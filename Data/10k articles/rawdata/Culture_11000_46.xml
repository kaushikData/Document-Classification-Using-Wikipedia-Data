[[File:Vindication1b.jpg|200px|right|thumb|alt=Page reads "A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN: WITH STRICTURES ON POLITICAL AND MORAL SUBJECTS. BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII."|Title page from the first American edition of ''Rights of Woman'']]

'''''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects''''' (1792), written by the 18th-century British [[proto-feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of [[feminist philosophy]]. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be "companions" to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.

Wollstonecraft was prompted to write the ''Rights of Woman'' after reading [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]]'s 1791 report to the French [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the ''Rights of Woman'' hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her. Although it is commonly assumed now that the ''Rights of Woman'' was unfavourably received, this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of [[William Godwin]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798). The ''Rights of Woman'' was actually well received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it "perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft's] century".&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[File:Talleyrand 01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of a man, showing his head and shoulders. He is wearing a black jacket with a high-necked collar and a white shirt tied in a bow. His head is adorned by a curly blonde wig.|[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]]]]
''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' was written against the tumultuous background of the [[French Revolution]] and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the ''[[Revolution controversy]]'', British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'', a response to [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790).&lt;ref name=MS1112&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Reflections'', Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In ''Reflections'' he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'', published just six weeks after Burke's ''Reflections'', is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] presented his ''Rapport sur l'instruction publique'' (1791) to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in France, Wollstonecraft was galvanized to respond.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 107; Sapiro, 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In his recommendations for a national system of education, Talleyrand had written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.&lt;ref&gt;Talleyrand, "Rapport sur l'instruction publique", reprinted in ''Vindications'', 394–95.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Olympe de Gouges.png|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a woman, showing her head, with a grey wig. Two large curls are sitting at the nape of her neck. Her shoulders are covered with a filmy, cream-coloured shawl.|[[Olympe de Gouges]]]]
Wollstonecraft dedicated the ''Rights of Woman'' to Talleyrand: "Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national education."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 101.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1791, French feminist [[Olympe de Gouges]] had published her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'', and the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain.&lt;ref name=MS1112/&gt;

The ''Rights of Woman'' is an extension of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the ''Rights of Men''. In the ''Rights of Men'', as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the ''Rights of Woman'', she is concerned with the rights afforded to "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the ''Rights of Woman'' addresses the issue of [[natural rights]] and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 105–6; Kelly, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rights of Woman'' thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by [[Political philosophy|political philosophers]] such as [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 182–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes of writings==
Wollstonecraft did not employ the formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century philosophical writing when composing her own works. The ''Rights of Woman'' is a long essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of [[sensibility]].&lt;ref name=K110&gt;Kelly, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, ''sensibility'' was a physical phenomenon that came to be attached to a specific set of moral beliefs. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men.&lt;ref name=BB9&gt;Barker-Benfield, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathise with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the [[abolitionism|movement to abolish the slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker-Benfield, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; But sensibility also paralysed those who had too much of it; as scholar G. J. Barker-Benfield explains, "an innate refinement of nerves was also identifiable with greater suffering, with weakness, and a susceptibility to disorder".&lt;ref name=BB9/&gt;

By the time Wollstonecraft was writing the ''Rights of Woman'', sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Sensibility'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as "profoundly separatist"; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Sensibility'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as [[Janet Todd]], another scholar of sensibility, argues, "to many in Britain the cult of sensibility seemed to have feminized the nation, given women undue prominence, and emasculated men."&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Sensibility'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rational education===
One of Wollstonecraft's central arguments in the ''Rights of Woman'' is that women should be educated in a rational manner to give them the opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and [[conduct book]] writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books,&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, Jennie. "[http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=216 Conduct Book]." ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 14 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as [[Catharine Macaulay]] and [[Hester Chapone]], maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' (1787), in her children's book, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), as well as in the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 169ff; Kelly, 123; Taylor, 14–15; Sapiro, 27–28; 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stating in her preface that "my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all", Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102; Sapiro, 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt; She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and "a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [consider] females rather as women than human creatures".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as "spaniels" and "toys"&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 124–26; Taylor, 234–37; Sapiro, 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women might not be able to attain the same degree of knowledge that men do.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|edition=3|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft attacks conduct book writers such as [[James Fordyce]] and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]] as well as educational philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 126; Taylor, 14–15; Sapiro, 130–31.&lt;/ref&gt;) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, "taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison",&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 157.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational "companions" of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: "women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to [[wikt:allot|allot]] to them&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. they might, also, study politics&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 286; see also Kelly, 125–24; Taylor, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Wollstonecraft, "the most perfect education" is "an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her broad philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft lays out a specific plan for national education to counter [[Talleyrand]]'s. In Chapter 12, "On National Education," she proposes that children be sent to [[day school]]s as well as given some education at home "to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures," and that such schools be free for children "five to nine years of age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/wollstonecraft_on_national_education.htm |title=Mary Wollstonecraft – on national education |publisher=Infed.org |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also maintains that schooling should be [[coeducation|co-educational]], contending that men and women, whose marriages are "the cement of society," should be "educated after the same model."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', Chapter 12; see also, Kelly, 124–25; 133–34; Sapiro, 237ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism writings===
[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 049.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Three women sitting around a small table, one sewing, one sitting in front of a small cup. All three are drawn to look almost horrific. The third woman looks as if she has two heads, but it may be that there are four women. The women's heads do not look as if they are comfortable on their bodies. The palette of the picture is dark red, black, brown, and almond.|''The Debutante'' (1807) by [[Henry Fuseli]]; "Woman, the victim of male social conventions, is tied to the wall, made to sew and guarded by governesses. The picture reflects Mary Wollstonecraft's views in ''The Rights of Women'' {{sic}}".&lt;ref&gt;Tomory, Peter. ''The Life and Art of Henry Fuseli.'' New York: Praeger Publishers, 1972; p. 217. {{LCCN|72077546}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It is debatable to what extent the ''Rights of Woman'' is a [[feminist]] text; because the definitions of ''feminist'' vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. Wollstonecraft would never have referred to her text as feminist because the words ''feminist'' and ''feminism'' were not coined until the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist'' and ''feminism''. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Retrieved 17 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there was no [[feminist movement]] to speak of during Wollstonecraft's lifetime. In the introduction to her seminal work on Wollstonecraft's thought, [[Barbara Taylor]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Describing [Wollstonecraft's philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Treating Wollstonecraft's thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft's political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women's emancipation. Wollstonecraft's leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 12; see also, 55–57; see also Sapiro, 257–59.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft does not make the claim for gender equality using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 126, 146; Taylor, 105–106; 118–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102 and 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and respect the sanctity of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.

However, Wollstonecraft's arguments for equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 110; Sapiro, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let it not be concluded, that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the ''Rights of Woman''. Because women are uneducated, they cannot alter their own situation—men must come to their aid.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 79; Kelly, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft writes at the end of her chapter "Of the Pernicious Effects Which Arise from the Unnatural Distinctions Established in Society":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I then would [[wikt:fain|fain]] convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.&amp;nbsp;– I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers&amp;nbsp;– in a word, better citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 288.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is Wollstonecraft's last novel, ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'' (1798), the fictionalized sequel to the ''Rights of Woman'', that is usually considered her most radical feminist work.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chapter 9; Sapiro, 37; 149; 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensibility===
One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the ''Rights of Woman'' is against false and excessive [[sensibility]], particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling"; because these women are "the prey of their senses", they cannot think rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization – these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important 18th-century philosopher [[David Hume]], the passions underpin all reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' (1788) and ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]''.

As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 259–60; Taylor, 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" is a "''[[leitmotif]]''" of the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, "Wild Nights", 35.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to "calmly let passion subside into friendship" in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be better, she writes, when "two virtuous young people marry . . . if some circumstances checked their passion".&lt;ref name=W192&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wollstonecraft, "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom".&lt;ref name=W192/&gt; As Mary Poovey explains, "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body."&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''Rights of Woman'' eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it  "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" while at the same time "exaggerat[ing] the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, "Wild Nights", 41.&lt;/ref&gt; But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [was] fatally linked [during the eighteenth century] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, "Wild Nights", 33; see also Taylor, 118–19; Taylor, 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicanism===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men with guns being led by a half-naked woman who is holding the French flag. She and they are walking over dead bodies. The painting is structured like a triangle, with the woman at the apex. The dead are lying at the base of the triangle.|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1833)]]
[[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]], a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the ''Rights of Woman'' "a republican manifesto".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the [[Commonwealth men|Commonwealth]] tradition of the 17th century and attempting to reestablish a [[republicanism|republican]] ethos. In Wollstonecraft's version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 29; see also Taylor, 211–22; Sapiro, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft "denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men|Rights of Men]]'' and the ''Rights of Woman'', of the "masculinization of sensitivity" in such works as [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Rights of Woman'' Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also briefly suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her "political criticism," as Chris Jones, a Wollstonecraft scholar, explains, "is couched predominantly in terms of morality".&lt;ref name=J43&gt;Jones, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual's happiness rather than, for example, the good of the entire society.&lt;ref name=J43/&gt; This is reflected in her explanation of [[natural rights]]. Because rights ultimately proceed from God, Wollstonecraft maintains that there are duties, tied to those rights, incumbent upon each and every person. For Wollstonecraft, the individual is taught republicanism and benevolence within the family; domestic relations and familial ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 46; Taylor, 211–22; ''Vindications'', 101–102, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class===
In many ways the ''Rights of Woman'' is inflected by a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] view of the world, as is its direct predecessor the ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men|Rights of Men]]''. Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the "most natural state". She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, were associated with the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 128ff; Taylor, 167–68; Sapiro, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the "false-refinement, immorality, and vanity" of the rich, calling them "weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [who] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 111; see also Taylor, 159–61; Sapiro, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Wollstonecraft's criticisms of the wealthy do not necessarily reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor. For her, the poor are fortunate because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: "Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!"&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, she contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she "sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 45; see also Taylor, 218–19; Sapiro, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her national plan for education, she retains class distinctions (with an exception for the intelligent), suggesting that: "After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual . . . The young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be taught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the elements of science, and continue the study of history and politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite literature."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 311; Kelly, 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric and style==
[[File:EmileTitle.jpeg|right|thumb|alt=Page reads "Émile, ou de L'Education. Par J. J. Rousseau, Citoyen de Genève....Tome Premier. A La Haye, Chez jean Neaulme, Libraire. M.DCC.LXII...."|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau's]] ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762)]]
In attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]'', constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref name=K109&gt;Kelly, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; She uses the language of philosophy, referring to her work as a "treatise" with "arguments" and "principles".&lt;ref name=K109/&gt; However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing "I" and "you", dashes and exclamation marks, and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text.&lt;ref name=K110/&gt; The ''Rights of Woman'' further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, while at the same time claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 113–14; Taylor, 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive [[sensibility]], the rhetoric of the ''Rights of Woman'' is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. For example, after excerpting a long passage from ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 162.&lt;/ref&gt; A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes "I must relieve myself by drawing another picture."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 163.&lt;/ref&gt; These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience,&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt; she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 109ff; Sapiro, 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.

In her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 118ff; Sapiro, 222.&lt;/ref&gt; She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to "capricious tyrants" who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides of the same coin.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 158; Sapiro, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance and obedience. And like the rich, women's "softness" has "debased mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 165; Taylor, 159–61; Sapiro, 124–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision==
Wollstonecraft was forced to write the ''Rights of Woman'' hurriedly to respond to [[Talleyrand]] and ongoing events. Upon completing the work, she wrote to her friend [[William Roscoe]]: "I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject.&amp;nbsp;– Do not suspect me of false modesty&amp;nbsp;– I mean to say that had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in every sense of the word&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. ''The Collected Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft''. Ed. Janet Todd. New York: Penguin Books (2003), 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt; When Wollstonecraft revised the ''Rights of Woman'' for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction", 23 and Mellor, 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt; She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft never wrote the second part to the ''Rights of Woman,'' although [[William Godwin]] published her "Hints", which were "chiefly designed to have been incorporated in the second part of the ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman''", in the posthumous collection of her works.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she did begin writing the novel ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'', which most scholars consider a fictionalized sequel to the ''Rights of Woman''. It was unfinished at her death and also included in the ''Posthumous Works'' published by Godwin.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
{{Feminist philosophy sidebar}}
When it was first published in 1792, the ''Rights of Woman'' was reviewed favourably by the ''[[Analytical Review]]'', the ''General Magazine'', the ''Literary Magazine'', ''New York Magazine'', and the ''Monthly Review'', although the assumption persists even today that ''Rights of Woman'' received hostile reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Janes, 293; Sapiro, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that "it was an immediate success".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 25; see also, Janes, 293–302; Wardle, 157–58; Kelly, 135–36; Sapiro 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, other writers such as [[Mary Hays]] and [[Mary Robinson (poet)|Mary Robinson]] specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft's text in their own works. Hays cited the ''Rights of Woman'' in her novel ''[[Memoirs of Emma Courtney]]'' (1796) and modelled her female characters after Wollstonecraft's ideal woman.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 143–44 and 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although female conservatives such as [[Hannah More]] excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on "Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work".&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft's work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The work also provoked outright hostility. The [[bluestocking]] [[Elizabeth Carter]] was unimpressed with the work.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 154"&gt;Gordon, 154&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]], the [[Neoplatonist]] translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'': if women have rights, why not [[animal rights|animals too]]?&lt;ref name="Gordon, 154"/&gt;

After Wollstonecraft died in 1797, her husband [[William Godwin]] published his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798). He revealed much about her private life that had previously not been known to the public: her illegitimate child, her love affairs, and her attempts at suicide. While Godwin believed he was portraying his wife with love, sincerity, and compassion, contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft's unorthodox lifestyle and she became a reviled figure. [[Richard Polwhele]] targeted her in particular in his anonymous long poem ''[[The Unsex'd Females]]'' (1798), a defensive reaction to women's literary self-assertion: Hannah More is Christ to Wollstonecraft's Satan. His poem was "well known" among the responses ''A Vindication''.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Craciun, ''Mary Wollstonecraft's a'' Vindication of the Rights of Woman'': A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2002, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer comments this "ingenious poem" with its "playful sallies of sarcastic wit" against "our modern ladies,"&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffiths, ''The Monthly Review'' 30 (1799): 103.&lt;/ref&gt; though others found it "a tedious, lifeless piece of writing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PolUnse.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=front Introduction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209180906/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PolUnse.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=front |date= 9 February 2011 }}, ''The Unsex'd Females'', Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical responses largely fell along clear-cut political lines.

Wollstonecraft's ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Robins Pennell|Pennell, Elizabeth Robins]] p351, ''Life of Mary Wollstonecraft''. (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1884).&lt;/ref&gt; and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her ''Rights of Woman'', for example, did not include her in the collection of ''Illustrious and Celebrated Women'' she published in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 145; Taylor, 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Edgeworth]] specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel ''[[Belinda (Edgeworth novel)|Belinda]]'' (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 155; Taylor, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; But, like [[Jane Austen]], she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative views towards Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century. The ''Rights of Woman'' was not reprinted until the middle of the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. [[George Eliot]] wrote "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the ''Rights of Woman'' as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sapiro, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[suffragist]] (i.e. moderate reformer, as opposed to [[suffragette]]) [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of the ''Rights of Woman'', cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 521&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Rights of Woman'' may have paved the way for feminist arguments, 20th century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft's life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan,"Mary Wollstonecraft's reception and legacies".&lt;/ref&gt; her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new "experiments in living", as [[Virginia Woolf]] termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. "[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c2/chapter13.html The Four Figures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403154849/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c2/chapter13.html |date=3 April 2007 }}". Retrieved 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some evidence that the ''Rights of Woman'' may be influencing current feminists. [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a feminist who is critical of [[Women and Islam|Islam's dictates regarding women]], cites the ''Rights of Woman'' in her autobiography ''[[Infidel (book)|Infidel]]'', writing that she was "inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ayaan Hirsi Ali|Hirsi Ali, Ayaan]]. ''Infidel''. New York: Free Press (2007), 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:afghan blanket.jpg|thumb|An afghan blanket]]
[[File:120116-N-IA840-053 (6851529435).jpg|alt=Afghans being made for charity by a crochet club.|thumb|Afghans being made for charity by US military members at a crochet club.]]

An '''afghan''' is a woollen blanket or shawl, usually knitted or crocheted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Afghan|title=Afghan - Definition of Afghan in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes also called a "throw" of indeterminate size. Afghans are often used as bedspreads, or as a decoration on the back of couches or chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-afghan.htm|title=What is an Afghan? (with pictures)|website=Wisegeek.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''afghan'' refers to the people of Central Asia. The use of ''afghan'' in the English language goes back to 1831, when Thomas Carlyle mentioned it in his ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Sartor Resartus", Fraser's Mag. VIII 670/1 Afghaun shawls, Thomas Carlyle, 1833&lt;/ref&gt;  The first mention of the word referring to the woven rug was in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;"Life and Letters of Elizabeth Prentiss", pp. 260, Letter: 13 Dec., 1868. Elizabeth Prentiss, George Lewis Prentiss, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and styles==
There are many styles of afghans:

* Single-piece afghans are the simplest style to make and are especially popular with beginners. 

* ''Mile-a-minute'' afghans are usually made in a number of separate strips, with a minimum of stitches per strip, and then the strips are joined together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410042215/http://www.coatsandclark.com/Crafts/Crochet/Projects/AfghansThrows/SB300-001+Mile+a+Minute.htm|title=SB300-001 Mile a Minute|date=2012-04-10|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Join-as-you-go'' afghans are made up of many different pieces, one of which begins where the last leaves off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2016/01/join-as-you-go-crochet/|title=Join As You Go Crochet Tutorial on Craftsy|date=2016-01-31|work=The Craftsy Blog|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Motif'' afghans are composed of many small [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, squares, or blocks, such as a [[granny square]]. These motifs may be all of the same design or of different designs. However, to make it easier to join the motifs into an afghan, the blocks are typically the same size. Some favor the motif style because of its portability and versatility of design. The motif style is still a very popular and a complex design for making blankets, scarves, etc. Although not a requirement, an edge or border is most often added to nicely finish off the blanket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/crafts/crocheting/projects/how-to-crochet-a-motif-afghan/|title=How to Crochet a Motif Afghan - dummies|website=Dummies.com|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''graphghan'' is an afghan made by following a flat chart. This method uses a grid of colored squares to create a visual design. There are three main methods to making a graphghan: pixel crochet, corner-to-corner crochet, and tapestry crochet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.craftsy.com/crocheting/article/graphghan/ Senior], Kathryn. "What Is a Graphghan &amp; How Do You Crochet One?" The Craftsy Blog. N.p., 01 Dec. 2017. Web. 16 Apr. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthropological Survey of India''' ('''AnSI''') is the apex [[India]]n government organisation involved in [[anthropological]] studies and field data research for human and cultural aspects, working primarily in the fields of [[physical anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/12/8i/6T/8I6T0G01.htm Anthropological Survey of India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625023925/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/12/8i/6T/8I6T0G01.htm |date=25 June 2010 }} Department of Education. [[Govt. of India]].&lt;/ref&gt; While maintaining a strong focus on [[Tribes of India|indigenous]] populations, it also attempts to document the cultures of other communities and religious groups.

==History==
Anthropological Research in India was founded 1945 in [[Varanasi]] and shifted to the [[Indian Museum]] at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthsi.com/ Anthropological Survey of India history at anthsi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the Zoological and Anthropological sections of the Museum together became a new entity the [[Zoological Survey of India]]. Later, in 1945, the Anthropology section formed into an independent body, the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI),&lt;ref name=an&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/app-k/textk.htm Anthropological Survey of India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525004432/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/app-k/textk.htm |date=2006-05-25 }} (The Andamanese by George Weber).&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Biraja Sankar Guha]] as the initial director and [[Verrier Elwin]],  Deputy Director.

The '''''Apse of Santa María d'Àneu''''' is a romanesque [[apse]] of the church of [[Santa Maria, Àneu]], the transferred [[fresco]]s from which are now exhibited at [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]], in [[Barcelona]].
The decoration of the apse of the church of Santa María d’Àneu combines themes and motifs from the Old and [[New Testament]]s. Originally painted at the Church of Santa María d’Àneu (La Guingueta d’Àneu, [[Lleida]])&lt;ref name="MNAC"&gt;[http://www.spainisculture.com/en/obras_de_excelencia/museo_nacional_de_arte_de_cataluna_mnac/abside_santa_maria_aneu.html Comment on Apse of Santa María d'Àneu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The church of Santa María d'Àneu is located in the upper valley of the Noguera Pallaresa, [[Pyrenees]] mountain region. The building once belonged to a Benedictine Monastery, it is divided into a [[nave]] and aisles by six pairs of piers, taking the shape of a cross. The east end concludes in three semicircular apses, the central apse was decorated with frescoes.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;Kuhn, Ch. L., Romanesque Mural Painting of Catalonia, Cambridge, 1930, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Maria in Àneu was the most important church in the Àneu Valley and belonged to the cathedral chapter of Urgell. From the stylistic circle of Pedret, of Lombardic influence, the decoration of the apse reveals the existence of an elaborate iconographic and theological programme setting off the prophetic hopes of the Old Testament—that is, hope in the coming of a Messiah who was to redeem humanity—against fulfillment of the prophecies—that is, the coming of the Messiah announced by the prophets.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;Post, Ch.R., A History of Spanish Painting, Cambridge, 1930, I, p. 136-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya dates the original work at the end of 11th century – beginning of 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=98d7f9bb3c2477d50327e48363fbd12d787959e035446012bc8afbd858e64243?inventoryNumber=015874-000 Technical Aspects from MNAC Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is speculation that the paintings were completed at the beginning of the 13th century at the time when Romanesque styles were breaking down and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Art was coming of age.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;

== Description ==
The iconography of the painting is suggestive of the Old Testament through the presence of the prophets in reverential attitudes. In the vault portion of the apse, the Epiphany or Adoration of the Magi is represented, with Mary, Jesus, and the three eastern kings baring gifts.  Wheels of fire from Jehovah’s chariot are depicted in the lower register, conforming to Ezekiel’s vision.&lt;ref name="Esteller"&gt;Esteller, E.,MNAC Romanesque Art Guide, Barcelona, 1998, p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  To the right and left are the [[archangels]] Michael and Gabriel holding banners and scrolls with the inscription PETICIVS and POSTVLATIVS.  Bordering the central window of the lower zones are two six-winged [[seraphim]], in their hands they hold live coals with tongs which they place in the mouths of two crouching figures. In the left lower zone, there are two tonsured (meaning scalp has been shaved) figures who might be Saints Benedict and Bernard or one of them might be a portrait of a local deacon on account of the realism in the face of the figure.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;  The theory that these figures are patrons of the church is strengthened by the discovery of similar figures in related frescoes at the monastery of Saint Peter of [[Berga]].  The third archangel, [[Raphael]], does not appear with the others in the semidome but in the lower section.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

At the bottom is the announcement, the biblical prophecy, represented by means of combined images of the visions of Isaiah and Ezequiel. In keeping with the first, two magnificent seraphim with three pairs of wings each purify the mouth of the
prophets with glowing embers which they are holding with tongs. Next to them are the prophets, represented with their hands together in an attitude of reverence.

At the same time, the seraphim intone the Trisagion, or song of praise to the Lord, represented by the letters SCS, SCS, SCS, which mean ‘holy, holy, holy’. From this moment, the word of the prophets will be the word of God. Beneath the central
window are the wheels of fire of Yahweh’s chariot, described in Ezequiel’s vision, which symbolise the presence of the Lord. On the vault was the Virgin and Child, representing the accomplishment of the prophecies, in the scene from Epiphany,
with two archangels, Michael and Gabriel, patrons of sinners, in a representation very similar to that in the apse from Santa Maria in Cap d'Aran (The Cloisters, New York). A third archangel, Raphael, is represented on the right of the semicylinder,
perhaps as the introducer of the two donor clergymen who appear on the left of the apse.

== Composition ==
The frescoes are attributed to the [[Circle of the Master of Pedret]].  The Master of Pedret was the first significant painter of the Catalon Romanesque period and is named for the wall paintings at the church of [[Southern apse from Pedret|San Quirze de Pedret]] in Berga.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art (1993).  The Art of Medieval Spain (AD 500-1200), New York. Distributed by Harry N Abrams, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The Apse at Aneu represents the end of a tradition, during this time the painter might have felt himself at liberty to relax old rules and abandon strict division into zones, therefore filling the bottom section not with lines of Apostles, but with less rigid elements of the prophetic vision.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
The Àneu frescos make a complete break with the normal Catalan artistic scheme.  The lower zone is unique and unrelated to the upper portion of the apse.  The Byzantine influence appears to be strong in the style of the frescos, the seraphim have been noted to resemble those in the crypt at the cathedral of [[Anagni]], near Rome.  In addition there are touches of pure [[Realism (arts)|realism]], this is seen in the details such as the unshaven face of the figure at the left of the lower register and the thin and deeply wrinkled face of [[Magus]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;  The painting could represent direct borrowings from Byzantium or importations from Byzantine Art via [[Lombardy]], Italy.  This influence is shown in the costume of the Wise Men (or Maji) which is representative of the eastern court.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt; Other features linking the artwork to Italy are the decorative border, simulated drapery (they have waves and circular medallions), and the geometrical border is similar to the one in the Roman church of San Carlo in [[Prugiasco]] (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="Esteller" /&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  The [[Lutheran]] churches, as they developed, accepted a limited role for larger works of art in churches,&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; and also encouraged prints and book illustrations.  [[Calvinist]]s remained steadfastly opposed to art in churches, and suspicious of small printed images of religious subjects, though generally fully accepting secular images in their homes. 

In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

==Art and the Reformation==

The [[Protestant Reformation]] was a religious movement that occurred in Western Europe during the 16th century that resulted in a divide in Christianity between Roman Catholics and Protestants. This movement "created a North-South split in Europe, where generally Northern countries became Protestant, while Southern countries remained Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;''The Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Historicist and ''Causes of the Reformation.'' New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformation produced two main branches of [[Protestantism]]; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith.&lt;ref name="Picken2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Picken|first=Stuart D.B.|title=Historical Dictionary of Calvinism|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810872240|page=1|quote=While Germany and the Scandinavian countries adopted the Lutheran model of church and state, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Hungary, what is now the Czech Republic, and Scotland created Reformed Churches based, in varying ways, on the model Calvin set up in Geneva. Although England pursued the Reformation ideal in its own way, leading to the formation of the Anglican Communion, the theology of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England were heavily influenced by Calvinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a restricted range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The use of images was one of the issues where Luther strongly opposed the more radical [[Andreas Karlstadt]].  For a few years Lutheran altarpieces like [[Last Supper (Cranach)|the ''Last Supper'' by the younger Cranach]] were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional [[depiction of Jesus]]. As such, "Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior."&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781351921169|page=237|quote=As it developed in north-eastern Germany, Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior.

On the other hand there was a wave of [[Iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|iconoclasm]], or the destruction of religious imagery.  This began very early in the Reformation, when students in [[Erfurt]] destroyed a wooden altar in the [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] in December 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 19, note 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Reformed Christianity showed consistent hostility to religious images, as [[idolatry]], especially [[sculpture]] and large paintings.  Book illustrations and prints were more acceptable, because they were smaller and more private.   Reformed leaders, especially [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], actively eliminated imagery from churches within the control of their followers, and regarded the great majority of religious images as idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/html/institutes/index.html Institutes, 1:11, section 7 on crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction was often extremely divisive and traumatic within communities, an unmistakable physical manifestation, often imposed from above, that could not be ignored.  It was just for this reason that reformers favoured a single dramatic ''coup'', and many premature acts in this line sharply increased subsequent hostility between Catholics and Calvinists in communities{{snd}} for it was generally at the level of the city, town or village that such actions occurred, except in England and Scotland.  

But reformers often felt impelled by strong personal convictions, as shown by the case of Frau Göldli, on which Zwingli was asked to advise.  She was a Swiss lady who had once made a promise to [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]] that if she recovered from an illness she would donate an image of the saint to a local convent, which she did. Later she turned Protestant, and feeling she must reverse what she now saw as a wrong action, she went to the convent church, removed the statue and burnt it. Prosecuted for [[blasphemy]], she paid a small fine without complaint, but flatly refused to pay the additional sum the court ordered be paid to the convent to replace the statue, putting her at risk of serious penalties.  Zwingli's letter advised trying to pay the nuns a larger sum on condition they did not replace the statue, but the eventual outcome is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of his life, after iconoclastic shows of force became a feature of the early phases of the [[French Wars of Religion]], even Calvin became alarmed and criticised them, realizing that they had become counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:St. Michaelis Oberkleen Blick nach Westen 02.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Daniel Hisgen]]'s paintings are mostly cycles on the parapets of Lutheran church galleries.  Here the Creation (left) to the [[Annunciation]] can be seen.]]

Subjects prominent in Catholic art other than Jesus and events in the [[Christian Bible|Bible]], such as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints were given much less emphasis or disapproved of in Protestant theology.  As a result, in much of northern Europe, the Church virtually ceased to commission figurative art, placing the dictation of content entirely in the hands of the artists and lay consumers.  Calvinism even objected to non-religious [[funerary art]], such as the [[heraldry]] and effigies beloved of the Renaissance rich.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Where there was religious art, iconic images of [[Christ]] and scenes from the Passion became less frequent, as did portrayals of the saints and clergy.  Narrative scenes from the Bible, especially as book illustrations and prints, and, later, moralistic depictions of modern life were preferred. Both Cranachs painted allegorical scenes setting out Lutheran doctrines, in particular a series on ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]''.  [[Daniel Hisgen]], a German [[Rococo]] painter of the 18th century in [[Upper Hesse]], specialized in cycles of biblical paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in Lutheran churches with an upper gallery, a less prominent position that satisfied Lutheran scruples.  Wooden organ cases were also often painted with similar scenes to those in Catholic churches.

Lutherans strongly defended their existing sacred art from a new wave of Calvinist-on-Lutheran iconoclasm in the second half of the century, as Calvinist rulers or city authorities attempted to impose their will on Lutheran populations in the "[[Second Reformation]]" of about 1560-1619.&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somehwat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 84. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQjGmEUtbPMC&amp;pg=PA84 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Against the Reformed, Lutherans exclaimed: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The [[Beeldenstorm]], a large and very disorderly wave of Calvinist mob destruction of Catholic images and church fittings that spread through the [[Low Countries]] in the summer of 1566 was the largest outbreak of this sort, with drastic political repercussions.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign of Calvinist iconoclasm "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns to the German actions, but with the addition of encouragement and sometimes finance from the national government, were seen in Anglican England in the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Commonwealth]] in the next century, when more damage was done to art in medieval parish churches than during the [[English Reformation]].

A major theological difference between Protestantism and [[Catholicism]] is the question of [[transubstantiation]], or the literal transformation of the Communion wafer and wine into the body and blood of Christ, though both Lutheran and Reformed Christians affirmed the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], the former as a [[sacramental union]] and the latter as a [[pneumatic presence]].&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A. G.|title=Changing Churches: An Orthodox, Catholic, and Lutheran Theological Conversation|date=27 February 2012|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English |isbn=9780802866943|page=54|quote=In this "sacramental union," Lutherans taught, the body and blood of Christ are so truly united to the bread and wine of the Holy Communion that the two may be identified. They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin. Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and mantained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protestant churches that were not participating in the iconoclasm often selected as altarpieces scenes depicting the Last Supper.  This helped the worshippers to recall their theology behind the [[Eucharist]], as opposed to Catholic churches, which often chose crucifixion scenes for their altarpieces to remind the worshippers that the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass were one and the same, via the literal transformation of the Eucharist.

The Protestant Reformation also capitalized on the popularity of [[printmaking]] in northern Europe. Printmaking allowed images to be mass-produced and widely available to the public at low cost. This allowed for the widespread availability of visually persuasive imagery. The Protestant church was therefore able, as the Catholic Church had been doing since the early 15th century, to bring their theology to the people, and religious education was brought from the church into the homes of the common people, thereby forming a direct link between the worshippers and the divine.

There was also a violent propaganda war fought partly with [[popular prints]] by both sides; these were often highly scurrilous caricatures of the other side and their doctrines.  On the Protestant side, portraits of the leading reformers were popular, and their likenesses sometimes represented the Apostles and other figures in Biblical scenes such as the [[Last Supper]].

== Genre and landscape ==

After the early years of the reformation, artists in Protestant areas painted far fewer religious subjects for public display, although there was a conscious effort to develop a Protestant [[iconography]] of Bible illustration in book illustrations and [[old master print|prints]].  In the early Reformation artists, especially [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Younger]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], made paintings for churches showing the leaders of the reformation in ways very similar to Catholic saints.  Later Protestant taste turned from the display in churches of religious scenes, although some continued to be displayed in homes.  There was also a reaction against large images from classical mythology, the other manifestation of high style at the time.  This brought about a style that was more directly related to accurately portraying the present times. The traditions of landscapes and genre paintings that would fully flower in the 17th century began during this period.

[[Peter Bruegel]] (1525–1569) of Flanders is the great genre painter of his time, who worked for both Catholic and Protestant patrons.  In most of his paintings, even when depicting religious scenes, most space is given to landscape or peasant life in 16th century Flanders.  Bruegel’s ''Wedding Feast'', portrays a Flemish-peasant wedding dinner in a barn, which makes no reference to any religious, historical or classical events, and merely gives insight into the everyday life of the Flemish peasant. Another great painter of his age, [[Lucas van Leyden]] (1489–1533), is known mostly for his [[engraving]]s, such as ''The Milkmaid'', which depicts peasants with milk cows.  This engraving, from 1510, well before the Reformation,  contains no reference to religion or [[classicism]], although much of his other work features both.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter Bruegel]]'s ''Peasant Wedding Feast''.]]
Bruegel was also an accomplished landscape painter. Frequently Bruegel painted agricultural landscapes, such as ''Summer'' from his famous set of the seasons, where he shows peasants harvesting wheat in the country, with a few workers taking a lunch break under a nearby tree. This type of landscape painting, apparently void of religious or classical connotations, gave birth to a long line of northern European landscape artists, such as [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].

With the great development of the engraving and printmaking market in [[Antwerp]] in the 16th century, the public was provided with accessible and affordable images. Many artists provided drawings to book and print publishers, including Bruegel. In 1555 Bruegel began working for ''The Four Winds'', a publishing house owned by [[Hieronymus Cock]]. ''The Four Winds'' provided the public with almost a thousand [[etching]]s and engravings over two decades. Between 1555 and 1563 Bruegel supplied Cock with almost 40 drawings, which were engraved for the Flemish public.

The courtly style of [[Northern Mannerism]] in the second half of the century has been seen as partly motivated by the desire of rulers in both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and France to find a style of art that could appeal to members of the courtly elite on both sides of the religious divide.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 98-101 on Rudolf, and Strong, Pt. 2, Chapter 3 on France, especially pp. 98-101, 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus religious controversy had the rather ironic effect of encouraging [[classical mythology]] in art, since though they might disapprove, even the most stern Calvinists could not credibly claim that 16th century mythological art really represented idolatry.

==Council of Trent==
[[File:Last Judgement (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]] fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]] (1534-41) came under persistent attack in the [[Counter-Reformation]] for, among other things, nudity (later painted over for several centuries), not showing Christ seated or bearded, and including the pagan figure of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]].]]

During the Reformation a great divergence arose between the [[Catholic Church]] and the Protestant Reformers of the north regarding the content and style of art work. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and Reformed iconoclasm as a threat to the church and in response came together at the [[Council of Trent]] to institute some of their own reforms. The church felt that much religious art in Catholic countries (especially Italy) had lost its focus on religious subject-matter, and became too interested in material things and decorative qualities.  The council came together periodically between 1545 and 1563. The reforms that resulted from this council are what set the basis for what is known as the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Italian painting after the 1520s, with the notable exception of the art of [[Venice]], developed into [[Mannerism]], a highly sophisticated style, striving for effect, that concerned many churchman as lacking appeal for the mass of the population.  Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the  [[Council of Trent]] in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art.  Previous Catholic [[Church council]]s had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.

Statements are often made along the lines of "The [[decrees]] of the Council of Trent stipulated that art was to be direct and compelling in its narrative presentation, that it was to provide an accurate presentation of the biblical narrative or saint’s life, rather than adding incidental and imaginary moments, and that it was to encourage [[piety]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Art in Renaissance Italy.'' Paoletti, John T., and Gary M. Radke. Pg. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact the actual decrees of the council were far less explicit than this, though all of these points were probably in line with their intentions. The very short passage dealing with art came only in the final session in 1563, as a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft. The decree confirmed the traditional doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person themself, not the image, and further instructed that:&lt;blockquote&gt; ...every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God.

And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did "unbecomingly or confusedly arranged" Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian [[Molanus]], Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable.  Many traditional iconographies considered without adequate scriptural foundation were in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', chapter VIII, especially pp. 107-128, 1940 (refs to 1985 edn), [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the great medievalist [[Émile Mâle]], this was "the death of medieval art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielmitsui.tripod.com/aaaaa/deathart.html The death of Medieval Art]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Extract from book by [[Émile Mâle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art and the Counter-Reformation ==
[[File:Lamentation Scipione Pulzone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]]'', a typical Counter-Reformation work.]]

While Calvinists largely removed public art from religion and Reformed societies moved towards more "secular" forms of art which might be said to glorify God through the portrayal of the "natural beauty of His creation and by depicting people who were created in His image",&lt;ref&gt;''Art of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Nosotro, Rit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-Reformation]] Catholic church continued to encourage religious art, but insisted it was strictly religious in content,  glorifying God and Catholic traditions, including the [[sacraments]] and the [[saints]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of the Counter Reformation.'' [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Lamport"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442271593|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between Lutheran and Roman Catholic places of worship was the presence of the [[tabernacle]] in the latter.&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]], who invented the term ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'', cautions against connecting this more austere style in religious painting, which spread from Rome from about 1550, too directly with the decrees of Trent, as it pre-dates these by several years. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;(Sidney) Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s (1550–1598) painting of the [[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]] which was commissioned for the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1589 is a ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'' work that gives a clear demonstration of what the holy council was striving for in the new style of religious art. With the focus of the painting giving direct attention to the crucifixion of Christ, it complies with the religious content of the council and shows the story of the passion while keeping Christ in the image of the ideal human.

[[File:Paolo Veronese.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Last Supper ([[The Feast in the House of Levi]])'']]
Ten years after the Council of Trent's decree [[Paolo Veronese]] was summoned by the [[Inquisition]] to explain why his ''Last Supper'', a huge canvas for the [[refectory]] of a monastery, contained, in the words of the Inquisition: "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast.&lt;ref name="Transcript of Veronese's testimony"&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript of Veronese's testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;  Veronese was told that he must change his indecorous painting within a three-month period - in fact he just changed the title to ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'', still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said.&lt;ref name="David Rostand 1997"&gt;David Rostand, ''Painting in Sixteenth-Century Venice: Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto'', 2nd ed 1997, Cambridge UP {{ISBN|0-521-56568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt any Protestant authorities would have been equally disapproving.  The pre-existing decline in "[[donor portrait]]s" (those who had paid for an altarpiece or other painting being placed within the painting) was also accelerated; these become rare after the Council.

[[File:Las lagrimas de san Pedro El Greco 1580.jpg|thumb|240px|''Repentance of Peter'' by [[El Greco]], 1580–1586.]]
Further waves of "Counter-Reformation art" occurred when areas formerly Protestant were again brought under Catholic rule. The churches were normally empty of images, and such periods could represent a boom time for artists. The best known example is the new [[Spanish Netherlands]] (essentially modern [[Belgium]]), which had been the centre of Protestantism in the Netherlands but became (initially) exclusively Catholic after the Spanish drove the Protestants to the north, where they established the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  [[Rubens]] was one of a number of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque painters]] who received many commissions, and produced several of his best known works re-filling the empty churches.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  Several cities in France in the [[French wars of religion]] and in Germany, [[Bohemia]] and elsewhere in the [[Thirty Years War]] saw similar bursts of restocking.

The rather extreme pronouncement by a synod in [[Antwerp]] in 1610 that in future the central panels of altarpieces should only show New Testament scenes was certainly ignored in the cases of many paintings by [[Rubens]] and other Flemish artists (and in particular the [[Jesuits]] continued to commission altarpieces centred on their saints, but nonetheless New Testament subjects probably did increase.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  Altarpieces became larger and more easy to make out from a distance, and the large painted or gilded carved wooden altarpieces that were the pride of many northern late medieval cities were often replaced with paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subjects were given increased prominence to reflect Counter-Reformation emphases. The ''[[Repentance of Peter]]'', showing the end of the episode of the ''[[Denial of Peter]]'', was not often seen before the Counter-Reformation, when it became popular as an assertion of the [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] against Protestant attacks.  This  followed an influential book by the [[Jesuit]] Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] (1542–1621).   The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes "the [[rooster|cock]]" in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant [[Mary Magdalen]], another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 10 and 315&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Counter-Reformation grew stronger and the Catholic Church felt less threat from the Protestant Reformation, [[Rome]] once again began to assert its [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] to other nations around the world. The religious order of the [[Jesuits]] or the Society of Jesus, sent missionaries to the [[Americas]], parts of [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[eastern Asia]] and used the arts as an effective means of articulating their message of the Catholic Church's dominance over the Christian [[faith]]. The Jesuits' impact was so profound during their missions of the time that today very similar styles of art from the Counter-Reformation period in Catholic Churches are found all over the world.

Despite the differences in approaches to religious art, stylistic developments passed about as quickly across religious divisions as within the two "blocs".  Artistically Rome remained in closer touch with the Netherlands than with Spain.

The '''balady citron''' is a variety of [[citron]], or ''[[etrog]]'', grown in [[Israel]], mostly for Jewish ritual purposes. Not native to the region, it was imported around 500 or 300 BCE by either Jewish or Greek settlers. Initially not widely grown, it was promoted and popularized in the 1870s by Rabbi [[Chaim Elozor Wax]].

== Etymology ==
''[[wikt:بلدي|Balady]] ({{lang-ar|بلدي}})'' is [[Arabic]] for "native." Local Arab farmers began using this name in the mid-19th century to distinguish this variety from the [[Greek citron]], which was cultivated along the [[Jaffa]] seashore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf קונטרס פרי עץ הדר, ירושלים תרל"ח] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410122008/http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The balady citron is an [[acid]]ic variety, alongside the [[Florentine citron|Florentine]] and [[Diamante citron]] from [[Italy]], and the [[Greek citron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ajit_Kandale/publication/234002705_A_review_on_citron-pharmacognosy_phytochemistry_and_medicinal_uses/links/0fcfd50e133856e8df000000.pdf | title=A review on citron-pharmacognosy, phytochemistry and medicinal uses |author1=Meena, Ajay Kumar |author2=Kandale, Ajit |author3=Rao, M.

History of citrus fruits, Tolkowsky, Samuel, London, 1938 |quote=The fruits were cultivated in Palestine and exported to Jewish communities settled in Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1800s, the Balady was grown on the outskirts of [[Nablus]], [[Nazareth]], [[Tiberias]], [[Safed]] and [[Alma, Safad|Alma al-Shaib]], in [[Umm al-Fahm]] and in [[Lifta]] village near [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter by Rabbi [[Meir Auerbach]], printed at the end of the 4th chapter of first volume of the responsa Nefesh Chaya by Rabbi [[Chaim Elozor Wax]] שו"ת נפש חיה או"ח סי' ד סוה"ס&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the middle of the 19th-century that Balady citrons began to feature significantly in the European market and a religious Jewish controversy subsequently erupted as to whether the citrons had been grafted and therefore deemed disqualified for ritual use.&lt;ref&gt;Issac, (1958). "Palestinian citrons began to figure in the European market in the late 1850s. These etrogim, however, met considerable opposition from certain Orthodox communities on the grounds that they were grafted. To counteract this unfavorable propaganda, a group of Palestinian rabbis investigated the situation and published a volume to inform world Jewry in which areas grafting was practiced and which exporters could not be relied upon, thus by implication putting the seal of approval upon the rest. The rabbis denied that grafting was universal in Palestine."&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Yishuv haYashan}}
In the 1870s, Rabbi [[Chaim Elozor Wax]] devoted himself to its cultivation and organized shipments to [[Europe]]. He felt the Balady citron had the strongest traditional lineage of species pureness, and claimed it was to be found in the wild when [[Nahmanides]] (d. 1270) arrived in the county. He wrote many letters to the rabbis hoping  to influence the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] to use the Balady citron. These letters were published in his [[responsa]] ''Nefesh Haya'' and the responsa of his correspondents, as well as in pamphlets addressing the Greek citron controversy.&lt;ref&gt;תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרקים ח-י.
שו"ת ביכורי שלמה סי' לח&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his influence, many Jews began to purchase the Balady instead of the [[Greek citron]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרקים ח-י.&lt;/ref&gt; While the variety was not domesticated, it was used by important scholars and pious Jews who believed in its  purity and appropriateness.&lt;ref&gt;שו"ת נפש חיה או"ח סי' ב-ד
* תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרקים ח-י.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Wax also saw the trade in this citron as an important source of economic income for the [[Yishuv haYashan|Jewish community in Palestine]]. He invested large sums establishing orchards in [[Hittin]] donating the profits to charity.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; In 1875, Wax planted 600 trees and by 1883 over 40,000 citrons had been exported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kupathrabbimeir.org/t-OurHistory.aspx Our History], Kupath Rabbi Meir Baal Haness.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-[[Zionist]] newspapers ''HaMelitz'' and ''HaLevanon'' were instrumental in stirring up interest in etrog cultivation in Palestine, which was seen as important in paving the way for Jewish independence.&lt;ref&gt;יוסף שלמון, הפולמוס על אתרוגי קורפו ואתרוגי ארץ ישראל - 1875–1891, ציון - רבעון לחקר תולדות ישראל, שנה סה (תש"ס) עמוד 75 והלאה.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some years before,{{when|date=April 2016}} the Greek citron had already been [[Greek citron#Introduction to Israel|introduced for plantation]] by newly arrived [[Sephardic]] Jews with the financial backing of Sir [[Moses Montefiore]]. The new Greek-Jaffa variety was more commercially successful than Balady.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf קונטרס פרי עץ הדר, השותפים סלאנט, ירושלים תרל"ח] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410122008/http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}
* יוסף שלמון, הפולמוס על אתרוגי קורפו ואתרוגי ארץ ישראל - 1875–1891, ציון - רבעון לחקר תולדות ישראל, שנה סה (תש"ס) עמוד 75 והלאה.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all efforts, the Balady was still unable to compete with the Greek citron{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and at the beginning of that 20th-century its cultivation was very primitive and limited.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The Baldy was considered unattractive and some of the new immigrants continued using varieties they were accustomed to in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter by Rabbi Shneor Zalman of Lublin, in Igros Baal Torath Chesed Chapter 9, אגרות בעל תורת חסד סימן ט
* Responsa ''Imrei Binah'' by Rabbi [[Meir Auerbach]], chapter 11 of the last cycle of the first volume שו"ת אמרי בינה או"ח-יו"ד סוה"ס סי' יא&lt;/ref&gt;

The supporters of the Balady were strained in a conflict of interest. While the Greek citron grown in [[Jaffa]] showed a good economical future, the [[Halachic]] intentions were against it. As a partial solution, the Greek-Jaffa citron was occasionally grafted onto Balady [[rootstock]]. The progeny achieved the beautiful properties of the [[grafting|scion]] type, while the possible influence of lemon rootstock was assumed to be flushed, and replaced with that of the most kosher Balady rootstock&lt;ref&gt;Igros HoRaye 114&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, Rabbi Wax was forced to relent and commence [[topworking]] to part of his orchard, in order to replace part of the crop with the Greek citron.&lt;ref&gt;תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרק ח.
* אתרוגי ארץ ישראל, [[Zohar Amar|זהר עמר]], תשע"א, עמוד 16 והלאה.
* יוסף שלמון, הפולמוס על אתרוגי קורפו ואתרוגי ארץ ישראל - 1875–1891, ציון - רבעון לחקר תולדות ישראל, שנה סה (תש"ס) עמוד 75 והלאה.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rescue and selections ==

The [[Old Yishuv]] rabbis [[Shmuel Salant]] and [[Meir Auerbach]] supported the progeny of Umm el-Fahm, but those declined quickly. Later, some Israeli rabbis did their utmost for the rescue of Balady. Each collected propagation material from a different place and brought it into cultivation under close supervision. This is how a diversity of sub-varieties or selections with different names developed.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;אתרוגי ארץ ישראל, זהר עמר, תשע"א&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of [[rabbi]]s who were instrumental includes (arranged in order of date): Rabbi Zarach Reuven Braverman founder and dean of the [[Yeshiva]] [[Mea Shearim]]; Rabbi [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]];&lt;ref&gt;According to Professor [[Eliezer E. Goldschmidt]] (''Hilkhot Sadeh'', issue 146, Elul 5765, Page 24) the ''Kibilewitz-etrog'' was obtained in 1910 at the remote nature of [[Wadi Qelt]]. According to the Widow Kibilewitz and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kelli, it was obtained by Rabbi Sonnenfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; and students and close disciples of Rabbi [[Yehoshua Leib Diskin]], who are said to have been inspired to this ambition by their master.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

When the [[Chazon Ish]] reached the Holy Land, he made his own selection according to his satisfaction. To Yakov Halperin, founder of [[Zichron Meir]] in [[Bnei Brak]], he gave plantings of the variety called Halperin-Chazon Ish; and to Rabbi [[Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz]], the variety called Lefkowitz-Chazon Ish.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Pines, (September 2009). [http://halachicadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/The-Etrog-TREE-OF-THE-CHAZON-ISH.pdf "The Chazon Ish's Magic Esrog Tree"], ''[[Mishpacha]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] promoted the intraspecific graft from the [[Greek citron]] onto Balady citron rootstock, and granted his [[Hechsher]] for this, believing that it was a practical solution to grow beautiful etrogs that were also kosher. However, he still acknowledged the halachic promotion of those etrogs cultivated at different Arabic villages, that were never as nice but were praised for not being grafted.&lt;ref&gt;.אגרות הראי"ה, חלק א, סימן נב, עמוד סא&lt;/ref&gt;

Balady citron varieties are still grown and sold today in [[diaspora]] as well as in [[Israel]], and are favored by the followers of the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rov]] and the Chazon Ish.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:he:אתרוג|Etrog in Hebrew Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charu Nivedita''' (born 18 December 1953) is a [[Post-modernism|postmodern]], transgressive [[Tamil language|Tamil]] writer, based in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. 
There is an invisible ban on his writings in the Tamil literary milieu, whereas he is widely translated into Malayalam in nearby Kerala.

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Conflict resolution''' is conceptualized as the methods and processes involved in facilitating the peaceful ending of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[Retribution (disambiguation)|retribution]]. Committed  group members attempt to resolve group conflicts by actively communicating information about their conflicting motives or ideologies to the rest of the group (e.g., intentions; reasons for holding certain beliefs) and by engaging in collective [[negotiation]].&lt;ref name=F&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forsyth |first1=Donelson R. |date=19 March 2009 |title=Group Dynamics |edition=5th |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Wadsworth [[Cengage Learning]] |page= |isbn=978-0495599524 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions of resolution typically parallel the dimensions of conflict in the way the conflict is processed. Cognitive resolution is the way disputants understand and view the conflict, with beliefs, perspectives, understandings and attitudes. Emotional resolution is in the way disputants feel about a conflict, the emotional energy. Behavioral resolution is reflective of how the disputants act, their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Bernard |date=27 March 2012 |title=The Dynamics of Conflict: A Guide to Engagement and Intervention |edition=2nd |url= |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0470613535 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately a wide range of methods and procedures for addressing conflict exist, including [[negotiation]], [[mediation]], mediation-arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-conflict-resolution.htm|title=Conflict Resolution|last=Methods|first=Conflict Resolution|date=14 March 2016|work=14 March 2016|access-date=14 March 2016|via=wisegeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diplomacy]], and creative [[peacebuilding]].

The term ''conflict resolution'' may also be used interchangeably with ''[[dispute resolution]]'', where arbitration and litigation processes are critically involved. The concept of conflict resolution can be thought to encompass the use of nonviolent resistance measures by conflicted parties in an attempt to promote effective resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Roberts |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Ash |editor2-first=Timothy Garton |date=3 September 2009 |title=Civil Resistance and Power Politics:The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present |edition= |url= |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199552016 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and models==

===Dual concern model===

The dual concern model of conflict resolution is a conceptual perspective that assumes individuals’ preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two underlying themes or dimensions: concern for self ([[assertiveness]]) and concern for others ([[empathy]]).&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

According to the model, group members balance their concern for satisfying personal needs and interests with their concern for satisfying the needs and interests of others in different ways. The intersection of these two dimensions ultimately leads individuals towards exhibiting different styles of conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldfien |first1=Jeffrey H. |last2=Robbennolt |first2=Jennifer K. |date=2007 |title=What if the lawyers have their way? An empirical assessment of conflict strategies and attitudes toward mediation styles. |url= |journal=Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution |publisher= [[Ohio State University]] [[Moritz College of Law]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=277–320 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual model identifies five [[group conflict|conflict]] resolution styles/strategies that individuals may use depending on their dispositions toward pro-self or [[prosocial behavior|pro-social]] goals.
 
; Avoidance conflict style
: Characterized by joking, changing or avoiding the topic, or even denying that a problem exists, the [[conflict avoidance]] style is used when an individual has withdrawn in dealing with the other party, when one is uncomfortable with conflict, or due to cultural contexts.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For example, in Chinese culture, reasons for avoidance include sustaining a good mood, protecting the avoider, and other philosophical and spiritual reasonings (Feng and Wilson 2011).{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During conflict, these avoiders adopt a “wait and see” attitude, often allowing conflict to phase out on its own without any personal involvement.&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bayazit |first1=Mahmut |last2=Mannix |first2=Elizabeth A |date=2003 |title=Should I stay or should I go? Predicting team members intent to remain in the team. |url=http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/34/3/290.full.pdf |journal=Small Group Research |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=290–321 |doi=10.1177/1046496403034003002 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By neglecting to address high-conflict situations, avoiders risk allowing problems to fester or spin out of control.
; Yielding conflict style
: In contrast, yielding, “accommodating”, smoothing or [[thought suppression|suppression]] conflict styles are characterized by a high level of concern for others and a low level of concern for oneself. This passive pro-social approach emerges when individuals derive personal satisfaction from meeting the needs of others and have a general concern for maintaining stable, positive social relationships.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; When faced with conflict, individuals with a yielding conflict style tend to harmonize into others’ demands out of respect for the social relationship.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
; Competitive conflict style
: The [[Competition|competitive]], “fighting” or forcing conflict style maximizes individual assertiveness (i.e., concern for self) and minimizes empathy (i.e., concern for others). Groups consisting of competitive members generally enjoy seeking domination over others, and typically see conflict as a “win or lose” predicament.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; Fighters tend to force others to accept their personal views by employing competitive power tactics (arguments, insults, accusations or even violence) that foster intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrill |first1=Calvin|year=1995 |title=The Executive Way: Conflict Management in Corporations |edition= |url= |location=Chicago, US |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-53873-7 |lccn=94033344}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Conciliation conflict style
: The [[conciliation]], “compromising”, bargaining or negotiation conflict style is typical of individuals who possess an intermediate level of concern for both personal and others’ outcomes. Compromisers value fairness and, in doing so, anticipate mutual give-and-take interactions.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; By accepting some demands put forth by others, compromisers believe this agreeableness will encourage others to meet them halfway, thus promoting conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van de Vliert |first1=Evert |last2=Euwema |first2=Martin C. |date=1994 |title=Agreeableness and activeness as components of conflict behaviors. |url= |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=674–687 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.674 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict style can be considered an extension of both “yielding” and “cooperative” strategies.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;
;Cooperation conflict style
:Characterized by an active concern for both pro-social and pro-self behavior, the [[cooperation]], integration, confrontation or problem-solving conflict style is typically used when an individual has elevated interests in their own outcomes as well as in the outcomes of others. During conflict, cooperators collaborate with others in an effort to find an amicable solution that satisfies all parties involved in the conflict. Individuals using this type of conflict style tend to be both highly assertive and highly empathetic.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; By seeing conflict as a creative opportunity, collaborators willingly invest time and resources into finding a “win-win” solution.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; According to the literature on conflict resolution, a cooperative conflict resolution style is recommended above all others. This resolution may be achieved by lowering the aggressor's guard while raising the ego.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fitness365academy.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sternberg |first1=Robert J. |last2=Dobson |first2=Diane M. |date=1987 |title=Resolving interpersonal conflicts: An analysis of stylistic consistency. |url= |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=794–812 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.4.794 |issn=0022-3514 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarboe |first1=Susan C. |last2=Witteman |first2=Hal R. |date=1996 |title=Intragroup conflict management in task-oriented groups: The influence of problem sources and problem analyses. |url= |journal=Small Group Research |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=316–338 |doi=10.1177/1046496496272007 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution curve==

There are many examples of conflict resolution in history, and there has been a debate about the ways to conflict resolution: whether it should be forced or peaceful. Conflict resolution by peaceful means is always a better option. The conflict resolution curve derived from an analytical model offers a peaceful solution by motivating conflicting entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |title=Regret Analysis Towards Conflict Resolution |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3173490 |ssrn=3173490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced resolution of conflict might invoke another conflict in future.

Conflict resolution curve (CRC) separates conflict styles into two separate domains: domain of competing entities and domain of accommodating entities([https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conflict-resolution-curve_fig1_325262817 Image of CRC ]). There is a sort of agreement between targets and aggressors on this curve. Their judgements of badness compared to goodness of each other are analogous on CRC. So, arrival of all conflicting entities to some negotiable points on CRC is important before peace building. CRC does not exist (i.e., singular) in reality if the chance of aggression of the aggressor is certain. Under such circumstances it might lead to apocalypse with mutual destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |title=Conflict Resolution Curve: Concept and Reality |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3196791 |ssrn=3196791}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The curve explains why nonviolent struggles ultimately toppled repressive regimes from power and sometimes forced leaders to change the nature of governance. Also, this methodology has been applied to capture the conflict styles in Korean Peninsula and dynamics of negotiation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |last2=Datta Ray |first2=Ishita |title=North Korea's Peace Building in the Light of Conflict Resolution Curve |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3193759 |ssrn=3193759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political conflict resolution in practice==
[[File:Dayan and el Tell.jpg|thumb|[[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Abdullah el Tell]] reach a ceasefire agreement during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] in Jerusalem on 30 November 1948]]
[[Wars]] may occur between parties who contest an incompatibility. The nature of an incompatibility can be [[territory (country subdivision)|territorial]] or [[governmental]], but a warring party must be a "government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations that uses [[armed force]] to promote its position in the incompatibility in an intrastate or an interstate armed conflict".&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Warring_party_2 Definitions: Warring party]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Wars can conclude with a [[peace agreement]], which is a "formal agreement... which addresses the disputed incompatibility, either by settling all or part of it, or by clearly outlining a process for how... to regulate the incompatibility."&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Peace_agreement Definitions: Peace agreement]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[ceasefire]] is another form of agreement made by warring parties; unlike a peace agreement, it only "regulates the conflict behaviour of warring parties", and does not resolve the issue that brought the parties to war in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Ceasefire_agreements Ceasefire agreements]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peacekeeping]] measures may be deployed to avoid violence in solving such incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellamy|first1=Alex J.|last2=Williams|first2=Paul|title=Understanding Peacekeeping|date=29 March 2010|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4186-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the last century, political theorists have been developing the theory of a [[global peace system]] that relies upon broad social and political measures to avoid war in the interest of achieving [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="RamSummy2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McElwee|first=Timothy A. |editor1-first=Senthil |editor1-last=Ram |editor2-first=Ralph |editor2-last=Summy|encyclopedia=Nonviolence: An Alternative for Defeating Global Terror(ism) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yopi-nCzQF8C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2007 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-60021-812-5 |title=The Role of UN Police in Nonviolently Countering Terrorism |pages=187–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach developed by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] facilitates cooperation between countries over shared water resources, thus reducing the risk of war and enabling sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28458Lessons%20Learnt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as a conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Conflict management capabilities of peace-brokering international organizations, 1945–2010: A new dataset|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0738894215572757|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|publisher=SAGE|volume=33|issue=2|pages=198–223|via=|last1=Lundgren|first1=Magnus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many major international [[non-governmental organizations]] have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as  in businesses, court systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions throughout the world.

==Culture-based==
Conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to [[culture|cultural]] practices. In Western cultural contexts, such as [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants, problem solving, and drafting agreements that meet underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding a mutually satisfying ("[[Win-win game|win-win]]") solution for everyone involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ury |first1=William |last2=Fisher |first2=Roger |date=1981 |title=Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In |edition=1st |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |page= |isbn=0-395-31757-6 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many non-Western cultural contexts, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Vietnam]], and [[China]], it is also important to find "win-win" solutions; however, the routes taken to find them may be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution. It can make sense to involve religious, tribal, or community leaders; communicate difficult truths through a third party; or make suggestions through stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Augsburger |first1=David W. |date=1992 |title=Conflict Mediation Across Cultures:Pathways and Patterns |edition=1st |url= |location=Louisville, KY |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |page= |isbn=978-0664219611 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different, and there is much occasion for misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intercultural Conflict in Groups|journal=Journal for Specialists in Group Work|date=December 2016|volume=41|issue=4|pages=350–369|doi=10.1080/01933922.2016.1232769|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
Conflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans, including dogs, cats, monkeys, snakes, elephants, and [[primates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Waal |first1=Frans B. M. |authorlink=Frans de Waal |date=28 July 2000 |title=Primates—A natural heritage of conflict resolution. |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/289/5479/586.full |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |volume=289 |issue=5479 |pages=586–590 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.586 |issn=0036-8075 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aggression]] is more common among relatives and within a group than between groups. Instead of creating distance between the individuals, primates tend to be more intimate in the period after an aggressive incident. These intimacies consist of [[Personal grooming|grooming]] and various forms of body contact. [[Stress (medicine)|Stress responses]], including increased heart rates, usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals. Different types of primates, as well as many other species who live in groups, display different types of conciliatory behavior. Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival, giving it a strong [[evolution]]ary value.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} These findings contradict previous existing theories about the general function of aggression, i.e. creating space between individuals (first proposed by [[Konrad Lorenz]]), which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups.

In addition to research in [[primates]], biologists are beginning to explore [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]] in other animals. Until recently, the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates has consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data. Although peaceful post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s, it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in [[feral]] [[sheep]]. Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wahaj |first1=Sofia A. |last2=Guse |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Holekamp |first3=Kay E. |date=December 2001 |title=Reconciliation in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). |url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00717.x |journal=Ethology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=107 |issue=12 |pages=1057–1074 |doi=10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00717.x |ISSN=0179-1613 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Jennifer E. |last2=Powning |first2=Katherine S. |last3=Dawes |first3=Stephanie E. |last4=Estrada |first4=Jillian R. |last5=Hopper |first5=Adrienne L. |last6=Piotrowski |first6=Stacey L. |last7=Holekamp |first7=Kay E. |date=February 2011 |title=Greetings promote cooperation and reinforce social bonds among spotted hyaenas. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210004501 |journal=Animal Behaviour |publisher= |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=401–415 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.007 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lions, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaver |first1=Ann |date=October 2003 |title=Conflict and reconciliation in captive bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. |url= |journal=Marine Mammal Science |publisher=[[Society for Marine Mammalogy]] |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=836–846 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2003.tb01134.x |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dwarf mongoose, domestic goats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schino |first1=Gabriele |date=1998 |title=Reconciliation in domestic goats. |url= |journal=Behaviour |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=343–356 |doi=10.1163/156853998793066302 |jstor=4535531 |issn=0005-7959 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; domestic dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cools |first1=Annemieke K.A. |last2=Van Hout |first2=Alain J.-M. |last3=Nelissen |first3=Mark H.

Conflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy, with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action and those that lead to peaceful resolution. The [[University of Law]], one of the oldest common law training institutions in the world, offers a legal-focused masters degree in Conflict Resolution as an LL.M. (Conflict resolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.ac.uk/postgraduate/llm/|title=LLM Masters in Law Degree {{!}} The University of Law|website=www.law.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tel Aviv University]] offers two graduate degree programs in the field of conflict resolution, including the English-language [[International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation]], allowing students to learn in a geographic region which is the subject of much research on international conflict resolution.

The Nelson Mandela Center for Peace &amp; Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi, is one of the first centers for peace and conflict resolution to be established at an Indian university. It offers a two-year full-time MA course in Conflict Analysis and Peace-Building, as well as a PhD in Conflict and Peace Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmi.ac.in/aboutjamia/centres/conflict-resolution/introduction|title=Jamia - Centres - Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution - Introduction|publisher=Jmi.ac.in|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict management==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
'''Conflict management''' refers to the long-term management of intractable conflicts. It is the label for the variety of ways by which people handle grievances—standing up for what they consider to be right and against what they consider to be wrong. Those ways include such diverse phenomena as gossip, ridicule, lynching, terrorism, warfare, feuding, genocide, law, mediation, and avoidance.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Which forms of conflict management will be used in any given situation can be somewhat predicted and explained by the social structure—or social geometry—of the case.

Conflict management is often considered to be distinct from conflict resolution. 
In order for actual conflict to occur, there should be an expression of exclusive patterns which explain why and how the conflict was expressed the way it was. Conflict is often connected to a previous issue. Resolution refers to resolving a dispute to the approval of one or both parties, whereas management is concerned with an ongoing process that may never have a resolution. Neither is considered the same as [[conflict transformation]], which seeks to reframe the positions of the conflict parties.

The role of culture is not always fully appreciated and must be taken into account. In a [http://www.britac.ac.uk/blog/ocean-model-civilization-sustainable-history-theory-and-global-cultural-understanding piece on “the ocean model of civilization”], Prof Nayef Al-Rodhan argues that greater transcultural understanding is critical for global security because it diminishes ‘hierarchies’ and alienation, and avoids dehumanization of the ‘other’.

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to [[frustration]] and loss of efficiency, [[counseling]] may prove helpful. Although few [[organization]]s can afford to have professional counselors on staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener—something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Henry P. |last1=Knowles |first2=Börje O. |last2=Saxberg |title= Personality and Leadership Behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.|location=Reading, MA |year=1971 |asin=B0014O4YN0 |oclc=118832 |doi= |nopp=true |chapter=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes simply being able to express one's feelings to a concerned and understanding listener is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for an individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and coworkers.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard Arvid |last=Johnson |title=Management, Systems, and Society: An Introduction |publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co. |date=January 1976 |location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.  |pages=148–142 |isbn=978-0-87620-540-2 |oclc=2299496 |ol=8091729M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other, more direct and more diagnostic, methods that could be used in appropriate circumstances. However, the great strength of the nondirective approach&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Nondirective counseling is based on the [[client-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]].&lt;/ref&gt; lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. Listening to staff with sympathy and understanding is unlikely to escalate the problem, and is a widely-used approach for helping people cope with problems that interfere with their effectiveness in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

====Steps to conflict resolution in the classroom====

Step 1: Clarifying and focusing: problem ownership

Negative feelings such as annoyance, anger and discomfort can interfere with understanding exactly what is wrong in situations of confrontation and how to set things right again. Gaining a bit of distance from negative feelings is exactly what such moments call for, especially on the part of the person with (presumably) the greatest maturity. ''Problem ownership'' is defined as deciding who should take ownership of the behavior or conflict in the issue (Gordon, 2003). The main person who is bothered by the root problem is also the “owner” of the problem, and thus the owner of a problem needs to be the one who takes primary responsibility for solving the issue. Identifying ownership makes a difference in how behavior is dealt with, as well as how the problem is effectively solved. It is important to ask clarifying questions to really understand the root causes of the conflict.

Step 2: Active listening

Several strategies help with distinguishing who has a problem with a behavior and who takes ownership. One of those strategies is active listening. Active listening is attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting to understand or empathize as much as one can (Seifert &amp; Sutton). Active listening consists of continually asking questions in order to test your understanding. It also requires giving encouragement to the student by letting them tell their story, and paraphrasing what the student says so you can form an unbiased conclusion. It is key not to move too quickly at solving the problem by just giving advice, instructions, or scolding. Responding too soon with solutions can shut down the student’s communication and leave you with inaccurate impressions of the source or nature of the problem (Seifert &amp; Sutton).

Step 3: Assertive discipline and I-messages

Once you, as the teacher, have taken in the student’s point of view, form your comments around how the student’s behavior affects your role. Your comments should be assertive, emphasize I-messages, and encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her behavior. They should not be passive, apologetic, hostile or aggressive, but matter-of-fact, such as, “Charlie, you are talking while I am talking.” The comments should emphasize I-messages that focus on how the behavior is affecting the teacher’s teaching and the other students' learning (Seifert &amp; Sutton). An example of this would be, “You are making it hard for me to focus on teaching this math lesson.” Lastly, you should ask the student more open-ended questions that make him or her think about the consequences of his or her behavior, such as, “How do the other kids feel when you yell in the middle of class?” (Seifert &amp; Sutton). 
* The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others—-a strategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs, 2003). Instead of simply saying, “When you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them”, you can try asking, “How do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?”

Step 4: Negotiation

Seifert and Sutton state that the first three steps describe desirable ways of handling situations that are specific and last for only a short time. These steps by themselves could potentially not be enough when conflicts persist over extended periods of time. Often it is better to negotiate a solution in these situations. Negotiating is defined as methodically deliberating various options and deciding on one if possible (Seifert &amp; Sutton). Even though negotiation demands time and energy, it often demands less time or effort ultimately than continuing to cope with the problem. The results of negotiation can be valuable to everyone involved in the situation. Various experts on conflict resolution have suggested different ways to negotiate with students about problems that are continual (Seifert &amp; Sutton). The theories differ in specifics, but typically are generally similar to the steps we previously discussed:
* Determine what the problem is—involves active listening 
* Discuss and share possible solutions, consider their efficacy
* Attempt to reach a consensus: Total agreement on the subject will not always be possible, but should be set as your end goal
* Assess the success of the decision: Renegotiation might be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classroom Management and the Learning Environment|last=Seifert|first=K|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5442">'''Critical code studies''' (CCS) is an emerging academic subfield, related to [[software studies]], [[digital humanities]], [[cultural studies]], [[computer science]], [[human-computer interface]], and the [[do-it-yourself]] [[maker culture]]. Its primary focus is on the cultural significance of [[computer code]], without excluding or focusing solely upon the code's functional purpose.

As introduced by Mark C. Marino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/codology|title=Critical Code Studies - Electronic Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; critical code studies was initially a method by which scholars "can read and explicate code the way we might explicate a work of literature," but the concept also draws upon Espen Aarseth's conception of a cybertext as a "mechanical device for the production and consumption of verbal signs" (Cybertext, 21), arguing that in order to understand a digital artifact we must also understand the constraints and capabilities of the authoring tools used by the creator of the artifact, as well as the memory storage and interface required for the user to experience the digital artifact.

Evidence that critical code studies has gained momentum since 2006 include an article by Matthew Kirschenbaum in the Chronicle of Higher Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science/14806/|title=Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide|first=Matthew|last=Kirschenbaum|date=23 January 2009|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCS sessions at the Modern Language Association in 2011 that were "packed" with attendees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Hard-Times-Sharpen-the-MLAs/125905/|title=Hard Times Sharpen the MLA's Lens on Labor and the Humanities|first=Jennifer|last=Howard|date=9 January 2011|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; several academic conferences devoted wholly to critical code studies, and a book devoted to the explication of a single line of computer code, titled ''10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Montfort |first1=Nick |last2=Baudoin |first2=Patsy |last3=Bell |first3=John |last4=Bogost |first4=Ian |last5=Douglass |first5=Jeremy |last6=Marino |first6=Mark C. |last7=Mateas |first7=Michael |last8=Reas |first8=Casey |last9=Sample |first9=Mark |last10=Vawter |first10=Noah |title=10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 |date=November 2012 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262018463 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/10-print-chr2055rnd1-goto-10 |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture''' or '''Old Croatian Art''' is [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]] [[Art of Croatia|of Croats]] from their arrival at [[Balkans]] till the end of the 11th century when begins the dominance of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style in art; that was the time of Croatian rulers ([[Dukes of Croatia|Croatian dukes]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatian Kingdom]]).

==Historical background==
{{main|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
[[File:Dolazak Hrvata Celestin Medović.JPG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Celestin Medović]], ''[[Arrival of Croats]]'', before 1920, [[Croatian History Institute]], [[Zagreb]].]]
[[Croats]] have moved from northern Europe, together with other Slavs and Avars, to the area of former Roman provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia and Istria, where they live til the present day. There they founded several [[principality|principalities]]: [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] in the north around the river [[Sava]], and [[Dalmatian Croatia]] along the western and southern [[Adriatic]] coast. Together they were known as [[White Croatia]], while to the east there were [[medieval principalities in southern Dalmatia]] which were at times collectively called [[Red Croatia]].

Croats have been developed to the stage of Iron Age, and they didn’t know how to enjoy the riches of Roman cities, so they inhabited not the city itself but its suburbs (like the river island on the delta of river Jadro next to city of Salona). Croats have assimilated Avars, accepted Christianity, and the ruling cast learned to speak and write Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Art of Early Medieval Croatia at culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt; Croats have accepted Christianity from Franks to the west and from Byzantium from the east. Most of the principalities have turned to Christianity in the 9th century except Pagania which was true to old Slav mythology until the 13th century.

[[File:Branimir.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with the inscription of [[duke Branimir]]’s name from year 880.]]
First Croatian ruler that was recognized by the [[pope]] was [[duke Branimir]], who was called by pope [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] ''dux Chroatorum'' in his letter in 879.
First king of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] from the [[House of Trpimirović]] was crowned around year 925 as ''rex Chroatorum'' and he united Pannonian Principality and Littoral Croatian Duchy into respectable medieval country  which peaked during the reign of [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058-1074).

During the time of Croatian rulers the country was rarely ruled from one place and royal court would move from town to town in which there was a royal castle. The most important royal cities were [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], [[Biograd na Moru]] and [[Knin]]. Other bigger cities were [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Krk]], [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], Trogir, Ston and Dubrovnik, in which big number of original Roman population resided that was eventually croaticized.

After the death of last ruler from the dynasty of Trpimirović in 1091 most of Croatian nobility has accepted the [[Hungarian Kingdom|Hungarian]] king [[Coloman]] as a king of unified kingdom of Croatian and [[Hungary]], stated by the deal ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta Conventa]]'' from year 1102. In Hungarian Kingdom, in Croatia all art already has all characteristics of Romanesque style.

==Old Croatian architecture==

[[File:Zadar Sankt Donat 04.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of St. Donatus]] from the 9th century in Zadar]]
During 7th and 8th century in Croatia there is a trend of building smaller buildings from the material and decorative elements of ruined older Roman buildings. During the 9th century, parallel with the establishment of Croatian principalities, new architecture of pre-Romanesque characteristics emerged. It was based on numerous influences of which the Frankish and Byzantine were the strongest. Slowly these inherited influences were degrading in favour of original architectural forms.

[[File:Crkva sv. trojice.jpg|thumb|150px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of Three Saints]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (9th-11th century)]]
From this time, there are dozens of large ones and over a hundred small churches preserved across entire Croatian coastline and islands. They are all built out of roughly broken stones covered with thick layer of moulter inside and out, and with narrow decorative niches with arched top (like church of st. Peter in Priko near [[Omiš]] and St. Michael near Ston). Also, they often have stone [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s, [[apse]]s and [[dome]]s, as well as stone furniture (frames of doors and windows, perforated stone windows, and altar fences) columns, beams and portals. Instead of classical Roman forms where every part of the building was articulated and had its own recognizable form, new pre-Romanesque buildings have those parts united in unified mass. Therefore, the point where the wall turns to vault, or to drum of the dome is almost unnoticeable. Even though they were built roughly with unsophisticated materials they have excellent and often perfect understanding of architectural space.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Radovan Ivančević from Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller churches are called “churches of free shapes”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art (Hr)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as which the medieval architects wanted to explore all possibilities of shaping on the circular and rectangular base. Cube churches with dome are a bit simple (St. Pelegrin, Dugi otok), rectangular with elliptical base are a bit more complex (St. George, Ravanjska), as well as single nave churches with dome above middle section (St. Peter in Omiš) and cube based churches elongated with two apses (Church of St. Donatus on Krk) and the most complicated ones are those based on Greek cross with dome on the centre and large apse in eastern wing and two smaller apses in northern and southern wing ([[Church of Saint Cross]] in Nin).&lt;ref name="culturenet1"&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Church of St. Mihailo.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;The Church of St. Michael in [[Ston]] from 1080, a foundation of [[Duklja|Doclea]] king [[Mihailo Voislav]].]] --&gt;
[[File:Crikva sveti Dunat 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Church of St. Donatus on the island of [[Krk]].]]
The most original churches are churches based on a circle with multiple apses that are spread around in radial rhythm. [[Church of St. Three]] in Split has radial 6 apses, while Church in Ošlje (Ston) is the ony one with 8 apses. The biggest church with circular base is ''[[Church of St. Donatus]]'' in Zadar from the 9th century. Around its circular base that has a dome there is a ring nave with gallery and three apses on the east. From that time in central Europe there is only Charlemagne’s ''[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]'' that can be compared with its size and beauty.

Large churches often have one or three naves, like ''[[St. Saviour, Cetina]]'' from the 9th century which has rounded [[buttress]]es and a [[bell tower]] above the western portal ([[westwork]]).

In the 10th century Croatian queen [[Jelena of Zadar]], the wife of king [[Mihajlo Krešimir II]], built in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] two churches: [[Church of St. Stephen of the Island]] which was used as a royal mausoleum, and [[Church of Our Lady of the Island]], one of the biggest in Croatia which was used as crown [[basilica]]. Church of St. Stephen was built in Carolingian style with entrance hall above which was a gallery surrounded with two towers (westwork) from each sides of a [[narthex]]&lt;ref&gt;In its ruins was found famous sepulchral tablet of queen Jelena († 976) in which was stated that she was "widow of king Michael, mother of Stephan the king". http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089&lt;/ref&gt; which led to tree nave church with two rows of pillars and a square apse at the end of central nave.

In the 11th century, next to older “Church on the Hill” in Solin, [[Crown church of St. Peter and Moses]] (better known as “[[Hollow church]]“) was built. The church was of unified Croatian pre-Romanesque forms and those Romanesque that appeared with the arrival of Benedictine monks in these parts. It has three naves, many thin niches inside and three apses of which middle is square and other are semicircular from inside and square outside. In this church the legate of Pope Gregory VII has crowned Croatian [[Dmitar Zvonimir]].

In northern Croatia there are only few fragments of interlace found in [[Sisak]], the capital of [[Ljudevit Posavski]]. When the bishopric was founded in [[Zagreb]] (1090), Croatian culture at the coast has already flourished for 300 years and Croatia was at the end of its independence.

==Sculptural ornaments==

[[File:10cent pleter Drzislav.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with inscription of king [[Stjepan Držislav]] from the 10th century.]][[File:Bascanska ploca.jpg|mini|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Baška tablet]], the most famous glagolitic monument written with transversal type of glagolitic script from the 11th century.]]

Pre-Romanesque Croatian churches are also the most important historical sources of that time because on their beams and tympanums of altar fences, as well on some portals and ciboriums we found many names of Croatian kings, dukes and nobleman which are mentioned as patrons and builders of those churches. The oldest one is from church in Rižinice (Solin) which mentions Croatian duke [[Trpimir]] (''PRO DVCE TREPIMERO''), from around year 850, while on the inscription of [[duke Branimir]] from year 888 we have the oldest mention of Croats: ''CRVATORVM''. On the rest from 10th century we found the names of dukes [[Muncimir of Croatia]], [[Držislav]] and [[Svetislav]], all the way to [[king Zvonimir]] from the end of the 11th century.
That inscription of king Zvonimir is already made in [[Croatian language]], written in [[Glagolitic script]] ([[Baška tablet]]).

Double literacy and two scripts have been noticed in several monuments as [[Plomin tablet]] (Istria) and [[Valun tablet]] ([[Cres]], 11th century) where we have Latin language and script as well as Croatian translation in Glagolitic script. Nevertheless, soon the Latin script replaced the Glagolitic which was the only way that Croats would be accepted into still Romanized Medieval Europe. However, Croats will use their native language and script all the way to the 16th century, especially in Istria, Kvarner and on the Croatian coast.&lt;ref name="culturenet1"/&gt;

[[File:Reljef splitska krstionica.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&lt;center&gt;Baptistery with figure of Croatian king from the 11th century; now in the [[Split Cathedral]].]][[File:Plomin tablet 1.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;[[Plomin tablet]]]]
Altar fences and stone perforated windows were decorated with shallow interlace ornament which we call [[Croatian interlace]]. Motifs of this interlace are often of classical origin (waves, three string interlace, pentagrams, nets of rhomboids, etc.), but while in the Roman art it was used only as a frame, here they cover the entire surface. Sheer number, but also the quality of stonework, of these monuments tells us of rich masonry tradition of numerous masters and workshops on the east coast of Adriatic. Comparing to thousands of fragments found in Dalmatia, in the northern Croatia there are only two confirmed founds: one in [[Lobor]] and one in [[Ilok]].&lt;ref&gt;Radovan Ivančević, ''Umjetnost razdoblja život I.'', Profil, Zagreb, 2001, pg. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the interlace is replaced with figures of Gospels (like on the altar fence of Holy Sunday Church in Zadar), but those figures are flatten and their character lines are reduced to graphic lines in outmost linear stylization. The same is the relief from Crown Hollow church of [[king Zvonimir]] in Solin with the figure of ''(Croatian) king'' on the throne with [[Franks|Frankish crown]], beside him is a page, and on the ground is a bowing subject. This relief is from the 15th century a front part of a baptistery in Split Cathedral.

In church of St. Mary from the 11th century in Bishopric (Biskupija) near [[Knin]] the oldest figure of Holy Mary in Croatia was found.&lt;ref&gt;Josip Soldo: History of Church in Croatia, Zagreb-Frankfurt/M., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Romanesque painting in Croatia==

Croatian interlace was originally painted, usually every string would be coloured brightly yellow, red or blue. Since the wall paintings that are mentioned in several literal sources (like the portraits of Trpimirović dynasty in church of St. George in Putalj above [[Kaštel Sućurac]]) are not preserved, they are only type of pre-Romanesque Croatian painting.

[[File:Fresco of Mihailo Vojislavljević, njegos.org.jpg|thumb|150px|right|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of [[Mihailo I of Duklja]], the first recognized ruler of Duklja on a fresco in the ''Church of St. Michael'' in ''[[Ston]]''.]]
The only preserved paintings are found in the [[church of St. Michael near Ston]] from the 11th century . They were ordered by [[Duklja|Doclea]]n ruler [[Mihailo Vojislav]], and were a work of local artist who with rough form and primitive materials achieved strong and suggestive expression in portrayed characters. The figure of a king that holds a model of a church has the same crown as the king depicted in the relief in Split baptistery. His portrait is also remarkable, it shows bony person with high eyebrows and wrinkled forehead, while his long hair and beard are already partly gray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortunately significant number of church [[codex|codices]] were preserved. They were done on pergam with pre-Romanesque [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s of high quality and technique. The oldest one is [[Split Breviary]] that was written and painted from the 8th to 11th centuries, based on famous Breviaries from pre-Carolingian era. In [[Zagreb]] there is a [[Liber psalmorum]] which was illuminated in [[Benedictine]] style by [[prior]] Majon for archbishop Paul of Split (c. 1015–1030). In [[Vatican City|Vatican]] there is a Breviary, also in monte-cassino Benedictine style (initials of intertwined leaves, interlace and animal heads) which originates from monastery of St. Nicola in Osor. The same style of illumination we can found in Breviars in [[Trogir]], [[Šibenik]] and [[Dubrovnik]] but there are many that were recorded (like 47 books in only one church in monastery of St. Peter in Seka) but not preserved.

'''''Der Deutsche Michel''''' ("Michael the German") is a figure [[national personification|representing the national character]] of the [[Germans|German people]], rather as [[John Bull]] represents the [[English people|English]] and [[Uncle Sam]] represents [[Americans]].

==Overview==
Such figures differ from those that serve as [[national personifications|personifications]] of the nation itself, as [[Germania (personification)|Germania]] did the [[Germany|German nation]] and [[Marianne]] the [[France|French]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "Mass-Producing Traditions: Europe, 1870–1914," in Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, eds., ''The Invention of Tradition'' (Cambridge, 1983), 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is usually depicted wearing a nightcap and nightgown, sometimes in the colours of the German flag, and represents the Germans' conception of themselves, especially in his easy-going nature and [[Everyman]] appearance. In any event, the nightgown and the night cap, which have been present in all pictorial representations of the German Michel - the first ones dating from the first half of the nineteenth century - are also interpreted in a way that the German Michel is, in fact, a rather naive and gullible person, not prone, for example, to question the authority of the government. On the contrary, he prefers a decent, plain and quiet lifestyle.

Over the centuries, the character traits attributed to the German Michel were subject to some change.

In German, ''Michel'' is also the short form of Michael, though quite rare today.

==Events and protests==

The concept of Dinkoism has spread through the social media but the movement has organised protest events. On January 30, 2016, a group of Dinkoists, under the banner of ''Mooshikasena'' (Rat Army) held a mock protest in front of Dhe Puttu restaurant owned by popular actor [[Dileep_(actor)|Dileep]] alleging his upcoming film [[Professor Dinkan]] hurt their religious sentiments, mocking similar protests happening worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.onlookersmedia.in/latestnews/protest-upcoming-dileep-film-named-professor-dinkan | title=Protest against upcoming Dileep film named Professor Dinkan| date=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twsTH1"&gt;{{cite news

'''[[Tightlacing]]''' is the practice of wearing a corset that has been tightly laced to shape the body to a desired figure. This practice has been in effect since the early years of corsetry, often deplored by moralists and the subject of urban legends and cautionary tales in many centuries. For the same amount of time, doctors spoke against the practice, citing dramatic risks to the wearer's health. However, many claims were based on the incomplete medical knowledge of the day, as well as incorrect assumptions and beliefs about the female body.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Valerie|title=The Corset: A Cultural History|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heart==

There is no actual evidence from specific, cited autopsies supporting the notion that the heart is damaged by corsetry.&lt;ref name="Steele" /&gt;

A study published in ''Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research'' in 1989 showed that participants who wore waist belts when weight lifting had an increase in blood pressure. that when weight lifting, the support belts that the men wore increased their blood pressure. This inspired the popular corset maker and founder of Lucy's Corsetry, Lucy Williams, to see if this could potentially apply to corsets as well. In a video, she measures her blood pressure both in and out of the corset, seeing a 10% increase of blood pressure while wearing a corset. This is consistent with the 1989 study which saw a 6-15% increase in blood pressure of the wearers.

==Lungs==
The constriction of the corset, if too tight, prevents the lower lobes of the lungs from fully expanding when taking a breath. This puts extra strain on and causes additional work for the lower lobes of the lungs. David Kunzle, an art historian{{Dubious|date=November 2015|reason = Art historian is not a medical professional}}, argues that because the lower lobes have been strained, they are unable to adequately fight off [[pneumonia]]&lt;ref name="Kunzle"&gt;Kunzle, David. ''Fashion and Fetishism''. Totowa: Rowman and Littlefield, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Tuberculosis|bacillus tuberculosis]] which go to the lower lobes of the lungs first.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield"&gt;Crutchfield, Eugene Lee, M.D. "Some Ill Effects of the Corset". ''Gaillard's Medical Journal'' 67 (July 1897): 37–14. Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Valerie Steele notes that the corset's association with tuberculosis originated before the bacillus was discovered, and that the corset may have only aggravated the condition.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt;

==Circulation==

In the nineteenth century, corseting was thought to lead to cardiac palpitations in the heart and [https://web.archive.org/web/20121024201635/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Spanaemia spanaemia],&lt;ref name="Crutchfield" /&gt; or the lack of oxygen in the blood.&lt;ref name="Spanaemia"&gt;"Spanaemia." Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary. n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

This claim was successfully debunked, as there is no evidence to support corset-caused circulatory damage.&lt;ref name="Steele" /&gt;

==Breasts==
Corset-wearing cannot cause breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt; Occurring more frequently is a reduction of the size of the nipples.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Victorians believed the corset caused mammary abscesses,&lt;ref name="Crutchfield"/&gt; a common inflammation of the connective tissue in the breast; however, [[mastitis]] is caused by bacteria, and thus there is no evidence supporting that clothing of any type alone could have led to the condition. These effects are only consistent with that of over-bust corsets and not relevant to those using under-bust only.

==Stomach==
Victorian doctors believed that, in a tightly-laced corset, the stomach would be unable to churn correctly, making it difficult to digest food completely. This condition is called [[dyspepsia]], more commonly known as indigestion.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield" /&gt;

It may cause constipation and make it difficult for the wearer to eat a sizable meal.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt;

==Liver==
Victorian doctors believed that the liver experienced many complications while the body is tightlaced, becoming severed due to the location of the ribs as a result of the tightlacing, and that the liver would become enlarged or displaced.&lt;ref name="Kunzle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Health"&gt;"Health Matters." Science. Vol. 10. Washington, D.C.: American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1887. 281–282. 253. JSTOR. Web. 26 Sept. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility was mechanical congestion,&lt;ref name="Crutchfield" /&gt; the result of the pressure placed on the [[inferior vena cava]], thus obstructing the flow of blood.&lt;ref name="Health" /&gt; According to Dr. Tse-Ling Fong, liver cancer is often the result of this vein being blocked. The blocked vein is not able to filter out the bad blood in the liver resulting in a cancerous infection.&lt;ref name="Fong"&gt;Fong, Tse-Ling, M.D. "Liver Cancer." MedicineNet.com. Ed. Leslie J. Schoenfield, M.D. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, corsets would not have had a drastic effect on the liver, merely squeezing and elongating it, and modern research shows that much of the liver function can be lost without causing health problems.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt; Steele also notes that there is a great deal of variation in liver appearance, which may have confused anatomists performing autopsies.

==Colon==
The corset may have aided a poor diet in causing constipation&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt; which, according to Dr. Majid Ali, if severe enough and left untreated, can eventually lead to death.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;Ali, Majid, M.D. "Control of Constipation". ''Ethnics in Medicine''. n.d. Web. 14 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uterus==
The uterus was believed by Victorian doctors to suffer the most from tightlacing, failing to develop properly due to the inactivity of the abdominal muscles or becoming [[Uterine prolapse|prolapsed]].&lt;ref name="Kunzle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crutchfield" /&gt; Others believed that every time the bladder or rectum emptied, the uterus was unable to be lifted back into place due to weak ligaments, causing head and back pain, and inability to stand or walk, and improper menstruation.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;Law, Hartland, M.D., and Herbert E. Law, F.C.S. "Displacements of the Womb". ''Viavi Hygiene: Explaining the Natural Principles upon Which the Viavi System of Treatment for Men, Women and Children Is Based''. San Francisco: Viavi Company, 1912. 258–271. Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this line of thought rested on very little evidence and the assumption that the uterus was one of the most important organs in a woman's body, and it is unlikely that the uterus actually suffered from corsetry.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt;

==Gall bladder==
Victorian doctors believed there was a relationship between gallstones and tightlacing, the corset causing extreme weight loss.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield" /&gt; (Gallstones are the result of the body metabolizing fat to compensate for rapid weight loss.&lt;ref name="Cornforth"&gt;Cornforth, Tracee. "What Causes Gallstones". About.com. Ed. Medical Review Board. N.p., 18 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, the most common sufferers from gallstones are female even today, and it is unlikely that the corset had much to do with the condition.&lt;ref name="Steele"/&gt;

==Muscles==

Wearing a corset for a very extended period of time can result in muscle atrophy and lower-back pain.&lt;ref name="Steele" /&gt; The pectoral muscles also become weak after extensive tightlacing.&lt;ref name="Kunzle" /&gt; These weakened muscles cause a greater reliance on the corset.&lt;ref name="Steele" /&gt;

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. "Historicism." ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term "historicism" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: "[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history..."; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: "Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are "inexorable laws of historical destiny", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term "[[New Historicism]]", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

==Variants==

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the "spirit" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence "through the activity of finite agents." Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this "Hegelian" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], "Philosophy is the history of philosophy," describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the "Spirit of the Age," is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of "historical inevitabilities" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the "modern" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few "cradles of civilization" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named "historicism."

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, "what you see is what you get" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. "They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as "vulgar" Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name="Theses on Feuerbach"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | website = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: "an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history".&lt;ref name = "Poverty 3"&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of "historicism" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks "historicism" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all "enemies of the open society".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms "moral historicism", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that "history is the world's court of justice".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe "that success proves anything or that history is our judge".&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls "[[Historism]]", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the "[[New Historicism]]" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of "natural right" or "right by nature").  Strauss argued that historicism "rejects political philosophy" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that "all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch." Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or "subjectivize") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or "objective" "value." Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a "radical historicist" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

'''John Howard''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (2 September 1726 – 20 January 1790) was a philanthropist and early English [[prison reform]]er.
[[Image:John Howard by Mather Brown.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;John Howard (1789)&lt;br&gt;by [[Mather Brown]]]]

==Birth and early life==
[[File:HowardHouseClapton.png|thumb|A picture published in 1826, supposedly of the house where Howard was born.]]
{{Marshalsea}}
Howard was born in North London, either in Hackney or Enfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoirs of the Public and Private Life of John Howard, the Philanthropist; compiled from his own diary, etc. With a portrait ...|author=[[James Baldwin Brown]] (the Elder.)|publisher=T. &amp; G. Underwood|date= 1823|edition= Second|pages=625–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, also John, was a wealthy [[upholsterer]] at [[Smithfield Market]] in the city. His mother Ann Pettitt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stafford-Smith|first1=Tessa West ; foreword, Clive|title=The curious Mr. Howard : legendary prison reformer|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|location=Hook, Hampshire|isbn=9781904380733}}&lt;/ref&gt; died when he was five years old, and, described as a "sickly child", he was sent to live at [[Cardington, Bedfordshire]], some fifty miles from London, where his father owned property. His father, a strict disciplinarian with strong religious beliefs, sent the young John to a school in [[Hertford]] and then to [[List of dissenting academies#London area|John Eames's dissenting academy in London]].

After school, John was apprenticed to a wholesale grocer to learn business methods, but he was unhappy. When his father died in 1742, he was left with a sizeable inheritance but no true vocation. His [[Calvinist]] faith and quiet, serious disposition meant he had little desire for the fashionable endeavours of an English aristocratic lifestyle. In 1748, he left England for a [[grand tour]] of the continent.

Upon his return, he lived in lodgings in [[Stoke Newington]], where he again became seriously ill. He was nursed back to health by his landlady, Sarah Loidore, whom he then married despite her being thirty years older than he was. She died within three years and he distributed her meagre belongings amongst her remaining family and poor neighbours.

John Howard was considered eccentric by many of his contemporaries. It has been advanced by psychiatrist Philip Lucas&lt;ref&gt;Philip Lucas, "John Howard and Asperger's Syndrome: Psychopathology and philanthropy" in: History of Psychiatry 12(45) March 2001, pp. 73-101.&lt;/ref&gt; and by mathematician [[Ioan James|Ioan Mackenzie James]]&lt;ref&gt;Ioan James, Asperger's Syndrome and High Achievement: Some Very Remarkable People, Jessica Kingsley Pub, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; that Howard might have had [[Asperger's Syndrome]].

==Taken prisoner==
He then set out for [[Portugal]] following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], traveling on the ''Hanover'', which was captured by French privateers. He was imprisoned in [[Brest, France|Brest]] for six days before being transferred to another prison on the French coast. He was later exchanged for a French officer held by the British, and he quickly travelled to the [[Sick and Hurt Commissioners|Commissioners of Sick and Wounded Seamen]] in London to seek help on behalf of his fellow captives. It is widely believed that this personal experience generated Howard's interest in prisons.

==Howard at Cardington==
Having returned from France, he settled again at [[Cardington, Bedfordshire|Cardington]], Bedfordshire to live on a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate which was formerly two farms, the larger of which he had inherited from his grandparents. His grandmother, Martha Howard, was a relation of the Whitbread family, and he became a neighbour and close friend of his cousin, [[Samuel Whitbread (1720–1796)|Samuel Whitbread]]. He spent the next two years building properties and trying to improve the lives of the tenants living on his land. Later, a survey of [[Cardington, Bedfordshire|Cardington]] in 1782 found that he was paying for the teaching of 23 children. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in May 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=16&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27howard%27%29|title= Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= The Royal Society|accessdate= 18 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1758, Howard married Henrietta Leeds who died in 1765, a week after giving birth to a son, also named John, who was sent to boarding school at a very young age. The younger John was sent down from [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] for homosexual offences, was judged insane at the age of 21, and died in 1799 having spent thirteen years in an asylum.

==High Sheriff of Bedfordshire==
[[Image:HowardStatueBedford.JPG|left|thumb|170px|[[Statue of John Howard, Bedford]]]]
John Howard was appointed [[High Sheriff of Bedfordshire]] in 1773,&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=David |title=1788 the brutal truth of the first fleet |publisher=Random House Australia |ISBN=978-1741668001 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} initially for a one-year period. Such was his dedication, rather than delegating his duties to the under-sheriff as was customary, Howard inspected the county prison himself. He was shocked by what he found, and spurred into action to inspect prisons throughout England. Of particular concern to Howard were those prisoners who were held because they could not pay the jailer's fee – an amount paid to the owner or keeper of the prison for upkeep. He took this issue to parliament, and in 1774 Howard was called to give evidence on prison conditions to a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|select committee]]. Members of that committee were so impressed that, unusually, Howard was called to the bar of the House of Commons and publicly thanked for his "humanity and zeal".

Having visited several hundred prisons across England, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and wider Europe, Howard published the first edition of ''The State of the Prisons'' in 1777. It included very detailed accounts of the prisons he had visited, including plans and maps, together with detailed instructions on the necessary improvements, especially regarding hygiene and cleanliness, the lack of which was causing many deaths.&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;{{rp|10}} It is this work that has been credited as establishing the practice of [[single-celling]] in the United Kingdom and, by extension, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Michael Sherman|author2=Gordon J. Hawkins|title=Imprisonment in America: Choosing the Future|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1983|pages=32–33|isbn=0-226-75280-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xff18mD7Z94C&amp;dq=%22single+celling%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following account, of the [[Bridewell]] at [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]], is typical:

blockquote&gt;Two dirty day-rooms; and three offensive night-rooms: That for men eight feet square: one of the women's, nine by eight; the other four and a half feet square: the straw, worn to dust, swarmed with vermin: no court: no water accessible to prisoners. The petty offenders were in irons: at my last visit, eight were women.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Howard viewed his work as humanitarian. Terry Carlson, in his 1990 biographical tract on Howard, remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Howard's detailed proposals for improvements were designed to enhance the physical and mental health of the prisoners and the security and order of the prison. His recommendations pertaining to such matters as the prison location, plan and furnishings, the provision of adequate water supply, and prisoner's diet promoted hygiene and physical health. Recommendations concerning the quality of prison personnel, rules related to the maintenance of standards of health and order and an independent system of inspection, reflect the need for prison personnel to set a moral example.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 1777, Howard's sister died, leaving him £15,000 and her house. He used this inheritance and the revenue from the sale of her house to further his work on prisons. In 1778, he was again examined by the House of Commons, who were this time inquiring into "hulks", or [[prison ship]]s. Two days after giving evidence, he was again travelling Europe, beginning in the [[Dutch Republic]].

By 1784, Howard calculated that he had travelled over {{convert|42000|mi|km}} visiting prisons. He had been awarded an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] by the [[University of Dublin]] and had been given the [[Freedom of the City of London]]. His fourth and final tour of English prisons began in March 1787 and two years later he published ''The State of the Prisons in England, and An Account of the Principal Lazarettos of Europe''.

His final journey took him into Eastern Europe, and into [[Crimea]]. Whilst at [[Kherson]], Howard contracted [[typhus]] on a prison visit and died, aged sixty-three. He was buried in a walled field at Dophinovka (Stepanovka), Ukraine. Despite requesting a quiet funeral without pomp and ceremony, the event was elaborate and attended by the Prince of Moldovia. When news of his death reached England in February 1790, a commemorative series of John Howard [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] [[Conder Tokens]] were struck, including one that circulated in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], on the reverse showing "Go forth" and "Remember the Debtors in Gaol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGgGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=howard+%22go+forth%22+token+halfpenny&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QPknUeDmBMbM0AXir4Bo&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bath%20%22go%20forth%22&amp;f=false|title=An alphabetical list of provincial copper-coins or tokens:|page=8|author=Samuel Birchall|publisher=Thomas Gill|year=1796|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard became the first civilian to be honoured with a statue in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], London. A statue was also erected in [[Bedford]], and a further one in Kherson. His bust features in the architecture of a number of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] prisons across the UK, such as at [[Shrewsbury]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1790.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Howard's legacy==
Howard's views on keeping prisoners in isolation were unavailingly opposed by [[Elizabeth Fry]], who believed in the value of association.

Almost eighty years after his death, the Howard Association was formed in London, with the aim of "promotion of the most efficient means of penal treatment and crime prevention" and to promote "a reformatory and radically preventive treatment of offenders". In its first annual report in 1867, the Association stated that its efforts had been focused on "the promotion of reformatory and remunerative prison labour, and the abolition of capital punishment." The Association merged with the Penal Reform League in 1921 to become the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]]. Today, the Howard League is Britain's biggest penal reform organisation.

John Howard's name was adopted by non-profit organizations in Canada which call themselves the John Howard Society of their given geographic area and each society seeks to develop effective, just and humane responses to crime and its consequences. There are currently over 60 John Howard societies spread across every province of Canada and the Northwest Territories.

The [[Howard Association]], a benevolent organisation founded in 1855 in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], United States, was also named after him. There is also a Howard League for Penal Reform in [[New Zealand]]. The John Howard Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejha.org www.thejha.org]&lt;/ref&gt; of Illinois, formed in 1901, independently monitors correctional facilities, policies and practices, and advances reforms needed to achieve a fair, humane and effective criminal justice system in Illinois.

A statue to Howard is in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the first to a civilian, and a large [[Statue of John Howard, Bedford|bronze statue at Bedford]] was erected in 1890, the centenary of his death.

A terracotta bust of John Howard is incorporated in the gatehouse of [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs]], and another bust over the entrance to [[Shrewsbury Prison]].

The John Howard Pavilion at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] in Washington, D.C., is the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital for the [[District of Columbia]]. Its most notorious inmate was [[John Hinckley, Jr.]], failed [[assassin]] of then US president [[Ronald Wilson Reagan]] in 1981.

[[Samford University]], located in the US state of [[Alabama]], was founded by Baptists as Howard College in 1841. Samford's Howard College of Arts and Sciences remains the academic core of the university.

[[John Howard School]] in Hackney is named after him.

'''Land development''' is altering the [[landscape]] in any number of ways such as:
* Changing [[landforms]] from a [[natural]] or semi-natural state for a purpose such as [[agriculture]] or [[House|housing]]
* [[subdivision (land)|Subdividing]] [[real estate]] into [[Lot (real estate)|lots]], typically for the purpose of building [[home]]s
* [[Real estate development]] or changing its purpose, for example by converting an unused [[factory]] complex into [[condominium|condominia]].

==Economic aspects==
In an economics context, land development is also sometimes advertised as '''land improvement''' or '''land amelioration'''. It refers to [[investment]]s making land more usable by humans. For accounting purposes it refers to any variety of projects that increase the [[property value|value of the property]]. Most are depreciable, but some land improvements are not able to be depreciated because a useful life cannot be determined. [[Home building]] and [[containment]] are two of the most common and the oldest types of development.

In an [[Urban development|urban]] context, land development furthermore includes:
* [[Road construction]]
** [[Access road]]s, [[walkway]]s and [[parking lot]]s
** [[Bridge|Bridging]]
* [[Landscaping]]
** [[Deforestation|Clearing]], [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] or [[land levelling]]
* Setup of [[fence]]s and, to a lesser degree, [[hedge]]s
* Service connections to [[municipal service]]s and public utilities
* [[Drainage]], [[canal]]s
* External lighting ([[street lamp]]s, etc.)

[[Landowner]] or developers on any size of project will often want to [[profit maximization|maximise profits]], minimise [[risk analysis|risk]] and control [[cash flow]]. This "profit enhancement" means identifying and developing the best scheme for the local marketplace, whilst satisfying the local planning process.

'''Development Analysis''' puts development prospects and the development process itself under the microscope, identifying where enhancements and improvements can be introduced. These improvements aim to align with best design practice, political sensitivities, and the inevitable social requirements of a project, with the overarching objective of increasing [[land value]]s and [[profit margin]]s on behalf of the landowner or developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=David E. |date=2008 |title=Fundamentals of Land Development |chapter=4. Marketing Studies and Market Considerations |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page= |isbn=9780471778936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development analysis can add significantly to the value of land and development, and as such is a crucial tool for landowners and developers. It is an essential step in [[Kevin A. Lynch]]'s 1960 book ''[[The Image of the City]]'', and is considered to be essential to realizing the value potential of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynch, Kevin |title=The Image of the City |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge MA |year=1960 |ol=5795447M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landowner can share in additional planning gain (significant value uplift) via an awareness of the land's development [[economic potential|potential]]. This is done via a residual development appraisal or residual valuation. The residual appraisal calculates the sale value of the end product (the Gross Development Value, or GDV), and hypothetically deducts costs, including planning and [[construction]] costs, finance costs and developer's profit. The "residue", or leftover proportion, represents the land value. Therefore, in maximising the GDV (that which one could build on the land), land value is concurrently enhanced.

Land value is highly sensitive to [[supply and demand]] (for the end product), build costs, planning and [[affordable housing]] contributions, and so on. Understanding the intricacies of the development system and the effect of "value drivers" can result in massive differences in the landowner's sale value.

==Conversion of landforms==
Land development puts more emphasis on the expected [[economic development]] as a result of the process; "land conversion" tries to focus on the general physical and biological aspects of the [[land use]] change. "Land improvement" in the economic sense can often lead to [[land degradation]] from the ecological perspective. Land development and the change in land value does not usually take into account changes in the ecology of the developed area. While conversion of (rural) land with a [[vegetation]] carpet to [[building land]] may result in a rise in [[economic growth]] and rising [[land price]]s, the [[irreversibility]] of lost flora and fauna because of [[habitat destruction]], the loss of [[ecosystem services]] and resulting decline in [[environmental cost|environmental value]] is only considered ''a priori'' in [[environmental full-cost accounting]].

===Conversion to building land===
[[File:Motorway construction in Ireland.JPG|thumb|Motorway construction in Ireland]]
Conversion to building land is as a rule associated with [[road building]], which in itself already brings [[topsoil]] abrasion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=2009-09-03 |title=Top soil is removed from the new road bed |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6htJvcohDXo |location=Dayton, TN |publisher=Bryan College}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[soil compaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Urban Soil Compaction |date=March 2000 |series=Soil Quality – Urban Technical Note No. 2 |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_053278.pdf |publisher=U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, Soil Quality Instsitute |location=Auburn, AL}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modification of the soil's chemical composition through [[soil stabilization]], creation of [[impervious surface]]s and, subsequently, (polluted) [[surface runoff]] water.
[[File:Varvarin - Building construction (USACE project).jpg|thumb|Building construction]]
Construction activity often effectively seals off a larger part of the soil from [[rainfall]] and the [[nutrient cycle]], so that the soil below buildings and roads is effectively "consumed" and made [[soil fertility|infertile]].

With the notable exception of attempts at [[rooftop garden]]ing and hanging gardens in [[green building]]s (possibly as constituents of [[green urbanism]]), [[vegetative cover]] of higher plants is lost to [[concrete]] and [[asphalt]] surfaces, complementary interspersed [[garden]] and [[park]] areas notwithstanding.

===Conversion to farmland===
[[File:Soy_forest.jpg|thumb|In Argentina and Bolivia, the [[Chaco (Paraguay)|Chaco]] [[thorn forest]] (A) is being felled at a rate considered among the highest in the world (B), to give way to [[soybean]] cultivation (C)]]

New creation of [[farmland]] (or 'agricultural land conversion') will rely on the conversion and development of previous [[forest]]s, [[savanna]]s or [[grassland]]. Recreation of farmland from [[Barren vegetation|wasteland]], [[desert]]s or previous impervious surfaces is considerably less frequent because of the degraded or missing [[soil fertility|fertile soil]] in the latter. Starting from forests, land is made [[arable land|arable]] by [[assarting]] or [[slash-and-burn]]. 
[[agriculture|Agricultural]] development furthermore includes: 
* Hydrological measures (land levelling, drainage, [[irrigation]], sometimes [[landslide]] and [[flood control]])
* [[Soil improvement]] ([[fertilization (soil)|fertilization]], establishment of a productive chemical balance).
* Road construction

[[File:Oil palm and rainforest fragment Borneo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Oil palm]] plantation and rainforest fragment on Borneo]]
Because the newly created farmland is more prone to [[erosion]] than soil stabilized by [[tree root]]s, such a conversion may mean irreversible crossing of an [[ecological threshold]].

{{see also|Horton overland flow}}

The resulting [[deforestation]] is also not easily compensated for by [[reforestation]] or [[afforestation]]. This is because [[plantation]]s of other trees as a means for [[water conservation]] and protection against wind [[erosion]] ([[shelterbelt]]s), as a rule, lack the [[biodiversity]] of the lost forest, especially when realized as [[monoculture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Sarah Jane |url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/science-blogger/not-all-forests-are-created-equal-reforesting-the-tropics-for-people-biodiversity-and-carbon-629 |title=Not All Forests Are Created Equal: Reforesting the Tropics for People, Biodiversity, and Carbon |date=2014-08-14 |website=The Equation (Blog) |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Boucher |first1=Doug |title=The Root of the Problem: What's Driving tropical Deforestation today? |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/UCS_RootoftheProblem_DriversofDeforestation_FullReport.pdf |date=June 2011 |series=Tropical Forest and Climate Initiative |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/issues/monoculture.html |title=Monocultures |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Carbon Trade Watch |location=Barcelona, Spain |access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brockerhoff |first1=E.G. |last2=Jactel |first2=H. |last3=Parrotta |first3=J. |last4=Quine |first4=C.P. |last5=Sayer |first5=J. |date=2008-04-09 |title=Plantation forests and biodiversity: oxymoron or opportunity? |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=925–951 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-008-9380-x |doi=10.1007/s10531-008-9380-x |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[soil stabilization]] and [[erosion control]] measures may not be as effective in preserving [[topsoil]] as the previous intact [[vegetation]].

===Restoration===
Massive land conversion without proper consideration of [[ecological]] and [[geological]] consequences may lead to disastrous [[Land degradation|results]], such as: 
* General [[soil degradation]]
** Catastrophic [[soil salination]] and [[solonchak]] formation, e.g., in [[Central Asia]], as a consequence of irrigation by saline [[groundwater]]
** [[Desertification]], soil [[erosion]] and ecological shifts due to drainage
** [[Leaching (agriculture)|Leaching]] of saline soils
* [[Habitat loss]] for the wildlife.

While deleterious effects can be particularly visible when land is developed for industrial or mining usage, agro-industrial and settlement use can also have a massive and sometimes irreversible [[environmental impact|impact]] on the affected ecosystem.

Examples of [[land restoration]]/[[land rehabilitation]] counted as land development in the strict sense are still rare. However, [[Ecological restoration|renaturation]], [[reforestation]], [[stream restoration]] may all contribute to a [[environmental health|healthier environment]] and quality of life, especially in densely populated regions. The same is true for planned vegetation like [[park]]s and [[garden]]s, but restoration plays a particular role, because it reverses previous conversions to [[Built-up area|built]] and agricultural areas.

'''Language secessionism''' (also known as '''linguistic secessionism''' or '''linguistic separatism''') is an attitude supporting the separation of a [[language variety]] from the [[language]] to which it has hitherto been considered to belong, in order to make this variety considered as a distinct language. This phenomenon was first analyzed by Catalan [[sociolinguistics]]&lt;ref&gt;For example:

*STRUBELL Miquel (1991) "Catalan in Valencia: the story of an attempted secession", Swiss Academy of Social Science Colloquium on Standardization: Parpan / Chur (Grisons) 15–20 April 1991
*PRADILLA Miquel Àngel (1999) "El secessionisme lingüístic valencià", in: PRADILLA Miquel Àngel (1999) (ed.) ''La llengua catalana al tombant del mil·leni'', Barcelona: Empúries, p. 153-202.
*Article "secessionisme lingüístic", in: RUIZ I SAN PASCUAL Francesc, &amp; SANZ I RIBELLES Rosa, &amp; SOLÉ I CAMARDONS Jordi (2001) ''Diccionari de sociolingüística,'' coll. Diccionaris temàtics, Barcelona: Enciclopèdia Catalana.&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be ascertained in other parts of the world.

== In Catalan and Occitan ==

=== Common characteristics ===
In the [[Occitano-Romance languages|Occitano-Catalan language area]], language secessionism is a quite recent phenomenon that has developed only since the 1970s. Language secessionism affects both [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] languages with the following common features:&lt;ref&gt;SUMIEN Domergue (2006) ''La standardisation pluricentrique de l’occitan: nouvel enjeu sociolinguistique, développement du lexique et de la morphologie,'' coll. Publications de l’Association Internationale d’Études Occitanes 3, Turnhout: Brepols, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A breakaway from the tradition of Occitan and Catalan [[Language revitalization|revivalist movements]], which usually claim the unity of both languages since the 19th century.
* An often deliberate ignorance of the tradition of [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[linguistics]] that also claims the unity of Occitan and Catalan.&lt;ref&gt;BEC Pierre (1970-71) (collab. Octave NANDRIS, Žarko MULJAČIĆ) ''Manuel pratique de philologie romane,'' Paris: Picard, 2 vol.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An exacerbation of the [[cultural identity]] [[Cultural linguistics|linked to dialects]], which secessionism considers as separate languages.
* A lack of success (or a very marginal position) in [[linguistics|linguistic]] scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Kremnitz, "Une approche sociolinguistique", in F. Peter Kirsch, &amp; Georg Kremnitz, &amp; Brigitte Schlieben-Lange (2002) ''Petite histoire sociale de la langue occitane: usages, images, littérature, grammaires et dictionnaires'', coll. Cap al Sud, F-66140 Canet: Trabucaire, p. 109-111 [updated version and partial translation from: Günter Holtus, &amp; Michael Metzeltin, &amp; Christian Schmitt (1991) (dir.) ''Lexikon der Romanistischen Linguistik''. Vol. V-2: ''Okzitanisch, Katalanisch'', Tübingen: Niemeyer]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An active [[lobbying]] in regional political circles.
* The support of a [[writing system]] or of any prescription, which breaks up linguistic unity and exaggerates dialectal particular features.

=== In Catalan ===
In [[Catalan language|Catalan]], there are three cases:
* [[Valencian]] language secessionism, or [[blaverism]], appeared during the [[Spanish transition to democracy|democratic transition]] at the end of the 1970s, after the fall of [[Francoism]]. It is supported by some conservative and usually [[Spanish language|Castilian]]-speaking circles of the Valencian society, which are branded as "post-Francoist" by partisans of [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan unity]]. It has variable impact in the population: Valencian people usually name their language "Valencian" but are divided about the unity of Catalan: some people agree in that "Valencian" is just the regional name for "Catalan" but other people think that "Valencian" would be a distinct language from "Catalan". Blaverism has no impact in the scientific community of linguists. Valencian institutions and Valencian partisans of Catalan unity use the official norm of Catalan (as codified by [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] and [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]]), while "Blavers" (partisans of blaverism) mostly write Valencian using a spin-off, nonstandard system called "normes del Puig".
* [[Balearic dialect|Balearic language]] secessionism is quite marginal and is supported by a few cultural groups. It has very little impact in the population. It is included in a wider (but unorganized) tendency called "gonellisme", which struggles against the [[Language standardization|standardization]] of Catalan.
* In [[Franja de Ponent]] (a Catalan-speaking strip in eastern [[Aragon]]), language secessionism is quite marginal. It appeared during the 2000s. It is supported only by a fraction of the already minority pro-[[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] movements, who overstate a so-called Aragonese [[Proto-language|ancestry]] in the Catalan spoken in Aragon.

=== In Occitan ===
There are three cases in [[Occitan language|Occitan]]:
* In the [[Auvernhat]] dialect, language secessionism has been supported since the 1970s by [[Pierre Bonnaud]], who founded the ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|Bonnaudian norm]]'', the group ''Cercle Terre d'Auvergne'' and the review ''Bïzà Neirà''. It has negligible impact in the population, where knowledge of the language is in any case at best residual. Auvernhat cultural circles are divided between the unitary vision of Occitan (associated with the Occitan ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|classical norm]]'') and secessionism (associated with ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|Bonnaudian norm]]'').
* In the [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] dialect, language secessionism appeared during the [[1970s]] with Louis Bayle and has been reactivated since the [[1990s]] by Philippe Blanchet and groups like "Union Provençale" and "Collectif Provence". This secessionism supports the ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|Mistralian norm]]'' (but it does not represent all Mistralian norm users, since some of them claim traditionally the unity of Occitan). It has little impact in the population, whose knowledge of the language is anyway residual. Provençal cultural circles are divided between the unitary vision (supported by users of both ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|Mistralian norm]]'' and ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|classical norm]]'') and the secessionist vision (supported by one some users of the ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|Mistralian norm]]''). The Regional Council of [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] voted a resolution on 5 December 2003 that approved the principle of the unity of "Occitan or Langue d'Oc" and the fact that Provençal is a part of it.
* In the [[Gascon language|Gascon]] dialect, language secessionism is claimed since the 1990s by Jean Lafitte, who created during the 2000s a group called "Institut Béarnais et Gascon". It has negligible impact in the population. Lafitte's secessionism supports two original writing systems: one is a nonstandard spin-off from the ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|classical norm]]'' and the other one is a nonstandard spinoff from the ''[[Occitan language#Writing system|Mistralian norm]]''. Gascon cultural circles almost unanimously support the unitary vision of the Occitan language. In [[Aran Valley]] (a little Gascon Occitan-speaking area in [[Spain]]), [[Aranese]], the local variety of [[Gascon language|Gascon]], is officially recognized as a part of the [[Occitan language]]. The status of semi-autonomy of Aran Valley (1990) presents Gascon [[Aranese]] as "Aranese, the variety of the Occitan language peculiar to Aran ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070609045335/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/aran/a_marclegal.htm "Er aranés, varietat dera lengua occitana e pròpia d’Aran"]). Similarly, the status of autonomy of [[Catalonia]], as reformed in 2006, confirms it with the following expression: "The Occitan language, which is named Aranese in Aran" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070609045335/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/aran/a_marclegal.htm "Era lengua occitana, denominada aranés en Aran"]).

==In Hindi and Urdu==
The [[national language]] of [[Pakistan]] and [[official language]]s in many parts of [[India]], the [[Khariboli dialect]] has become the chief [[language variety]] for use in [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]. Grammatically, Hindi and Urdu [[Hindustani language|are the same]] but differ in their lexicons. Hindi tends to revitalize its [[Sanskrit]] words and [[Linguistic purism|purges words]] borrowed from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] while Urdu does the opposite. In essence, apart from their scripts, the [[lexicon]] is what distinguishes Urdu and Hindi. Also, there are other [[Indo-Aryan languages]] that are classed as Hindi but are not necessarily the same as Hindi and Urdu. Their dialects are close to the [[Khariboli]] dialect, which sets the grammatical standard over other Indo-Aryan languages both far and near. These languages will tend to diverge, especially through the influence and accents of surrounding [[native languages]] in the communities.

In Pakistan, Western [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] or [[Lahnda languages]], with [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]] ([[Multani dialect|Multani]]), [[Panjistani]] (Mirpuri-Potohari), [[Hindko languages|Hindko]] (Peshawari-Kohati), [[Dogri language|Dogri]] and [[Eastern Panjabi language|Eastern Panjabi]]/Majhi as the principal standards, have been related linguistically to other Indo-Aryan languages.

== In Romanian ==
The official standard language of [[Moldova]] is identical to [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. However, its official name in that country is "Moldovan" and at least [[Vasile Stati]], a local linguist, has asserted that it is, in fact, a separate language in its own right.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} During the Soviet era, the USSR authorities officially recognized and promoted [[Moldovans]] and [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] as a distinct ethnicity and language. A [[Moldovan cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]] was introduced in the [[Moldovan SSR]] to reinforce this claim. Since 1989 the official language switched to the [[Romanian alphabet|Latin script]] and underwent the same language reforms as Romanian, but has retained its name, Moldovan.
 
Nowadays, the Cyrillic alphabet remains in official use only on the territories controlled by the breakaway authorities of the [[Transnistria|Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]], where it is named "Moldovan", as opposed to the Latin script version used elsewhere, which the local authorities call "Romanian".

[[Serbo-Croatian]] has a strong structural unity, according to the vast majority of linguists who specialize in [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Comrie |editor1-first=Bernard |editor1-link=Bernard Comrie |editor2-last=Corbett |editor2-first=Greville G. |year=2002 |origyear=1st.

Since the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in 1991, Serbo-Croatian has lost its unitary codification and its official unitary status.

The problems of the so-called Ausbau-languages in Heinz Kloss’s terminology are similar, but by no means identical to the problems of variants. In Ausbau-languages we have pairs of standard languages built on the basis of different dialects [...]. The difference between these paired Ausbau-languages and standard language variants lies in the fact that the variants have a nearly identical material (dialectal) basis and the difference is only in the development of the standardisation process, while paired standard languages have a more or less distinct dialect base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brozović |first=Dalibor |authorlink=Dalibor Brozović |editor1-last=Bugarski |editor1-first=Ranko |editor2-last=Hewkesworth |editor2-first=Celia |title=Language Planning in Yugoslavia |publisher=Slavica Publishers |pages=72–79 |chapter=The Yugoslav Model of Language Planning: A Confrontation with Other Multilingual Models |location=Columbus, Ohio |year=1992 |oclc=26860931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, the Serbo-Croatian kind of language secessionism is now a strongly consensual and institutional majority phenomenon. Still, this doesn't make it legitimate to say that such a language secessionism has led to "[[Ausbau language]]s" in the cases of Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin and Serbian, because such diversion has not taken place:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kafadar |first=Enisa |editor1-last=Henn-Memmesheimer |editor1-first=Beate |editor2-last=Franz |editor2-first=Joachim |title=Die Ordnung des Standard und die Differenzierung der Diskurse; Teil 1 |publisher=Peter Lang |pages=100–101, 103 |language=German |chapter=Bosnisch, Kroatisch, Serbisch – Wie spricht man eigentlich in Bosnien-Herzegowina? |trans-chapter=Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian – How do people really speak in Bosnia-Herzegovina? |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=63hKaFGtTDAC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Frankfurt am Main |year=2009 |oclc=699514676 |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Plurizentrische Sprachen, Ausbausprachen, Abstandsprachen und die Serbokroatistik |trans-title=Pluricentric languages, Ausbau languages, Abstand languages and the Serbo-Croatistics |url=http://www.zeitschrift-fuer-balkanologie.de/index.php/zfb/article/view/203/203 |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=210–215 |year=2009 |issn=0044-2356 |oclc=680567046 |id={{ZDB|201058-6}} |archivedate= 4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5bCgpH?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/436361.AUSBAU-ABSTAND-PLURIZENTRISCH.PDF |accessdate=2 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Galician-Portuguese ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The [[Portugal|Portuguese kingdom]], a former southern county split from the [[Kingdom of Galicia]] and fief of the [[Kingdom of Leon]], was created by [[Afonso I of Portugal]] in 1126 and expanded towards the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic south]], like its neighbouring kingdoms. That part of Galicia, named Portugal, became independent while the northern part of the country remained under the [[Kingdom of León]] during the 12th century and early 13th century. Northern Galicia would later be ruled by the [[Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Castile]], which would become the core and ethnic base for the future [[Spain]]; but the culture was the same on both sides of the political border. Galician-Portuguese culture attained great [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] during the [[Low Middle Ages]]. In the late 15th century, Castilian domination became harder, [[Minoritized language|banishing their language]] in all official uses, including the [[Liturgical language|church]].

[[Galician-Portuguese]] survived [[Diglossia|diglossically]] for the following centuries among the peasant population, but it experienced a strong Spanish [[Superstratum|influence]] and had a different evolution.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Meanwhile, the same language (for the [[Reintegrationism|reintegrationist]] view) remained fully [[Official language|official]] in Portugal and was carried across the world by [[Portuguese explorers]], soldiers and [[Portuguese colonies|colonists]].

During the 19th century a [[Linguistic revival|revival movement]] arose. This movement defended the Galician language, and created a provisional norm, with a Castilian [[orthography]] and many [[Loanword|loanwords]]. When autonomy was granted, a norm and orthography (based in ''rexurdimento'' writers) ([[Galician language literature|Galician literature]]) for a Galician language was created. This norm is taught and used in schools and [[List of universities in Spain|universities of Galicia]]. But most writers ([[Castelao]], [[Risco]], Otero Pedrayo) did not support the traditional Galician forms;{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} some of them based in Spanish orthography even if they recognized the essential linguistic unity, saying that the priority was achieving [[political autonomy]] and being [[Literacy|read by the population]]. Other writers wrote with a Portuguese-like orthography (e.g. Guerra da Cal and Carvalho Calero).

Reintegrationists claim that the official norm (released in 1982) was imposed by the Spanish state, with the covert intent of severing Galician from Portuguese. But this idea is rejected by the [[Royal Galician Academy|Real Academia Galega]], which supports the official norm.

[[Reintegrationism|Reintegrationist and Lusist groups]] are protesting against this so-called language secessionism, which they call Castrapism (from ''[[castrapo]]'', something like "[[patois]]") or [[Isolationism]]. Unlike in the case of [[Valencia|Valencian]] [[Blaverism]], isolationism has no impact in the scientific community of linguists, and it is supported for a small number of them but still has clear political support.

Galician-Portuguese linguistic unity until the 16th century seems to be consensus,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} as does both Galician and European Portuguese being closer to each other and to the more conservative [[Portuguese dialects|Portuguese variants]] of [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazil]] and [[Portuguese in Africa|Africa]] in the 18th century than in the 19th century, and also closer in the 19th century than in the 20th century and now. In this period, while Galician for the most part lost vowel reduction, [[velarization]] of {{IPA|/l/}} and [[Nasal vowel|nasal vowels]], and some speech [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of it adhered to ''[[yeísmo]]'', all making it phonologically closer to Spanish. For example, [[European Portuguese]] had splits that created two new [[vowel]] [[Phoneme|phonemes]], one of them usually an [[allophone]] only in the case of [[vowel reduction]] and the other phonetically absent in any other variant. Some dialects had a merger of three of its oral [[Diphthong|diphthongs]] and another three of its nasal vowels, and together with [[Brazilian Portuguese]] absorbed more than 5000 loanwords from [[French language|French]] as well as 1500 from [[English language|English]].

It seems that the debate for a greater integration among [[List of countries where Portuguese is an official language|Portuguese-speaking countries]] had the result of a single writing standard ([[1990 Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement]]), often shunned by some segments of [[Media of Portugal|Portuguese media]] and population but long waited and cheered by Brazilians despite occasional criticism to some aspects and that changed the spelling of between 0.5% and 1% of the words in both former varieties, with minor respect to major dialect phonological differences. The other debate, whether Galician should use the same standard of Portuguese ([[Lusism]]), a standard with minor differences ([[Reintegrationism]]), a re-approximation of both through another [[Lusophone]] spelling agreement that would give particular regional differences such as that of Galician as well as major diverging dialects of Portuguese (especially in South America) more room (Reintegrationism), or the present standard based on the Spanish orthography, still did not cast official attention of government authorities in any of the involved countries, even if Lusophone support is expected to be strong in any of the first three cases.

A point often held by minorities among both Reintegrationists/Lusists and Lusophonists is that Portuguese should have a more conservative and uniform international speech standard that at the same time respected minor phonological differences between its [[Varieties of Portuguese|variants]] (such as a complete free choice of the various allophones of the [[rhotic consonant]] {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, {{IPA|[a ~ ɐ ~ ɜ ~ ə]}} for {{IPA|/a ~ ɐ/}} or {{IPA|[s ~ s̻ʲ ~ ʃ ~ ɕ]}} for the [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] allophone of {{IPA|/S/}}) that would further strength Lusophone integration (while sung European Portuguese is comprehensible to untrained Brazilians, this is not the case for even the media standard of Galician, let alone more colloquial varieties){{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}, but this is not especially welcomed by any party in Europe, much because as the adoption of the 1990 OA in 2009–2012 proved, the Portuguese are often very [[wikt:reticent|reticent]] of the adoption of things seen as giving preference, even if minor, to Brazil.

==In Tagalog==
Republic Act No. 7104, approved on August 14, 1991, created the Commission on the [[Filipino language|Filipino Language]], reporting directly to the President and tasked to undertake, coordinate and promote researches for the development, propagation and preservation of Filipino and other [[Philippine languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno7104.htm |title=Commission on the Filipino Language Act |publisher=Chan Robles Law Library |accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 1992, the commission issued Resolution 92-1, specifying that Filipino is the{{quote|text=...indigenous written and spoken language of [[Metro Manila]] and [[List of cities in the Philippines|other urban centers]] in the Philippines used as the language of communication of [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name="Res921"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Resolusyon%20Blg%2092-1 |title=Resolusyon Blg. 92-1 |publisher=Commission on the Filipino Language |date=13 May 1992 |accessdate=2007-03-24 |language=Filipino}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though the [[Commission on the Filipino Language]] recognizes that a lot of the vocabulary of [[Filipino language|Filipino]] is based on [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], the latest definition given to the national language tries to evade the use of the term ''Tagalog''.

According to some [[Filipinology|Filipinologists]] (people who specialize in the study of Filipino as a language), the main reason that Filipino is distinct from Tagalog is that in Filipino, there is a presence of vocabulary coming from other [[Philippine languages]], such as [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] (such as ''bana'' - husband), [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] (such as ''buang'' - insane) and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] (such as ''ading'' - little brother). They also maintain that the term [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] is the language of the [[Katagalugan]] or the [[Tagalog Republic|Tagalog Region]] and [[Linguistic purism|puristic]] in a sense. It lacks certain phonemes like /f/ and /v/, which makes it incapable of producing some indigenous proper nouns ''I'''f'''ugao'' and ''I'''v'''atan''.&lt;ref name="Res921"/&gt; Curiously, proponents of language secessionism are unable to account for the glaring absence of long vowel, phonemic in [[Tausug language|Tausug]], in Filipino phonology or for the absence of a [[schwa]]. Arguments for secessionism generally ignore the fact that the various [[languages of the Philippines]] have divergent phonologies.

== In Chinese ==

=== Mandarin versus other dialects ===
Among [[Chinese language|Chinese]] speakers, [[Cantonese]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://unravellingmag.com/articles/cantonese/|title=Cantonese: Language or dialect? {{!}} Unravel Magazine|work=Unravel|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hokkien]] and other [[varieties of Chinese]] are often referred to as [[dialect]]s ({{Lang-zh|c=方言|s=|t=}}), instead of [[language]]s ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=语言|t=語言}}), despite the fact that those languages/dialects are hard to understand for [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers who are the majority of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] speakers unless they write things down. There are debates over whether those varieties of the [[Chinese language]] should be separate languages.

=== In Hokkien ===
In the [[Hokkien]] dialect ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=閩南語}}) , which is widely used in [[Fujian]], [[Taiwan]], and other areas, it is debated that whether [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese dialect]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=臺灣閩南語}}) should be separated from the Hokkien language as the [[Taiwanese language]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=臺灣話 or 臺語}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=民視綜合頻道|title=台語更名「閩南語」 學者批歧視－民視新聞|date=2011-05-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WweOAI4XH8c|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peoplenews.tw/news/c239aeb3-bf18-42b6-8fbe-1b15f9a9cfe4|title=【民報】台灣南社 台灣羅馬字協會：「台語就是台語」不是閩南語|access-date=2018-04-17|language=zh-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt; although people from Fujian and Taiwan can communicate with each other despite some differences in vocabulary. Such debates may be associated with [[Politics of the Republic of China|politics of Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/285388|title=北京話不是國語、台語也不能叫閩南語！他這樣控訴國民黨對台灣歷史記憶的操弄…-風傳媒|last=Storm.mg|access-date=2018-04-17|language=zh-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some scholars believe that Hokkien should be the most standard accent of Chinese in history, regarding the [[Standard Chinese]] based on [[Beijing dialect|Beijing accent]] as an alienized dialect deeply influenced by [[Ethnic minorities in China|non-Han minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwanus.net/history/1/57.htm|title=台灣話的由來|website=www.taiwanus.net|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simckes, descended from a long line of [[rabbi]]s (including his father Herbert Isaac Simckes, grandfather [[Mnachem Risikoff]] and great-grandfather [[Zvi Yosef Resnick]]), was born in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]],&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;Simckes, L.S., ''Seven Days of Mourning'', Random House, 1963, "About the Author"&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="writers"&gt;[http://www.pw.org/content/lazarre_simckes Writers and Poets: Writers directory], retrieved February 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a graduate of [[Harvard College]] (Magna Cum Laude, [[Phi Beta Kappa]]), [[Stanford University]] (Wallace Stegner Writing Fellow, M.A.), and [[Harvard University]] (Ph.D.).&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[http://offbroadway.broadwayworld.com/article/Next_NEW_CITY_NEW_BLOOD_READINGS_SERIES_Takes_Place_316_20090304 BroadwayWorld.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught at colleges and universities throughout the United States including Harvard, [[Yale]], [[Williams College|Williams]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]] and [[Tufts University|Tufts]], as well as at [[Bar-Ilan]] and the [[University of Haifa]] in Israel.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt;  He has also conducted live, interactive writing workshops via satellite linking middle school and high school students across the country, including the [[Virgin Islands]]. During his [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] year at the University of Haifa, he conducted a similar workshop linking Israeli Arab and Jewish high school students with their counterparts in America ("Celebrating Differences").&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fulbright"&gt;"Bridging Differences," ''The Israel Fulbrighter'', pg 7, 1995-1996, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playwright===
His first play, ''Seven Days of Mourning'' (adapted from his novel published by Random House), was staged on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] at [[Circle in the Square Theatre|Circle in the Square]]. Clive Barnes called it "spiky, yet intensely moving. A ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' without music, but with blood. Unique, wild, funny. It still haunts me." He wrote the off-off-Broadway play ''Ten Best Martyrs of the Year'', a [[Theater for the New City]] (TNC) production directed by Crystal Field, about the ten rabbis who were tortured to death in Rome for supporting the revolt led by [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhbah]] in 2nd century Palestine. Simckes  said of that play, "I tend to make tragic comment in a mixture of styles. So what did I do? I wrote a play as if through the eyes of Hadrian, the Roman emperor, watching the genocide of the Jews from his balcony."&lt;ref name="tallmer"&gt;Tallmer, Jerry, [http://www.thevillager.com/villager_52/nossigsanticsat.html "Nossig's Antics at Theater for the New City"], ''The Villager'', May 4, 2004, retrieved February 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was reviewed by Michael Smith in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as "timeless, mythic, enlivened by all kinds of stylistic intrusions and an almost hysterical inventiveness."&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;[http://offoffbroadway.broadwayworld.com/article/TNCs_New_City_New_Blood_Series_Premieres_SOLDIER_BOYS_119_20091108 BroadwayWorld.com], retrieved February 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seymour Simckes 2009.jpg|thumb|left|New Haven, Connecticut, 2009]]

Another of his off-off-Broadway productions, ''Nossig's Antics'', also a TNC production directed by Crystal Field, focuses on the character of Alfred Nossig, who was accused of collaborating with Nazis in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], and executed in 1943, just before his 80th birthday, by a Jewish fighters organization.&lt;ref name="mcbee"&gt;McBee, Richard, [http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/16311 ''The Jewish Press''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228144015/http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/16311/ |date=2010-12-28 }}, June 2, 2004, retrieved February 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic Richard McBee called it "a riveting puzzle,"&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; and it has also been described as a "dark farce" and an "absurd exploration of history and the horrific times we live in."&lt;ref name="mcbee"/&gt;

His other plays include ''Minutes'', a fictional encounter between [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Gustav Mahler]]; "Soldier Boys" about [[Nicholas I of Russia|Czar Nicholas]]'s 1827 edict to recruit Jews into the Russian army for the first time, including children as Cadets, which had a reading at Theater for the New City with Judd Hirsch as the Czar; and "Open Rehearsal," chosen by [[Edward Albee]] as first runner-up in the inaugural 2006-2007 Yale Drama Series Competition,&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt;  He also wrote the screenplay for [[Sidney Lumet]]'s movie version of ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', which has not yet been produced.&lt;ref name="tallmer"/&gt;

===Novelist and translator===
Simckes's first published work was a translation of two stories by the Israeli author, [[S. Y. Agnon]], followed by the short story, "Behold My Servant!", published in Stanford Short Stories 1962.&lt;ref name="Seven"/&gt;  His novels include ''Seven Days in Mourning'' and ''The Comatose Kids''.  He has translated a number of works from Hebrew to English, including ''[[Adam Resurrected]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905398,00.html "Books:Rags and Bones," July 19, 1971, Time.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Chocolate Deal'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://wsupress.wayne.edu/books/625/Chocolate-Deal Book Review, Wayne State University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Commander of the Exodus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fact+and+Fiction+by+Yoram+Kaniuk.-a070450990 TheFreeLibrary.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also translated Nava Semel's children's book, "Becoming Gershona," about a twelve-year-old girl in 1958 [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alibris.com/booksearch?qwork=607289&amp;matches=33&amp;browse=1&amp;subject=Tel+Aviv+Israel&amp;cm_sp=works*listing*title Alibris.com], retrieved February 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Hebrew, Simckes is fluent in [[Yiddish]], and according to the director of the film ''Kvetch'', [[Austin Kase]], Simckes was one of the inspirations for the movie, and also appeared in it.&lt;ref&gt;Claudell, Matthew, [http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/oct/08/kvetch-director-schvitzes-out-movie "Kvetch director schvitzes out a movie"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227043615/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/oct/08/kvetch-director-schvitzes-out-movie/ |date=2011-02-27 }}, October 8, 2010, ''Yale News''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapist===
As a practicing psychotherapist, Simckes has worked with multi-problem families and imprisoned [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt;

An article in ''The Israeli Fulbrighter'' notes that Simckes found a "dual vocation as a writer and healer."&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;  After studying at the Kantor Family Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he began using brief writing assignments with patients in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, to help them deal with their problems. He continued working on this idea and eventually launched writing workshops in community centers, "attempting to foster literacy, empathy, listening skills, insight, respect, and resolution of conflict."  He believes writing exercises are especially effective because "they serve to highlight the problem in a way that it can be dealt with."&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;

===Cross-cultural educator===
Simckes has tried to bring all his talents and experiences to bear in his efforts among Israelis and Palestinians.  He made "fostering cross-cultural insights and empathy" in the "interlocked perspectives surrounding the Arab/Israeli encounter" the core of his Fulbright year in Israel, at the University of Haifa.&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;
[[File:Seymour Simckes.jpg|thumb|right|Simckes standing on bridge over Charles River, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1963]]

Among his initiatives were a creative writing seminar, "The Mirror of Fiction", and a two-way live interactive video workshop, "Celebrating Differences", broadcast on February 27, 1996.  The live interactive TV seminar linked American high school students in the United States with Jewish and Arab students (both Israeli and Palestinian) in Israel.  "He created a live bridge and prompted the participants to share their experiences on handling differences," helping the students gain new insights about one another.&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;

To prepare for the Israeli video program, broadcast through the Massachusetts Corporation for Educational Telecommunications, Simckes made frequent visits to [[Nazareth]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20101210073610/http://www.beit-hagefen.com/En_Web/En_%20Home_Index.htm Beit Hagefen], and [[Jish]] to find students who were comfortable with writing spontaneously, and sharing their writing on the air—and prepared to listen, not just "to yell at each other."&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;

==== Use of language ====
Simckes has strong feelings about the use of English in workshops that involve both Israeli and Palestinians, because it is a "bridge language" and a "diffuser of power" in a political sense, interrupting "the implication of power through language."&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;

He believes that the ability to listen is critical to both writing and healing, and hopes his writing workshops strengthen that skill.  If people "can hear each other," he says, "they become a community."&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;

==Awards==
His awards include two National Endowment of the Arts fellowships and the National Jewish Book Award, as well as receiving the Best Actor award for his performance in the award-winning Comedy short-film, Kvetch.&lt;ref name="fulbright"/&gt;

'''''Magnolia''''' is a 1999 American epic [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, co-produced and directed by [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]. The film stars [[Jeremy Blackman]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Melinda Dillon]], [[Philip Baker Hall]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Ricky Jay]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Jason Robards]] and [[Melora Walters]], and is a mosaic of interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness and meaning in the [[San Fernando Valley]].

''Magnolia'' received positive reviews, with critics praising its acting, direction, storytelling, ambition, and [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], largely consisting of [[Aimee Mann]] songs; however, some deemed it overlong and melodramatic. Of the [[ensemble cast]], Tom Cruise was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[72nd Academy Awards]], and won the award in that category at the [[Golden Globes]] of 2000. The film also won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. It was Robards' final feature film.

==Plot==
The narrator recounts three instances of incredible coincidences and suggests that forces greater than chance play important roles in life.

Police officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman's apartment, finding a body in a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, tries to tell him who committed the murder but Jim is dismissive. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson. Claudia's neighbors called the police after she had an argument with her estranged father, children's game show host Jimmy Gator, and then blasted music while snorting [[cocaine]]. Unaware of her addiction, Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit. He asks her on a date that night; she says yes.

Jimmy hosts a long-running quiz show called ''What Do Kids Know?'' and is dying of cancer; he has only a few months to live. That night the newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley's father berates him for freezing on air, Stanley refuses to return for the final round.

Donnie Smith, a former ''What Do Kids Know?'' champion, watches the show from a bar. Donnie's parents spent the money he won as a child, a lightning strike has damaged his mental capacity, and he has just been fired from his job at Solomon &amp; Solomon, an electronics store, due to chronic lateness and poor sales. He is obsessed with getting oral surgery, thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces. He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces.

The show's former producer, Earl Partridge, is also dying of [[cancer]]. Earl's trophy wife, Linda, collects his prescriptions for [[morphine]] while he is cared for by a nurse, Phil Parma. Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son, Frank Mackey, a [[motivational speaker]] peddling a [[pickup artist]] course to men. Frank is in the midst of an interview with a journalist who reveals that she knows Frank had to take care of his dying mother after Earl abandoned the family. An angry Frank storms out of the interview when Phil gets through to him.

Linda goes to see Earl's lawyer, begging him to change Earl's will. She admits she married Earl for his money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and refuse the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage. Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank, but later apologizes. She drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda in her car, near death, and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse.

Before his date with Claudia, Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun. When he meets Claudia they promise to be honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was divorced three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, but Jim assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she runs off.

Jimmy Gator goes home to his wife Rose and confesses that he cheated on her. She asks why Claudia does not talk to him, and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her. Rose demands to know if it is true, but Jimmy says he cannot remember whether he abused Claudia. Rose tells Jimmy he deserves to die alone, and she walks out on him. Jimmy decides to kill himself.

Donnie takes money from the Solomon &amp; Solomon safe. As he drives away, he decides to return the money, but discovers he cannot get back in as his key broke off in the lock. While climbing a utility pole to get on the roof, he is seen by a passing Jim. Suddenly, [[Raining animals|frogs begin falling from the sky]], with multiple consequences: as Jimmy is about to kill himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the TV which sets his house on fire; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia's apartment, but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter; Earl dies as Frank watches the frogs; Linda's ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room; and Donnie is knocked from the pole and smashes his teeth, then is dragged to safety by Jim.

Jim counsels Donnie and helps him return the money; his gun falls from the sky. Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda, who will recover from her attempted suicide. Stanley, on his way to bed, tells his father that he needs to be nicer to him, but his father ignores him and tells him to go to bed. Jim goes to see Claudia, telling her he wants to make things work between them; she smiles in reply.

==Production==
===Development===
Anderson started to get ideas for ''Magnolia'' during the long editing period of ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  As he got closer to finishing the film, he started writing down material for his new project.&lt;ref name="konow"&gt;{{cite news | last = Konow | first = David | title = PTA Meeting: An Interview with Paul Thomas Anderson | publisher = Creative Screenwriting | date = January–February 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the critical and financial success of ''Boogie Nights'', [[New Line Cinema]], who backed that film, told Anderson that he could do whatever he wanted and the filmmaker realized that, "I was in a position I will never ever be in again".&lt;ref name="hirschberg"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hirschberg | first = Lynn | title = His Way | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = December 19, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael De Luca]], then Head of Production at New Line, made the deal for ''Magnolia'', granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein"&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldstein | first = Patrick | title = Heading in a New Direction | publisher = ''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date = December 24, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was "intimate and small-scale",&lt;ref name="patterson"&gt;{{cite news| last = Patterson | first = John | title = ''Magnolia'' Maniac | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = March 10, 2000 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/10/culture.features| accessdate = April 12, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that he could shoot in 30 days.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = ''Magnolia'' Production Notes | publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | year = 1999 | url = http://www.cigarettesandredvines.com/film.php?id=MMB | accessdate = February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the title of "Magnolia" in his head before he wrote the script.&lt;ref name="strauss2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Bob | title = ''Magnolia'' Springs from Valley Roots | publisher = ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'' | date = December 19, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he started writing, the script "kept blossoming" and he realized that there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put "an epic spin on topics that don't necessarily get the epic treatment".&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; He wanted to "make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie".&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt; Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that "start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue",&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress [[Melora Walters]].&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; The next image that came to him was of [[Philip Baker Hall]] as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters' apartment and having an intense confrontation with her.&lt;ref name="portman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Portman | first = Jamie | title = How ''Magnolia'' Grew and Grew | publisher = ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' | date = December 30, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also did research on the magnolia tree and discovered a concept that eating the tree's bark helped cure cancer.&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt;

Before Anderson became a filmmaker, one of the jobs he had was as an assistant for a television game show, ''Quiz Kid Challenge'', an experience he incorporated into the script for ''Magnolia''.&lt;ref name="goldstein"/&gt; He also claimed in interviews that the film is structured somewhat like "[[A Day in the Life]]" by [[The Beatles]], and "it kind of builds up, note by note, then drops or recedes, then builds again".&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt; The production designers looked at films with close, tight color palettes, films that were warm and analyzed why they did that and then applied it to ''Magnolia''.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; They also wanted to evoke the colors of the magnolia flower: greens, browns and off-whites. For the section of the prologue that is set in 1911, Anderson used a hand-cranked [[Pathé]] camera that would have been used at the time.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; Some of the actors were nervous about singing the lyrics to Mann's "Wise Up" in the film's climactic scene and so Anderson had Moore do it first and she set the pace and everyone else followed.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

Anderson and New Line reportedly had intense arguments about how to market ''Magnolia''.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; He felt that the studio did not do a decent enough job on ''Boogie Nights'' and did not like the studio's poster or trailer for ''Magnolia''. Anderson ended up designing his own poster, cut together a trailer himself,&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; wrote the liner notes for the soundtrack album, and pushed to avoid hyping Cruise's presence in the film in favor of the ensemble cast.&lt;ref name="puig"/&gt; Even though Anderson ultimately got his way, he realized that he had to "learn to fight without being a jerk. I was a bit of a baby. At the first moment of conflict, I behaved in a slightly adolescent knee-jerk way. I just screamed."&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, published around the time of ''Magnolia'''s release, Anderson said that he walked out of ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' after the first half hour and criticized its director, [[David Fincher]], for making jokes about cancer, saying that he should get it as punishment. Afterwards, Anderson wrote Fincher a note apologizing and explained that he had lost his sense of humor about cancer.&lt;ref name="lacey"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lacey | first = Liam | title = The Lion and the Young Cub | publisher = ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' | date = January 22, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson is known for his use of [[long take]]s in his films, moving along considerable distances with complex pivoting movements and transitions in actors and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/video-steadicam-progress-career-paul-thomas-anderson-five |title=Video: Steadicam progress – the career of Paul Thomas Anderson in five shots |author=Kevin B. Lee |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the long takes in ''Magnolia'', the most notable may be the 2 minutes 15 seconds where character Stanley Spector arrives at the studio for a taping of ''What Do Kids Know?'', the camera seamlessly moving through multiple rooms and hallways, transitioning to follow different characters throughout the take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/05/25-the-place-beyond-the.html |title=25 Great Extended Shots in Film History |author= Mark Rozeman |publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplay===
By the time he started writing the script, Anderson was listening to [[Aimee Mann]]'s music.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; Anderson used her two solo albums and some demo tracks from a new album that Mann was working on as a basis and inspiration for the film.&lt;ref name="bessman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bessman | first = Jim | title = Music Blossomed into Film | publisher = ''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date = December 16, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Mann's song "Deathly", on her album ''[[Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo]]'', inspired the character of Claudia.&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; At one point in the movie, Claudia uses part of the lyric as dialogue in the film ("Now that I've met you/Would you object to/Never seeing each other again").&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

The character of Jim Kurring originated in the summer of 1998 when actor [[John C. Reilly]] grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of [[Cops (TV series)|''COPS'']] with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was "always cast as these heavies or these semi-[[mental retardation|retarded]] child men. Can't you give me something I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?"&lt;ref name="braun"&gt;{{cite news | last = Braun | first = Liz | title = He Finally Gets the Girl| publisher = ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' | date = January 11, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

For [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], Anderson wanted him to play a "really simple, uncomplicated, caring character".&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; The actor described his character as someone who "really takes pride in the fact that every day he's dealing with life and death circumstances".&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; With [[Julianne Moore]] in mind, the director wrote a role for her to play a crazed character using many pharmaceuticals. According to the actress, "Linda doesn't know who she is or what she's feeling and can only try to explain it in the most vulgar terms possible".&lt;ref name="strauss"&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Bob | title = Everything's Coming Up ''Magnolia''s for Actress | publisher = ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' | date = December 23, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For William H. Macy, Anderson felt that the actor was scared of big, emotional parts and wrote for him, "a big tearful, emotional part".&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

While convincing [[Philip Baker Hall]] to do the film by explaining the significance of the rain of frogs, the actor told him a story about when he was in the mountains of [[Italy]] and got caught in bad weather—a mix of rain, snow and tiny frogs. Hall had to pull off the road until the storm passed.&lt;ref name="pevere"&gt;{{cite news | last = Pevere | first = Geoff | title = Director Can Do Both Riveting and Ribbiting | publisher = ''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date = January 23, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview, Hall said that he based the character of Jimmy Gator on real-life TV personalities such as [[Bob Barker]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]].&lt;ref name="dawson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Dawson | first = Tom | title = I Went from Being Anonymous to: 'Who Is This Guy We've Got To Have Him' | publisher = ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' | date = March 5, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rain of frogs was inspired by the works of [[Charles Fort]] and Anderson claims that he was unaware that it was also a reference in [[The Bible]] when he first wrote the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Reinhartz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lu-hXPqGJsMC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=paul+thomas+anderson+unaware+of+bible+reference+magnolia#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20thomas%20anderson%20unaware%20of%20bible%20reference%20magnolia ''Scripture on the Silver Screen''], Westminster John Knox Press, 2003 p25-26&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the filmmaker came across the notion of a rain of frogs, he was "going through a weird, personal time", and he started to understand "why people turn to religion in times of trouble, and maybe my form of finding religion was reading about rains of frogs and realizing that makes sense to me somehow".&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt;

===Casting===
[[Tom Cruise]] was a fan of Anderson's previous film, ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', and contacted the filmmaker while he was working on [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="weinraub"&gt;{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | title = ''Boogie'' Writer Back in the Valley | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = October 8, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson met with Cruise on the set of Kubrick's film and the actor told him to keep him in mind for his next film. After Anderson finished the script, he sent Cruise a copy and the next day, the actor called him. Cruise was interested but nervous about the role. They met with Cruise along with De Luca who helped convince the actor to do the film.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; Frank T.J. Mackey, the character that Cruise would play in the film, was based in part on an audio-recording done in an engineering class taught by a friend that was given to Anderson.&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt; It consisted of two men, "talking all this trash" about women and quoting a man named [[Ross Jeffries]], who was teaching a new version of the [[Eric Weber (director)|Eric Weber]] course, "How to Pick Up Women," but utilizing [[hypnotism]] and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] language techniques.&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt; Anderson transcribed the tape and did a reading with Reilly and [[Chris Penn]].&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; The director then incorporated this dialogue and his research on Jeffries and other self-help gurus into Mackey and his sex seminar.&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt; Anderson felt that Cruise was drawn to the role because he had just finished making ''Eyes Wide Shut'', playing a repressed character, and was able to then play a character that was "outlandish and bigger-than-life".&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt;

Anderson wrote the role of Earl Partridge for [[Jason Robards]], but Robards was initially unable to do it because of a serious [[staph infection]]. Anderson approached [[George C. Scott]], who turned him down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puig|first=Claudia|title=Interview: USA Today|date=7 January 2000|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|url=http://cigsandredvines.blogspot.com/2000/01/interview-usa-today.html|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Robards was able to do the film.&lt;ref name="puig"&gt;{{cite news | last = Puig | first = Claudia | title = Dangerous Ground Is Paul Thomas Anderson's Turf | publisher = ''[[USA Today]]'' | date = January 7, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robards said of his character, "It was sort of prophetic that I be asked to play a guy going out in life. It was just so right for me to do this and bring what I know to it".&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; According to Hall, much of the material with Partridge was based on Anderson watching his father die of cancer.&lt;ref name="dawson"/&gt;

Anderson wanted [[Burt Reynolds]] to star in the film, but Reynolds declined it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|title=Burt Reynolds: 'I regret turning down Greta Garbo'|date=3 December 2015|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/burt-reynolds-guardian-live-interview-hate-paul-thomas-anderson|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and soundtracks==
{{Main|Magnolia (soundtrack)|Magnolia (score)}}
Anderson met [[Aimee Mann]] in 1996 when he asked her husband, [[Michael Penn]], to write the score and songs for his film, ''[[Hard Eight (film)|Hard Eight]]''. Mann had songs on soundtracks before but never "utilized in such an integral way" she said in an interview.&lt;ref name="weinraub"/&gt; She gave Anderson rough mixes of songs and found that they both wrote about the same kinds of characters.&lt;ref name="weinraub"/&gt; He encouraged her to write songs for the film by sending her a copy of the script.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt;

Two songs were written expressly for the film: "You Do", which was based on a character later cut from the film, and "Save Me", which closes the film;&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; the latter was nominated in the 2000 [[Academy Award]]s and [[Golden Globes]] and in the 2001 [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]. Most of the remaining seven Mann songs were demos and works in progress; "Wise Up", which is at the center of a sequence in which all of the characters sing the song,&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; was originally written for the 1996 film ''[[Jerry Maguire]]''. At the time Mann's record label had refused to release her songs on an album.&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; The song that plays at the opening of the film is Mann's cover of [[One (Harry Nilsson song)|"One"]] by [[Harry Nilsson]]. Mann's track "Momentum" is used as the loud playing music in Claudia's apartment scene when Officer Jim arrives and was also featured in the trailer for the film.

The [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], released in December 1999 on [[Reprise Records]], features the Mann songs, as well as a section of [[Jon Brion]]'s score and tracks by [[Supertramp]] and [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] that were used in the film. Reprise released a [[Magnolia (score)|full score album]] in March 2000.

''Magnolia'' initially opened in a [[limited release]] on December 17, 1999, in seven theaters grossing [[United States dollar|USD$]]193,604. The film was given a [[wide release]] on January 7, 2000, in 1,034 theaters grossing $5.7 million on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $22,455,976 in North America and $25,995,827 in the rest of the world with a worldwide tally of $48,451,803, above its budget of $37 million.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news| title = ''Magnolia'' | publisher = ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' | date = | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=magnolia.htm | accessdate = January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Magnolia'' struggled at the box office, it was well-received critically. {{As of|2018}} it has an 83% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 119 "fresh" reviews out of 144.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes| id=magnolia| title=Magnolia}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it "the most imperfect of the year's best movies".&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Mike | title = ''Magnolia'' Unfolds with Epic Boldness | work = [[USA Today]] | date = December 17, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] praised the film, saying: "''Magnolia'' is the kind of film I instinctively respond to.

In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, "But when that group sing-along arrives, ''Magnolia'' begins to self-destruct spectacularly. It's astonishing to see a film begin this brilliantly only to torpedo itself in its final hour," but went on to say that the film "was saved from its worst, most reductive ideas by the intimacy of the performances and the deeply felt distress signals given off by the cast".&lt;ref name="maslin"&gt;{{cite news | last = [[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]| title = Entangled Lives on the Cusp of the Millennium | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = December 17, 1999 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940CE3DD1430F934A25751C1A96F958260 | accessdate = January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip French, in his review for ''[[The Observer]]'', wrote, "But is the joyless universe he (Anderson) presents any more convincing than the Pollyanna optimism of traditional [[sitcom]]s?

Following the film's release, Anderson said: "I really feel... That ''Magnolia'' is, for better or worse, the best movie I'll ever make."&lt;ref&gt;P. T. Anderson, quoted at [http://www.theyshootpictures.com/andersonpaulthomas.htm They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, he came to consider it overlong;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/01/06/when-david-foster-wallace-taught-paul-thomas-anderson/|title=When David Foster Wallace Taught Paul Thomas Anderson|last=Piepenbring|first=Dan|magazine=The Paris Review|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when asked in a [[Reddit]] AMA what he would tell himself to do if he could go back to when he shot the movie, his response was "Chill The Fuck Out and Cut Twenty Minutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7quthe/im_paul_thomas_anderson_writer_and_director_of/dss3g5x/ |title= I'm Paul Thomas Anderson, Writer and Director of PHANTOM THREAD, AMA!|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|website=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raining frogs and Exodus (Bible) references===
{{further|Raining animals}}
At the end of the film, [[frog]]s rain from the sky. Throughout the film, there are references to the [[Book of Exodus]] 8:2 "And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will [[Plagues of Egypt#Frogs2ndPlague|smite all thy borders with frogs]]."

The film has an underlying theme of unexplained events, taken from the 1920s and 1930s works of [[Charles Fort]]. Fortean author [[Loren Coleman]]'s 2001 book "Mysterious America: The Revised Edition" includes a chapter entitled "The Teleporting Animals and ''Magnolia''", addressing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lorencoleman.com/books-by-loren-coleman/ |title=Books by Loren Coleman |publisher=The Cryptozoologist : Loren Coleman   |date=2012 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter discusses how one of Fort's books is visible on the table in the library and the film's end credit thanking Charles Fort.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=Loren | title=Mysterious America: The Ultimate Guide to the Nation's Weirdest Wonders, Strangest Spots, and Creepiest Creatures | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only character who seems to be unsurprised by the falling frogs is Stanley. He calmly observes the event, saying, "This happens. This is something that happens." This has led to the speculation that Stanley is a [[prophet]], [[Allegory|allegorically]] akin to [[Moses]], and that the "[[slavery]]" the film alludes to is the exploitation of children by adults.&lt;ref name="hipps"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hipps | first=Shane | title=''Magnolia'': The Exodus for Kids | publisher=Metaphilm | date=May 9, 2003 | url=http://metaphilm.com/philm.php?id=96_0_2_0 | accessdate=January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "father issues" persist throughout the film, as seen in the abuse and neglect of Claudia, Frank, Donnie, Stanley, and Dixon.&lt;ref name="pta"&gt;{{cite book | last=Anderson | first=Paul Thomas | title=The Paul Thomas Anderson Shooting Script Set: ''Magnolia'' and ''Punch-Drunk Love'' | publisher=[[Newmarket Press]] | date=January 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The [[DVD]] release includes a lengthy behind-the-scenes [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''That Moment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lussier|first1=Germain|title=Watch: 'That Moment,' A 72 Minute Documentary on P.T. Anderson's 'Magnolia'|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/72-minute-magnolia-documentary/|website=[[/Film]]|accessdate=July 3, 2016|date=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a [[Fly on the wall|fly-on-the-wall]] approach to cover nearly every aspect of production, from [[production management]] and scheduling to music direction to [[special effect]]s. The behind-the-scenes documentary is an in-depth look into Anderson's motivation and directing style. Pre-production included a screening of the film ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'' (1976), as well as ''[[Ordinary People]]'' (1980). Several scenes showed Anderson at odds with the child actors and [[Child labour|labor laws]] that restrict their work time. The character of Dixon has further scenes filmed but, from Anderson's reactions, appear not to be working. These scenes were cut completely and have never been shown on DVD.

'''Manang''', also called '''Manangba''', '''Manange''', '''Manang Ke''', '''Nyishang''', '''Nyishangte''', and '''Nyishangba''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken in [[Nepal]]. Native speakers refer to the language as ''ŋyeshaŋ'', meaning 'our language'.&lt;ref name=Grammar&gt;Kristine A. Hildebrant. 2004.[http://www.siue.edu/~khildeb/Manange_Grammar.pdf "A Grammar and Dictionary of the Manange Language"] in Tibeto-Burman Languages of Nepal: Manange and Sherpa, edited by [[Carol Genetti]]. 2-189. Canberra:Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of half a dozen languages in the [[Tamangic languages|Tamangic]] branch of the Sino-Tibetan family. Manang and its most closely related languages are often written as TGTM in literature, referring to [[Tamang]], [[Gurung]], [[Thakali language|Thakali]], and Manangba, due to the high degree of similarity in the linguistic characteristics of the languages.&lt;ref name= "tone"&gt;Martine Mazaudon. 1978. [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/227328/kailash_06_03_01.pdf?sequence=2 "Consonantal Mutation and Tonal Split in the Tamang Sub-Family of Tibeto-Burman."] Kailash. 6:157-179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The language is unwritten and almost solely spoken within the [[Manang District]], leading it to be classified as threatened, with the number of speakers continuing to decline. Suspected reasons for the decline include parents not passing down the language to their children, in order to allow for what they see as more advanced communication with other groups of people, and thus gain more opportunities. Due to the proximity of the district to [[Tibet]], as well as various globally widespread languages being introduced into the area, use of the native language is declining in favor of new languages, which are perceived to aid in the advancement of the people and region.&lt;ref name= "loanwords"&gt;Martin Haspelmath, Uri Tadmor, and Kristine A. Hildebrandt. 2009. 'Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook.' De Gruyter Mouton: Berlin. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
In the Manang Languages Project,&lt;ref&gt;https://mananglanguages.isg.siue.edu/atlas/&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrandt, et al. list four varieties of Manang.
*Manang
*Nar-Phu
*Gyasumdo
*Nyeshangte

==Classification==
The classification system of the language often varies throughout the literature, and multiple terms are often used to describe the same language family. The Tamangic branch is referenced as Western Bodish by some scholars. Although the existence of the Sino-Tibetan family is agreed upon, it is here that the breakdown can vary. Whereas some refer to the next subfamily as simply Tamangic, others have a slightly longer classification system. In this, Sino-Tibetan (or [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]) is broken down into Northeastern India, Western, Southeastern, and Northeastern. The Western group further breaks down into Bodic and Himalayan, each of which has its own subgroups, with Western Bodish being one of the four Bodic subgroups.&lt;ref name= "Bodish"&gt;David Bradley. 1997. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/bradley1997tibeto-burman.pdf "Tibeto-Burman Languages and Classification."] In Papers in South East Asian Linguistics: Tibeto-Burman Languages of the Himalayas. 14:1-72. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
There are 29 consonants in Manang, which are summarized in the table below. The contrastive status of the consonants in parentheses is questionable, as they are rare idiosyncratic in distribution.&lt;ref name="Grammar" /&gt;

=== Vowels ===
There are six oral vowels and five nasalized vowels, which contrast with the oral vowels. Length is emergent and not phonemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrandt|first=Kristine|date=2005|title=A Phonetic Analysis of Manange Segmental and Suprasegmental Properties|url=http://stedt.berkeley.edu/ltba/tocs.html|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tone ===
Manangba, along with the related Tamangic languages, is semi-tonal and reliant on the pitch of the speaker. There are four distinct tones in the TGTM sub-family, each of which differs by the overall pitch, as well as how breathy the sound is. Using a rating of 1 to 5, which correlates to low to high pitch respectively, the beginning and ending sound of every [[monosyllabic]] Manang word can be rated in order to determine whether the speaker increases or decreases the pitch, as well as breathiness. Of the four tones, the first stays consistently mid-level throughout the entire word, whereas the second tonal type starts at a 4 and increases in pitch to a 5. The third and fourth types decrease from the start to finish of the word, although tone-3 is higher pitched overall. The four tone classification is used for every related language, although the exact pitch levels can vary between them. For example, tone-3 in Manang is high pitched and clear, as discussed above, while tone-3 of Gurung is low and breathy.&lt;ref name="tone" /&gt; Essentially, every one of these languages has four potential tones in their words, but the exact pitch and clarity of each varies between languages. Words can have the same basic pronunciation, with the only difference being the pitch, making it possible to misinterpret words that have drastically different meanings. It is believed that a two toned system may have created the original makeup of these languages, although the original tones used are still unclear.&lt;ref name="Martine"&gt;Martine Mazaudon. 2005.[http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/13/94/89/PDF/Mazaudon_TokyoToneSymposium2004.pdf "On Tone in Tamang and Neighbouring Languages: Synchrony and Diachrony".] Proceedings of the Symposium Cross Linguistic Studies of Tonal Phenomenon. 79-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllables===
The structure of syllables is represented as (C1)(C2)V(C3), with C1-3 corresponding to three consonants, and the V representing the vowel.&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;Isao Honda. 2002. [http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/seke_phonology_-_a_comparative_study_of_three_seke_dialects.pdf "Seke Phonology: A Comparative Study of Three Seke Dialects".] Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area. 25:191-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Native speakers tend to agree that the most emphasis is placed on the first syllable of a word. Vowels present in the first syllable of words are held slightly longer than if located later in the word. However, from the minimal field research carried out, there is often not a distinguishable difference between syllable emphasis, and exceptions are also present. Terms that are exceptions often show stress on the last syllable, have vowels held longer on the second syllable, or both.&lt;ref name="Grammar" /&gt; Examples of exceptions include the Manang words for 'enemy', 'insect', 'forehead', 'button', 'graveyard', and 'leg'.

==Nouns==
Nouns do not identify gender, or whether something is inanimate or alive. Rather, there are completely separate words to identify men from women, and girls from boys. The most common way of making nouns plural is by adding ''tse'' to the end. As with English, there are some exceptions, and the entire form of the word may change rather than having an ending attached. The structure of [[compound nouns]] varies. One interesting compound structural type is where the leftmost word gives additional meaning to the word on the right. For example, the word ''phémwi'' meaning 'coin', breaks down into ''phe'' meaning 'metal' and ''mwi'' meaning 'money'.&lt;ref name="Grammar" /&gt; The money is being described as metallic, making it known that the currency is in coin form rather than a paper bill.

==Status==
The status of this language is currently rated as a 6b according to the [[Ethnologue]] rating system, classifying it as threatened.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; While the language is able to be spoken by older generations, and continuing to be passed onto newer ones, the rate at which it is being taught is sharply declining. The Nepalese Revolution of 1990 allowed for more freedom of languages, so identifying with a native ancestral language was of great importance to many. In reality however, fewer people actually spoke the languages they claimed to, leading to exaggerated speaker numbers being listed.&lt;ref name="dialects" /&gt;  Despite the relatively small number of speakers, allowing the language to die out entirely will be detrimental to the world as a whole. Even the least spoken languages hold stories, traditions, and potentially useful knowledge of the world, which will be lost if the language is gone. The endangered status of Manang means that researchers should attempt to collect as much detailed documentation and audio recordings now, before the language is potentially lost.

'''Marte Meo''' ([[Latin]] ''"by own power"'') is a method of [[educational counselling]].

It was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by the Dutch educational counsellor ''Maria Aarts''. She recognised the difficulties in explaining scientific observations of a child's problems to parents and other educators, as they are often unable to relate to the [[pedagogy|pedagogic]] jargon and identify the relevance of these insights in everyday-life situations.

She developed a method where normal situations between child and educator were recorded by [[video]] and later watched by the parents or other educators to enable discussion together. By this, strengths and weaknesses of both children and educators in their interaction should be more easily recognised, which in turn aims at helping both to gain the optimism and power to solve educational issues themselves. Enhanced communication becomes the most important instrument in achieving this.

After having practiced Marte Meo for many years, Maria Aarts founded the ''Marte Meo'' organisation in 1987, which aimed at teaching educational counsellors how to apply the Marte Meo method.

Marte Meo has attracted significant attention not only in the [[Netherlands]], but also in [[Scandinavia]], [[France]], [[Ireland]] and [[India]] where it is practiced. In these countries, it is often regarded as effective, cheap and pragmatic, which is opposite the viewpoint held by the therapeutic community in the United States, where the method is regarded as too time consuming considering that there are other alternatives in such situations&lt;ref name="DSS"&gt;[http://www.orcas.bc.ca/An%20Exploration%20of%20the%20Value%20of%20Marte%20Meo%20Therapy.pdf An Exploration of the Value of Marte Meo Therapy in Establish, Re-establishing and supporting Attachment Relationships Between Caregivers and their Children], By Geraldine Maughan, Department of Social Studies, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AXBERG, U., HANSSON, K., BROBERG, A.

'''"Midlife Crisis"''' is a song by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Faith No More]]. It was released on May 26, 1992 as the first single from their fourth album, ''[[Angel Dust (Faith No More album)|Angel Dust]]''. It became their sole number-one hit on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.

==Music and lyrics==
"Midlife Crisis" is an [[alternative metal]]&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rock.about.com/od/reviews/fr/AngelDust.htm | title=Faith No More - 'Angel Dust' Review | publisher=[[About.com]] | accessdate=December 29, 2014 | author=Grierson, Tim | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007140114/http://rock.about.com/od/reviews/fr/AngelDust.htm | archivedate=October 7, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="treble" /&gt; and [[funk metal]]&lt;ref name="treble"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.treblezine.com/10-essential-alternative-metal-singles/ | title=10 Essential Alternative Metal Singles | publisher=Treblezine | date=October 3, 2012 | accessdate=November 14, 2015 | author=Terich, Jeff and Adam Blyweiss}}&lt;/ref&gt; song, which incorporates [[progressive rock]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] elements.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Mike Patton has denied that the song is about having a [[midlife crisis]], as he did not know what one would feel like, but says that "it's more about creating false emotion, being emotional, dwelling on your emotions and in a sense inventing them"&lt;ref name="songs"&gt;[http://old.fnm.com/faq/#30 Q30 on the FAQ] on the [[Faith No More]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and that: {{quote|The song is based on a lot of observation and a lot of speculation. But in sort of a pointed way it's kind of about [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]... I think it was a particular time where I was being bombarded with her image on TV and in magazines and her whole shtick kind of speaks to me in that way... like she's going through some sort of problem. It seems she's getting a bit desperate.&lt;ref name="songs" /&gt;}}

==Production==
During production the song was given the [[working title]] of "Madonna"&lt;ref&gt;The Making of Angel Dust. [[MTV]]. Retrieved February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later maintained as a [[setlist]] name during live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.fnm.com/faq/#32|title=Faith No More FAQ, Q32|publisher=FNM.com|accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drum track for the song contains a sample of the first bar of the song "[[Cecilia (Simon &amp; Garfunkel song)|Cecilia]]", as performed by [[Simon and Garfunkel]], repeated throughout.{{audio|Simon &amp; Garfunkel&amp;nbsp;– "Cecilia" Intro.ogg |sample}}&lt;ref name="sample"&gt;[http://old.fnm.com/faq/#40 Q40 on the FAQ] on the [[Faith No More]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  The bridge features a sample of "[[Car Thief]]" by the [[Beastie Boys]].

==Music video==
The video for this song was directed by [[Kevin Kerslake]], who also directed their shoestring video for the song "[[Everything's Ruined]]". The version on the ''[[Who Cares a Lot?: Greatest Videos]]'' collection is uncensored and contains shots during the bridge which show a man being stretched by four horses (alluding to an old punishment for [[regicide]], known as "[[hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]]") – the censored version uses additional shots of choirboys running to a large cross instead. Singer [[Mike Patton]] can also be seen dancing around holding a [[spade]].

For the video, the sound mix of this song is slightly different than the album version (on certain promotional releases it is referred to as 'The Scream Mix').  For the DVD re-release of ''[[Live At The Brixton Academy, London: You Fat Bastards/Who Cares A Lot?: The Greatest Videos|Who Cares a Lot?: Greatest Videos]]'', the album version of the song is used instead, with the accommodating edits made.

==Appearances and covers==
"Midlife Crisis" has featured on the soundtrack for the videogames ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' on the fictional radio station [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas_soundtrack#Radio_X|Radio X]]. It is a master track song on ''[[Rock Band 3]]'', with the fade-out ending edited for gameplay reasons.

The song has been covered on [[industrial metal]] band [[Bile (band)|Bile]]'s 2002 album ''[[The Copy Machine]]''. It was covered by American rock band [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] twice: the first time for a Faith No More tribute album, which was instead released through the Internet; the second time as a [[B-side]] to their fourth studio album ''[[Indestructible (Disturbed album)|Indestructible]]''. This re-recorded version was released on ''[[Covered, A Revolution in Sound]]'' and re-mastered for a third release on their B-side collection album ''[[The Lost Children (album)|The Lost Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET &amp;ndash; MASTODON, DISTURBED Featured On 'Covered, A Revolution In Sound'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mastodon-disturbed-featured-on-covered-a-revolution-in-sound/|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|date=January 13, 2009|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Midsummer''' is the period of time centered upon the [[summer solstice]], and more specifically the northern European celebrations that accompany the actual solstice or take place on a day between June 19 and June 25 and the preceding evening. The exact dates vary between different cultures. The undivided [[Christian Church]] designated June 24 as the [[feast day]] of the [[early Christian]] martyr [[John the Baptist|St John the Baptist]], and the observance of St John's Day begins the evening before, known as [[St John's Eve]].

These are commemorated by many [[Christian denomination]]s, such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Lutheran Church]]es, and [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref name="TIFCF2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrill|first=Ann|title=Thanksgiving and Other Harvest Festivals|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=1438127979|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sweden]] the Midsummer is such an important festivity that there have been serious discussions to make the Midsummer's Eve into the [[National Day of Sweden]], instead of June 6. It may also be referred to as St. Hans Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danishmuseum.org/santk-hans-aften.cfm Santk Hans Aften, The Danish Immigrant Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint John's Day, the feast day of [[Saint John the Baptist]], was established by the undivided Christian Church in the 4th century AD, in honour of the birth of the Saint John the Baptist, which the [[Gospel of Luke]] records as being sixth months before [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].&lt;ref name="FleterenSchnaubelt2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleteren|first1=Frederick Van|last2=Schnaubelt|first2=Joseph C.|title=Augustine: Biblical Exegete|year=2001|publisher=Peter Lang|language=English|isbn=9780820422923|page=197|quote=The cult of John the Baptist began to develop in the first half of the fourth century.

{{quotation|By the sixth century, this solar cycle was completed by balancing Christ's conception and birth against the conception and birth of his count, John the Baptist. Such a relationship between Christ and his cousin was amply justified by the imagery of scripture. The Baptist was conceived sixth months before Christ and his cousin as amply justified by the imagery of scripture. The Baptist was conceived six months before Christ (Luke 1:76); he was not himself the light, but was to give testimony concerning the light (John 1:8–9). Thus John's conception was celebrated on the eighth kalends of October (24 September: near the autumn equinox) and his birth on the eighth kalends of July (24 June: near the Summer solstice). If Christ's conception and birth took place on the 'growing days', it was fitting that John the Baptist's should take place on the 'lessening days' ('diebus decrescentibus'), for the Baptist himself had proclaimed that 'he must increase; but I must decrease' (John 3:30). By the late sixth century, the Nativity of John the Baptist (24 June) had become an important feast, counterbalancing at midsummer the midwinter feast of Christmas. —Professor Éamonn Ó Carragáin, [[University College Cork]]}}
Within [[Christian theology]], this carries significance as John the Baptist "was understood to be preparing the way for Jesus", with {{Bibleverse|John|3:30|KJV}} stating "He must increase, but I must decrease"; this is [[Christian symbol|symbolized]] in the fact that the "sun begins to diminish at the summer solstice and eventually increases at the winter solstice."&lt;ref name="Yeats2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeats|first=William Butler|title=A Vision: The Revised 1937 Edition: The Collected Works of W.B.

John's day comes at the time when the sun is beginning to decrease, and six months later, Christmas, comes at the time when the sun is beginning to increase.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century AD, several churches were dedicated in the honour of Saint John the Baptist and a [[Vigil#Eves of religious celebrations|vigil]], [[Saint John's Eve]], was added to the feast day of Saint John the Baptist and Christian priests held three [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] in churches for the celebration.&lt;ref name="Birmingham1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Birmingham|first=Mary|title=Word and Worship Workbook for Year B: For Ministry in Initiation, Preaching, Religious Education|year=1999|publisher=Paulist Press|language=English |isbn=9780809138982|page=790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Florence]], medieval midsummer celebrations were "an occasion for dramatic representations of the Baptist's life and death" and "the feast day was marked by processions, banquets, and plays, culminating in a fireworks show that the entire city attended."&lt;ref name="Tornabuoni2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tornabuoni|first=Lucrezia|title=Sacred Narratives|year=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|language=English|isbn=9780226808529|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] states that the "lighting of festive fires upon St. John's Eve is first recorded as a popular custom by [[Jean Beleth]]us, a theologian at the University of Paris, in the early twelfth century".&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780198205708|pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In England, the earliest reference to this custom occurs on in the 13th century AD,&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt; in the ''Liber Memorandum'' of the [[Church of England parish church|parish church]] at Barnwell in the [[Nene Valley]], which stated that parish youth would gather on the day to sing songs and play games.&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt; A Christian monk of [[Lilleshall Abbey]], in the same century, wrote:&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt;
{{quote|In the worship of St John, men waken at even, and maken three manner of fires: one is clean bones and no wood, and is called a bonfire; another is of clean wood and no bones, and is called a wakefire, for men sitteth and wake by it; the third is made of bones and wood, and is called St John's Fire.&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt;}}
The 13th-century monk of [[Winchcomb]], Gloucestershire, who compiled a book of sermons for Christian feast days, recorded how [[St. John's Eve]] was celebrated in his time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us speak of the revels which are accustomed to be made on St. John's Eve, of which there are three kinds. On St. John's Eve in certain regions the boys collect bones and certain other rubbish, and burn them, and therefrom a smoke is produced on the air. They also make brands and go about the fields with the brands. Thirdly, the wheel which they roll.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]] Harleian Mss 2345, edited by J. Kemble, ''The Seasons in England'', vol. I:361, quoted in [[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991:369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Saint John's Fires, explained the monk of Winchcombe, were to drive away [[dragon]]s, which were abroad on St. John's Eve, poisoning springs and wells. The wheel that was rolled downhill he gave its explanation: "The wheel is rolled to signify that the sun then rises to the highest point of its circle and at once turns back; thence it comes that the wheel is rolled."&lt;ref&gt;Homans 1991:370.&lt;/ref&gt;

On St John's Day 1333 [[Petrarch]] watched women at [[Cologne]] rinsing their hands and arms in the [[Rhine]] "so that the threatening calamities of the coming year might be washed away by bathing in the river."&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''Epistolae familiares'', Aachen,21 June 1333, noted by [[Simon Schama]], ''Landscape and Memory'' 1995:265.&lt;/ref&gt; 15th-century diarist [[Goro Dati]], described the celebration of Saint John's Day at Midsummer in Italy as being one in which guilds prepared their workshops with fine displays, and one in which solemn church processions took place, with men dressed in the costumes of Christian saints and angels.&lt;ref name="Dean2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Trevor|title=The Towns of Italy in the Later Middle Ages|date=5 August 2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719052040|page=72|quote=When springtime comes ... every Florentine begins to think of making a fine day of the feast of St John, which falls in mid-summer, and everyone in good time supplies themselves with garments, decorations and jewels. ...

As many cloths of gold and silk are displayed as would adorn ten kingdoms, and as many gold and silver jewels, rich hangings, painted panels and marvellous carvings, and things pertaining to feats of arms ... Then at around the hour of terce, a solemn procession is made by all the clerics, priests, monks and friars ... with so many relics of saints, that it is a thing of immeasurable devotion ... With them are many companies of secular men ... dressed as angels, sounding musical instruments of many sorts, singing marvellously, and enacting the stories of those saints that each company honours.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century AD, the historian [[John Stow]], described the celebration of Midsummer:&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt;
{{quote|the wealthier sort also before their doors near to the said bonfires would set out tables on the vigils furnished with sweet bread and good drink, and on the festival days with meats and drinks plentifully, whereunto they would invite their neighbours and passengers also to sit, and to be merry with them in great familiarity, praising God for his benefits bestowed on them. These were called bonfires as well of good amity amongst neighbours that, being before at controversy, were there by the labour of others reconciled, and made of bitter enemies, loving friends, as also for the birtue that a great fire hat to purge the infection of the air. On the vigil of St John Baptist and St Peter and Paul the Apostles, every man's door being shadowed with green birch, long fennel, St John's Wort, Orpin, white lillies and such like, garnished upon with garlands of beautiful flowers, had also lamps of glass, with oil burinin in them all night, some hung branches of iron curiously wrought, containing hundreds of lamps lit at once, which made goodly show.&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt;}}

These fires are commonly called Saint John's Fires in various languages. Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] states that the "lighting of festive fires upon St. John's Eve is first recorded as a popular custom by [[Jean Beleth]]us, a theologian at the University of Paris, in the early twelfth century".&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt; In England, the earliest reference to this custom occurs on in the 13th century A.D.,&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt; in the ''Liber Memorandum'' of the [[Church of England parish church|parish church]] at Barnwell in the [[Nene Valley]], which stated that parish youth would gather on the day to sing songs and play games.&lt;ref name="Hutton1996"/&gt; and served to repel [[Christian views on witchcraft|witches]] and [[unclean spirit|evil spirits]].&lt;ref name="Dahlig2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlig|first=Piotr|title=Traditional Musical Cultures in Central-Eastern Europe: Ecclesiastical and Folk Transmission|year=2009|publisher=Dahlig|language=English |isbn=9788389101860|page=68|quote=The dangers posed to humans by demons require specific rituals, aimed at identifying witches and putting them to death.

Midsummer/Saint John's Day-related traditions, church services, and celebrations are particularly important in northern Europe – Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – but is also very strongly observed in Poland, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Netherlands, Flanders, Ireland, parts of the United Kingdom ([[Cornwall]] especially), France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine, other parts of Europe, and elsewhere – such as Canada, the United States, Puerto Rico, and also in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] (mostly in Brazil, Argentina and Australia).&lt;ref name="LapointeTessier1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lapointe|first1=Richard|last2=Tessier|first2=Lucille|title=The Francophones of Saskatchewan: a history|year=1988|publisher=Campion College, University of Regina|language=English|isbn=9780969265825|page=189|quote=The feast of Saint John the Baptist on June 24 was observed in all of Quebec with religious services, patriotic speeches, parades and floats. The movement soon spread to Ontario, the New England states, and even to Chicago and the distant state of Oregon. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society was the largest secular Franco-Catholic institution in North America. French Canadians in Saskatchewan also celebrated their patron saint's feast day. In Battleford, they seem to have begun to mark the occasion before 1885. It is known definitely that in May 1890 a meeting was held to revive the local Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, inactive since the Batoche uprising. The festivities on June 24 of that year began with a Mass celebrated at an altar on which stood a statue of Saint John the Baptist with a beaver at his feet and a banner bearing the inscription "Faith – Nation – Unity."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Quebec]] (Canada), the traditional Midsummer day, June 24, is a [[public holiday]].

===Austria===
In Austria the midsummer solstice is celebrated each year with a spectacular procession of ships down the Danube River as it flows through the [[wine-growing Wachau Valley]] just north of Vienna. Up to 30 ships sail down the river in line as fireworks erupt from the banks and hill tops while bonfires blaze and the vineyards are lit up. Lighted castle ruins also erupt with fireworks during the 90-minute cruise downstream.

===Brazil===
Portuguese St. John's Day, brought to Brazil during colonial times, has become a popular event that is celebrated during a period that starts one week before St. Anthony's Day (June 12) and ends after St. Peter's Day (June 29). This nationwide festival, called "[[Festa Junina]]" (June Festival), or ''São João'', takes place during midwinter in most of the country.

Rural life is celebrated through typical clothing, food, and dance (particularly [[square dancing]], or ''quadrilha''). The ''quadrilha'' features couple formations around a mock wedding whose bride and groom are the central attraction of the dancing. A kind of [[maypole]] (called "pau-de-sebo") is also raised and used in some festivities. It's prepared a typical hot drink called "quentão" (very hot) that consists in a mix of fruits and spices with a lacing of Cachaça. On St. John's Day eve celebration, it's sometimes placed a ritual of walking on live-coal made of the remnants of the main bonfire, which is a traditional part of the party, on barefoot by midnight. It's believed that if the one who walks is strong in faith, he shall not be hurt.

Two northeastern towns in particular have competed with each other for the title of "Biggest Saint John Festival in the World", namely [[Caruaru]] (in the state of [[Pernambuco]]), and [[Campina Grande]], in [[Paraíba]]. The festivities also coincide with the corn harvest, dishes served during this period are commonly made with corn, such as [[canjica]] and [[pamonha]]; dishes also include boiled or baked vegetable corn (often buttered), sausages, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and numerous sweet dishes such as rice pudding. The celebrations are very colorful and festive and include the use of [[fireworks]] and [[bonfires]].

===Bulgaria===
[[File:Nestinar.bulgari.jpg|thumbnail|right|A firewalking ritual in Bulgaria]]
On Midsummer day Bulgarians celebrate the so-called Enyovden. On the same day the [[Eastern Orthodox]] church celebrates the day of [[John the Baptist]] and the rites and traditions of both holidays are often mixed. A fire-related ritual may also be performed in Bulgaria on that day; it involves barefoot dance on smoldering embers and is called [[Nestinarstvo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDermott|first1=Mercia|title=Bulgarian Folk Customs|date=1998|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London; Philadelphia, NJ|isbn=978-1-85302-485-6|page=227|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gh4IE6toGJMC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=enyovden+nestinarstvo|accessdate=7 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian folklore states the beginning of summer starts on Enyovden. It is thought that in the morning of Enyovden, when the sun rises, it "winks’ and "plays". Anyone seeing the sunrise will be healthy throughout the year. It is believed that on Enyovden a variety of herbs have the greatest healing power, and that this is especially true at sunrise. Therefore, they have to be picked early in the morning before dawn. Women – sorceresses and enchantresses – go to gather herbs by themselves to cure and make charms. The herbs gathered for the winter must be 77 and a half – for all diseases and for the nameless disease.

===Canada===
{{See also|National Holiday (Quebec)}}
In [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], St. John's Day is observed on the Monday nearest June 24 and commemorates [[John Cabot]]'s discovery of Newfoundland in 1497. In [[Quebec]], the celebration of June 24 was brought to [[New France]] by the first French colonists. Great fires were lit at night. According to the ''[[Jesuit Relations]]'', the first celebrations of St John's Day in New France took place around 1638. In 1834, [[Ludger Duvernay]], printer and editor of ''[[La Minerve]]'' took the leadership of an effort to make June 24 the national holiday of the ''Canadiens'' ([[French Canadians]]). In 1908, Pope [[Pius X]] designated [[John the Baptist]] as the patron saint of the French-Canadians. In 1925, June 24 became a legal holiday in Quebec and in 1977, it became the secular [[Fête nationale du Québec|National Holiday of Quebec]]. It still is the tradition to light great fires on the night of the 24th of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fontaine |first1=Myriam et al |title=Fête nationale du Québec (Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day) |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/la-fete-nationale-du-quebec-saint-jean-baptiste-day |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], the solstitial celebration is called ''sankthans'' or ''sankthansaften'' ("St. John's Eve"). It was an official holiday until 1770, and in accordance with the Danish tradition of celebrating a holiday on the evening before the actual day, it takes place on the evening of 23 June. It is the day where the medieval wise men and women (the doctors of that time) would gather special herbs that they needed for the rest of the year to cure people.

Bonfires on the beach, speeches, picnics and songs are traditional, although they are built in many other places where beaches may not be close by (i.e. on the shores of lakes and other waterways, parks, etc.)  Bonfires are lit in order to repel witches and other [[evil spirit]]s,&lt;ref name="Dahlig2009"/&gt; with the burnings sending the "witch" away to Bloksbjerg, the [[Brocken]] mountain in the [[Harz]] region of [[Germany]] where the great witch gathering was thought to be held on this day.

On Saint John's Eve and Saint John's Day, churches arrange Saint John's worship services and [[family reunion]]s also occur, which are an occasion for drinking and eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/traditions|title=Traditions in Denmark|year=2018|publisher=Government of Denmark|language=English|accessdate=26 March 2018|quote=Many Danish traditions are based around the Christian calendar, with Christmas, Easter and St. John’s Eve (at the end of June) being some of the most important and typically spent together with family.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranchurch.dk/liturgy-and-worship/festivals-and-traditions/saint-johns-eve/|title=Saint John's Eve|year=2018|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark]]|language=English|accessdate=28 March 2018|quote=In recent years, a number of churches have re-established the tradition of holding a service on Saint John's Eve.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, [[Holger Drachmann]] wrote a ''midsommervise'' (Midsummer hymn) called ''"Vi elsker vort land..."'' ("We Love Our Country") with a melody composed by P.E. Lange-Müller that is sung at every bonfire on this evening.

===Estonia===
"[[Jaanipäev]]" ("Jaan's Day" in English) was celebrated long before the arrival of Christianity in [[Estonia]], although the day was given its name by the crusaders. The day is still known by its many names as: leedopäev, suvine pööripäiv, suvepööripäev, püäripääv, päevakäänak, päiväkäänäk, päiväkäändjäne, päevapesa, pesapäev and suured päevad. The arrival of Christianity, however, did not end pagan beliefs and fertility rituals surrounding this holiday. In 1578, [[Balthasar Russow]] wrote in his Livonian Chronicle about [[Estonians]] who placed more importance on the festival than going to church. He complained about those who went to church, but did not enter, and instead spent their time lighting bonfires, drinking, dancing, singing and following pagan rituals. Midsummer marks a change in the farming year, specifically the break between the completion of spring sowing and the hard work of summer hay-making.

Understandably, some of the rituals of Jaanipäev have very strong folkloric roots. The best-known Jaanik, or midsummer, ritual is the lighting of the bonfire and jumping over it. This is seen as a way of guaranteeing prosperity and avoiding bad luck. Likewise, to not light the fire is to invite the destruction of your house by fire. The fire also frightened away mischievous spirits who avoided it at all costs, thus ensuring a good harvest. So, the bigger the fire, the further the mischievous spirits stayed away.

Estonians celebrate "[[Jaaniõhtu]]" on the eve of the Summer Solstice (June 23) with bonfires. On the islands of [[Saaremaa]] and [[Hiiumaa]], old fishing boats may be burned in the large pyres set ablaze. On Jaaniõhtu, Estonians all around the country will gather with their families, or at larger events to celebrate this important day with singing and dancing, as Estonians have done for centuries. The celebrations that accompany Jaaniõhtu carry on usually through the night, they are the largest and most important of the year, and the traditions are almost identical to Finland (read under Finland) and similar to neighbors Latvia and Sweden (read under Sweden).

Jaanipäev is usually spent in a summer cottage, where people light bonfires, or at a festival, such as [[Pühajärve Jaanituli]] in [[Otepää]].

Since 1934,  June 23 is also national [[Victory Day (Estonia)|Victory Day]] of Estonia and both 23rd and 24th are holidays and [[flag day]]s. The [[Estonian flag]] is not lowered in the night between these two days.

===Faroe Islands===
On the [[Faroe Islands]], St. John's Eve (''jóansøka'') is generally not celebrated. However, on the southernmost island of [[Suðuroy]] it is observed by lighting a bonfire. Only one bonfire is lit on the island as one of the two biggest towns hosts the celebration alternately every other year.

===Finland===

[[File:Seurasaari-2005-johannus2.jpg|thumb|Midsummer bonfire in [[Seurasaari]].
Bonfires are very common in Finland, where many people spend their midsummer in the countryside outside towns.]]
The summer solstice was called ''Ukon juhla'' ("Ukko's celebration") after the Finnish god [[Ukko]]. After the celebrations were [[Christianized]], the holiday became known as ''juhannus'' after John the Baptist (Finnish: ''Johannes Kastaja'').

Since 1955, the holiday has always been on a Saturday (between June 20 and June 26). Earlier it was always on June 24. Many of the celebrations of midsummer take place on Friday, midsummer eve, when many workplaces are closed and shops may close their doors at noon.

In the Finnish midsummer celebration, bonfires (Finnish ''kokko'') are very common and are burned at lakesides and by the sea.&lt;ref name="birt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/kokko.htm |title=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura: Juhannuskokko |publisher=Finlit.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212031052/http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/kokko.htm |archivedate=2012-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often branches from birch trees (''koivu'') are placed on both side of the front door to welcome visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/koriste.htm |title=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura: Koivunoksia ja maitoruokia |publisher=Finlit.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212031056/http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/koriste.htm |archivedate=2012-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swedish-speaking Finns]] often celebrate by erecting a midsummer or [[maypole]] (Swedish ''midsommarstång'', ''majstång'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/salko.htm |title=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura: Juhannussalko |publisher=Finlit.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527002503/http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/salko.htm |archivedate=2012-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Finland Swedes call the holiday ''Johannes'' after the Finnish term ''juhannus'' – or more accurately after the Biblical John the Baptist  (="Johannes Döparen" in Swedish).

In [[folk magic]], midsummer was a very potent night and the time for many small rituals, mostly for young maidens seeking suitors and fertility. [[Will-o'-the-wisp]]s were believed to appear at midsummer night, particularly to finders of the mythical "[[Fern flower|fern in bloom]]" and possessors of the "fern seed", marking a treasure. In the old days, maidens would use special charms and bend over a well, naked, in order to see their future husband's reflection. In another tradition that continues still today, an unmarried woman collects seven different flowers and places them under her pillow to dream of her future husband.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Russell. (2014-06-16) [http://finland.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=278702&amp;nodeid=37598&amp;culture=en-US Enjoying Midsummer the Finnish way – thisisFINLAND]. Finland.fi. Retrieved on 2014-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of the midsummer in Finland is the white night and the [[midnight sun]]. Because of Finland's location around the [[Arctic Circle]] the nights near the midsummer day are short or non-existent. This gives a great contrast to the darkness of the winter time. The temperature can vary between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and +30&amp;nbsp;°C, with an average of about 20&amp;nbsp;°C in the South.

Many Finns leave the cities for Midsummer and spend time in the countryside. Nowadays many spend at least a few days there, and some Finns take their whole vacation at a summer cottage. Traditions include bonfires, cookouts, sauna and spending time together with friends or family. Heavy drinking is also associated with the Finnish midsummer.&lt;ref name="perinne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/perinne.htm |title=Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura: Juhannus, miksi ja milloin? |publisher=Finlit.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212031033/http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/juhlat/juhannus/perinne.htm |archivedate=2012-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many music festivals of all sizes are organized on the Midsummer weekend. It is also common to start summer vacation on Midsummer day. For many families Midsummer is the time when they move to the countryside to their summer cottage by the sea or lake. Midsummer is also a [[Flag days in Finland|Finnish Flag Day]] where the flag is hoisted at 6 pm on Midsummer's Eve and flown throughout the night until 9 pm the next evening; this is an exception to the normal flag day rule of flying the flag from 8 am to sundown.&lt;ref name="perinne" /&gt;  [[Finnish Canadian]]s in the [[New Finland, Saskatchewan|New Finland]] district, Saskatchewan, Canada celebrate Juhannus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===France===
In France, the {{lang|fr|Fête de Saint-Jean}} (feast of St John), traditionally celebrated with bonfires ({{lang|fr|le feu de Saint-Jean}}) that are reminiscent of Midsummer's pagan rituals, is a Catholic festivity in celebration of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]]. It takes place on June 24, on Midsummer day (St John's day). In certain French towns, a tall bonfire is built by the inhabitants in order to be lit on St John's Day. In the {{lang|fr|[[Vosges]]}} region and in the Southern part of {{lang|fr|[[Meurthe-et-Moselle]]}}, this huge bonfire is named {{lang|fr|chavande}}.

===Germany===
[[File:Johannisfeuer CC-BY-SA30 Use 20120623.jpg|thumb|Bonfire in Freiburg im Breisgau]]
The day of sun solstice is called {{lang|de|Sommersonnenwende}} in German. On June 20, 1653 the [[Nuremberg]] town council issued the following order: "Where experience herefore have shown, that after the old heathen use, on John's day in every year, in the country, as well in towns as villages, money and wood have been gathered by young folk, and there upon the so-called {{lang|de|sonnenwendt}} or ''zimmet fire'' kindled, and thereat winebibbing, dancing about the said fire, leaping over the same, with burning of sundry herbs and flowers, and setting of brands from the said fire in the fields, and in many other ways all manner of superstitious work carried on — Therefore the Hon. Council of Nürnberg town neither can nor ought to forbear to do away with all such unbecoming superstition, paganism, and peril of fire on this coming day of St. John."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Grimm |first = Jacob |publisher = George Bell &amp; Sons |year = 1883 |title = Teutonic Mythology, Volume 2 |page = 619 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vtE3AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA619&amp;ots=Xgfx_euesl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonfires are still a custom in many areas of Germany. People gather to watch the bonfire and celebrate solstice.

===Greece===
According to Eastern Orthodox tradition the eve of the day of the Nativity of John the Baptist is celebrated with festivals in many towns and villages, both in the mainland and in the Greek isles. Traditionally the midsummers celebration is called {{lang|el-Latn|Klidonas}} ({{lang|el|Κλήδονας}}) meaning sign or oracle, and was considered a time when unmarried girls would discover their potential mates through a ritual. It is also customary to this day to burn the Mayday wreaths that are used to decorate the doors of the houses for the previous two months, in large communal bonfires, accompanied by music, dancing and jumping over the flames. It takes place on May 30 and May 31.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeka.com/cyclades/naxos/naxos-festivals/klidonas-custom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
On June 21 Hungarians celebrate "Saint Ivan's Night" ({{lang|hu|Szentiván-éj}}) ({{lang|hu|Iván}} being derived from the Slavic form of Johannes/John, ''Ivan'', which may correspond to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] {{lang|hu|Jovános}}, {{lang|hu|Ivános}}, {{lang|hu|Iván}}). The whole month of June was once called the Month of St. Ivan until the 19th century. Setting fires is a folklore tradition this night. Girls jumped over it, while boys watched the spectacle.&lt;ref name="szentivánéj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fn.hu/magazin/20080620/szentivan_ej_magikus_ejszaka/ |title=Szent Iván éj |publisher=Fn.hu |date=|accessdate=2012-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most significant among the customs of the summer is lighting the fire of Midsummer Night ({{lang|hu|szentiváni tűzgyújtás}}) on the day of St. John (June 24), when the sun follows the highest course, when the nights are the shortest and the days the longest. The practice of venerating [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] developed in the Catholic Church during the 5th century, and at this time they put his name and day on June 24. The summer solstice was celebrated among most peoples, so the Hungarians may have known it even before the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]]. Although the Arab historian [[Ibn Rusta]] speaks of the Hungarians' fire worshipping, so far there is no data that could connect it to this day. In the Middle Ages it was primarily an ecclesiastical festivity, but from the 16th century on the sources recall it as a folk custom. The most important episode of the custom is the lighting of the fire.

The custom survived longest and in the most complete form in the northwestern part of the linguistic region, where as late as the 1930s they still lit a Midsummer Night fire. The way of arranging the participants by age and by sex has suggested the possibility that these groups sang by answering each other, but there are hardly any remnants that appear to support this possibility. People jumped over the fire after they lit it. This practice is mentioned as early as the 16th century, although at that time in connection with a wedding; still, it is called "Midsummer Night fire". The purpose of jumping over the fire is partly to purify, partly because they believed that those whose jump was very successful would get married during the following carnival.

===Iran===
[[Tiregān]] ({{lang-fa|تیرگان}}) is one of ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] festival coinciding with the mid summer festivals, another midsummer festival is Gilaki Bal Nowrooz which is held in the north of Iran.

Bal Nowrooz, meaning ‘the fire of Nowrooz’, is the name of a festival celebrated on the first day of ‘Our Nowrooz’ and this is the first day of Daylaman New Year.

Lighting the fire, thanking God for his blessings and crops, and praying for the peace of the souls of the dead were parts of this ancient Iranian tradition. This ceremony coincides with harvesting in Gilan.

On the first day of ‘Our Nowrooz’, the newly wed couples who have married in the past year, are given white horses to ride up to the foot of the mountain. As the brides and grooms reach the mountain foot, a yellow cow is set free, as a sign of happiness and abundance for the new couples.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amordaden.blogfa.com/post-536.aspx The New Year of 1583 (Gilani calendar) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Many towns and cities have 'Midsummer Carnivals' with [[fairs]], [[concerts]] and [[fireworks]] either on or on the weekend nearest to Midsummer. In rural spots particularly the northwest, bonfires are lit on hilltops. This tradition harks back to pagan times and is now associated with "St. John's Night". The [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Irish Environmental Protection Agency]], after much initial upset in the west of Ireland, has an exemption for the burning of fires outdoors during midsummer night.
Traditionally the longest day of the year in Ireland falls on June 21.

===Italy===
In [[Italy]] there is the San Giovanni's day (Saint John).

The feast of Saint John the Baptist has been celebrated in [[Florence]] from medieval times, and certainly in the Renaissance, with festivals sometimes lasting three days from 21 to 24 June. Such celebrations are held nowadays in [[Cesena]] from June 21 to 24, also with a special street market.
Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of [[Genoa]], [[Florence]] and [[Turin]] where a fireworks display take place during the celebration on the river. In [[Turin]] Saint John's cult was also diffused since medieval times when the city stops to work for two days and people from the surroundings come to dance around the bonfire in the central square. Nowadays Saint John is the patron saint of Genoa, Florence and Turin and he was celebrated on June 24 which is a city public holiday.

Italian neopagans usually celebrates the Mid Summer with rites, dances and festivals all around the country.

===Jersey===
In [[Jersey]] most of the former midsummer customs are largely ignored nowadays. The custom known as ''Les cônes d'la Saint Jean'' was observed as late as the 1970s – horns or conch shells were blown. Ringing the ''bachîn'' (a large brass preserving pan) at midsummer to frighten away evil spirits survived as a custom on some farms until the 1940s and has been revived as a folk performance in the 21st century.

===Latvia===
{{Main|Jāņi}}
In [[Latvia]], Midsummer is called ''Jāņi''  (plural of Latvian name Jānis, which is equivalent to John) or Līgo svētki (svētki = festival). It is a [[Holidays in Latvia|national holiday]] celebrated from the night of June 23 through June 24 on a large scale by almost everyone in Latvia and by people of Latvian origin abroad. Celebrations consist of a lot of traditional and mostly pagan elements – eating, [[Jāņi cheese]], drinking beer, baking pīrāgi, singing Latvian folk songs dedicated to Jāņi, burning bonfires to keep light all through the night and jumping over it, wearing wreaths of flowers (for women) and [[English oak|oak]] leaves (for men) together with modern commercial products and ideas. There are tens and hundreds of different beliefs and traditions all over Latvia on what should be done on that day for good harvest, for predicting the future, for attracting your future spouse etc. People decorate their houses and lands with [[birch]] or sometimes oak branches and flowers as well as leaves, especially [[fern]]. In rural areas livestock is also decorated. In modern days small oak branches with leaves are attached to the cars in Latvia during the festivity. Jāņi has been a strong aspect of Latvian culture throughout history, originating in pre-Christian Latvia as an ancient fertility cult.

In the western town of [[Kuldīga]], revellers mark the holiday by running naked through the town at three in the morning. The event has taken place since 2000. Runners are rewarded with beer, and police are on hand in case any "puritans" attempt to interfere with the naked run.&lt;ref name="Kuldiga"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=29&amp;art_id=nw20070620215922450C300346 |title=Latvian town to mark summer solstice with naked run |publisher=Iol.co.za |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuania===
{{See also|Saint Jonas' Festival}}
Midsummer is commonly called John's Day (''Joninės'') in Lithuania, and is also known as Saint Jonas' Festival, Rasos (Dew Holiday), Kupolė, Midsummer Day and St. John's Day. It is celebrated in the night from 23 June to 24 June and on 24 June. The traditions include singing songs and dancing until the sun sets, telling tales, searching to find the magic fern blossom at midnight, jumping over bonfires, greeting the rising midsummer sun and washing the face with a morning dew, young girls float flower wreaths on the water of river or lake. These are customs brought from pagan culture and beliefs. The latter Christian tradition is based on the reverence of Saint John. Lithuanians with the names Jonas, Jonė, Janina receive many greetings from their family, relatives and friends.

===Norway===
[[File:Jonsokbryllup 1924.jpg|thumb|left|Midsummer mock wedding of two children in Norway, c. 1924]]
[[File:Tønnebål.jpg|thumb|Traditional Norwegian St. Hansbål (bonfire) in [[Laksevåg]], [[Bergen]].]]
As in Denmark, ''Sankthansaften'' is celebrated on June 23 in [[Norway]]. The day is also called ''Jonsok'', which means "John's wake", important in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] times with [[pilgrimage]]s to churches and holy springs. For instance, up until 1840, there was a pilgrimage to the [[Røldal Stave Church]] in [[Røldal]] (southwest Norway) whose crucifix was said to have healing powers. Today, however, ''Sankthansaften'' is largely regarded as a [[secular]] or even pre-Christian event.

In most places, the main event is the burning of a large bonfire. In [[Western Norway]], a custom of arranging mock weddings, both between adults and between children, is still kept alive.&lt;ref&gt;Stig Persson (26 June 2009): [http://www.oblad.no/ski/stort-jonsokbryllup-i-barnehagen-1.3913207 Stort jonsokbryllup i barnehagen]{{no icon}} [[Østlandets Blad]], retrieved 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was meant to symbolize the blossoming of new life. Such weddings are known to have taken place in the 1800s, but the custom is believed to be older.

It is also said that, if a girl puts flowers under her pillow that night, she will dream of her future husband.

===Poland===
Especially in northern [[Poland]] – the Eastern Pomeranian and [[Kashubia]]n regions – midsummer is celebrated on June 23. People dress in traditional Polka dress, and girls throw wreaths made of flowers into the [[Baltic Sea]], and into lakes or rivers. The midsummer day celebration starts at about 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and lasts all night until sunrise. People celebrate this special day every year and call it ''Noc Świętojańska'' which means St. John's Night. On that day in big [[Poland|Polish]] cities (like [[Warsaw]] and [[Kraków]]) there are many organized events, the most popular event being in [[Kraków]], called the ''[[Wianki]],'' which means wreaths. In many parts of Poland the Summer solstice is celebrated as ''[[Kupala Night]]''.

===Portugal===
[[File:Festa de Sao Joao (Porto).jpg|thumb|St. John's festival in [[Porto]].]]
[[File:Tricana desfile nocturno.jpg|thumb|[[Tricana poveira|Tricana girl]] during a St. Peter's day rusga in [[Póvoa de Varzim]].]]
In Portugal, Midsummer festivities are included in what is known today as ''Santos Populares'' (Popular Saints celebrations), now corresponding to different municipal holidays: St. Anthony's Day in [[Lisbon]] and [[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]] (June 13), [[Festa de São João do Porto]] (St. John's Day) in [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Figueira da Foz]], [[Vila do Conde]], and [[Almada]] (June 24), St. Peter's day in [[Seixal Municipality|Seixal]], [[Sintra]], [[Póvoa de Varzim]], and [[Barcelos, Portugal|Barcelos]] (June 29).

Saints’ days are full of fun and merriment. The streets are decorated with balloons and arches made out of brightly colored paper; people dance in the city's small squares, and altars, dedicated to the saints, are put up as a way of asking for good fortune. These holidays are days of festivities with good food and refreshments, people eat [[Caldo verde]] (cabbage and potato soup), Sardinha Assada (grilled sardines), bread and drink red wine and água-pé (grape juice with a small percentage of alcohol).

In [[Lisbon]], in Avenida da Liberdade, there are the ''Marchas'', a parade of folklore and costumes of the inhabitants from the city's different traditional quarters, with hundreds of singers and dancers and a vast audience applauding their favorite participants. As St. Anthony is the matchmaker saint, it is still the tradition in [[Lisbon]] to celebrate multiple marriages (200 to 300) and still following the tradition, if you are attracted to someone, one can declare themself in the heat of the festivities by offering to the loved person a ''manjerico'' (a flower-pot with a sweet basil plant) and a love poem.

In [[Porto]] and [[Braga]] St. John's is a festival that is lived to the full in the streets, where anything is permitted. People carry a plant of flowering [[leek]] (''alho-porro,'' which has a pungent smell) with them, and run it over the face of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alho-porro: significado quase desconhecido|url = http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Vida/Interior.aspx?content_id=2622460|website = TSF|accessdate = 2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1963, people have also carried a small plastic hammer which they use to bang their neighbors over the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sabe como nasceu o martelinho do São João?|url = http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/Buzz/interior.aspx?content_id=4633662|website = Dinheiro Vivo|accessdate = 2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition is that St. John was a scalliwag in his youth and the people hit him on the head with the garlic saying "return to the right path". There is also dancing, while the highlight of the night is the firework display over the River Douro (in [[Porto]]) and down Avenida da Liberdade (in [[Braga]]). Across the country the traditional midsummer bonfire is also built, and following an ancient pagan tradition, revelers try to jump over the bonfire, this in order to gain protection during the rest of the year.

In Póvoa de Varzim, a traditional fisher town, midsummer was celebrated during St. John's day, but most festivities were changed to Saint Peter's Day in the 1960s, as the day was declared a municipal holiday. [[Póvoa de Varzim Holiday|Póvoa de Varzim's Saint Peter Festival]] keeps traditional midsummer elements, such as the bonfire, the celebrations occur in the streets and include the ''rusgas'', in which inhabitants of one quarter (''[[bairro]]'') visit in a parade other neighborhoods in the evening of June 28. Women are dressed as [[tricana poveira|tricana]] (women dressed in a traditional costume with a sensual walking style). Each neighborhood has its own festival and colors for identification. In the 21st century, younger population although participating strongly in this festival, now use contemporary ways to celebrate it, such as the very popular ''Saint Peter [[rave]]s'' in the waterfront.

===Romania===
[[File:Cricau Festival 2013 - Sanziene - 24.jpg|thumb|''[[Sânziene]]'' dancing during the Cricău Festival, June 2013]]
[[Romanian folklore|In Romania]], the Midsummer celebrations are named ''[[Drăgaica]]'' or ''[[Sânziene]]''. Drăgaica is celebrated by a dance performed by a group of 5–7 young girls of which one is chosen as ''the Drăgaica''. She is dressed as a [[bride]], with wheat wreath, while the other girls, dressed in white wear a veil with [[Galium verum|bedstraw]] flowers. Midsummer fairs are held in many Romanian villages and cities. The oldest and best known midsummer fair in Romania is the [[Drăgaica fair]], held in [[Buzău]] between 10 and 24 June every year. There are many superstitions related to this day, particularly those involving marriage or death. The term Sânziene originates in the Latin "Sancta Diana", and superstitions relating to this day are mainly erotic in nature, referring to young girls and their marriage prospects.

===Ukraine===
[[File:Ivankupala.jpg|thumb|''Night on the Eve of Ivan Kupala'', by Henryk Hector Siemiradzki]]
[[Ivan Kupala Day|Ivan Kupala]] was the old Kyiv Rus' name for John the Baptist. Up to the present day, the Rus' Midsummer Night (or Ivan's Day) is known as one of the most expressive Kyiv Rus' folk and pagan holidays. Ivan Kupala Day is the day of summer solstice celebrated in [[Ukraine]] on June 23 NS and July 6 OS. Before the day was named for St John, this was a celebration of a pagan fertility rite involving bathing in water.  Since St John the Baptist's birth is celebrated at this time, some elements of Kupala's pagan origins were seen to be roughly synonymous with Christian meanings, most notably the parallel of Baptism as cleansing from sins, so the holiday in a Christian-modified form has been accepted into the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] calendar.  In modern times, due to increasing secularization, it is possible to find Kupala being celebrated in a manner closer to its pagan roots.

===Russia===
Many rites of this holiday are connected with water, [[fertility]] and [[Ritual purification|autopurification]]. The girls, for example, would float their flower garlands on the water of rivers and tell their fortunes from their movement. Lads and girls would jump over the flames of bonfires. Nude bathing is likewise practiced. Nights on the Eve of Ivan Kupala inspired [[Modest Mussorgsky]] to create his ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]''. A prominent Ivan Kupala night scene is featured in [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Andrei Rublev (film)|''Andrei Rublev'']]. Also, in [[Saint Petersburg]] the [[White Nights Festival]] is also predominantly connected with water.

The [[Yakut people]] of the [[Sakha Republic]] celebrate a solstitial ceremony, ''Ysyakh'', involving tethering a horse to a pole and [[circle dance|circle dancing]] around it. Betting on [[Reindeer]] or [[horse racing]] would often take place afterward. The traditions are derived from [[Tengriism]], the ancient sun religion of the region which has since been driven out by the [[Russian empire]], [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and finally the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. The traditions have since been encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Read MacDonald|title=The Folklore of World Holidays|year=1992|publisher=|pages=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovenia===
In Slovenia, ''Kresna noč'' (Midsummer Night) used to be celebrated on June 21, but the celebration was later moved to May 1, [[International Workers Day]]. Kresna noč used to be connected with the Slavic god [[Kresnik (deity)|Kresnik]], who was later replaced by [[St. John the Baptist]].

===Croatia===
The tradition of Sveti Ivan Krstitelj (St.John Baptist), also called Ivanjdan or Svitnjak in Western Herzegovina and coastal Croatia, is celebrated on June 23 in Croatia. The people light large bonfires in the name of Saint John Baptist, and the celebration can also be connected to the old Slavic traditions for Kresnik (South Slavic version of Perun) the god of Sun. There are places in Croatia like Ričice where saint St. John Baptist is the patron and their tradition is different. The village folk and especially children bring firewood to a designated place, and then a bonfire is lit at sunset, after the bonfire burns out the children jump, walk or run on the embers of the bonfire because it is believed their feet won't hurt if they do that. There is also the tradition of which village makes the bigger bonfire, a competition that the village folk will talk and boast about tomorrow after the church Eucharist ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narodni.net/narodni-obicaji-za-ivandan-sv-ivana]&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition everywhere else in Croatia is pretty similar,but mostly the bonfires are lit but the walking on embers is not done anymore.

===Serbia===
{{see also|Serbian traditions}}
''[[Ivanjdan]]'' is celebrated on July 7, according to the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Saint John (Sveti Jovan) is known by the name ''Igritelj'' (dancer) because it is thought the sun is dancing on this day. Among traditions are that girls watch the sunrise through their [[wreath]], to become red as the sun, towards the evening in the heights, ''Ivanjske vatre'' (kresovi, ''bonfire'') are lit, and dancing and singing takes place. It is a tradition for people to become [[Godparent|Godfathers]] and [[blood brothers]] on this day, as John is a symbol of character and [[rectitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/197231/SPC-i-vernici-danas-obelezavaju-Ivanjdan |title=Blic Online &amp;#124; SPC i vernici danas obeležavaju Ivanjdan |publisher=Blic.rs |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{Main|bonfires of Saint John}}

[[File:Sant joan marina alta 2007.jpg|thumb|Bonfire at Almadrava beach on Saint John's night. Bonfires are very common in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].]]
The traditional midsummer party in Spain is the celebration in honour of Saint John the Baptist (Spanish: ''San Juan'', Catalan: ''Sant Joan'', Galician: ''San Xoán'', Asturian: ''San Xuan'') and takes place in the evening of June 23 [[St John's Eve]]. It is common in many areas of the country. In some areas, bonfires are traditionally named ''tequeos'', which means people of the dance. Parties are organized usually at beaches, where bonfires are lit and a set of firework displays usually take place. On the Mediterranean coast, especially in [[Catalonia]] and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], special foods such as ''[[coca]] de Sant Joan'' are also served on this occasion. In [[Alicante]], since 1928, the [[bonfires of Saint John]] were developed into elaborate constructions inspired by the [[Falles]], or Fallas, of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].

Midsummer tradition is also especially strong in northern areas of the country, such as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]] and [[Cantabria]] where one can easily identify the rituals that reveal the pagan beliefs widespread throughout Europe in [[Neolithic]] times. These beliefs pivot on three basic ideas: the importance of medicinal plants, especially in relation to health, youth and beauty; the protective character of fire to ward men off evil spirits and witches and, finally, the purifying, miraculous effects of water. What follows is a summary of Galician traditions surrounding St. John's festival in relation to these three elements.
* Medicinal plants: Traditionally, women collect several species of plants on St. John's eve. These vary from area to area, but mostly include fennel, different species of fern (e.g. [[dryopteris filix-mas, osmunda regalis]]), [[rue]] (herb of grace, ruta graveolens), [[rosemary]], [[dog rose]] (rosa canina), [[lemon verbena]], [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] (hypericum perforatum), mallows ([[malva sylvestris]]), [[laburnum]], foxgloves ([[digitalis purpurea]]) and [[Sambucus|elder]] flowers. In some areas, these are arranged in a bunch and hung in doorways. In most others, they are dipped in a vessel with water and left outside exposed to the dew of night until the following morning (o dia de San Xoan – St. John's day), when people use the resulting flower water to wash their faces.
* Water: Tradition holds it that the medicinal plants mentioned above are most effective when dipped in water collected from seven different springs. Also, on some beaches, it was traditional for women who wanted to be fertile to bathe in the sea until they were washed by 9 waves.
* Fire: Bonfires are lit, usually around midnight both on beaches and inland, so much so that one usually cannot tell the smoke from the mist common in this Atlantic corner of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] at this time of the year, and it smells burnt everywhere. Occasionally, a dummy is placed at the top, representing a witch or the devil. Young and old gather around them and feast mostly on pilchards, potatoes boiled in their skins and maize bread. When it is relatively safe to jump over the bonfire, it is done three times (although it could also be nine or any odd number) for good luck at the cry of "meigas fora" (witches off!).It is also common to drink ''Queimada'', a beverage resulting from setting alight Galician grappa mixed with sugar, coffee beans and pieces of fruit, which is prepared while chanting an incantation against evil spirits.

[[File:Årsnäs, Midsummer of 69 (5).JPG|thumb|Midsummer games taking place after dancing around the Maypole, here depicting throwing balls at piles of cans]]
Raising and dancing around a [[maypole]] (''majstång'' or ''midsommarstång'') is an activity that attracts families and many others. Greenery placed over houses and barns were supposed to bring good fortune and health to people and livestock; this old tradition of decorating with greens continues, even though most don't take it seriously. To decorate with greens was called ''att maja'' (to may) and may be the origin of the word ''majstång'', ''maja'' coming originally from the month May, or vice versa. Other researchers say the term came from German merchants who raised the maypole in June because the Swedish climate made it impossible to find the necessary greens and flowers in May, and continued to call it a maypole. Today, however, it is most commonly{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} called a ''"midsommarstång"'' (literally ''midsummer pole'').

In earlier times, small spires wrapped in greens were erected; this probably predates the maypole tradition, which is believed by many to have come from the continent in the Middle Ages. Midsummer is also sprung from pagan rites, it has a lot to do with [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]] which has a phallic symbol, and during the [[Viking age]] there were rituals centered around this, as a worshipping of fertility and a rich harvest, which is the older meaning of the celebration and the German merchant influence has very little to do with it overall.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In Sweden Midsummer's day is a Saturday between June 20 and June 26, but as is usual in Sweden the actual celebration is on the eve, i.e. a Friday between June 19 and June 25. Midsummer's Eve is a de facto public holiday in Sweden with offices and many shops closed.&lt;ref&gt;https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/midsummer/&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in Norway and Finland, it is believed that if a girl picks 7 different flowers in silence of the midsummer night and puts them underneath her pillow, she will dream of her future husband.

Traditional Swedish midsummer was observed on June 24.

===United Kingdom===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Holt, Norfolk]] --&gt;
{{See also|A Midsummer Night's Dream}}
In [[Great Britain]] from the 13th century, Midsummer was celebrated on Midsummer Eve (St. John's Eve, June 23) and St. Peter's Eve (June 28) with the lighting of bonfires, feasting and merrymaking.

In late 14th-century England, [[John Mirk]] of [[Lilleshall Abbey]], [[Shropshire]], gives the following description: "At first, men and women came to church with candles and other lights and prayed all night long. In the process of time, however, men left such devotion and used songs and dances and fell into lechery and gluttony turning the good, holy devotion into sin." The church fathers decided to put a stop to these practices and ordained that people should fast on the evening before, and thus turned waking into fasting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mirksfestialcoll00mirk#page/182/mode/2up Theodore Erbe (editor) (1905). ''Mirk's Festial: a Collection of Homilies''], Kegan Paul et al., for the Early English Text Society, p. 182, accessed 15 December 2014 at Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirk adds that at the time of his writing, "...in worship of St John the Baptist, men stay up at night and make three kinds of fires: one is of clean bones and no wood and is called a "[[bonfire|bonnefyre]]"; another is of clean wood and no bones, and is called a ''wakefyre'', because men stay awake by it all night; and the third is made of both bones and wood and is called, "St. John's fire" (Festial 182)." These traditions largely ended after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], but persisted in rural areas up until the 19th century before petering out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://midsummer.mobi Midsummer – Mobilising the world to enjoy the magnificence of Midsummer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620104607/http://midsummer.mobi/ |date=2013-06-20 }}. Midsummer.mobi (2013-06-20). Retrieved on 2013-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Midsummer festivities had uneasy relations with the Reformed establishment. The [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]], begun in 1498, was held at every Summer Solstice in years when the [[Chester Mystery Plays]] were not performed. Despite the cancellation of the plays in 1575, the parade continued; in 1599, however, the Lord Mayor ordered that the parades be banned and the costumes destroyed. The parade was permanently banned in 1675.

[[File:Castle an Dinas midsummer bonfire 2009.jpg|thumb|{{lang|kw|Tansys Golowan}} – A Cornish hilltop bonfire on Midsummer's eve.]]
Traditional Midsummer bonfires are still lit on some high hills in [[Cornwall]] (see [[Carn Brea, St Just|Carn Brea]] and [[Castle an Dinas, St. Columb Major|Castle an Dinas]] on [[Castle Downs, Cornwall|Castle Downs]]). This tradition was revived by the [[Old Cornwall Society]] in the early 20th century. Bonfires in Cornwall were once common as part of {{lang|kw|[[Golowan Festival|Golowan]]}}, which is now celebrated at [[Penzance]], Cornwall. This week long festival normally starts on the Friday nearest St John's Day. {{lang|kw|Golowan}} lasts several days and culminates in Mazey Day. This is a revival of the Feast of St John ({{lang|kw|Gol-Jowan}}) with fireworks and bonfires.

====England====
June 24, Midsummer Day, the feast of [[St. John the Baptist]], is one of the [[quarter days]] in England.

====Scotland====
Midsummer festivals are celebrated throughout Scotland, notably in the [[Scottish Borders]] where [[Peebles]] holds its [[Beltane]] Week. The Eve of St. John has special magical significance and was used by [[Sir Walter Scott]] as the title, and theme, for a pseudo-ballad poem. He invented a legend in which the lady of [[Smailholm Tower]], near [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]], keeps vigil by the midnight fires three nights in a row (see above) and is visited by her lover; but when her husband returns from battle, she learns he slew that lover on the first night, and she has been entertained by a very physical ghost.

====Wales====
In Wales it is called {{lang|cy|Gŵyl Ifan}}, or {{lang|cy|Gŵyl Ifan Ganol Haf}} (St John's of Midsummer) to distinguish it from {{lang|cy|Gŵyl Ifan Ganol Gaeaf}} (St John's of Midwinter, the feast of John the Evangelist). Great agricultural fairs used to be held at this time, along with merriment and dancing. A bonfire was also kept this night. With the advent of non-conformist beliefs on the Welsh socio-political culture, this (among so many other similar festivals) suffered greatly, and its observance finally died out in [[south Wales|south-east Wales]] by the end of the 19th century. However, since 1977, a folk-dance revival started in Cardiff, and is held now annually on this feast day&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwylifan.org/ Gwyl Ifan 2013]. Gwylifan.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Solstice fire Montana.jpg|thumb|Solstice fire in [[Montana]]]]
Midsummer celebrations held throughout the United States are largely derived from the cultures of immigrants who arrived from various European nations since the 19th century.  With the rise of earth-centered spirituality, many, including Unitarian Universalists, celebrate the summer solstice as a religious holiday.

====Alaska====
As the state of Alaska, northernmost state in the nation, straddles the [[Arctic Circle]], midsummer is a time when most of the state is in daylight or civil [[twilight]] the entire day. The [[Midnight Sun Game]] is an annual tradition in the city of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], in which a regulation game of baseball is played at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, through the midnight hour, with no artificial lighting.

====Arizona====
[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] has announced its inaugural Earthwalk Solstice celebration, with sister events in San Francisco, Jerusalem, and other communities around the world. The event features a walk through a giant labyrinth, musicians, healers, ceremony, etc.

====California====
Since 1974, [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] has hosted an annual Summer Solstice celebration, typically on the weekend of or the weekend after the actual solstice. It includes a festival and parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solsticeparade.com/index.php/history |title=Summer Solstice Celebration: History |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Illinois====
[[Geneva, Illinois|Geneva]] hosts a Swedish Day ({{lang-sv|Svenskarnas Dag}}) festival on the third Sunday of June. The event, featuring maypole-raising, dancing, and presentation of an authentic Viking ship, dates back to 1911.

====Michigan====
In [[Kaleva, Michigan|Kaleva]], {{lang|fi|Juhannus}} is celebrated annually on or near the Summer Solstice by Gathering at the Village Roadside Park. Traditionally {{lang|fi|Pannukakku}} (Finnish Oven Baked Pancake) and strawberry shortcake is enjoyed followed by a bonfire or {{lang|fi|kokko}}. {{lang|fi|Kaleva}} was founded in 1900 by Finnish immigrants.

====Oregon====
The Astoria Scandinavian Midsummer Festival has been a tradition on the North Coast of Oregon for over forty years. The Festival takes place typically on the 3rd full weekend of June. The festival embodies the rich cultural heritage that was transplanted to the [[Astoria, Oregon]] region by emigrating Scandinavians. In the Pacific Northwest they found the same bounteous seas and forests as in their native lands and the demand for their skills at managing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astoria Scandinavian Midsummer Festival website|url=http://astoriascanfest.com/site/|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====
The [[NYC Midsummer|NYC Swedish Midsummer]] celebrations in [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], attracts some 3,000–5,000 people annually, which makes it one of the largest celebrations after the ones held in [[Leksand]] and at the [[Skansen|Skansen Park]] in [[Stockholm]]. [[Sweden Day]], a Midsummer celebration which also honors Swedish heritage and history, has been held annually on the sound in [[Throgs Neck]] in New York City since 1941. Swedish Midsummer is also celebrated in other places with large Swedish and Scandinavian populations, such as [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], [[Illinois]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Lindsborg, Kansas|Lindsborg]], [[Kansas]]. The Swedish "language village" (summer camp) {{lang|sv|[[Sjölunden]]}}, run by [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]] in Minnesota, also celebrates Midsummer.

====Washington====
The [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] neighborhood of [[Fremont, Seattle, Washington|Fremont]] puts on a large [[Summer Solstice Parade and Pageant]], which for many years has controversially included [[Solstice Cyclists|painted naked cyclists]]. In St. Edwards Park in [[Kenmore, Washington|Kenmore]], the [[Skandia Folkdance Society]] hosts {{lang|sv|Midsommarfest}}, which includes a Scandinavian solstice pole.

====Wyoming====
A solstitial celebration is held on [[Casper Mountain]] at Crimson Dawn park. [[Crimson Dawn]] is known in the area for the great stories of mythical creatures and people that live on Casper Mountain. The celebration is attended by many people from the community, and from around the country. A large bonfire is held and all are invited to throw a handful of red soil into the fire in hopes that they get their wish granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperwyoming.info/specmerchant.php?id=6726 |title=Merchant Information |accessdate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018065731/http://casperwyoming.info/specmerchant.php?id=6726 |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogous summer solstice observances==
===Neopaganism===
As forms of [[Neopaganism]] can be quite different and have very different origins, these representations can vary considerably, despite the shared name. Some celebrate in a manner as close as possible to how they believe ancient pagans observed the summer solstice, while others observe the holiday with rituals culled from numerous other unrelated sources, the Germanic culture being just one of the sources used. In [[Neo-druidism]], the term ''Alban Hefin'' is used for the summer solstice. The name was invented by the late 18th century [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] author and prolific literary forger [[Iolo Morganwg]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen, William (1832) ''A Dictionary of the Welsh Language: Explained in English; with Numerous Illustrations.''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germanic Neopaganism====
Germanic neopagans call their summer solstice festival '''Litha''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polon|first=Linda|title=The Whole Earth Holiday Book|year=1983|publisher=Good Year Books|isbn=067316585X|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of the reconstructed [[Germanic calendar]] used by some [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagans]] and takes its name from [[Bede]]'s ''[[The Reckoning of Time|De temporum ratione]]'' that provides Anglo-Saxon names for the months roughly corresponding to June and July as ''se Ærra Liþa''{{efn-ua|See [[Thorn (letter)]]}} and ''se Æfterra Liþa'' (the "early Litha month" and the "later Litha month") with an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month of ''Liþa'' appearing after ''se Æfterra Liþa'' on leap years. In modern times, Litha is celebrated by neopagans who emphasize what they believe to be the [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstruction]] of [[Anglo-Saxon polytheism|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Germanic paganism]].

'''Mobile sales enablement''' is a systematic approach to helping sales representatives prepare for in-person prospect interactions, engage effectively with their audience using mobile devices in any place, and close deals faster. Mobile sales enablement should not be confused with the larger sales enablement process.
There are many ways that organizations use mobile devices to functionally enhance the sales process. Behaviors completed on a mobile device may include, but are not limited to the use of specialized applications, distribution of dynamic content, mobile email tactics or messaging such as push notifications, etc.

== Origin ==
Mobile sales enablement is an extension of the long-standing sales enablement strategy. IDC defines sales enablement as: “Getting the right information into the hands of the right seller at the right time and place, and in the right format, to move a sales opportunity forward”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cournoyer|first=Brendan|title=What is Sales Enablement? 3 Definitions that Help Tell the Story|url=https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/sales-enableMent-3-definitions-help-tell-story-170014998.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the first [[iPad]] was released, some entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Capital|first=Magazine|title=IT-ondernemers Pieterjan Bouten, Louis Jonckheere en Peter Minne|url=http://www.capitalmagazine.be/capital/it-ondernemers-pieterjan-bouten-louis-jonckheere-en-peter-minne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minneapolis/Saint Paul|first=Business Journal|title=ThisClicks is picking up med-tech clients with its App Data Room|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/print-edition/2012/03/23/thisclicks-is-picking-up-med-tech.html?page=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; took the opportunity to develop mobile apps that enabled salesmen to sell everywhere. These were initiated out of costly custom agency builds that where difficult to maintain. As technology progressed, standardized apps were developed. Some apps focus on content distribution others are focused on more transactional functions.

== Devices ==
Mobile sales enablement can be applied to all [[mobile devices]]. This often includes tablets and smartphones. However; the downside of smartphones is the smaller screen size, in comparison with a tablet which has a larger screen for sharing presentations or materials to an audience. Good apps will tailor the benefits of the solution to the specific selling behavior for the devices.

== The difference between mobile sales enablement and a CRM ==
There is often confusion between the terms mobile sales enablement and [[customer relationship management]]. This is mostly due to the fact that a lot of CRM providers have a mobile version of their software. CRM software is designed to manage relationships with customers using a database of customers, prospects, and support staff. Meanwhile, mobile sales enablement is focused on making sales people more successful while on the go. Some mobile sales enablement solutions integrate seamlessly with an already existing CRM solution, thereby helping both tools to be more successful. 

== Opportunities ==
Research by Demand Metric&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Sales and Marketing Survey from Showpad and Demand Metric Benchmarks High Cost of a Bad Sales Experience|url=http://showpad.com/about/press/national-sales-and-marketing-survey-from-showpad-and-demand-metric|website=www.showpad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the cost of a bad sales experience indicated that a misalignment between sales and marketing is key to a loss in revenue. Specifically, 72% of sales and marketing professionals agree on this statement. 60% of these professionals often deliver bad sales experiences. The cause of this problem is due to sales thinking that marketing materials lacks quality, while marketers think salespeople aren’t using the content the right way. Mobile sales enablement provides a solution to this problem.

In a recent research conducted by BSharp Sales Enablers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Listen to and Act Fast on Market Trends Using Sales Enablement Tools|url=http://bsharpcorp.com/how-to-listen-to-and-act-fast-on-market-trends-using-sales-enablement-tools|publisher=BSharp Sales Enablers}}&lt;/ref&gt; 96% of field sales team said they preferred a mobile sales enablement solution to a PC based solution.

Profitable Channels conducted research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best practices mobile sales enablement|url=http://profitablechannels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Profitable-Channels-Best-Practices-in-Mobile-Enablement-Report-6-1-13.pdf|publisher=Profitable Channels}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the opportunities  provided by mobile sales enablement. They found 3 areas where mobile sales enablement had a lot of potential:
* '''Drive revenue growth''': Thanks to having access to the right sales information at the right time, at the right place, the revenue/sale has gone up.
* '''Improve sales effectiveness''': Due to simplifying the sales process, improving sales productivity, and showing a return on the investment of sales assets.
* '''Differentiate the customer experience''': A higher level of collaboration, a visually clean sales interface and client insight’s help with bringing the customer experience to a higher level.

'''Music Law''' refers to legal aspects of the music industry, and certain legal aspects in other sectors of the entertainment industry. The music industry includes [[record label]]s, music publishers, merchandisers, the live events sector and of course performers and artists.

The terms "music law" and "entertainment law", along with "business affairs", are used by the music and entertainment industry and should not be thought of as academic definitions. Indeed, music law covers a range of traditional legal subjects including [[intellectual property]] law ([[copyright]] law, [[trademark]]s, image publicity rights, design rights), [[competition law]], [[bankruptcy law]], [[contract law]], [[defamation]] and, for the live events industry, [[immigration law]], [[health and safety law]], and licensing.

==Definitions==
*A "compilation" refers to work formed from already existing materials in a way that forms its own original work, including collective works.
*"Copies" are physical objects that hold, fix, or embody a work such as a music tape, film, CD, statue, play, or printed sheet music.
*"Sound recordings" can refer to any audio recording including the sound accompanying motion pictures.
*"Copyright owner" is the entity that legally owns rights to a work.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/|title=Copyright Law of the United States - U.S. Copyright Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Performance" The copyright holder has the exclusive right to perform the work in public, or to license others to perform it. The right applies to “literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works.".&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106(4)&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a CD in public, or showing a film in public is "performing" the work.

==Copyright==

{{main| copyright}}

==Publishing==

Publishing is the primary source of income for musicians writing their own music.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Money collected from the 'publishing' rights is ultimately destined for songwriters - the composers of works, whether or not they are the recording artist or performer. Often, [[songwriter]]s will work for a musical ensemble to help them with musical aspects of the composition, but here again, the writer of the song is the owner of it and will own the copyrights in the song and thus will be entitled to the publishing revenues.  Copyrights in compositions are not the same as [[sound recording]]s.  A recording artist can record a song and sell it to another band or company. As a result, that particular company will own the recording, but not the song. The original writer will always maintain the copyright for that particular song. The publishing money is connected to the copyright, so the owner will be the only one making money off of the song itself. All successful songwriters will join a collection society (such as ASCAP and BMI in the USA, SOCAN in Canada, JASRAC in Japan, GEMA in Germany and PRS for Music in the UK, etc.) and many will enter into agreements with music publishing companies who will exploit their works on the songwriters behalf for a share of ownership, although many of these deals involve the transfer (assignment) of copyright from the songwriter to the music publisher.

Both the recorded music sector and music publishing sector have their foundations in [[intellectual property]] law and all of the major recording labels and major music publishers and many independent record labels and publishers have dedicated "business and legal affairs" departments with in-house lawyers whose role is not only to secure intellectual property rights from recording artists, performers and songwriters but also to exploit those rights and protect those rights on a global basis. There are a number of specialist independent law firms around the world who advise on music and entertainment law whose clients include recording artists, performers, producers, songwriters, labels, music publishers, stage and set designers, choreographers, graphic artists, games designers, merchandisers, broadcasters, artist managers, distributors, collection societies and the live events sector (which further includes festivals, venues, promoters, booking agents and production service providers such as lighting and staging companies).

==Performance Licensing==
{{main|Music licensing}}

==Business==

The US Government views artists that give concerts and sell merchandise as a business. Bands that tour internationally will also face a plethora of legislation around the world including health and safety laws, immigration laws and tax legislation. Also, many relationships are governed by often complex contractual agreements.

In the US it is important for musicians to get legal business licenses. These can be obtained at a city hall or local government center. The business license will require the tracking of sales, wages, and gigs. A tax ID is also necessary for all businesses. Musicians that fail to comply with the tax ID process and do not report their profits and losses to the government can face serious consequences with the IRS.

The '''National Latin Exam''' is a test given to [[Latin]] students. Sponsored by the U.S.-based [[American Classical League]] and the [[National Junior Classical League]], the exam was given in 2012 to over 136,000 students in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, United Kingdom, Zimbabwe, and for the first time Taiwan.&lt;ref name="NLE"&gt;[http://www.nle.org/pdf/NLE-spring2012.pdf] - accessed July 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The test covers general knowledge of [[Latin]] grammar and vocabulary, mythology, Roman culture, derivatives, and translation abilities.

The office of the National Latin Exam is located in Trinkle Hall on the campus of the [[University of Mary Washington]] in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

==Philosophy==
The philosophy of the National Latin Exam is predicated on providing every Latin student the opportunity to experience a sense of personal accomplishment and success in his or her study of the Latin language and culture. This opportunity exists for all students on the National Latin Exam since they are not competing with their fellow students on a comparative basis, but are evaluated solely on their own performance on the exam. The basic purposes of the NLE are to promote the study of Latin and to encourage the individual student.&lt;ref name="NLE"/&gt;

==Format==
The National Latin Exam is a forty question, multiple-choice test with a time limit of forty-five minutes; it is offered to students on seven levels.

On the Introduction to Latin, Latin I, Latin II, Latin III, Latin III/IV Prose, and Latin III/IV Poetry exams, there are questions on grammar, comprehension, mythology, derivatives, literature, Roman life, history, geography, oral Latin, and Latin in use in the modern world.

The Latin V-VI exam contains two Latin passages as the basis for questions on grammar, comprehension, historical background, classical literature, and literary devices.&lt;ref name="NLE"/&gt;

The exam is scored based on the number of questions answered correctly, with no penalty for guessing.

While a student can take an exam for a higher level than the one in which he or she is currently enrolled, the student may not take any level below his or her completion. The student is not required to take an actual Latin class to take an exam; however, the student must have an official sponsor and must take the exam with a proctor that is not the Latin teacher.

==Awards==
[[File:NLEGold.JPG|thumb|The National Latin Exam gold medal and certificate]]
[[File:NLESilver.JPG|thumb|The National Latin Exam silver medal and certificate]]

Several awards are available to those students who excel on the NLE:&lt;ref name="nle.org"&gt;http://www.nle.org/awards.html#awards_medals&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medals and Certificates ===

For Latin I-VI+:
* Perfect paper: Hand-lettered certificate
* Gold medal and a ''summa cum laude'' certificate awarded to top scorers
* Silver medal and a ''maxima cum laude'' certificate to second-place winners
* ''Magna cum laude'' certificate to third-place winners
* ''Cum Laude'' certificate to fourth-place winners

For Introduction to Latin:
* Perfect Paper: Purple certificate of achievement 
* A gold outstanding achievement certificate and a purple outstanding achievement ribbon for top scorers
* Silver certificate of achievement for second-place winners 

An NLE Certificate of Merit is also provided for each school participating in the exam.

=== Carter Stubbs Drake Goad Award (Latin I-VI+) ===

The students who have three, four, or five years of perfect papers are sent special book awards in addition to the special certificate. The perfect papers must be for ascending levels of the exam exclusive of the Introduction to Latin exam.

=== The Maureen O'Donnell Oxford Classical Dictionary Award (Latin I-VI+) ===

The Maureen O’Donnell Oxford Classical Dictionary Award is given to students who win four gold medals in recognition of their outstanding achievement. The students who have won five gold medals will be sent special book awards.

==Scholarships==
The National Latin Exam offers three different types of scholarships:&lt;ref name="nle.org"/&gt;

===NLE Scholarships===

Seniors who win a gold medal on the Latin III, III-IV Prose, III-IV Poetry, or the Latin V-VI+ exam are eligible to apply for one of twenty-one $2,000 scholarships awarded annually. Those who apply must agree to take a least one course per semester of Latin or Classical Greek in their first year of college. Recipients may reapply, if they continue their study of Latin or Greek.

===NLE Graduate Scholarship===

Students or teachers who are continuing their Latin or Greek on the post-graduate level are eligible to apply for one $2,000 scholarship awarded annually.

===The Jane Harriman Hall Professional Development Scholarship===

The Jane Harriman Hall Professional Development Scholarship program is designed to support teachers in their ability to teach Latin.  The scholarship was developed in honor of Jane Harriman Hall, founder of the National Latin Exam, in order to continue her efforts to bring high quality Latin instruction to their students.

{{refimprove|date=June 2010}}

'''Nomenclature''' is a [[system]] of [[names]] or terms, or the rules for forming these terms in a particular field of arts or sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nomenclature |title= ''Nomenclature - definitions from Dictionary.com'' |accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of naming vary from the relatively informal [[naming conventions|conventions]] of everyday speech to the internationally agreed principles, rules and recommendations that govern the formation and use of the specialist terms used in scientific and any other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;
http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch2/names.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

Naming "things" is a part of general human [[communication]] using [[word]]s and [[language]]: it is an aspect of everyday [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] as people distinguish the objects of their experience, together with their similarities and differences, which observers [[Identification (information)|identify]], name and [[wikt:classification|classify]]. The use of names, as the many different kinds of [[noun]]s embedded in different languages, connects nomenclature to [[theoretical linguistics]], while the way humans mentally structure the world in relation to [[semantics|word meanings]] and [[Experience (disambiguation)|experience]] relates to the [[philosophy of language]].

[[Onomastics]], the study of [[proper names]] and their origins, includes [[anthroponymy]] (concerned with human names, including [[personal names]], [[surnames]] and [[nicknames]]); [[toponymy]] (the study of place names) and [[etymology]] (the derivation, history and use of names) as revealed through [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] and [[descriptive linguistics]].

The scientific need{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} for simple, stable and internationally accepted systems for naming objects of the natural world has generated many formal nomenclatural systems. Probably the best known of these nomenclatural systems are the five codes of [[biological nomenclature]] that govern the [[Latin]]ized [[scientific name]]s of [[organism]]s.

==Etymology==
The word ''nomenclature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''nomen'' - [[name]], and ''calare'' - to call; the Latin term ''[[wikt:nomenclatura|nomenclatura]]'' refers to a list of names, as does the word ''[hujb which can also indicate a provider or announcer of names.

==Onomastics and nomenclature==
{{Main article|Onomastics}}
The study of proper [[name]]s is known as [[onomastics]],&lt;ref&gt;Scheetz, George H. 1988. ''Names' Names: A Descriptive and Prescriptive Onymicon.'' (“What’s In a Name?” Chapbook Series; 2.) Sioux City, Ia.: Schütz Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; which has a wide-ranging scope encompassing all names, all languages, all geographical and cultural regions. The distinction between onomastics and nomenclature is not readily clear: onomastics is an unfamiliar discipline to most people and the use of nomenclature in an academic sense is also not commonly known. Although the two fields integrate, nomenclature concerns itself more with the rules and conventions that are used for the formation of names. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

== Influence of social-political-religious factors on names==
Same things may be given different names and different things may be given the same name due to the social, political, religious and cultural motivations. Closely related similar things may be considered separate, and on the other hand considerably different things might be considered same, both due to the social-political-religious contextual reasons, for example closely related mutually intelligible sanskritised-Hindustani language [[Hindi]] versus arabised-Hindustani language [[Urdu]] being favored as separate languages by [[hindu]]s and [[muslims]] respectively as seen in the context of [[Hindu–Islamic relations|hindu-muslim conflict]] resulting in [[Partition of India|violent 1947 Partition of India]], where as mutually unintelligible speech varieties that differ considerably in structure such as [[Moroccan Darija|Moroccan Arabic]], [[Judeo-Yemeni Arabic|Yemeni Arabic]] and [[Lebanese Arabic]] are considered same language due to the [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamism religious identity]].&lt;ref name=SameSameDiff1&gt;Yaron Matras, 2010, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Lh6rBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=urdu+and+arabic+are+mutually+inintelligible&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KCQ3xscZUT&amp;sig=GMZySYG6WXKKJ0r3ZXv1sTRBs4A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi07f-QqonUAhWIq48KHQa_BK8Q6AEIhQEwEg#v=onepage&amp;q=urdu%20and%20arabic%20are%20mutually%20inintelligible&amp;f=false Romani in Britain: The Afterlife of a Language: The Afterlife of a Language], [[Edinburgh University]] Press, p.5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SameSameDiff2&gt;Julie Tetel Andresen, Phillip M.

==Naming as a cultural activity==
{{Main article|Philosophy of language}}
Names provide us with a way of structuring and [[map]]ping the world in our [[mind]]s so, in some way, they mirror or represent the objects of our experience.

===Names, words, language and meaning===
{{Main article|Proper name (philosophy)|Semantics}}
Elucidating the connections between language (especially names and nouns), meaning and the way we perceive the world has provided a rich field of study for [[philosopher]]s and [[linguist]]s. Relevant areas of study include: the distinction between proper names and proper nouns;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names "Names." In ''The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.''] Retrieved: 2009-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationship between names,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kent Bach|Bach, Kent]] 1981. What's in a name? ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' '''59''': 371–86.&lt;/ref&gt; their referents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference/ "Reference." In ''The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.''] Retrieved 2009-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; meanings ([[semantics]]), and the structure of language.

===Folk taxonomy===
{{Main article|Folk taxonomy|Binomial nomenclature}}
Modern scientific taxonomy has been described as "''basically a Renaissance codification of folk taxonomic principles.''"&lt;ref name=rbd&gt;[[Peter H. Raven|Raven, Peter H.]], [[Brent Berlin|Berlin, Brent]], Breedlove, Dennis E. 1971. The origins of taxonomy. ''Science''. New Series '''174(4015)''': 1210-1213. p. 1210.&lt;/ref&gt;
Formal scientific nomenclatural and classification systems are exemplified by [[biological classification]]. All [[wikt:classification|classification]] systems are established for a purpose. The scientific classification system anchors each organism within the [[nested hierarchy]] of internationally accepted classification categories. Maintenance of this system involves formal rules of nomenclature and periodic international meetings of review. This modern system evolved from the [[folk taxonomy]] of pre-history.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, Harold C. 1980. ''Folk Classification: A Topically Arranged Bibliography of Contemporary and Background References through 1971.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Department of Anthropology. {{ISBN|0-913516-02-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk taxonomy can be illustrated through the Western tradition of horticulture and gardening. Unlike scientific taxonomy, folk taxonomies serve many purposes. Examples in horticulture would be the grouping of plants, and naming of these groups, according to their properties and uses: [[annual plant|annual]]s, [[biennial plant|biennial]]s and [[perennial plant|perennial]]s (nature of life cycle); [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[culinary herb]]s and [[spice]]s (culinary use); [[herb]]s, [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s (growth habit); wild and cultivated plants (whether they are managed or not), and [[weed]]s (whether they are considered to be a nuisance or not) and so on.

Folk taxonomy is generally associated with the way rural or indigenous peoples use language to make sense of and organise the objects around them. [[Ethnobiology]] frames this interpretation through either "utilitarianists" like [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] who maintain that names and classifications reflect mainly material concerns, and "intellectualists" like [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who hold that they spring from innate mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;Balee, William 1993. ''Journal of Ethnobiology'' '''13(1)''': 144–147.&lt;/ref&gt; The literature of [[ethnobiology|ethnobiological]] classifications was reviewed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Newmaster, Stephen G. et al. 2006. Mechanisms of Ethnobiological Classifications. ''Ethnobotany'' '''18''': 4–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk classification is defined by the way in which members of a language community name and categorize plants and animals whereas [[ethnotaxonomy]] refers to the hierarchical structure, organic content, and cultural function of biological classification that ethnobiologists find in every society around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Newmaster, Stephen G. et al. 2006. Mechanisms of Ethnobiological Classifications. ''Ethnobotany'' '''18''':4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographic studies of the naming and classification of animals and plants in non-Western societies have revealed some general principles that indicate pre-scientific man’s conceptual and linguistic method of organising the biological world in a hierarchical way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brent Berlin|Berlin, Brent]], Breedlove, Dennis E. &amp; [[Peter H. Raven|Raven, Peter H.]] 1973. General principles of classification and nomenclature in folk biology.

:*in all languages natural groups of organisms are distinguished (present-day taxa)
:*these groups are arranged into more inclusive groups or ethnobiological categories
:*in all languages there are about five or six ethnobiological categories of graded inclusiveness
:*these groups (ethnobiological categories) are arranged hierarchically, generally into mutually exclusive ranks
:*the ranks at which particular organisms are named and classified is often similar in different cultures

The levels are — moving from the most to least inclusive:
:*level 1 - "unique beginner" ---e.g. ''plant'' or ''animal''. A single all-inclusive name rarely used in folk taxonomies but loosely equivalent to an original living thing, a "common ancestor"
:*level 2 - “life form” --------------e.g. ''tree'', ''bird'', ''grass'' and ''fish'' These are usually primary lexemes (basic linguistic units) loosely equivalent to a phylum or major biological division.
:*level 3 - "generic name" ------e.g. ''oak'', ''pine'', ''robin'', ''catfish'' This is the most numerous and basic building block of all folk taxonomies, the most frequently referred to, the most important psychologically, and among the first learned by children. These names can usually be associated directly with a second level group. Like life-form names these are primary lexemes.
:*level 4 - "specific name" ------e.g. ''white fir'', ''post oak'' More or less equivalent to species. A secondary lexeme and generally less frequent than generic names.
:*level 5 - "varietal name"-------e.g. ''baby lima bean'', ''butter lima bean''.

In almost all cultures objects are named using one or two words equivalent to "kind" (genus) and "particular kind" (species).&lt;ref name=rbd /&gt; When made up of two words (a [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]]) the name usually consists of a noun (like ''salt'', ''dog'' or ''star'') and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more "specific", for example, ''lap dog'', ''sea salt'', or ''film star''. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (''whelk'', ''elm'', ''lion'', ''shark'', ''pig'') but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (''sting ray'', ''poison apple'', ''giant stinking hogweed'', ''hammerhead shark''). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like ''Simpson'' and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say ''Homer Simpson''. It seems reasonable to assume that the form of scientific names we call [[binomial nomenclature]] is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language.

In keeping with the "utilitarianist" view other authors maintain that ethnotaxonomies resemble more a "complex web of resemblances" than a neat hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, B. 1984. The Pragmatics of Folk Classification. ''Journal of Ethnobiology'' '''4(1)''': 45–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names and nouns==
{{Main article|Name|Noun}}
A name is a label for any [[noun]]. Names can identify a class or [[Category of being|category]] of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given [[Context (language use)|context]]. Names are given, for example, to [[human]]s or any other [[organism]]s, [[Location (geography)|place]]s, [[Product (business)|product]]s - as in [[brand]] names - and even to [[idea]]s or [[concept]]s. It is names as nouns that are the building blocks of nomenclature.

The word "name" is possibly derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] hypothesised word ''nomn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=name&amp;searchmode=none |accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between names and nouns, if made at all, is extremely subtle&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John M. 2007. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jo5J2XUX9EUC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=distinction+names+and+nouns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i4FEYnO2N-&amp;sig=EfGH_k6JJNulQl5Sggudi3Thf3c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PgabSpeyM8yHkAXT6MCcBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=distinction%20names%20and%20nouns&amp;f=false ''The Grammar of Names.''] Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-929741-2}}. Retrieved 2009-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; although clearly “noun” refers to names as [[lexical category|lexical categories]] and their function within the context of language,&lt;ref&gt;Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003. [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsANoun.htm ''Glossary of linguistic terms: what is a noun''?] Retrieved 2009-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; rather that as “labels” for objects and properties.

===Personal names===
{{Main article|Anthroponymy|Personal name}}
Human [[personal names]] are presented, used and categorised in many ways depending on the language and culture. In most cultures (Indonesia is one exception) it is customary for individuals to be given at least two names. In Western culture, the first name is given at birth or shortly thereafter and is referred to as the [[given name]], the [[given name|forename]], the [[baptismal name]] (if given then), or simply the [[first name]]. In England prior to the Norman invasion of 1066, small communities of [[Celt]]s, [[Anglo-Saxon]]s and [[Scandinavia]]ns generally used single names: each person was identified by a single name as either a personal name or [[nickname]]. As the population increased, it gradually became necessary to identify people further – giving rise to names like John the butcher, Henry from Sutton, and Roger son of Richard … which naturally evolved into John Butcher, Henry Sutton, and Roger Richardson. We now know this additional name variously as the [[second name]], [[last name]], [[family name]], [[surname]] or occasionally the [[byname]], and this natural tendency was accelerated by the Norman tradition of using surnames that were fixed and hereditary within individual families. In combination these two names are now known as the personal name or, simply, the name. There are many exceptions to this general rule: Westerners often insert a third or more names between the given and surnames; Chinese and Hungarian names have the family name preceding the given name; females now often retain their maiden names (their family surname) or combine, using a hyphen, their maiden name and the surname of their husband; some East Slavic nations insert the patronym (a name derived from the given name of the father) between the given and the family name; in Iceland the given name is used with the patronym, or matronym (a name derived from the given name of the mother), and surnames are rarely used. [[Nickname]]s (sometimes called [[hypocoristic]] names) are informal names used mostly between friends.

===Common names and proper names===
{{Main article|Common name| Proper name}}
The distinction between [[proper name]]s and [[common name]]s is that proper names denote a unique entity e.g. [[London Bridge]], while common names are used in a more general sense in reference to a class of objects e.g. [[bridge]]. Many proper names are obscure in meaning as they lack any apparent meaning in the way that ordinary words mean, probably for the practical reason that when they consist of [[Collective noun]]s, they refer to groups, even when they are inflected for the [[Grammatical number|singular]] e.g. "committee". [[Concrete noun]]s like “cabbage” refer to physical bodies that can be observed by at least one of the senses while [[abstract noun]]s, like “love” and “hate” refer to abstract objects. In English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding noun-forming suffixes ("-ness", "-ity", "-tion") to adjectives or verbs e.g. "happiness", "serenity", “concentration”. [[Pronoun]]s like "he", "it", "which", and "those" stand in place of nouns in [[noun phrase]]s.

The capitalization of nouns varies with language and even the particular context: journals often have their own [[Style guide|house style]]s for common names.

===-onym nouns===
{{Main article|-onym}}
Distinctions may be made between particular kinds of names simply by using the suffix [[-onym]], from the Greek ὄνομα (ónoma) 'name'. So we have, for example, [[hydronym]]s name bodies of water, [[synonym]]s are names with the same meaning, and so on. The entire field could be described as chrematonymy - the names of things.

===Toponyms===
{{Main article|Toponymy}}
Toponyms are the names given to places or features of a particular district, region, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian 1997. ''Place names of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for over 5000 Natural Features, Countries, Capitals, Territories, Cities and Historic sites''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Company. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-0172-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ekwall, Eilert 1960. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names.'' 4th edition. (includes the origin of place-names). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This could include planets, countries, cities, towns, villages, buildings etc.; it can be further divided into specialist branches: hodonymy, the names of streets, roads, and the like; [[hydronymy]], the names of water bodies; and oronomy, the names of mountains. Toponymy has popular appeal because of its socio-cultural and historical interest and significance for [[cartography]]. However, work on the etymology of toponyms has found that many place names are descriptive, honorific or commemorative but frequently they have no meaning or the meaning is obscure or lost. Also the many categories of names are frequently interrelated. For example, many place-names are derived from personal names (Victoria), many names of planets and stars are derived from the names of [[myth]]ological characters ([[Venus]], [[Neptune]]), and many personal names are derived from place-names, names of nations and the like (Wood, Bridge).&lt;ref&gt;Harder, Kelsie B. 1976.

==Scientific nomenclature==

===Nomenclature, classification and identification===
{{Main article|Taxonomy (biology)|Identification (biology)}}
In biological science, at least, nomenclature is regarded as a part of (though distinct from) taxonomy. [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]] can be defined as the study of [[Taxonomic classification|classification]] including its principles, procedures and rules,&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hadland Davis|Davis, Peter H.]] &amp; [[Vernon Heywood|Heywood, Vernon H.]] 1965. ''Principles of Angiosperm Taxonomy''. Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd. p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; while classification itself is the ordering of [[taxa]] (the objects of classification) into groups based on similarities or differences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Talbut Onions|Onions, Charles T.]] (ed.) 2007. ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Sixth Edition. Oxford: Clarenden Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923324-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Michael G. 2006. ''Plant Systematics''. London: Elsevier Academic Press. p. 552. {{ISBN|978-0-12-644460-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Doing taxonomy entails [[Identification (biology)|identifying]], describing&lt;ref&gt;Winston, Judith E. 1999. ''Describing Species: Practical Taxonomic Procedure for Biologists''. New YorK: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-231-06825-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and naming [[taxa]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, George H.M. 1951. ''Taxonomy of Vascular Plants''. New York: Macmillan. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; so nomenclature, in this strict scientific sense, is that branch of taxonomy concerned with the application of scientific names to taxa, based on a particular classification scheme and in accordance with agreed international rules and conventions.

Identification determines whether a particular organism matches a taxon that has already been classified and named – so classification must precede identification.&lt;ref&gt;Stuessy, Tod F. 2008. ''Plant Taxonomy''. New York: Columbia Press. p.10. {{ISBN|0-231-06784-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure is sometimes referred to as “determination".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hadland Davis|Davis, Peter H.]] &amp; [[Vernon Heywood|Heywood, Vernon H.]] 1965. ''Principles of Angiosperm Taxonomy''. Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd. p.5. {{ISBN|81-7019-277-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The precision demanded by science in the accurate naming of objects in the natural world has resulted in a variety of international nomenclatural codes.

===Biology===
{{Main article| Biological nomenclature}}
Although [[Linnaeus]]’ system of [[binomial nomenclature]] was rapidly adopted after the publication of his [[Species Plantarum]] and [[Systema Naturae]] in 1753 and 1758 respectively, it was a long time before there was international consensus concerning the more general rules governing [[biological nomenclature]]. The first botanical code was produced in 1905, the zoological code in 1889 and cultivated plant code in 1953. Agreement on the nomenclature and symbols for genes emerged in 1979.

===Astronomy===
{{Main article| Astronomical naming conventions}}
Over the last few hundred years, the number of identified astronomical objects has risen from hundreds to over a billion, and more are discovered every year. Astronomers need universal systematic designations to unambiguously identify all of these objects using [[astronomical naming conventions]], while assigning names to the most interesting objects and, where relevant, naming important or interesting features of those objects.

The '''IUPAC nomenclature''' is a system of naming [[chemical compound]]s and for describing the science of [[chemistry]] in general. It is maintained by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]. The rules for naming [[Organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic compound]]s are printed in two publications, the ''Blue Book''&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4607">'''PACE''' is an acronym and methodology used to build a communication plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/call/call_01-1_commoc2.htm |title=Preparation and Planning of Tactical Communications |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://survivalttp.com/2012/02/pace-primary-alternate-contingency-emergency-survival-planning/ |title=PACE (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) Survival Planning |publisher=Survival TTP |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PACE stands for Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency means (i.e. technologies or systems) of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graywolfsurvival.com/2096/prepping-101-how-to-plan-pace/ |title=Prepping 101: How to plan using PACE |publisher=Graywolfsurvival.com |date=2014-03-01 |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method requires the author to determine the different parties that need to communicate and then determine, if possible, the best four forms of communication between each of those parties. PACE also designates the order in which an element will move through available communications systems until contact can be established with the desired distant element(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=MAJ MICHAEL S. RYAN |url=https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/magazine/issues/2013/Jul-Sep/pdfs/Ryan.pdf |title=A SHORT NOTE ON PACE PLANS |publisher=U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence |date= |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideally each method will be completely separate and independent of the other systems of communication.  For each method, the receiver must first sense which one the sender is using and then respond.

A PACE-based Communication Plan exists for a specific mission or task, not a specific unit, because the plan must consider both intra- and inter-unit sharing of information.  An organization may have multiple plans for different situations, activities, and/or partners. 

Per the US Army, a PACE Comm plan "designates the order in which an element will move through available communications systems until contact can be established with the desired distant element."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/magazine/issues/2013/Jul-Sep/pdfs/Ryan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A PACE plan is not a frequency plan (which details [https://www.fcc.gov/engineering-technology/policy-and-rules-division/general/radio-spectrum-allocation frequency allocation] and radio spectrum characteristics) or [http://www.arrl.org/band-plan band plan] (to avoid interference) or channel plan (which details which channels users listen/talk upon)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/nifog-v1-4-resized-for-pda-viewing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or deployment plan (which details the users' radios types and locations).  


'''Primary''' = the best and intended method of communication between parties.

'''Alternate''' = another common but less-optimal method of accomplishing the task.  Often monitored concurrently with primary means.

'''Contingency''' = method will not be as fast/easy/inexpensive/convenient as the first two methods but is capable of accomplishing the task. Often (but undesirably) the receiver rarely monitors this method.

'''Emergency''' = method of last resort and typically has significant delays, costs, and/or impacts.  Often only monitored when the others means fail.


'''A few examples.'''
* PACE for the public radio station [[WYSO]] to share local news with a citywide audience might be Primary: FM radio, Alternate: streaming over the Internet, Contingency: local newspaper articles, and Emergency: direct mailing newsletters
** PACE would not use a different FM transmitter, antenna, and/or frequency.  Those are described as redundant Primary means.
* PACE for an Army convoy to talk internally might be Primary: secure military radio, Alternate: secure satellite telephone, Contingency: cellular phones, and Emergency: courier.
** PACE would not be changing channels, encryption, location, or power levels on the military radio.  All of those still use the Primary means.
* PACE for two suburban American families who live blocks apart might be Primary: text messaging via smartphones, Alternate: web-based email, Contingency: landline telephone, and Emergency: driving/biking/walking.
* PACE for two [[Boy Scout]] patrols across a lake might be Primary: [[flag semaphore]], Alternate: [[Morse code]] using clapping wood boards, Contingency: [[Morse code]] using a mirror, and Emergency: sending a boat across.

A '''public bad''', in [[economics]], is the symmetry of a [[public good]]. [[Air pollution]] is the most obvious example since it is non-excludable and non-rival, and negatively affects welfare.&lt;ref&gt;For current definitions of public bads see: Charles D. Kolstad, ''Environmental Economics'' Second Edition {{ISBN|0-19-973264-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas public goods are typically under-provided by decentralized decision making (the market), public bad will generally be over-provided, since the parties generating the public bad do not account for the negative effects (or [[externality]]) imposed on others. One possibility to mitigate the existence of public bad is the intervention of a third party, typically the state.

In "[[green economics]]", it is a [[Good (economics)|good]] that produces socially undesirable results (or an externality in standard economics). Most "green economists" advise [[measuring]] such impacts back to the present from the [[Seven generation sustainability|seventh generation]].  Thus in the golf course example, both the recreation and the negative impacts from deforestation, associated [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and [[biodiversity loss]], and [[pesticide]] toxicity would be estimated across those generations and some [[amortization]] applied to determine whether the golf course was a [[public benefit]] or a public bad from the point of view of that seventh generation.

Green economists argue that the costs of public bads are [[hidden cost|hidden]] as [[externality|externalities]] from the businesses that cause them &amp;mdash; meaning the market is not working correctly. The legal challenge is to create a system that takes into account these costs. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] is an example of an attempt to make sure the costs of public bads are taken into account, although some groups on the right and left have criticized the value of its efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10924">A '''radius clause''' is a form of [[non-compete clause]] used in the [[live music]] industry, in which a [[tour promoter]] stipulates that a performer, for a certain length of time prior to or following an appearance at a concert or [[music festival|festival]], must not hold concerts at other locations within a certain radius of the city where they are to perform. In essence, it gives the promoter a form of territorial exclusivity, ensuring that the performer does not book concerts with competing promoters and venues in nearby areas, which can undermine ticket sales for their main event.

Critics in favor of radius clauses have agreed with their intent to protect the investments of organizers into the production and promotion of music events,&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt; and that they are a worthwhile trade-off for acts wanting to obtain the expanded exposure that a festival performance can provide. Others have criticized the concept, arguing that they effectively discourage major acts from performing in smaller cities, and are influenced by a profit-oriented mentality in the live events industry. In 2010, the state of [[Illinois]] also launched an [[antitrust]] investigation into the use of radius clauses by [[Lollapalooza]].

== Effects ==
Radius clauses contractually ensure that a particular act does not hold events at competing venues or festivals within a certain distance of a city in which they are scheduled to perform, for a length of time prior to and/or after the performance.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt; For example, a band booked to perform at a venue in San Francisco may be barred from performing in cities within a {{convert|60|mile|km}} radius of San Francisco, for 60 days, before and after the concert. These clauses intend to maximize ticket sales; as an act cannot also perform concerts in smaller, nearby markets, fans in these markets are forced to instead buy tickets for the act in the major market.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt;&lt;ref name=bohemian-dreaded&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hecht|first1=Anna|title=The Dreaded Radius Clause|url=http://www.bohemian.com/northbay/the-dreaded-radius-clause/Content?oid=2458475|website=Bohemian.com|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of radius clauses has been considered controversial by some venue owners—especially those who own small-market venues in proximity to larger markets, or those in markets with a large number of venues—as they affect their ability to book major acts. In the city of Chicago, radius clauses imposed by the city's major music festival [[Lollapalooza]] can make it difficult for venues and [[block party|block parties]] around the city to book major acts during the lucrative summer months. Similar effects are faced by the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] in the lead-up to the [[Coachella Festival]], although they are not as pronounced as those of Lollapalooza because their radius clauses fall during the winter months.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt;&lt;ref name=bohemian-dreaded/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts/&gt;

[[Dangerbird Records]] founder [[Jeff Castelaz]] argued that such clauses were a "reality" in the music business, and that in relation to music festivals, since promoters are &lt;blockquote&gt;putting up millions of millions of dollars to market and promote this festival, not to mention the money that they're putting on the table as guarantees for the bands, they have to have rules about people playing in the markets where they'll get their tickets from.&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On the other hand, while noting that festival appearances can be a significant milestone for an up-and-coming act rather than exclusively playing clubs, talent agency head Tom Windish felt that there was a mentality in the live events industry where "if you don't have 75,000 people at your event, it's a failure."&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts/&gt;

=== Coachella ===
The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] uses radius clauses which, as of 2012, could prevent acts from performing in [[Los Angeles]], the [[Inland Empire]], or [[San Diego]] for up to three months before and after the festival. The festival has allowed some of its acts to make appearances in the region prior to the festival, but only at events and venues owned or controlled by festival owner [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG)—such as [[Jay-Z]] at [[Staples Center]] in 2010. That year also marked the first time Coachella had ever sold out in advance.&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts&gt;{{cite web|title=Coachella and destination festivals: the hidden costs|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/04/coachella-and-destination-festivals-the-hidden-costs.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kpcc-bendrules&gt;{{cite web|title=Coachella organizers bend rules on bands playing non-festival venues|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/04/17/32062/coachella-organizers-bend-rules-bands-playing-non-/|publisher=[[KPCC]]|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr-coachella&gt;{{cite web|title=Marooned in L.A.

In 2018, the organizers of the  [[Portland, Oregon]] Soul'd Out Music Festival filed an [[antitrust]] lawsuit against AEG, alleging that Coachella had enforced radius clauses much stricter than previously reported. In its original complaint, the organizers stated that the restrictions had extended to the entirety of [[California]], as well as [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In an amended complaint, the organizers identified that Coachella performers are forbidden from:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/festivals/8462036/coachella-radius-clause-details-exposed-lawsuit-oregon-festival |title=Coachella's Radius Clause Details Exposed in Legal Fight With Oregon Festival |first=Dave |last=Brooks |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] |date=June 20, 2018 |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During a period that starts on the December 15 prior to Coachella and ends on the following May 1.
** Playing any festival in North America
** Playing any "hard ticket" concerts in Southern California
* Publicizing any tour stops in California, Arizona, Oregon, or Washington until after the Coachella lineup is announced.
* Publicizing any performances at competing festivals in California, its bordering states, and Washington, or a headlining concert in Southern California, until May 8.
* Publicizing any performances at competing festivals in the remainder of the United States (except for the [[New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival]], [[South by Southwest]], and [[Ultra Music Festival]]) until after the Coachella lineup is announced.  With respect to Nevada, they can publicize appearances at Las Vegas casinos, or tour stops in other parts of Nevada, but cannot publicize Las Vegas festival appearances.

=== Other events ===
In April 2010, it was reported that [[Illinois Attorney General]] [[Lisa Madigan]] had launched an antitrust investigation into the [[Lollapalooza]] festival's use of radius clauses.&lt;ref name=rollingstone-lolla/&gt; It was alleged that the festival had imposed radius clauses on performers that were so strict, that some acts were barred from performing within {{convert|300|miles|km}} of Chicago&amp;mdash;including cities as far as [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Milwaukee]]&amp;mdash;for as long as six months prior to, and three months after Lollapalooza.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall&gt;{{cite web|title=So maybe Coachella's booking rules aren't so egregious after all|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/so-maybe-coachellas-booking-rules-arent-so-egregious-after-all.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone-lolla&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorney General Investigates Lollapalooza|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/attorney-general-investigates-lollapalooza-20100625|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[Toronto]] festival [[NXNE]] announced that it would drop a 45-day radius clause it had implemented for its 2014 edition, following protests by fans and artists (including a [[Change.org]] petition with over 3000 signatures), with a particular emphasis on its effects on emerging artists. NXNE 2014 marked the first time that it had been held just weeks after [[Canadian Music Week]] (CMW)&amp;mdash;which had moved to May from its traditional March date; the clause had been implemented primarily to prevent NXNE acts from performing at CMW.&lt;ref name=billboard-nxnegetalong&gt;{{cite web|title=How Canadian Music Week and NXNE Are Learning To Get Along|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/6084679/canadian-music-week-nxne-learning-to-get-along|website=Billboard|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-cmwradius&gt;{{cite web|title=NXNE, CMW Remove Radius Clause While 'Why NXNE Sucks' Panel Rages|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/6128814/nxne-cmw-remove-radius-clause-while-why-nxne-sucks-panel-rages|website=Billboard|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[South By Southwest]] (SXSW) was the subject of criticism for several controversial clauses in its performance contracts, including one warning that international performers entering the United States under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] to perform at SXSW would face threats of deportation and passport revocation if they performed outside of their "official" events (a large number of parties unaffiliated with SXSW are held in [[Austin]] alongside the official festival). Managing director Roland Swenson stated that this clause was based on U.S. immigration law; performing in the country requires a [[work visa]], but SXSW performers have typically qualified under the Visa Waiver Program because it classifies itself as an "industry showcase". Those who do perform under this clause are legally forbidden from performing any shows beyond the specific showcase they have been granted permission for. Some critics initially interpreted this statement as being a traditional radius clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6859106/uk-musicians-union-task-force-unequal-visa-system-uk-us|title=Task Force Assembled to Address an Unequal Visa System for U.K. Musicians|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/03/how-sxsw-got-pegged-as-the-anti-immigration-music-festival/|title=How SXSW Got Pegged as the Anti-Immigration Music Festival|date=2017-03-03|work=Spin|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tanjore Nayak Kingdom.jpg|thumb|Tanjore Nayak Kingdom]]
The '''''Raghunāthābhyudayam''''' (or ''Raghunāthā-bhyudayam'', ''Raghunāthābhyudaya'', ''Ragunatha Abhyudaya'') by [[Rāmabhadrāmbā]], one of the wives of the [[Thanjavur Nayak]] king [[Raghunatha Nayak]] (r. 1600-34), is a Sanskrit ''[[Mahakavya|mahākāvya]]'' in twelve cantos. It was designed to valorise Raghunatha, situating his career as a type of the life of Rāma-Viṣṇu-Kṛṣṇa.&lt;ref&gt;Davesh Soneji, ''Performing Satyabhimi: Text, Context, Memory and Mimesis in Telugu-Speaking South India'' (unpublished PhD thesis, McGill University 2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first few cantos of the poem invoke Raghunatha, seeking his patronage and assistance, and praise his generosity, piety, and intellect. Canto 4 presents Raghunatha's ancestry and the subsequent cantos discuss his early life and military successes. He succeeds his father [[Achuthappa Nayak]] in canto 8 and continues with his military exploits. The last two cantos focus on the cultural activities and artistic achievements of his court, with a colophon in which Rāmabhadrāmbā emphasises her own merits.

The poem was first brought to scholarly attention by [[S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar]] in 1919, after he found it in November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Rāmabhadrāmbā, 'Raghunāthābhyudayam', in ''Sources of Vijayanagar History (Selected and Edited for the University)'', ed. by S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar [and A. Rangaswami Sarasvati], The Madras University Historical Series, 1 (Madras: University of Madras, 1919), pp. 284-302 [no. 91] (p. 284), https://archive.org/details/sourcesofvijayan00krisrich.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was fiercely criticised by an early reviewer of the first scholarly edition, who claimed that Rāmabhadrāmbā 'had thoroughly assimilated the art of composing a poem of surpassing tediousness and consisting of the most abject flattery of her royal patron' and did not think the poem would have any interest to historians.&lt;ref&gt;J. C., review of ''Raghunāthābhyudaya of Rāmabhadrāmbā (A Historical Poem)''. Edited by T. R. Chintamani. (Bulletins of the Sanskrit Department, No. 2.) pp. viii + 78. University of Madras, 1934. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', 7 (1935), 961-62, doi:10.1017/S0041977X00086377&lt;/ref&gt; But it has since been identified as a significant source for the cultural history of seventeenth-century south India.&lt;ref&gt;Velcheru Narayana Rao, and David Shulman, 'History, Biography and Poetry at the Tanjavur Nayaka Court', ''Social Analysis'' 25 (1989), 115–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rāmabhadrāmbā's Sanskrit ''Raghunāthābhyudayam'' is not to be confused with the identically named Telugu poem the ''Raghunāthābhyudayam'' and the similarly named ''Raghunāthanāyakabhyudayamu'', both composed by Raghunatha's eldest son and successor, [[Vijaya Raghava Nayak|Vijayarāghava Nāyaka]].&lt;ref&gt;''Raghunāthanāyakābhyudayamu and Raghunāthābhyudayamu'', ed. by N. Venkataramanayya and M. Somasekhara Sarma, Madras: Government Oriental Series, 49/Tanjore Saraswathi Mahal Series, 32 (Madras, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lord of the Rings''''' is a [[film series]] consisting of three [[epic film|epic]] [[fantasy]] [[adventure film]]s directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. They are based on the novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The films are subtitled ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' (2003). They are a New Zealand-American venture produced by [[WingNut Films]] and [[Saul Zaentz|The Saul Zaentz Company]] and distributed by [[New Line Cinema]].

The trilogy was one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken. It had a budget of $281 to $330 million depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8mxughWAOEC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Lord+of+the+Rings+$310&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6l2tnemKXP&amp;sig=TZjpzxpco_8lECzvNqrytga0ryw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uUniU870OoKqyASH4oCACg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%24310&amp;f=false|title=The Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three films were shot over eight years simultaneously and entirely in Jackson's native [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2178504-can-harry-potter-work-his-magic-on-oscar-/ |title=Can Harry Potter work his magic on Oscar? |work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]] |agency=[[McClatchy-Tribune News Service]] |date=26 November 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207115537/http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2178504-can-harry-potter-work-his-magic-on-oscar-/ |archivedate=7 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One in every 160 New Zealanders was part of the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaino|first1=Lorna|title=What Difference Does a Museum Make?

While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.

Set in the fictional world of [[Middle-earth]], the films follow the [[hobbit]] [[Frodo Baggins]] ([[Elijah Wood]]) as he and the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] embark on a quest to destroy the [[One Ring]], and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] ([[Sean Astin]]) and the treacherous [[Gollum]] ([[Andy Serkis]]). Meanwhile, [[Aragorn]] ([[Viggo Mortensen]]), heir in exile to the throne of [[Gondor]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and the [[wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Gandalf]] ([[Ian McKellen]]) unite to rally the [[Middle-earth peoples#Free peoples|Free Peoples of Middle-earth]] in the [[War of the Ring]].

The series was received with overwhelming praise and was a major financial success, with the films collectively being [[List of highest-grossing franchises and film series |among the highest-grossing film series]] of all time. The films were critically acclaimed and [[List of accolades received by The Lord of the Rings film series|heavily awarded]], winning 17 out of 30 total [[Academy Award]] nominations. The final film in the series, ''The Return of the King'', won all 11 of its Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, which also tied it with ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' for most Academy Awards received for a film. The series received wide praise for its innovative special and visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_fellowship_of_the_ring/| accessdate = 12 October 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060709081538/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_fellowship_of_the_ring/ |archivedate = 9 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers/| accessdate = 12 October 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061129014020/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers/ |archivedate = 29 November 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king/| accessdate = 12 October 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060709081024/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king/ |archivedate = 9 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
Director Peter Jackson first came into contact with ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when he saw [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 animated film ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. Jackson "enjoyed the film and wanted to know more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Peter Jackson interview |date=October–November 2001 |work=Explorations (the Barnes &amp; Noble Science Fiction newsletter) |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he read a tie-in edition of the book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ian Nathan|title=Peter Jackson|page=90|publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=28 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a twelve-hour train journey from [[Wellington]] to [[Auckland]] when he was seventeen.&lt;ref name="Sibley-11"&gt;Sibley (2001), pp.11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Jackson was finishing ''[[The Frighteners]]'' and considered ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a new project, wondering "why nobody else seemed to be doing anything about it".&lt;ref name="Sibley-11"/&gt; With the new developments in [[computer-generated imagery]] following ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', Jackson set about planning a fantasy film that would be relatively serious and feel real. By October, he and his partner [[Fran Walsh]] teamed up with [[Miramax Films]] boss [[Harvey Weinstein]] to negotiate with [[Saul Zaentz]] who had held the [[Film rights|rights]] to the book since the early 1970s, pitching an adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and two films based on ''The Lord of the Rings''. Negotiations then stalled when [[Universal Studios]] offered Jackson a [[remake]] of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.&lt;ref name="cheat"&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher=Harper Collins | year =2006 | location =London | pages =310–328 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 | chapter = Cheats, Spooks, Hobbits and Apes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein was furious, and further problems arose when it turned out Zaentz did not have distribution rights to ''The Hobbit''; [[United Artists]], which was in the market, did. By April 1996, the rights question was still not resolved.&lt;ref name="cheat"/&gt;

Jackson decided to move ahead with ''King Kong'' before filming ''The Lord of the Rings'', prompting Universal to enter a deal with Miramax to receive foreign earnings from ''The Lord of the Rings'' while Miramax received foreign earnings from ''King Kong''.&lt;ref name="cheat"/&gt; It was also revealed that Jackson originally wanted to finish ''King Kong'' before ''The Lord of the Rings'' began. But due to location problems, he decided to start with ''The Lord of the Rings'' franchise instead.

When Universal cancelled ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 1997,&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web| last = Watkin| first = Tim| title = The 'Rings' movies, a potted history|work=The New Zealand Herald| url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=200&amp;objectid=232465| date = 12 August 2001| accessdate = 21 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson and Walsh immediately received support from Weinstein and began a six-week [[Chain of title|process of sorting out the rights]]. Jackson and Walsh asked Costa Botes to write a [[Abridgement|synopsis]] of the book and they began to re-read the book. Two to three months later, they had written their [[Film treatment|treatment]].&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher=Harper Collins | year =2006 | location =London | pages =329–87 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 | chapter = Quest for the Ring }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first film would have dealt with what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'', and the beginning of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'', ending with [[Saruman]]'s death, and [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] going to [[Minas Tirith]]. In this treatment, [[Gwaihir]] and Gandalf visit [[Edoras]] after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and [[Farmer Maggot]], [[Glorfindel]], [[Radagast (Middle-earth)|Radagast]], [[Elladan and Elrohir]] are present. Bilbo attends the [[Council of Elrond]], Sam looks into [[Galadriel]]'s [[Mirror of Galadriel|mirror]], Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the [[Nazgûl]] just make it into [[Mount Doom]] before they fall.&lt;ref name="quest"/&gt; They presented their treatment to Harvey and [[Bob Weinstein]], the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had not read the book. They agreed upon two films and a total budget of $75&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="quest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/03/kill-bilbo-weinstein-threatened-to-hire-tarantino-for-lord-of-the-rings&lt;/ref&gt;

During mid-1997,&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE"&gt;{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Appendices|medium = DVD|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]] |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson and Walsh began writing with [[Stephen Sinclair]].&lt;ref name="quest"/&gt; Sinclair's partner, [[Philippa Boyens]], was a major fan of the book and joined the writing team after reading their treatment.&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE"/&gt; It took 13–14 months to write the two film scripts,&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE"/&gt; which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to theatrical obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, as occurs in the original novel. In the final treatment Sam, Merry, and Pippin infer the existence of One Ring and voluntarily go along after confronting Frodo about it.  Gandalf's account of his time at [[Orthanc]] was pulled out of flashback and [[Lothlórien]] was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. [[Denethor]] attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having [[Arwen]] rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll]]. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the [[Witch-king]].&lt;ref name="quest"/&gt;

Trouble struck when [[Marty Katz]] was sent to New Zealand. Spending four months there, he told Miramax that the films were more likely to cost $150&amp;nbsp;million, and with Miramax unable to finance this, and with $15&amp;nbsp;million already spent, they decided to merge the two films into one. On 17 June 1998, Bob Weinstein presented a treatment of a single two-hour film version of the book. He suggested cutting [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]] and the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], "losing or using" [[Saruman]], merging [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] with [[Éowyn]] as [[Boromir]]'s sister, shortening [[Rivendell]] and [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] as well as having [[Ent]]s prevent the [[Uruk-hai]] from kidnapping Merry and Pippin.&lt;ref name="quest"/&gt; Upset by the idea of "cutting out half the good stuff"&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE"/&gt; Jackson balked, and Miramax declared that any script or work completed by [[Weta Workshop]] was theirs.&lt;ref name="quest"/&gt; Jackson went around Hollywood for four weeks,&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE"/&gt; showing a thirty-five-minute video of their work, before meeting with [[New Line Cinema]]'s [[Mark Ordesky]].&lt;ref&gt;Sibley (2006), pp.388–92&lt;/ref&gt; At New Line Cinema, [[Robert Shaye]] viewed the video, and then asked why they were making two films when the book was published as three volumes (this was later corrected: New Line only made this choice out of economical reasons);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/06/11/73279-10-things-you-know-about-the-lotr-movies-that-arent-true/ |title=10 Things You Know About The LOTR Movies (That Aren't True) |work=theonering.net |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726011631/http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/06/11/73279-10-things-you-know-about-the-lotr-movies-that-arent-true/ |archivedate=26 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he wanted to make a film trilogy. Now Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to write three new scripts.&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE"/&gt;

The expansion to three films allowed much more creative freedom, although Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to restructure their script accordingly. The three films do not correspond exactly to the trilogy's three volumes, but rather represent a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]]. Jackson takes a more [[chronology|chronological]] approach to the story than did Tolkien. Frodo's quest is the main focus, and Aragorn is the main sub-plot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Head |first=Steve |title=An interview with Peter Jackson |publisher=IGN |date=13 December 2002 |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/380/380092p1.html |accessdate=24 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222005531/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/380/380092p1.html |archivedate=22 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many sequences (such as [[Tom Bombadil]]) that do not contribute directly to those two plots were left out. Much effort was put into creating satisfactory conclusions and making sure [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] did not bog down the pacing. Amongst new sequences, there are also expansions on elements Tolkien kept ambiguous, such as the [[battle]]s and the creatures. During [[Filmmaking#Production|shooting]], the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE"/&gt; Most notable amongst these rewrites was the character [[Arwen]], who was originally planned as a warrior princess, but reverted to her book counterpart, who remains physically inactive in the story (though she sends moral and military support).&lt;ref name="TTT SEE"&gt;{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers "Appendices"| medium = DVD| publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop fight and sword choreography for the series, the filmmakers employed Hollywood sword-master [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]]. Anderson worked directly with the talent including [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Karl Urban]] to develop the film's many sword fights and stunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0026428|Bob Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Anderson's role in ''The Lord of the Rings'' series was highlighted in the film ''[[Reclaiming the Blade]]''. This documentary on sword martial arts also featured [[Weta Workshop]] and [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]], ''The Lord of the Rings'' illustrator John Howe and actors [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Karl Urban]]. All discussed their roles and work on the series as related to the sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0961079|Reclaiming the Blade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production design ==
[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|Alan Lee at Worldcon 2005 in Glasgow, August 2005.]]
{{Main article|Production design of The Lord of the Rings film series}}
Jackson began [[storyboarding]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]] in August 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.&lt;ref name="TTT Art"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Russell| first = Gary| authorlink = Gary Russell| title = The Art of the Two Towers| publisher=Harper Collins| year = 2003| isbn = 0-00-713564-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson hired long-time collaborator [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] to lead [[Weta Workshop]] on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997,&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE" /&gt; famed Tolkien illustrators [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]] and [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]] joined the project. Most of the imagery in the films is based on their various illustrations.&lt;ref name="Lord of the Films"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Braun| first = J.W.| title = The Lord of the Films| publisher=ECW Press| year = 2009| isbn = 978-1-55022-890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Production designer]] [[Grant Major]] was charged with the task of converting Lee and Howe's designs into architecture, creating models of the sets, while [[Dan Hennah]] worked as [[Art director#In film|art director]], scouting locations and organising the building of sets.

Jackson's vision of [[Middle-earth]] was described as being "[[Ray Harryhausen]] meets [[David Lean]]" by [[Randy Cook]].&lt;ref name="ROTK SEE"&gt;{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King "Appendices"| medium = DVD| publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted to make the world rational and believable. For example, the [[New Zealand Army]] helped build [[Hobbiton]] months before filming began so the plants could really grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hobbiton is being built |publisher=The One Ring.net |date=12 April 2006 |url=http://www.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/923891184 |accessdate=15 October 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011173905/http://www.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/923891184 |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the [[Fell beast (Middle-earth)|fell beast]] to help it fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = French | first = Lawrence | editor=Paul A.

== Filming ==
{{Main article|Principal photography of The Lord of the Rings film series}}

[[Principal photography]] for all three films was conducted concurrently in many locations within New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks. Filming took place between 11 October 1999 and 22 December 2000, a period of {{age in days|1999|10|11|2000|12|22}} days. [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|Pick-up]] shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2003. The series was shot at over 150 different locations,&lt;ref name="Trilogy book" /&gt; with seven different units shooting, as well as soundstages around [[Wellington]] and [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]]. Along with Jackson directing the whole production, other unit directors included John Mahaffie, [[Geoff Murphy]], [[Fran Walsh]], Barrie Osbourne, Rick Porras, and any other assistant director, producer, or writer available. Jackson monitored these units with live satellite feeds, and with the added pressure of constant script re-writes and the multiple units interpreting his envisioned result, he only got around four hours of sleep a night.&lt;ref name="TTT SEE" /&gt; Due to the remoteness of some of the locations, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters could not reach the location to bring them home in time.&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE" /&gt; The [[New Zealand Department of Conservation]] was criticised for approving the filming within national parks without adequate consideration of the adverse environmental effects and without public notification.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. 2002. 'The Lord of the Rings and Vertical Limits Film Concessions and the Conservation Act 1987', 4 ''Butterworths Resource Management Bulletin'' Vol. 11:125–129, Butterworths of NZ, Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; The adverse effects of filming battle scenes in [[Tongariro National Park]] meant that the park later required restoration work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=38714 Tongariro/Taupo Conservation Awards 2005], Department of Conservation Regional Awards.

[[Image:Armadura élfica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of Elvish armour from the films.]]
Each film had the benefit of a full year of post-production time before its respective December release, often finishing in October–November, with the crew immediately going to work on the next film. In this period's later part, Jackson would move to London to supervise the scoring and continue editing, while having a computer feed for discussions to The Dorchester Hotel, and a "fat pipe" of Internet connections from [[Pinewood Studios]] to look at the special effects. He had a video link and [[5.1 surround sound]] to organise meetings, and listen to new music and sound effects generally wherever he was. The extended editions also had a tight schedule at the start of each year to complete special effects and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/ipod-helped-to-make-lord-of-the-rings/ |title=iPod helped to make Lord of the Rings |author=Dennis Lloyd |publisher=iLounge |date=19 November 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217034716/http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/ipod-helped-to-make-lord-of-the-rings/ |archivedate=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editing ===
To avoid pressure, Jackson hired a different editor for each film. [[John Gilbert (film editor)|John Gilbert]] worked on the first film, [[Michael J. Horton|Mike Horton]] and [[Jabez Olssen]] on the second and longtime Jackson collaborator [[Jamie Selkirk]] and [[Annie Collins]] on the third. Daily rushes would often last up to four hours, with scenes being done throughout 1999–2002 for the rough (4½ hours) assemblies of the films.&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE" /&gt; In total, 1828&amp;nbsp;km (six million feet) of film&lt;ref name="Trilogy book" /&gt; was edited down to the 11 hours and 23&amp;nbsp;minutes (683&amp;nbsp;minutes) of Extended running time. This was the final area of shaping of the films, when Jackson realised that sometimes the best scripting could be redundant on screen, as he picked apart scenes every day from multiple takes.

The first film's editing was relatively easygoing, with Jackson coming up with the concept of an Extended Edition later on, although after a screening to New Line they had to re-edit the beginning for a prologue. ''The Two Towers'' was always acknowledged by the crew as the most difficult film to make, as "it had no beginning or end", and had the additional problem of inter-cutting storylines appropriately. Jackson even continued editing the film when that part of the schedule officially ended, resulting in some scenes, including the reforging of [[Andúril]], Gollum's back-story, and Saruman's demise, being moved to ''The Return of the King''. Later, Saruman's demise was cut from the theatrical edition (but included in the Extended edition) when Jackson felt it was not starting the third film effectively enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hey, what happened to Saruman?|publisher=CNN|date=17 December 2003|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/17/film.rings.saruman.ap/|accessdate=15 October 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525194031/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/17/film.rings.saruman.ap/|archivedate=25 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all parts of the third film's post-production, editing was very chaotic. The first time Jackson actually saw the completed film was at the Wellington premiere.

Many filmed scenes remain unused, even in the Extended Editions. Promotional material for ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' contained an attack by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] from Moria on Lothlórien after the Fellowship leaves Moria, replaced with a more suspenseful entrance for the Fellowship. Also cut were scenes from the book, including Frodo seeing more of Middle-earth at [[Parth Galen]] and an extended Council of Elrond,&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE" /&gt; and new scenes with an attack upon Frodo and Sam at the river [[Anduin]] by an Uruk-hai.&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE" /&gt; The major cut to ''The Two Towers'' featured Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at Lothlórien, with Arwen then leading the Elven reinforcements to Helm's Deep.&lt;ref name="TTT SEE" /&gt; This scene, and a flashback to Arwen and Aragorn's first meeting, was cut during a revision of the film's plot; the Elves' appearance was explained with a telepathic communication between Elrond and Galadriel.&lt;ref name="TTT SEE" /&gt;

Éowyn was to have a greater role in defending the refugees in the [[Glittering Caves]] from Uruk-hai intruders,&lt;ref&gt;''The Fellowship of the Ring'' DVD preview of ''The Two Towers'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; while in Osgiliath, Faramir was to have a vision of Frodo becoming like Gollum,&lt;ref name="TTT SEE" /&gt; with Frodo and Sam having an extended fight sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Elijah Wood and Sean Astin on ''The Two Towers'' Extended Edition commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed for ''The Return of the King'' were two scenes present in the book; Sam using the [[List of Middle-earth objects#Phial_of_Galadriel|Phial of Galadriel]] to pass the Watchers at [[Cirith Ungol]], and further epilogue footage, with endings for Legolas and Gimli, Éowyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knowles |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Knowles |title=There and Back Again: A Geek's Adventures in Middle-earth, CHAPTER FOUR! |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |date=17 December 2000 |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=7728 |accessdate=15 October 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326131514/http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=7728 |archivedate=26 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sauron was to fight Aragorn at the Black Gate, but with Jackson deciding the scene was inappropriate, a computer-generated Troll was used instead.&lt;ref name="ROTK SEE" /&gt; To give context for Wormtongue killing Saruman, and Legolas in turn killing Wormtongue, it was to be revealed Wormtongue poisoned [[Théodred]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson in ''The Return of the King'' audio commentary&lt;/ref&gt; The final scene cut was Aragorn having his armour fitted for the [[Battle of the Morannon|Battle of the Black Gate]] by the trilogy's armourers, which was the final scene filmed during principal photography.&lt;ref name="ROTK SEE" /&gt; Peter Jackson has stated that he would like to include some of these unused scenes in a future "Ultimate Edition" home video release, also including out-takes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Jackson talks of Lord of the Rings Ultimate Box Set|publisher=The Movie Blog.com|url=http://www.themovieblog.com/2005/01/peter-jackson-talks-of-lord-of-the-rings-ultimate-box-set|accessdate=14 January 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228120806/http://www.themovieblog.com/2005/01/peter-jackson-talks-of-lord-of-the-rings-ultimate-box-set|archivedate=28 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main article| Music of The Lord of the Rings film series}}

[[File:Howard Shore, Canadian Film Centre, 2013-1.jpg|thumb|Howard Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted, and produced the trilogy's music.]]
[[Howard Shore]] composed, orchestrated, conducted, and produced the trilogy's music. He was hired in August 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Davidson |first=Paul |title=Lord of the Rings Composer Confirmed |publisher=IGN |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034262p1.html |date=15 August 2000 |accessdate=14 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831202427/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034262p1.html |archivedate=31 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and visited the set, and watched the assembly cuts of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and ''The Return of the King''. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) [[leitmotifs]] to represent various characters, cultures, and places - the largest catalogue of leitmotives in the history of cinema, surpassing - for comparison - that of the entire [[Music of Star Wars|Star Wars saga]]. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington,&lt;ref name="FOTR SEE" /&gt; virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in [[Watford Colosseum|Watford Town Hall]] and mixed at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for ''The Two Towers'' he stayed for twelve. As a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] fan, Jackson had a photo tribute done there on the [[zebra crossing]].&lt;ref name="TTT SEE" /&gt;

The score is primarily played by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] (ranging from 93 to 120 players throughout the recording), [[London Voices]], London Oratory School Schola boy choir, and many artists such as [[Ben Del Maestro]], [[Enya]], [[Renée Fleming]], [[James Galway]], [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Emilíana Torrini]] contributed. Even actors [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Liv Tyler]], [[Miranda Otto]] (extended cuts only for the latter two), and Peter Jackson (for a single gong sound in the second film) contributed to the score. Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens served as librettists, writing lyrics to various music and songs, which [[David Salo]] translated into Tolkien's languages. The third film's end song, "[[Into the West (song)|Into the West]]", was a tribute to a young filmmaker Jackson and Walsh befriended named [[Cameron Duncan]], who died of cancer in 2003.&lt;ref name="ROTK SEE" /&gt;

Shore composed a main theme for ''The Fellowship'' rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted at different points in the series. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes.&lt;ref name="ROTK SEE" /&gt; The music for the series turned out to be a success and has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing ''[[Schindler's List]]'', ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lord of the Rings voted 'best movie soundtrack' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34748803 |website=BBC News |date=7 November 2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015 |language=en-GB |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120090121/http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34748803 |archivedate=20 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sound ===
Sound technicians spent the early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Warg]] howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the ''[[mûmakil]]'''s bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]] was used for most of the dialogue.

The technicians worked with New Zealand locals to get many of the sounds. They re-recorded sounds in abandoned tunnels for an echo-like effect in the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] sequence. 20,000 New Zealand cricket fans provided the sound of the Uruk-hai army in ''The Two Towers'', with Jackson acting as conductor during the innings break of a one-day international cricket match between England and New Zealand at [[Westpac Stadium]].&lt;ref name="TTT SEE" /&gt; They spent time recording sounds in a graveyard at night, and also had construction workers drop stone blocks for the sounds of boulders firing and landing in ''The Return of the King''. Mixing took place between August and November at "The Film Mix", before Jackson commissioned the building of a new studio in 2003. The building, however, had not yet been fully completed when they started mixing for ''The Return of the King''.&lt;ref name="ROTK SEE" /&gt;

=== Special effects ===
{{Main article|Special effects of The Lord of the Rings film series}}
The first film has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, and the third 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total increases to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by ''The Two Towers''. The crew, led by [[Jim Rygiel]] and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within the last six weeks of post-production of ''The Two Towers'', and the same happened again within the last six weeks on ''The Return of the King''.

==Releases==

===Theatrical===
The trilogy's online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000, and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7&amp;nbsp;million hits in the first 24 hours of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenite.org/faqs/lotr_movie/download-press-release.html |title=Lord of the Rings News &amp;#124; LoTR movie internet trailer preview |publisher=Xenite.org |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821192740/http://www.xenite.org/faqs/lotr_movie/download-press-release.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for ''[[Braveheart]]'' and ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' among other cuts. In 2001, 24&amp;nbsp;minutes of footage from the series, primarily the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] sequence, was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was very well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Paul |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/200/200155p1.html |title=IGN: LOTR Footage Wows Journalists |publisher=Uk.movies.ign.com |date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215011403/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/200/200155p1.html |archivedate=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The showing also included an area designed to look like [[Middle-earth]].&lt;ref name="Trilogy book" /&gt;

The first two films were released on standard two-disc edition DVDs containing previews of the next film. The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc Extended Editions, with new editing, added special effects and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Special Extended Edition) |url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/571/571469p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |accessdate=21 February 2011 |date=8 December 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005407/http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/571/571469p1.html |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extended cuts of the films and the included special features were spread over two discs, and a limited collector's edition was also released. ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' was released on 12 November 2002, containing 30&amp;nbsp;minutes more footage, an Alan Lee painting of the Fellowship entering Moria, and the Moria Gate on the back of the sleeve; an [[Argonath]]-styled bookend was included with the Collector's Edition. ''The Two Towers'', released on 18 November 2003, contained 44&amp;nbsp;minutes extra footage and a Lee painting of Gandalf the White's entrance; the Collector's Edition contained a Sméagol statue, with a crueller-looking statue of his Gollum persona available by order for a limited time.

''The Return of the King'' was released on 14 December 2004, having 51&amp;nbsp;minutes more footage, a Lee painting of the Grey Havens and a model of Minas Tirith for the Collector's Edition, with [[Minas Morgul]] available by order for a limited time. The Special Extended DVD Editions also had in-sleeve maps of the Fellowship's travels. They have also played at cinemas, most notably for a 16 December 2003 marathon screening (dubbed "Trilogy Tuesday") culminating in a late afternoon screening of the third film. Attendees of "Trilogy Tuesday" were given a limited edition keepsake from [[Sideshow Collectibles]] containing one random frame of film from each of the three movies. Both versions were put together in a Limited Edition "[[Seamless branching|branching]]" version, plus a new feature-length documentary by [[Costa Botes]]. The complete series was released in a six-disc set on 14 November 2006.

=== Academy Awards ===
{{See also|List of accolades received by The Lord of the Rings film series}}
The three films together were nominated for a total of 30 [[Academy Awards]], of which they won 17, a record for any movie trilogy (the three nominations for ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'' along with the single nomination for ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' brings the series' total to 37 nominations). ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' earned thirteen nominations, the most of any film at the [[74th Academy Awards]], winning four. ''The Return of the King'' won in every category in which it was nominated, setting the current Oscar record for the highest clean sweep, and its 11 [[Academy Awards]] wins ties the record held by ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (though both of those films had additional nominations that they ultimately lost). ''The Return of the King'' became only the second sequel to win the Oscar for Best Picture (after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'') and the first fantasy film to receive this honor, though this has been widely perceived as an award by proxy for the entire series (the first two films were also nominated for Best Picture).&lt;ref name="LA Times McNamara"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/02/news/la-en-fantasy-actors-20101202 |title=Critic's Notebook: Can 'Harry Potter' ever capture Oscar magic? |first=Mary |last=McNamara |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207143916/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/02/news/la-en-fantasy-actors-20101202 |archivedate=7 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No actors in any of the three films won Oscars, and [[Ian McKellen]] was the only actor in the trilogy to receive a nomination, for his work in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.&lt;ref name="LA Times McNamara"/&gt;

As well as Academy Awards, each film in the series won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], the [[MTV Movie Award for Best Movie]], and the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]]. The first and third films also won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]]. The soundtrack for ''The Two Towers'' did not receive a nomination because of a rule prohibiting a soundtrack including music from a previous soundtrack to be eligible for nomination. This rule was changed in time for ''The Return of the King'' to receive the Oscar for Best Music Score. The New York Film Critics Circle awarded ''The Return of the King'' its Best Picture Award at the 2003 Awards Ceremony, hosted by [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]], chair of the organization at that time, who called it "a masterful piece of filmmaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/3720057 |title=New York film critics honor 'Rings' |publisher=MSNBC |date=15 December 2003 |accessdate=10 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927185041/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/3720057 |archivedate=27 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions to changes in the films from the books ===
{{See also|List of original characters in The Lord of the Rings film series}}

The film series provoked both positive and negative reaction from fans and scholars of the novels, and was sometimes seen as changing parts Tolkien felt thematically necessary in terms of characters, themes, events and subtlety. Some fans of the book who disagreed with such changes have released [[fan edit]]s of the films such as ''The Lord of the Rings: The Purist Edition'',&lt;ref name="cimmerian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tolkien Purists Strike Back! |author=Leo Grin |url=http://www.thecimmerian.com/?p=739 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228132400/http://www.thecimmerian.com/?p=739 |archivedate=28 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Lord of the Rings: the purist edition | url = http://fanedit.org/true_fanedits/3ditor_lotr/3ditor_lotr.html | accessdate=28 December 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070922024756/http://www.fanedit.org/true_fanedits/3ditor_lotr/3ditor_lotr.html |archivedate = 22 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which removed many of the changes to bring them closer to the original.

Various changes to characters such as [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Arwen]], [[Denethor]], [[Faramir]], [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], when considered together, were seen by some to alter the tone and themes found in the books. Several critics contend that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.&lt;ref name="akers-jordan"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Akers-Jordan|first=Cathy|chapter=Fairy Princess or Tragic Heroine?

[[Janet Brennan Croft]] criticized the films using Tolkien's own terms "anticipation" and "flattening", which she used in critiquing a [[Adaptations of The Lord of the Rings#Early efforts|proposed film script]]. She contrasts Tolkien's subtlety with Jackson's tendency to show "too much too soon".&lt;ref name="Croft2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Croft|first=Jannet Brennan|chapter= Mithril Coats and Tin Ears: ‘Anticipation’ and ‘Flattening’ in Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings Trilogy|title=Tolkien on Film: Essays on Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings|editor-last=Croft|editor-first=Janet Brennan|publisher=[[Mythopoeic Society|Mythopoeic Press]]|date=1 January 2005|location=Altadena|isbn=978-1-887726-09-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the series assert that it is a worthy interpretation of the book and that most of the changes were necessary.&lt;ref name="Lord of the Films"/&gt; Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including &lt;!-- any others besides... --&gt;[[Christopher Lee]], who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0000489|name=Christopher Lee|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philippa Boyens|Boyens]] once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book.

The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming the whole story of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was probably impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/ |title=The Encyclopedia of Arda |publisher=Glyphweb.com |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429123029/http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/ |archivedate=29 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of "faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone."&lt;ref name="bratman"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bratman|first=David|chapter=Summa Jacksonica: A Reply to Defenses of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films, after St. Thomas Aquinas|title=Tolkien on Film: Essays on Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings|editor-last=Croft|editor-first=Janet Brennan|publisher=[[Mythopoeic Society|Mythopoeic Press]]|date=1 January 2005|location=Altadena|isbn=978-1-887726-09-2|quote=It's Jackson's vision, not Tolkien's ...

[[Douglas Kellner]] argues that the conservative community spirit of Tolkien's Shire is reflected in Jackson's films as well as the division of the Fellowship into "squabbling races".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFW_2zZtjtwC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=haldir+jackson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PBoMUKfBE4SU0QWuq43aCg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=haldir%20jackson&amp;f=false |title=From Hobbits to Hollywood: Essays on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings |chapter=The Lord of the Rings as Allegory: A Multiperspectivist Reading |pages=21, 23 |first=Douglas |last=Kellner |authorlink=Douglas Kellner |editor-first=Ernest |editor-last=Matthijs |editor2-first=Murray |editor2-last=Pomerance |editor2-link=Murray Pomerance |publisher=Editions Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |year=2006 |isbn=978-90-420-1682-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 review, film theorist Kristin Thompson was critical about the fact that film studies were undertaken by literary researchers and about the frequent denigration of Jackson's work in the collected essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tolkien on Film: Essays on Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' (review) |first=Kristin |last=Thompson |authorlink=Kristin Thompson |journal=[[Tolkien Studies]] |year=2006 |volume=3 |pages=222–228 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/tolkien_studies/v003/3.1thompson.html |doi=10.1353/tks.2006.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the films saw a surge of interest in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture.&lt;ref name="surge"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Gilsdorf, Ethan |date=16 November 2003 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2003/11/16/lord_of_the_gold_ring/ |title=Lord of the Gold Ring |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=16 June 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827073302/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2003/11/16/lord_of_the_gold_ring/ |archivedate=27 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the films spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise.

It was rumored that the Tolkien family became split on the series, with [[Christopher Tolkien]] and his son [[Simon Tolkien]] feuding over whether or not it was a good idea to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=594&amp;ObjectID=231286|title=Feud over 'Rings' movie splits Tolkien family|date=3 December 2001|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher has since denied these claims, saying, "My own position is that ''The Lord of the Rings'' is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form. The suggestions that have been made that I 'disapprove' of the films, even to the extent of thinking ill of those with whom I may differ, are wholly without foundation." He added that he had never "expressed any such feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1697884.stm |title=Tolkien's son denies rift |publisher=BBC News |date=7 December 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315035516/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1697884.stm |archivedate=15 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, however, he described the films as having "eviscerated" the book, and criticized the resulting "commercialisation" of his father's work.&lt;ref name="Le Monde" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Worldcrunch.com |title=My Father's "Eviscerated" |date=5 December 2012 |url=http://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/my-father-039-s-quot-eviscerated-quot-work-son-of-hobbit-scribe-j.r.r.-tolkien-finally-speaks-out/hobbit-silmarillion-lord-of-rings/c3s10299/#.UX1d3qKG2So |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210205838/http://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/my-father-039-s-quot-eviscerated-quot-work-son-of-hobbit-scribe-j.r.r.-tolkien-finally-speaks-out/hobbit-silmarillion-lord-of-rings/c3s10299/ |archivedate=10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on the film industry and tourism===
As a result of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become a major player in the film business (sometimes called a [[Business magnate|mogul]]) in the mold of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]], in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like [[Bryan Singer]] and [[Frank Darabont]]. Jackson has since founded his own film production company, [[Wingnut Films]], as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as ''The Lord of the Rings'' series. Jackson has been called a "favourite son" of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=594&amp;ObjectID=584301|title=NZer of the year: Peter Jackson|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=29 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Howard Shore toured with ''The Lord of the Rings Symphony'', playing two hours of the score. Along with the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre. [[Tourism for New Zealand]] is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theculturedtraveler.com/Archives/AUG2005/Movies_New_Zeland.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120164817/http://theculturedtraveler.com/Archives/AUG2005/Movies_New_Zeland.htm|archivedate=20 November 2005|title=Movie Tourism in New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the country's tourism industry waking up to an audience's familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealand.com/travel/about-nz/culture/lotr/nz-home-of-middle-earth-feature.cfm |title=New Zealand, Home of Middle-earth |publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810092351/http://www.newzealand.com/travel/about-nz/culture/lotr/nz-home-of-middle-earth-feature.cfm |archivedate=10 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2002, [[The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy: The Exhibition]] opened at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa museum]] in [[Wellington]], New Zealand. As of 2007, the exhibition has traveled to seven other cities around the world. A [[The Lord of the Rings (theatre)#Toronto|musical adaptation]] of the book was launched in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, in 2006, but it closed after mostly poor reviews. A [[The Lord of the Rings (theatre)#London|shortened version]] opened in London, United Kingdom, in the summer of 2007. 

===Legal disputes===
The legacy of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is also that of court cases over profits from the trilogy. Sixteen cast members ({{Interlanguage link multi|Noel Appleby|de}}, [[Jed Brophy]], [[Mark Ferguson]], Ray Henwood, [[Bruce Hopkins (actor)|Bruce Hopkins]], William Johnson, [[Nathaniel Lees]], [[Sarah McLeod]], [[Ian Mune]], [[Paul Norell]], [[Craig Parker]], [[Robert Pollock (New Zealand actor)|Robert Pollock]], [[Martyn Sanderson]], Peter Tait and {{Interlanguage link multi|Stephan Ure|de}}) sued over the lack of revenue from merchandise bearing their appearance. The case was resolved out of court in 2008. The settlement came too late for Appleby, who died of cancer in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Bruce Hopkins |title=New Zealand actors settle out of court with New Line |publisher=TheOneRing.net |date=8 October 2008 |url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2008/10/08/30205-new-zealand-actors-settle-out-of-court-with-new-line-cinema/ |accessdate=9 October 2008 |authorlink=Bruce Hopkins (actor) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011115524/http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2008/10/08/30205-new-zealand-actors-settle-out-of-court-with-new-line-cinema/ |archivedate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Zaentz]] also filed a lawsuit in 2004 claiming he had not been paid all of his royalties.

===''The Hobbit'' prequel trilogy===
{{main|The Hobbit (film series)}}
The success of the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy led to Jackson directing a trilogy of prequels based on Tolkien's children's book ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast and crew of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]] (as older Bilbo), [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Although the ''Hobbit'' films were even more commercially successful than ''The Lord of the Rings'', they received mixed reviews from critics.

=== Video games ===
Numerous video games were released to supplement the film series. They include: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|The Two Towers]],'' [[The Lord of the Rings (pinball)|Pinball]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|The Return of the King]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age|The Third Age]]'', [[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (GBA)|''The Third Age'' (GBA)]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics|Tactics]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth|The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|Conquest]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest|Aragorn's Quest]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North|War in the North]]'', ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'', ''[[Lego The Hobbit (video game)]]'', ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', and ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]''.

'''Tiger parenting''' (老虎妈妈, "tiger mother" or "tiger mom") is strict or demanding parenting. Tiger parents push and pressure their children to attaining high levels of scholastic and academic achievement, using authoritarian parenting methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Kim |first=Su Yeong |title=Defining Tiger Parenting in Chinese Americans |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.Agov/pmc/articles/PMC4865261/ |journal=Human development |volume=56.4 |pages=217-222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Yale law professor [[Amy Chua]] in her 2011 memoir ''[[Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=S.|title=What is "tiger" parenting?

Chua's rise to fame quickly popularized the concept and term "tiger mother" spawning numerous caricatures while also becoming the inspiration for the 2014-2015 Singaporean TV show ''[[Tiger Mum]]'', the 2015 mainland Chinese drama ''[[Tiger Mom (TV series)|Tiger Mom]]'', and the 2017 Hong Kong series ''[[Tiger Mom Blues]]''. The stereotyped figure often portrays a Chinese mother who relentlessly drives her child to study hard, to the detriment of the child's social and physical development, and emotional well being. 

The tiger mom is analogous to other parenting stereotypes such as the American [[stage mother]] who forces her child to achieve career success in Hollywood, the stereotypical Japanese [[kyōiku mama]] who takes an enormous amount of effort in directing much of her maternal influence towards development of their children's educational and intellectual achievement, or the [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]]'s drive for her children to succeed academically and professionally, resulting in a push for perfection and a continual dissatisfaction with anything less or the critical, self-sacrificing mother who coerces her child into [[medical school]] or [[law school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count |last= Nisbett |first=Richard E. |publisher=WW Norton |year=2010 |isbn=978-0393337693 |publication-date=January 26, 2010 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The origin of the tiger mom concept, term, and neologism traces its roots in ancient Confucian teachings articulated through classical anthologies such as the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' written more than two millennia ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Education as Cultivation in Chinese Culture |last=Hsu |first=Shihkuan  |last2= Wu |first2=Yuh-Yin |publisher= Springer |year=2016 |isbn= 978-9811013300 |publication-date=October 23, 2016 |pages=202-203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thepointmag.com/2012/examined-life/on-tiger-moms |title=On Tiger Moms |last=Park  |first=Julie  |date=July 5, 2012 |website=The Point}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Feminist Encounters with Confucius |last=Tan  |first=Sor-Hoon  |last2=Foust |first2=Mathew  |publisher=Brill Academic Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-9004332102 |publication-date=October 20, 2016 |pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Confucius: And the World He Created |last= Schuman |first=Michael |publisher=Basic Books |year=2015 |isbn=978-0465025510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]], an ancient Chinese philosophy developed by the philosopher [[Confucius]] in the 5th century BC that promoted values such as [[filial piety|respect for one’s elders and authority]], harmonious relations, bringing honor rather than [[Face_(sociological_concept)#Chinese_脸面_and_面子|shame]] to the family, hard work, enduring hardship, keeping one's place in society, honesty, and dedicating oneself towards academic excellence through the pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-shocked/201801/why-do-tiger-parents-want-their-kids-marry-young |title=Why Do Tiger Parents Want Their Kids to Marry Young? |last=Beglin |first=Cynthia Kim  |date=January 10, 2018  |website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thepointmag.com/2012/examined-life/on-tiger-moms |title=On Tiger Moms |last=Park  |first=Julie  |date=July 5, 2012 |website=The Point}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Feminist Encounters with Confucius |last=Tan  |first=Sor-Hoon  |last2=Foust |first2=Mathew  |publisher=Brill Academic Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-9004332102 |publication-date=October 20, 2016 |pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Confucius: And the World He Created |last= Schuman |first=Michael |publisher=Basic Books |year=2015 |isbn=978-0465025510}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Chinese and East Asian society is permeated by values reflecting the teachings of the ancient Chinese scholar, Confucianism remains still very much a core part of everyday life in Mainland China and the rest of East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2011/05/tiger-mothers-to-be-celebrated/ |title=Q. and A.: Michael Schuman on the Return of Confucianism in China |last=Wong |first=Edward  |date=April 2, 2015 |website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://discoversociety.org/2015/05/05/challenging-stereotypes-the-lived-experience-of-british-chinese-parenting/ |title=Challenging Stereotypes: The Lived Experience of British Chinese Parenting |last=Society |first=Discover |date=May 5, 2015 |website=Discover Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/amy-chuas-chinese-mom-controversy-response-china-66857|title=Amy Chua's 'Chinese Mom' Controversy: The Response in China |last=Liu |first=Melinda  |date=January 8, 2011 |website=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Lyu |first=Sung Ryung  |year=2017 |title=Rethinking Parenting of East Asian Immigrant Families in the United States with Asian Feminist Perspectives |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/47397/LYU-MASTERSREPORT-2017.pdf?sequence=1 |department=Family Studies |publisher=University of Texas at Austin Press |pages=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/family-education/article/1386776/asian-students-superiority-maths-due-confucian-focus-hard |title=Asian students' superiority at maths due to Confucian focus on hard work |last=Yeung |first=Linda |date=December 23, 2013 |website=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary Chinese families strive to inculcate the value and importance of an education in their child at a young age. Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in Chinese society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of Chinese culture and life. Education is regarded with a high priority for Chinese families as success in education holds a cultural status as well as a necessity to improve one's socioeconomic position in Chinese society. These values are embedded deeply in Chinese culture, parent-child relations and parents' expectations for their children. For the Chinese, the importance of education was considered a crucial means for channeling one's upward social mobility in ancient and medieval Chinese societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Zhong |first=Lan |year=2011 |title=Chinese Immigrant Parents Involvement in the Education of their Elementary School Children in Windsor, Ontario: Perceptions and Practices |journal=University of Windsor |publisher=University of Windsor Press |pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Chen |first=Chuansheng  |last2=Huttal |first2=David  |year=1988 |title=Cultural Values, Parents' Beliefs, and Children's Achievement in the United States and China' |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Uttal/publication/247701487_Cultural_Values_Parents'_Beliefs_and_Children's_Achievement_in_the_United_States_and_China/links/0deec530158296960d000000/Cultural-Values-Parents-Beliefs-and-Childrens-Achievement-in-the-United-States-and-China.pdf |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=351-353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Mainland China, national examinations such as the ''[[Gaokao]]'' remain the primary path for channeling one's upward social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Chen |first=Chuansheng  |last2=Huttal |first2=David  |year=1988 |title=Cultural Values, Parents' Beliefs, and Children's Achievement in the United States and China' |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Uttal/publication/247701487_Cultural_Values_Parents'_Beliefs_and_Children's_Achievement_in_the_United_States_and_China/links/0deec530158296960d000000/Cultural-Values-Parents-Beliefs-and-Childrens-Achievement-in-the-United-States-and-China.pdf |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=352-353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Zhong |first=Lan |year=2011 |title=Chinese Immigrant Parents Involvement in the Education of their Elementary School Children in Windsor, Ontario: Perceptions and Practices |journal=University of Windsor |publisher=University of Windsor Press |pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
While "tiger mother" is a generic term for the tiger parenting phenomenon, representing a concept that was not commonly known until the publication of Chua's book, the broader phrase "tiger parenting" also acknowledges the fact that fathers or other parent-figures can also instigate, participate in, or be accomplices to the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx|title=What is “tiger” parenting?

===Harsh regime===
Parents who set up rules that overstep conventional parental boundaries are regarded as either tiger mothers or (less commonly) tiger fathers. Tiger parents prioritize schoolwork above all else and only allow children to participate in activities in order to potentially win awards which they believe will increase the chance of the child's acceptance to the elite universities.&lt;ref name=amy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chua|first1=A.|title=Battle hymn of the tiger mother|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-59420-284-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=D.|title=16 Signs you’re too strict with your kids|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/16-signs-youre-too-strict-with-kids|website=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is said that "Asian American parents provide a constant wind beneath their children's wings";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prigg|first1=M.|title=The tiger mom doesn’t know the best: Researchers find Western parenting methods are just as effective|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2637942/Is-Tiger-Mom-better-Researchers-say-western-methods-just-effective.html|website=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning tiger parents constantly propel their children towards their commitment towards excellence. In a similar way, Chinese tiger parents pay more attention to students core academic subjects such as math, science, and language arts and ignore other non-academic activities such as art and sports in order to ensure their children's superior performance in their core academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last= Zhong |first=Lan |title=Chinese Immigrant Parents Involvement in the Education of their Elementary School Children in Windsor, Ontario: Perceptions and Practices |degree=Degree of Doctor of Philosophy |publisher=University of Windsor Press |url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1426&amp;context=etd |year=2011 |location=Windsor, Ontario, Canada |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demanding===
Tiger parents emphasize a commitment towards excellence in academia and award-winning non-academic achievements such as performing classical music instruments. Some also choose to incorporate competitive sports for their children.&lt;ref name=renede&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rende|first1=R.|title=Evaluating "Tiger Mom" parenting: What’s the take-home message from research?|url=http://www.parents.com/blogs/red-hot-parenting/2012/02/22/health/evaluating-tiger-mom-parenting-whats-the-take-home-message-from-research/|website=Parents|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402130656/http://www.parents.com/blogs/red-hot-parenting/2012/02/22/health/evaluating-tiger-mom-parenting-whats-the-take-home-message-from-research/|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unusually high level of expectations may stem from parental love and care, as well as a strong desire to pave the way for their children’s future success,  as playing an instrument or being proficient in a competitive sport often serve as a cosmetic addition of extracurricular activities that may look good on college applications. Many Chinese tiger parenting families have a huge emphasis on academic achievement. Extrinsic rewards play a role in the Confucian cultural value system Chinese parents communicate and inculcate in their children at a young age. The strong emphasis on high academic achievement is often seen as a source of stress for Western parents while Chinese parents see the stress of academic achievement on their children as a sign of good parenting reinforced by the entire Confucian cultural value system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Chen |first=Chuansheng  |last2=Huttal |first2=David  |year=1988 |title=Cultural Values, Parents' Beliefs, and Children's Achievement in the United States and China' |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Uttal/publication/247701487_Cultural_Values_Parents'_Beliefs_and_Children's_Achievement_in_the_United_States_and_China/links/0deec530158296960d000000/Cultural-Values-Parents-Beliefs-and-Childrens-Achievement-in-the-United-States-and-China.pdf |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological and behavioral control===
Tiger parents try to reinforce higher levels of psychological and behavioral control over their children than other parents. Tempering a child's self-esteem may be part of this strategy. Psychological control comes in many forms but it rooted when parents work to constrain children’s autonomy through psychologically manipulative tactics such as the withdrawal of love or induction of guilt. While behavioral control is focused on setting limits on children's activities, often referring to academics and limiting behavioral problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doan, Tardif Miler, Olson, Kessler, Felt, Wang|first=Stacey N., Twila, Sheryl, Daniel, Barbara, Li|date=May 2017|title=Consequences of 'tiger' parenting: a cross-cultural study of maternal psychological control and children's cortisol stress response.|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.cyrano.ucmo.edu:2048/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=28e7d4b9-341a-49ff-a1c1-85822fceb1d3%40pdc-v-sessmgr02&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=122602238&amp;db=a9h|journal=Developmental Science|volume=20|pages=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chua's memoir, ''[[Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]]'', she mentions an incident that she yelled at her daughters, calling them ‘garbage’ in public. It has been shown that tiger parents are less likely than other parents to compliment their children in public as well. Children raised by tiger parents may be met with emotional threats and low-impact physical punishments if they failed to practice their piano scales and meet their expectations. Moreover, some tiger parents do not allow their children to make some decisions on their own, whether in academia or daily life. For instance, Chua's daughters were not allowed to watch TV at night or have sleepovers with their schoolmates.

===High expectations and commitment to excellence===
Chua cites her parents' newfound immigration experience in the United States and intense struggle to set their roots in a foreign land as the reason inevitably prompting them to adopt a more utilitarian approach towards raising their children. In her memoir, Chua brings up Confucius to elucidate why Chinese parents feel that their children are indebted to them due to all the sacrifices the previous parental generation made to secure a better life for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/comparing-american-and-chinese-parents-116355614/113764.html |title=Comparing American and Chinese Parents |last=Elmasry  |first=Faiza  |last2=Davis |first2=Lawan |date=February 16, 2011 |website=Learning English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://travel.cnn.com/shanghai/life/helen-he-dont-demonize-chinese-mothers-545975/ |title=Chinese Mom: American 'Tiger Mother' clueless about real Chinese parenting |last=He  |first=Helen  |date=January 20, 2011 |website=CNN Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger parents enforce high expectations and may harbor  snobbish and inflated views regarding their children’s academic performance. In some cases these expectations may be held unrealistically high regardless of the child's ability or passion for studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Peaceful Song of the Panda Mom |last=X |first=Ms.  |publisher= New Idea Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=978-0983565000 |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger parents may exhibit harsh and unrealistic expectations for the child's academic performance where "B" and even mid to low end "A" grades are not tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marquez|first1=L|title=UCLA sociologist zeroes in on what motivates 'tiger moms'|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-sociologist-zeroes-in-on-what-motivates-tiger-moms|website=UCLA Newsroom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger parents put a heavy emphasis on the pursuit of academic success at the expense of other character traits that are just as crucial for future career success such as [[soft skills]], social skills, dealing with people, and emotional intelligence. Tiger parents eschew the [[Parenting styles#Indulgent parenting|lax parenting style]] typically exhibited by many liberal Western parents but also disregard other soft skills that are just are as crucial for their children's future career prospects and the lack of such skills may put them at a disadvantage when competing for job positions. Tiger parents may impose choices on their children as to which interests they choose to pursue. Critics of the tiger parenting argue that this approach will restrict their children's ability to discover their individual talents and passions thus denying the child a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and purpose. On the other hand, proponents for tiger parenting argue that their parenting strategy imbues children with self-control, self-regulation and self-discipline and won't produce excellent academic results if they let their child to drift freely to develop their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Li |first=Jun |year=2001 |title=Expectations of Chinese Immigrant Parents for Their Children’s Education: The Interplay of Chinese Tradition and the Canadian Context |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/cje/index.php/cje-rce/article/viewFile/2817/2116 |journal=Canadian Journal of Education |publisher=Simon Fraser University Press |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=483-484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Confucian philosophy has traditionally emphasized [[self-improvement]]. As a result, tiger parents often make sure that their children work conscientiously on their schoolwork to help secure better grades and an overall superior academic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Chen |first=Chuansheng  |last2=Huttal |first2=David  |year=1988 |title=Cultural Values, Parents' Beliefs, and Children's Achievement in the United States and China' |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Uttal/publication/247701487_Cultural_Values_Parents'_Beliefs_and_Children's_Achievement_in_the_United_States_and_China/links/0deec530158296960d000000/Cultural-Values-Parents-Beliefs-and-Childrens-Achievement-in-the-United-States-and-China.pdf |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=351-353}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Exam-oriented education===
East Asian countries often adopt a strict exam-oriented approach in teaching, which encourages rote memorization. Some argue that this approach encourages uniformity while eschewing creativity, questioning, student participation, self-determination, autonomy, diversity and critical or independent thinking. Tiger parents often put children in tutorial classes as early as the preschool stage. Typically, throughout the child's academic career, the mothers attempts to help the child obtain outstanding results in exams to secure a seat in prestigious schools, with the end goal of entering a top-notch university in mind.

===Cultural influences===
In East Asian societies, a higher education level is perceived as a guarantee of promising career prospects; and as a tool to climb up the socioeconomic ladder or to lift a family out of poverty. In the classical Chinese anthologies ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' by the ancient Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] in the 5th century BC, education is a central theme in the book with philosophical ideas and sayings that placed great value on work ethic and the pursuit of knowledge. The Confucian ideal argued that education is a passport to higher socioeconomic status and wealth. In ancient and medieval East Asian societies, [[Scholar-official]]s had a high social status and intellectuals were held in high esteem, well above than that of wealthy [[Four_occupations#The_shang_(商)|landowners, businessmen, and merchants]]. Thus, tiger parents pin high hope on their children, taking much pride in their children's academic achievements and may flaunt them to other parents when comparing their own children with the academic achievements of others. Chinese immigrant parents in the West argue that "high academic achievement" reflects "successful parenting" while parents who have children that bring home inferior academic records are seen as irresponsible parents who are not doing their job.&lt;ref name="amy" /&gt; One historical explanation for the strict examination approach stems from the [[Imperial examination]] system of China for civil service government positions. Success in the civil examination administered by the royal court was seen as a sure conduit improve a family’s socioeconomic position. Since such positions were scarce with many applicants applying for few opening positions, competition was fierce and these positions were highly coveted, as only a select few could succeed and attain them. Tiger parents recognize how crucial self-discipline is in gaining success, so they may try to instill the value of an exam oriented education into their children as early as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carey|first1=T.|title=How Chinese success in education comes at a high cost|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2015/01/how-chinese-success-education-comes-high-cost|website=NewStatesMan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on success and achievement===
Tiger parents perceive a narrow definition of success that is rooted solely in a high level of academic and intellectual achievement. 
As academic success is often a source of pride for families and within Chinese and East Asian society at large, tiger parents typically view "success" as graduating from a top university such as [[Harvard]], or other Ivy League institutions as the ultimate marker of prestige, granting high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a highly respectable lucrative white collar career path such as becoming a high end neurosurgeon for [[Mayo Clinic]], a high powered lawyer at a top law [[Wall Street]] law firm, a software engineer in [[Silicon Valley]], a management consultant for [[Boston Consulting Group]], or as an investment banker working for [[Goldman Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Peaceful Song of the Panda Mom |last=X |first=Ms.  |publisher= New Idea Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=978-0983565000 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger mothers also incorporate classical music training or extracurricular enrichment activities such as joining a sports team, including those with competitive structures and awards systems to bolster their child's university entrance application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Peaceful Song of the Panda Mom |last=X |first=Ms.  |publisher= New Idea Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=978-0983565000 |pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of early life training illustrates the tiger parent's zeal for education and the desire for their children to get into a prestigious university as tiger parents see the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution as a ticket that leads to a prestigious, rewarding, and lucrative white collar career filled with socioeconomic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Peaceful Song of the Panda Mom |last=X |first=Ms.  |publisher= New Idea Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=978-0983565000 |pages=10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger parents may look down on careers beneath their expectations - that is a truck driver may be viewed as less socially respectable than a neurosurgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Peaceful Song of the Panda Mom |last=X |first=Ms.  |publisher= New Idea Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=978-0983565000 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration, acculturation, and values ===
During the past 30 years the Asian American population has increased due to increased immigration to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kilty|first=Keith M.|date=2002|title=Race, Immigration, and Public Policy:

It is important to understand that Asian Americans trace their roots to dozens of regions and countries across the Asian continent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although this article predominantly focuses on tiger parenting as a Chinese-American phenomenon it can be found across Asian culture by trends found in Asian immigration.

'''Acculturation''' \ə-ˌkəl-chə-ˈrā-shən can be defined as is an adaptive process which occurs both on an individual and group level when intercultural exchange happens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Barry's model of acculturation there are four key strategies including (1) assimilation - the acceptation of the host countries dominant culture, (2) separation - the acceptation of one's native culture, (3) integration - adopting both the host countries and native countries cultures, and (4) marginalization - the rejection of both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190215217.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190215217-e-2|title=Theories and Models of Acculturation|last=Berry|first=John W.|date=September 2017|website=Oxford Handbooks Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to tiger parenting acculturation is a key predictor of the mother's expectations of their children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Values /ˈvalyo͞os/''', in a sociological sense, are a culture's standards for discerning what is considered good, bad, beautiful and ugly, and sought after and avoided. These are deeply embedded into the foundation of culture and society suggesting how people should behave, although there may be some deviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/alamo-sociology/chapter/values-and-beliefs/|title=Reading: Values and Beliefs|last=|first=|date=|website=Lumen Learning|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian Americans are distinctive in that their values are represented as a whole when compared with other U.S. adults. Asian Americans on average exceed with having a high rate of college completion, traditionally seen as a predecessor of financial and career success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They have a strong emphasis for family and successful marriages, where being a good parent is one of the most important aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are most likely to have multi generational households with at least two generations living together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And, have a strong belief in the rewards of hard work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Altogether these values and beliefs work together to formulate the phenomena of the tiger parent in Asian cultures. 

==Effects==
Advocates suggest a strict approach to parenting produces an exceptionally high proportion of top performers – children who display academic excellence across the board with great musical ability and professional success later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=K.|title=Tiger Mother|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/tiger-mother.html|website=Macmillan Dictionary|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a three-part series on competition in Hong Kong's education system by the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', many Hong Kong parents revealed that cultural fears over economic hardship motivated them to begin thinking of their children's futures as professionals soon after birth, striving to find the best playgroups, and encouraging competition among children in academia, sports and music, in the belief that this fosters competitiveness and increases their children's chances of entering into a better pre-nursery school and elite kindergarten, and determine their eventual success at primary schools, secondary schools and universities. However, many other Hong Kong parents, psychologists and educators assert that pushing children too hard does not work, and can even harm children. There is a growing trend of children aged five to 12 seeking psychiatric help and even contemplating suicide. In reaction, some parents have relaxed their formerly strict discipline with their children, and some schools have made their admissions requirements less strenuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhao|first1=S|title=Hong Kong parents say pushing children too hard doesn't work|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1460601/hong-kong-parents-say-pushing-children-too-hard-doesnt-work?page=all|website=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, children raised under a strict, controlling, and punitive tiger mother will suffer a chronic social and psychological toll. This included some young Asians as well as children from immigrant families of Asian ancestry who live in other parts of the world outside Asia. Children raised with a less supportive type of parenting have developed chronic mental health and psychiatric problems such as [[anxiety]], [[low self-esteem]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and contemplation of suicide. These mental health and psychiatric problems may create psychological problems that make these children feel like "failures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/tiger-moms-may-help-their-kids-succeed-it-comes-psychological-cost-304606|title=Tiger Parenting Works, But At What Cost?|date=2014-09-23|newspaper=Medical Daily|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When parents do not provide coping strategies to their children and guide alongside to manage negative feelings, such loneliness may transition into depression and suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markham|first1=L|title=What's Wrong With Strict Parenting?|url=http://www.ahaparenting.com/parenting-tools/positive-discipline/strict-parenting|website=Aha!

Tiger parenting has been blamed for high rates of suicide in East Asia, particularly [[Suicide in South Korea|South Korea]], which has some of the highest [[List of countries by suicide rate|suicide rates]] in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/south-korean-students-wracked-with-stress-201312884628494144.html | title=South Korean students wracked with stress | publisher=Al Jazeera | date=8 December 2013 | accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/daily-videos/south-koreas-education-fever/ |title=South Korea’s ‘Education Fever’ |last=Warner |first=Margaret |date=January 24, 2011 |website=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, [[stress (biological)|stress]] from constant study and limited [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]] pressured by harsh and demanding parents on a student may be taking a psychological and social toll on younger generations, causing an increase in aggression, mental health problems, impaired cognitive development, and drug and alcohol abuse. Other adverse effects, such as depression, anxiety, antisocial behavior, and increased risk of physical abuse, have also been linked to the increasing amount of academic pressure placed on young South Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2011/05/depressed_students_south_korea|title=We don't need quite so much education|date=2011-05-12|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tiger parents' belief in the importance of academics for their children is considered by many to constitute [[child abuse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/20/poll-shows-half-of-korean-teenagers-have-suicidal-thoughts/ |title=Poll Shows Half of Korean Teenagers Have Suicidal Thoughts |last=Kang |first=Yewon |publisher=''The Wall Street Journal'' |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is seen as acceptable by many Asian parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/opinion/sunday/south-koreas-education-system-hurts-students.html |title=An Assault Upon Our Children |last=Koo |first=Se-Woong |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=1 August 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dianeravitch.net/2014/08/03/why-we-should-not-copy-education-in-south-korea/|title=Why We Should Not Copy Education in South Korea |last=Ravitch |first=Diane |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have described their traditions as including [[Human body|physical]] and [[emotional]] closeness that ensures a lifelong bond between parent and child, as well as establishing parental authority and child obedience through [[discipline]].&lt;ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006"&gt;Lau, A. S., Takeuchi, D. T., &amp; Alegría, M. (2006). Parent-to-child aggression among Asian American parents: Culture, context, and vulnerability. ''Journal of Marriage and Family'', 68(5), 1261–1275. Retrieved&lt;/ref&gt;

Balancing disciplinary responsibilities through violence within parenting is common in many Asian cultures, including [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006" /&gt; To some cultures, violent parenting may be seen as abuse, but in other societies such as these, the use of violence is looked at as a reflection of parental devotion.&lt;ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006" /&gt; Severe forms of violence may include spanking or slapping the child with an open hand or striking with an available household implement such as a belt, slipper, cane, clothes hanger, meterstick, hairbrush, paddle or bamboo feather duster.

According to the sources cited by the website Parenting Science, children from [[Authoritarian Parenting|authoritarian families]] may find it more difficult to fend for themselves and make friends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewar|first1=G|title=Authoritarian parenting: How does it affect the kids?|url=http://www.parentingscience.com/authoritarian-parenting.html|website=Parenting Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; but whether or not most families with a tiger parent could be considered authoritarian is a matter of debate. Studies published by the ''Handbook of Child Psychology'' have shown that children under tiger parenting were rated as less helpful and less popular by their teachers and classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Damon|first1=W.|last2=Lerner|first2=R. M.|last3=Eisenberg|first3=N.|title=Handbook of Child Psychology, Social, Emotional, and Personality Development|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=690|isbn=978-0-471-27290-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sg4Qr7qZrXYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they are more likely to show aggressive behavior towards others when they are forced to learn without recess. They were rated as less self-reliant and are not able to be independent thinkers since their life is organized by their parents.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Mangrnberet.jpg|thumb|upright|A paperback book cover by [[Norm Saunders]]]]

Members of the '''[[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]]''' will emphatically assert that the "Green Beret" is a hat and not the man who wears it. Nevertheless, for a time in the 1960s the Green Berets and the men who wore them became a national [[fad]] emerging in a wide variety of '''[[popular culture]]''' referents. After a decline in popularity during the 1970s — coinciding with the American public's [[Vietnam Syndrome|backlash against the Vietnam War]] — the Green Berets gripped the popular imagination again beginning with the [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo film franchise]] in 1982. They continue to appear as both major and minor referents in popular culture — especially in movies and television — often serving as a shorthand signifier for a shady or [[Covert operation|covert]] military background for a fictional character. As a [[dramatic device]], this can cut both ways — i.e., lead an audience to either admire or fear (or both) a character.

==Soldiers of the "New Frontier"==
Although the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] were created with a low profile in 1952, and the green beret was not officially authorized, things changed dramatically with President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He wanted to challenge Communist influence and wars of liberation in the recently decolonized [[Third World]], and bolster pro-American regimes with the U.S. Army's own [[special forces]] and [[Counter-insurgency|counter-guerrilla]] fighters.

On 12 October 1961, Kennedy visited the U.S. Special Warfare Center, where his aide, [[Major General]] [[Chester Victor Clifton Jr.|Chester V. Clifton]] (and friend of the SWC Commander, BG [[William P. Yarborough]]) informed Yarborough that the President was keen on the Special Forces — but would not visit the SF base unless they were wearing their green berets. The Army, having previously forbidden the green beret, allowed the soldiers to wear them, lest JFK not visit.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstadt, Hans, ''The Green Berets: Unconventional Warriors'', Presidio Press, (1988), {{ISBN|9780891412809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Forces displayed their capabilities, impressing the President; so often, in the next years, that they referred to it as "Disneyland." President Kennedy's visit was topped with a [[Bell Aircraft]] pilot (dressed in Army fatigues) flying with a [[rocket belt]] to the President, and saluting him.

Kennedy approved of the Green Beret, and the U.S. Army authorised it. In 1962, he called the green beret, "a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom." Special Forces soldiers in berets and dress Greens were President Kennedy's cortege in 1963. An SF beret was photographed atop his grave at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Earliest media==
The 1st Special Forces Group on [[Okinawa]] provided a number of troopers to act as extras in director [[Samuel Fuller]]'s ''[[Merrill's Marauders (film)|Merrill's Marauders]]'' (1961) and were credited at film's start. On U.S. television, a March 1962 episode of ''[[Surfside 6]]'' titled "The Green Beret" featured SF training. [[Henry Fonda]] appeared in, and narrated, a 1962 "Special Forces" episode of ''[[The Big Picture (TV series)|The Big Picture]]'' series of U.S. Army-produced films that found their way to U.S. television. In 1963, a Green Beret appeared in the episode "[[In Praise of Pip]]" of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' though the U.S. Army told the [[CBS]] television network to not name the Southeast Asian country where the story occurred. The Green Beret's first Hollywood appearance is in the futuristic thriller film ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1963) wherein [[Andrew Duggan]] is a Special Forces officer loyal to the U.S. President, not the traitorous JCS Chief [[Burt Lancaster]]; the film also gave the U.S. filmgoer a first glimpse of the [[M16 rifle]].

[[Mattel]] toys made "Guerrilla Fighter" playsets in 1962 containing a commando green beret with an interesting tin "Guerrilla Fighter" badge depicting the crossed arrows insignia of the Special Forces, (formerly worn by the [[1st Special Service Force]], and before that the [[U.S. Army Indian Scouts]]) and a jungle knife in front of a parachute. The set also contained the Mattel [[Dick Tracy]] automatic cap firing "[[tommy gun]]" or "[[Scattergun]]" (the Dick Tracy cap firing but no longer water firing riot shotgun) [[toy gun]]s, both now in [[military camouflage]] plastic, a military camouflaged [[poncho]], and in some sets, a rubber [[Ka-Bar]] knife and a [[tripwire]] [[booby trap]]. Mattel later made the "M-16 Marauder", in 1966, which appeared in ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' film wherein an enraged [[John Wayne]] smashes one against a tree.

The public was fascinated with this new type of soldier of the [[New Frontier]], and the Army reluctantly gave journalists' access to many of Special Forces often [[top secret]] missions. One writer was [[Robin Moore]], who used his connections with [[Harvard University]] classmate [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to write a book about the Special Forces. The U.S. Army agreed on the condition that Moore (then 38&amp;nbsp;years old) complete the [[United States Army Airborne School|Basic Airborne Course]] and SF training before being allowed to visit the Special Forces in [[South Vietnam]].

==Saturation==
[[File:Fightin Army.jpg|right|thumb|1966 ''[[Fightin' Army]]'' comic book, published by [[Charlton Comics]].]]

Robin Moore successfully completed the courses and was allowed to live with the soldiers in Special Forces and their South Vietnamese, [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]], and [[Nung people|Nung]] allies. His book, ''[[The Green Berets (book)|The Green Berets]]'', was published in 1965, but, because he mentions the American presence in [[North Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], he published ''The Green Berets'' as a novel. The U.S. Army was upset by the book; the reading public was not and it became a best selling book, especially its paperback edition in 1966.

At the time of Moore's book and the increasing U.S. Military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], Special Forces [[Staff Sergeant]] [[Barry Sadler]] wrote a song with Robin Moore and recorded it under the title the "[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]," which became the number-one single of 1966 in the U.S. In addition to the single, Sadler released an album ''Ballads of the Green Berets'' with Sadler's photograph of him in a green beret appearing on the single, the LP, and on the paperback cover of Moore's ''The Green Berets''. SSgt. Sadler later recorded an additional, but lesser, song "The A-Team" and released two more long-playing albums, then wrote his autobiography, ''I'm A Lucky One''.

"Ballad of the Green Berets" had many cover versions ranging from [[Ennio Morricone]] and [[Duane Eddy]] to "[[drugstore records]]" on labels such as Diplomat and Wyncote records. [[Hanna-Barbera Records]] released a children's LP ''The Story of the Green Beret'' available to members of the [[G.I. Joe]] club. The album was a tie-in with the release of the G.I. Joe Green Beret "[[action figure]]" (doll) that had appeared in 1966. The record had an album cover of Special Forces in action and a picture of the [[Medal of Honor]]. The record started off with a cover version of "Ballad of the Green Berets" but was a spoken account with sound effects of Colonel Pat Lawrence ([[Mike Road]]) taking two small boys (Andy and George) to visit [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]], to learn about the training and capabilities of ''The Green Berets''. The album then featured an exciting account of the [[Battle of Nam Dong]] where Captain [[Roger Donlon]] received the first Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War.

A less successful song was [[Nancy Ames]]' "He Wore The Green Beret" with a flip side of "War is a Card Game". [[Dickie Goodman]] pitted the two fads of 1966 against each other in ''[[Batman &amp; His Grandmother]]'' where the Caped Crusader went up against the Green Beret.

Robin Moore also wrote a 1965 ''[[Tales of the Green Beret]]'' newspaper [[comic strip]] with artwork by [[Sgt. Rock (comics)]] [[Joe Kubert]] that was also published in paperback. It later became a [[Dell Publishing]] [[American comic book]] in 1967 replacing their earlier ''[[Jungle War Stories]]'' and ''Guerrilla War'' comics. When [[DC Comics]]'s Larry Rock (brother of the Sergeant), the replacement in ''[[Our Fighting Forces]]'' for the Marines Gunner and Sarge and their dog Pooch proved unpopular, DC replaced him with a Green Beret named Captain Hunter in 1966. Captain Hunter's adventures featured him hunting for his twin brother, a pilot shot down and captured by the [[Viet Cong]]. Other [[war comics]] put in their own Green Beret characters, such as [[Lightning Comics (1967)|Lightning Comics]]' ''Todd Holton-Super Green Beret'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/thoughtviper/holton/th.html |title=INEXPLICABLE OBJECT OF THE WEEK : Week of 7/23/00 : WEEK 119 : Tod Holton, Super Green Beret |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2015-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knqgSZHl?url=http://www.geocities.com/thoughtviper/holton/th.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children could also enjoy [[Philadelphia Gum]] "Men of the Green Beret" [[trading cards]] of photographs of the Special Forces in action with a stick of [[bubble gum]]. The artwork on the box was by artist [[Norm Saunders]] of ''[[Mars Attacks]]'' fame. [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora Models]] came out with a model of a Green Beret soldier.

==Feature films==
[[File:Chhotletpos.jpg|left|200px|[[film poster]] for ''[[Chrome and Hot Leather]]'']]With all the interest in the men of the Green Berets, a film version seemed a long time in coming. [[Columbia Pictures]] had bought the film rights to Robin Moore's book before publication, using the title, ''The Green Berets'', for a screenplay about the training of an SF Team and their deployment in Southeast Asia, but dropped the idea, because of the U.S. Army's many conditions and the U.S. public's dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War. Producer [[David L. Wolper]] then bought the rights to ''The Green Berets'', and dropped the idea for reasons like Columbia Pictures. A screenplay was written by [[George Goodman]] who had served with the Special Forces in the 1950s as a [[military intelligence]] officer and had written a 1961 article about the Special Forces called ''The Unconventional Warriors'' in [[Esquire Magazine]]. Columbia sent Goodman to South Vietnam to research the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/george-jerome-waldo-goodman-dlb/3.html |title=George J(erome) W(aldo) Goodman Biography |publisher=Bookrags.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsmith.net/connection.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926133905/http://www.adamsmith.net/connection.html |date=September 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolper later produced ''[[The Devil's Brigade (film)|The Devil's Brigade]]'' (1968) with Utah-based [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] SF soldiers as extras, wearing attractive, but imaginary [[red beret]]s.

Thus, it fell to John Wayne to buy the rights and ask President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s help in obtaining the assistance and cooperation of [[the Pentagon]] in filming the book. The Army set strict conditions, forbidding Moore to work on or be associated with the film, though the [[film trailer]] has the caption "TOLD TOUGH - LIKE THE BOOK". Despite Wayne's box office prestige and public interest in ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', the film was rejected by [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. Wayne's preferred film composer, [[Elmer Bernstein]], refused to write the score. Wayne used his [[Batjac Productions]] money to make the film, which [[Warner Bros.]] profitably released to some public protest.

John Wayne's version of Robin Moore's ''The Green Berets'' begins with a choral version of the "[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]" heard behind [[Wayne Fitzgerald]]'s titles that segue to an SF A-Team putting on a "Disneyland" show for journalists, including skeptical [[David Janssen]]. From SF Colonel John Wayne, reporter Janssen wangles a trip to the Vietnam War, and, eventually, participates in a large-scale battle, based on the [[Battle of Nam Dong]]. In the end, Janssen tells Wayne "If I write what I feel, I'll be out of a job". Wayne tells Janssen he'll always have one with them.

The last third of the film is Green Beret expertise in a [[commando]] mission to abduct a North Vietnamese General who has been seduced by the sister-in-law of an ARVN Special Forces Colonel (played by [[Jack Soo]]). The climax is a superb demonstration of [[combatives]] by former-[[Tarzan]] [[Mike Henry (football)|Mike Henry]] killing a horde of [[Viet Cong]] who attack him, even impaling one on a low tree branch. The [[martial arts]] inspired many film producers.

[[Tom Laughlin]] made a highly profitable [[American International Pictures]] film called ''[[The Born Losers]]'' (1967) featuring [[Billy Jack]], a half-American Indian former Green Beret Vietnam War veteran using his martial arts on a [[motorcycle gang]]. The 1971 [[American International Pictures]] film ''[[Chrome and Hot Leather]]'' features SF men Tony Young, [[Peter Brown (actor)|Peter Brown]], and [[Marvin Gaye]] using their training and Vietnam War experience to avenge the murder of Young's girlfriend by [[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]]'s motorcycle gang. The film's poster shows a uniformed Green Beret using a biker as a sub-human punching bag with the [[tagline]]: "DON'T MUCK AROUND WITH A GREEN BERET'S MAMA!  HE'LL TAKE HIS CHOPPER AND RAM IT DOWN YOUR THROAT!"

===Disenchantment===
As the public wearied of the Green Berets, so did the American [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. The 1969 "Green Beret Murder Case" in which Colonel [[Robert B. Rheault]] and several of his men were tried for assassinating a [[Communism|Communist]] spy was used as a discrediting tactic against the Special Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Jeff, ''A Murder in Wartime: The Untold Spy Story That Changed the Course of the Vietnam War'', St Martins Mass Market Paper, (1993) {{ISBN|978-0312929190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thCentury/articles/greenberets.aspx |title=The "Green Beret Affair" |publisher=Militarhistoryonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case also contributed to the plot of the movie ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' in which a Green Beret Colonel accused of the same offence has gone rogue.

===Rambo===
In 1972, author [[David Morrell]] published ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'', a novel that features a former member of the Army Special Forces named [[John Rambo]]. The novel focuses on the struggle Rambo faces when he attempts to return to civilian life following the end of his tour of duty in Vietnam, and he eventually turns to violence. In 1982, a [[First Blood|film adaptation]] of the novel was released, starring [[Sylvester Stallone]]. The film altered many aspects of the novel, including excising the self-loathing characteristics the protagonist possesses in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidmorrell.net/faq.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509133752/http://www.davidmorrell.net/faq.cfm |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a box office success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=firstblood.htm |title=First Blood (1982) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spawned a media franchise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20155">'''Western media''' is the [[mass media]] of the [[Western world]].  During the [[Cold War]], Western media contrasted with [[Soviet media]]. Western media has gradually expanded into [[developing countries]] (non-Western countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadha|first=K.|author2=Kavoori, A. |title=Media imperialism revisited: some findings from the Asian case|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|date=1 July 2000|volume=22|issue=4|pages=415–432|doi=10.1177/016344300022004003|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/22/4/415.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The roots of the Western media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when [[printing press]]es began to operate throughout [[Western Europe]]. The emergence of [[news media]] in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the [[spread of the printing press]], from which the publishing [[Publishing|press]] derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Weber | first = Johannes | title = Strassburg, 1605: The Origins of the Newspaper in Europe | journal = German History | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–412 (387) | year = 2006 | doi=10.1191/0266355406gh380oa}}: {{quote|At the same time, then as the printing press in the physical technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was now born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, newspapers developed during a period of political upheaval that challenged the absolute rule of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|English Monarchy]]. In 1641, newspapers were allowed to publish domestic news for the first time.&lt;ref name=hardy1/&gt; Despite strict controls placed by the political elite on the print media to restrict the expansion of the press, the print industry continued to grow. By the late 18th century, over 10 million newspapers were distributed annually in Britain alone.&lt;ref name=hardy1&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Jonathan|title=Western media systems|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0203869048|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosah Ebo writes that "During the [[Cold War]], the United States and Soviet Union engaged in an intense media diplomacy aimed to create international image of each other."&lt;ref&gt;Bosah Ebo, "Media Diplomacy and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Framework" in ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QboMgCKGqUEC&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false News Media and Foreign Relations: A Multifaceted Perspective]'' (ed. Abbas Malek: Greenwood, 1997), pp. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe]] were established by the U.S. as counterpoints to the Communist-dominated news media in the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aeon.co/essays/cold-war-propaganda-the-truth-belonged-to-no-one-country|title=Cold War propaganda: the truth belonged to no one country|work=Aeon|author=Melissa Feinberg|date=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar James Schwoch writes, "Western-inspired television programming and development in Cold War Germany and Europe began as not so much a case of the unfettered free flow of information from West to East, but rather as a strong counterbalance preventing, or discouraging, the Soviet-sourced first flow of the European television landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bFCbAn5j6gIC&amp;pg=PA41|title=Global TV: New Media and the Cold War, 1946-69|last=Schwoch|first=James|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=9780252075698|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], Western media outlets were gradually accepted as a trustworthy and reliable source of news. In former [[East Germany]], surveys showed that over 91% of [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|migrants]] perceived Western media outlets to be more reliable than East German media outlets.&lt;ref name="de Gruyter"&gt;{{cite book|authors=H. J. Bretz, R. Weber, G. Gmel &amp; B. Schmitz|editors=Rainer K. Silbereisen &amp; Alexander von Eye|title=Growing up in times of social change|year=1999|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=978-3110165005|page=2015–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In recent years, many Western media outlets have seen their circulation figures stagnate.&lt;ref name="Simone Pieranni"&gt;{{cite web |last=Simone Pieranni|title=Western Media In Crisis, But What About China?|url=http://en.ejo.ch/6304/media_economics/western-press-crisis-china|publisher=[[European Journalism Observatory]]|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics ==
''[[New Left Review]]'' editor [[Tariq Ali]] asserts that "the notion of a free press in the Western media in the 20 century evolved as a counterpoint to the monopolistic State-owned model of erstwhile Soviet Union with the aim of showing its superiority by accommodating diversity of voices. In terms of what it published and what it showed, the Western media gained its peak during the Cold War era."&lt;ref name="hindu1"&gt;{{cite news |title='Without free flow of information, there can be no serious democracy' |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/without-free-flow-of-information-there-can-be-no-serious-democracy/article4898966.ece |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=12 December 2013 |date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Global coverage ===
[[File:Time magazine POY.jpg|thumb|In 2011, "The Protester" was named "[[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine]]

* [[Africa]] – A 1997 study found that the American newsmagazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' and the German newsmagazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' regularly reported on Africa issues, but that "most of the news comes from [[List of ongoing armed conflicts|regions of conflict]] and can be regarded as crisis news."&lt;ref name="Annas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rolf Annas|title=News flow out of Africa: are Western media striving for excellence in communication standards?|journal=Ecquid Novi: African Journalism Studies|date=1997|volume=18|issue=2|pages=196–208|doi=10.1080/02560054.1997.9653203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that "the ratio of crisis to non-crisis news" was more balanced in ''Newsweek'' than in ''Der Spiegel''.&lt;ref name="Annas"/&gt; 

* [[Middle East]] – It has been claimed that past representations of Arabs in Western media have relied heavily on racial myths and [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|stereotypes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Yahya R. Kamalipour |title=Cultural diversity and the US media |year=1998 |publisher=State Univ. of New York Press |location=Albany |isbn=978-0791439296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverage of military conflicts===
Criticisms of the [[media coverage of the Iraq War|media coverage leading up to]] the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] was been acute.&lt;ref name="HayesGuardino"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whose Views Made the News? Media Coverage and the March to War in Iraq|author=Danny Hayes &amp; Matt Guardino|journal=Political Communication|volume=27|date=2010|issue=1|pages = 59–87|doi = 10.1080/10584600903502615}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study examined every evening television news story related to Iraq on [[ABC News|ABC]], [[CBS News|CBS]], and [[NBC News|NBC]]. The study found that "that news coverage conformed in some ways to the conventional wisdom: Bush administration officials were the most frequently quoted sources, the voices of anti-war groups and opposition Democrats were barely audible, and the overall thrust of coverage favored a pro-war perspective."&lt;ref name="HayesGuardino"/&gt; However, the study also found that "it is too facile to conclude that anti-war positions were completely marginalized. In contrast to the common critiques of media coverage, even as elites in the United States were not publicly sparring, journalists turned to foreign officials for the anti-war perspective."&lt;ref name="HayesGuardino"/&gt; The network media did commonly report "opposition from abroad—in particular, from Iraq and officials from countries such as France, who argued for a diplomatic solution to the standoff."&lt;ref name="HayesGuardino"/&gt; 

Max Abrahms, writing in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', has criticized Western media's [[Media coverage of the Syrian Civil War|coverage of the Syrian Civil War]], arguing that it is overly favorable to the [[Syrian opposition]] and fails to take into account extremist elements within the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2017-10-30/syrias-extremist-opposition|title=Syria's Extremist Opposition|last=Abrahms|first=Max|work=Foreign Affairs|date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Coverage of human rights===
Coverage of global [[human rights]] increased in the media of the [[Global North]] between 1985 and 2000. A [[regression analysis]] of human rights reporting by the newsmagazines ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' found that "these two media sources cover abuses in human rights terms more frequently when they occur in countries with higher levels of state repression, economic development, population, and Amnesty International attention. There is also some evidence that political openness, number of battle-deaths, and civil societies affect coverage, although these effects were not robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.howardramos.ca/index_htm_files/Ramos%20Ron%20Thoms%202007.pdf|title=Shaping the Northern Media's Human Rights Coverage, 1986–2000|authors=Howard Ramos, James Ron &amp; Oskar N. T. Thoms|number=4|journal=Journal of Peace Research|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an empirical analysis of the effects of "naming and shaming" of governments that are said to perpetrate human rights abuses (by media outlets as well as by governments and [[nongovernmental organizations]]) found that "governments put in the global spotlight for violations often adopt better protections for political rights afterward, but they rarely stop or appear to lessen acts of terror." The study also found that "In a few places, global publicity is followed by more repression in the short term, exacerbating leaders' insecurity and prompting them to use terror, especially when armed opposition groups or elections threaten their monopoly on power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hafner-Burton|first=Emilie M.|date=October 2008|title=Sticks and Stones: Naming and Shaming the Human Rights Enforcement Problem|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/sticks-and-stones-naming-and-shaming-the-human-rights-enforcement-problem/39C386310B323A85E58F4E687CA5F7D9|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=62|issue=4|pages=689–716|doi=10.1017/S0020818308080247|issn=1531-5088|citeseerx=10.1.1.668.3134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ownership patterns===
In the United States, the media is largely privately owned.&lt;ref name="Janda"&gt;Kenneth Janda, Jeffrey Berry &amp; Jerry Goldman, ''The Challenge of Democracy: Government in America'' (Centgage: 9th ed. 2008), pp. 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt; In other democratic nations of the Western world, particularly in [[Western Europe]], print media outlets such as newspapers are usually privately owned, but [[public broadcasting]] is dominant in the broadcast media (radio and television).&lt;ref name="Janda"/&gt; Historically, the United States was the only developed nation that "created a broadcasting system that was [[Advertisement|advertiser]]-supported virtually from the start."&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. McCauley, "Introduction" in ''Public Broadcasting and the Public Interest'' (eds. Michael P. McCauley, Deedee Halleck, B. Lee Artz &amp; Eric E. Peterson: M.E. Sharpe, 2003), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The contrasting Western European model sees public media as "a representation of the national culture."&lt;ref&gt;Katarzyna Konarska, "Globalisation, Local Media Markets and the Media Regulatory Systems of the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe: Main Aspects" in ''Media, Power and Empowerment: Central and Eastern European Communication and Media Conference 2012'' (eds. Tereza Pavlíčková &amp; Irena Reifová: Conference Proceedings of the 5th Central and Eastern European Communication and Media Conference: Media, Power and Empowerment, Prague, Czech Republic, April 21-28, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Press freedom ===
[[Reporters Without Borders|Reporters Without Borders's]] [[Press Freedom Index]] scored the following countries the highest in 2018: [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Jamaica]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]], [[Denmark]], and [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 World Press Freedom Index|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|url=https://rsf.org/en/ranking}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] reported in 2014 that "the freedom to publish in the 27 countries of the Western Europe and North America region has remained strong and widely upheld."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002277/227741e.pdf|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development: Regional Overview of Western Europe and North America|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Communication and Information Sector|date=2014|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In the 1970s, some scholars in communications studies, such as Oliver Boyd-Barrett, Jeremy Tunstall and [[Elihu Katz]], advanced a "[[media imperialism]]" perspective. This theory posits that there is an "iniquitous flow of cultural production from the First to the Third World ... whereby the media of advanced capitalist economies were able to substantially influence, if not actually determine, the nature of cultural production and consumption within Third World countries," leading to cultural hegemonization in favor of individualism and consumerism.&lt;ref name="ChadhaKavoori"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240707871|title=Media imperialism revisited: Some findings from the Asian case|author=Kalyani Chadha &amp; Anandam P. Kavoori|journal=Media Culture &amp; Society|date=July 2000|page=415–32|volume=22|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Kuan Yew]] of Singapore, [[Hindu nationalist]]s in India, and the Chinese authorities have all pressed for restrictions on Western media in their respective nations, viewing it as a possible threat to Asian values.&lt;ref name="ChadhaKavoori"/&gt; Other scholars, such as Fred Fejes, Daniël Biltereyst and [[Hamid Naficy]], have criticized the "media imperialism" theory, arguing that it arguing that it unjustifiably relies on a "[[hypodermic needle model]]" of media effects, overstates the influences of media on the audience's behavior and views, and romanticizes "national culture" unduly.&lt;ref name="ChadhaKavoori"/&gt;

===From China===
Following the Chinese [[2014 Kunming attack]], in which [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] Muslim [[Xinjiang conflict|Xinjiang secessionists]] killed 31 people, Chinese state media and Chinese social media users criticized major Western media outlets that placed quotation marks around the word "terrorism" in news articles about the event.&lt;ref name="Dawn, Yiqin Fu"&gt;Dawn, Yiqin Fu, [http://www.dawn.com/news/1091091 "Chinese are angry at western media's portrayal of the Kunming attack], ''Dawn'' (March 5, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; While some Chinese Internet users interpreted the quotation marks as attribution to the statements of the Chinese government, others accused the Western media of sympathizing with the separatists.&lt;ref name="Dawn, Yiqin Fu"/&gt; China accused "Western commentators, with their focus on Uighur rights, of hypocrisy and [[double standards]] on terrorism."&lt;ref name="BBC News, Kunming, John Sudworth"&gt;BBC News, Kunming, John Sudworth, Mar 3, 2014 [https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-26380542 "Shock and anger after Kunming brutality"], March 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Russia===
Russian media and government often claims that Western media is biased against Russia.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;New East network expert panel, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/western-media-coverage-ukraine-crisis-russia Is Western media coverage of the Ukraine crisis anti-Russian?], ''The Guardian'' (August 4, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] wrote in 2018 that the Russian Foreign Ministry has promoted [[conspiracy theories]] about "the Western media" and denounced critical news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Emma Daly|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/03/rising-hostility-media-threatens-real-democracy-0|title=Rising Hostility to Media Threatens Real Democracy|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Russia established [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] (later RT); [[Julia Ioffe]], writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', writes that RT was established as a [[soft power]] and [[Russian propaganda|propaganda]] instrument, aimed at countering Western media outlets and promoting Russian foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ioffe, [https://archives.cjr.org/feature/what_is_russia_today.php What Is Russia Today?: The Kremlin's propaganda outlet has an identity crisis], ''Columbia Journalism Review'' (September/October 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of 2012, between 2.25 and 2.5 million Britons watched RT broadcasting (making it the third-most watched [[rolling news]] channel in Britain, behind [[BBC News]] and [[Sky News]]).&lt;ref name="Bullough"&gt;Oliver Bullough [http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/world-affairs/2013/05/inside-russia-today-counterweight-mainstream-media-or-putins-mou Inside Russia Today: counterweight to the mainstream media, or Putin's mouthpiece?], ''New Statesman'', May 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin"&gt;Laughlin, Andrew, Jan 14, 2013 [http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a450812/rt-russian-news-channel-goes-hd-on-sky.html RT Russian news channel goes HD on Sky], ''Digital Spy''.&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Andrei P. Tsygankov on editorials in the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'', and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' related to Russian domestic politics from 2008 to 2014 found that the editorials were overwhelmingly negative of the Russian government, based on such issues as "elections, opposition and minority rights, the justice system, protection of property rights, freedom of media, development of NGOs and civil society, protection of citizens against crime and terrorism, mechanisms for the transfer of power, attitudes of [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and [[Medvedev]], and relations with Western nations." Tsygankov asserted that the editorials failed to adequately reflect "neutral and positive frames and such as those stressing the country's relative progress or objective difficulties faced in its development."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The dark double: the American media perception of Russia as a neo-Soviet autocracy, 2008–2014|author=Andrei P Tsygankov|volume=37|issue=1|pages = 19–35|journal=Politics|date=2017|doi = 10.1177/0263395715626945}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, James Nixey of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at [[Chatham House]] argued that fair reporting does not require [[False balance|false equivalence]] between Russian and Western actions, and that negative coverage of Russia was understandable given its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|conduct in Crimea]], [[Russo-Georgian War|Georgia]], and [[Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War|Syria]], and its poor human rights record.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; [[Piers Robinson]] argues that both Russian media and Western media is biased, writing "mainstream media, wherever it may be based, is widely acknowledged to be overly deferential to political and economic power and that means, as consumers of news."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/russian-propaganda-western-media-manipulation|title=Russian news may be biased – but so is much western media|author=Piers Robinson|date=August 2, 2016|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women Poets International Movement''' (also known as '''Movimiento Mujeres Poetas Internacional MPI''') is an international non-profit organization operated out of the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International Women Poets Movement (MPI), Inc., and it grows each year as it is being translated into several languages thanks to the altruism of hundreds of people|url=http://www.dominicanaonline.org/portal/english/cpo_noti5414.asp|accessdate=14 August 2014|newspaper=Dominicana Online|date=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first launched in 2009 and focuses on the promotion of female poets and poetry through collective projects, publications and events.

==Events==
Women Poets International is a nonprofit foundation started in November 2009 at the Dominican Republic, committed to promoting the work of contemporary female poets internationally through collective projects, and with the social responsibility of sharing messages of respect, self-esteem and nonviolence against women. This foundation holds several events throughout the year,&lt;ref name="KP"&gt;{{cite news|title="Britma e gruas" pro fuqizimit të zërit femëror|url=http://www.kosovapress.com/sq/arkiva/britma-e-gruas-pro-fuqizimit-te-zerit-femeror-161640/?old=1|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=Kosova Press|date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ''Woman Scream International Poetry Festival'' celebrated in march of each year,&lt;ref name="listindiario.com"&gt;{{cite news|title="Grito de Mujer" en Macorís del mar|url=http://www.listindiario.com/ventana/2012/3/3/223890/Grito-de-Mujer-en-Macoris-del-mar|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=Listin Diario|date=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; international poetry contests, and outdoor non-violence campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anuncian Jornada art|url=http://www.almomento.net/news/134/ARTICLE/101628/2011-12-06.html|publisher=Al Momento|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also lends assistance to various festivals, concerts, and conferences throughout the world.

===Woman Scream International Poetry Festival===
In 2009 the organization held their first ''Woman Scream International Poetry Festival'' (''Festival Internacional de Poesía Grito de Mujer'') in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="listindiario.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Con un festival de poesía rindieron homenaje a las mujeres en su día|url=http://www.elliberal.com.ar/ampliada.php?ID=35523|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=El Liberal|date=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is held over the month of March and focuses on honoring women through multiple events. In 2011 Women Poets International expanded the focus of the event to also promote violence awareness due to the mutilation and murder of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] poet [[Susana Chávez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trujillo: Preparan II Festival Internacional de poesía Grito de Mujer|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-02-17-trujillo-preparan-ii-festival-internacional-de-poesia-grito-de-mujer-noticia_452170.html|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=Radio Programas del Perú|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the worldwide event honored [[Malala Yousafzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebran Segundo Festival Internacional de Poesía en San Pedro de Macorís|url=http://eldia.com.do/sociales/2012/4/3/79233/Celebran-Segundo-Festival-Internacional-de-Poesia-en-San-Pedro-de-Macoris|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=El Dia|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VÉLEZ|first=PILAR|title=Descubra cómo se gestó "Grito de Mujer".

'''Women in the workforce''' earning wages or  salary are part of a modern phenomenon, one that developed at the same time as the growth of paid employment for men, but women have been challenged by [[Gender inequality|inequality]] in the workforce. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women's entry and participation in the [[workforce]]. Economic dependency upon men, and consequently the poor [[socio-economic status]] of women, have had the same impact, particularly as occupations have become [[professionalization|professionalized]] over the 19th and 20th centuries.

Women's lack of access to [[higher education]] had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like [[law]] and [[medicine]] was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, [[Cambridge University]] only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107063131/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html|date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term [[career]]s rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs.

The increasing rates of women contributing in the work force has led to a more equal disbursement of [[working hours|hours worked]] across the regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2007$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rdCufG2vozTpKw7TBGbyoWw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=26;dataMax=56$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=|title=Graph|publisher=[[Gapminder World]] |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in western European countries the nature of women's employment participation remains markedly different from that of men.

Although access to paying occupations (the "workforce") has been and remains unequal in many occupations and places around the world, scholars sometimes distinguish between "work" and "paying work", including in their analysis a broader spectrum of labor such as uncompensated [[household work]], childcare, [[eldercare]], and family [[subsistence farming]].

==Areas of study==
{{Women in society sidebar}}
As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] raged in the U.S., [[Virginia Penny]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] was finishing up her research project and publish the ground-breaking book, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-women-can-make-money-married-or-single-in-all-branches-of-the-arts-and-sciences-professions-trades-agricultural-and-mechanical-pursuits/oclc/15690614 ''How women can make money married or single, in all branches of the arts and sciences, professions, trades, agricultural and mechanical pursuits'' (Philadelphia, 1862)]. Hoping to offer hard facts about what women in the workforce would encounter, Penny had interviewed thousands of employers, using both a survey via the postal mail and in person – when she would also interview workers. Much of her site visits were conducted in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. She distilled her research to list over 500 jobs that were open to women as well as the information about the jobs and potential availability for women. She also indicated when employers offered their reasons for wage differentials based on gender. She dedicated her book "to worthy and industrious women in the United States, striving to earn a livelihood," and the book garnered much attention by reviewers and scholars across the country. She sold her rights to the book to another publisher who put it out instead as an encyclopedia, ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xR0EAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'']&lt;/ref&gt; in 1863. It sold better once it was re-titled again in 1870 as ''How Women Can Make Money, Married or Single''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gensemer|first1=Susan H.|title=Penny, Virginia|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/14/14-01170.html|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American Council of Learned Societies|accessdate=21 December 2016|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the several different versions of the book ended up with 36 editions published between 1862 and 2006, and six editions of the adaptation in German (first published in 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penny, Virginia 1826-|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n90694085/|website=OCLC WorldCat Identities|publisher=OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[division of labor]] by [[gender]] has been studied most systematically in [[women's studies]] (especially [[women's history]], which has frequently examined the history and biography of women's participation in particular fields) and [[gender studies]] more broadly. Occupational studies, such as the [[history of medicine]] or studies of [[professionalization]], also examine questions of gender, and the roles of women in the history of particular fields. Women dominate as accountants, auditors, and psychologists.&lt;ref name="Witz-1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anne Witz | title = Patriarchy and Professions: The Gendered Politics of Occupational Closure | journal = Sociology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | date = 1990 | pages = 675–690 | url = http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/4/675 | doi = 10.1177/0038038590024004007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavanagh-2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=S.

In addition, modern [[civil right]]s law has frequently examined gender restrictions of access to a field of occupation; [[gender discrimination]] within a field; and gender harassment in particular workplaces. This body of law is called [[employment discrimination|employment discrimination law]], and gender and race discrimination are the largest sub-sections within the area. Laws specifically aimed at preventing discrimination against women have been passed in many countries; see, e.g., the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] in the United States.

==Paid employment globally==
[[File:Changes in percentages of professionals by gender.png|thumbnail|This chart depicts the change in the percentage of women in three professional occupations (dentist, physician, lawyer), from 1970 to 2007.]]
Women still contribute to their communities in many regions mainly through agricultural work. In Southern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa, only 20% of women work at paid non-agricultural jobs. Worldwide, women's rate of paid employment outside of agriculture grew to 41% by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main forms of paid employment for women worldwide is actually a traditional one, that of the market "hawker". Women have worked outside the home as vendors at markets since ancient times in many parts of the world, such as Central America, South Asia, and Africa.

During the 20th century, the most significant global shift in women's paid employment came from the spread of global travel and the development of a large migrant workforce of women [[domestic workers]] seeking jobs outside of their native country. The [[Philippines]] is a major source of female domestic workers. Before the 1990s, the majority of Filipinos working outside the Philippines were male, but by 2012, an estimated 63% of Filipinos working overseas were female.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|title=Overseas deployment of Filipino domestic workers continues to rise|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|publisher=Inquirer Global Nation|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/32067/overseas-deployment-of-filipino-domestic-workers-continues-to-rise|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of Filipino women working overseas are in the millions. Over 138,000 new domestic workers gained permission to work overseas in 2012, a number that grew 12% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"/&gt; Overseas employment often results in the women leaving their own children behind in the Philippines to be cared for by relatives. Domestic employees from the Philippines and other countries have also been subject to exploitation and sex and money extreme abuse, for example in several countries in the Middle East, where they are often employed. It is estimated that [[remittances]] from overseas workers (both male and female) bring $1 billion (USD) per month to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An atlas of migration|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=0-520-26151-8|pages=78–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce participation by sector===
[[File:Computer industry entrepreneur workshop.jpg|thumb|Attendees at a computer business networking event for potential entrepreneurs, United State.]]
[[File:Woodstock press photographer.jpg|thumb|A woman press photographer covers a music fest, Poland, 2008.]]

Women and men often participate in economic sectors in sharply different proportions, a result of gender clustering in occupations. Reasons for this may include a traditional association of certain types of work with a particular gender. There is a wide range of other possible economic, social and cultural variables that impact the gender distribution in different occupations, including within a region or country. An averaging of statistics gathered by the United Nations for 2004 through 2007 reflects these differences (totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding):

'''Sectoral distribution of employed persons, by sector and sex (2004 through 2007)'''&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Women 2010|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW_full%20report_color.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 15, 2012|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Region'''||'''Agriculture'''||'''Industry'''||'''Services'''
|-
|Africa||43% women / 42% men||11% women / 20% men||46% women / 39% men 
|-
|Asia (excluding China)||32% women / 26% men||12% women / 25% men||56% women / 49% men 
|-
|Latin America and the Caribbean||7% women / 22% men||13% women / 27% men||80% women / 51% men 
|-
|Europe and other more developed regions||6% women / 8% men||15% women / 36% men||79% women / 55% men 
|}

More detailed statistics show large differences even within these regions. For example, 11% of employed women in East Asia are employed in agriculture, a number that rises to 55% in South Asia; 70% of women in Southern Africa are employed in the service sector, while in Eastern, Middle, and Western Africa this number is 26%.&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"/&gt;

===Occupational dissimilarity index===
Choice of occupation is considered to be one of the key factors contributing to the male-female wage differential. In other words, careers with a majority of female employees tend to pay less than careers that employ a majority of males. This is different from direct wage discrimination within occupations, as males in the female dominated professions will also make lower than average wages and the women in the male dominated occupations usually make higher than average wages. The occupational [[index of dissimilarity|dissimilarity index]] is a measure from 0 to 100; it measures the percent of laborers that would need to be rearranged into a job typically done by the opposite sex in order for the wage differential to disappear. In 1960, the dissimilarity index for the United States was measured at 62. It has dropped since then, but at 47 in 2000, is still one of the highest of any developed nation.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hong Li J | year = | title = Gender Differences in Class Mobility: A Comparative Study of the United States, Sweden, and West Germany | url = | journal = Acta Sociologica | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 315–333 | doi=10.1177/000169939804100402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations formed by women for rights==
In the nineteenth century women became involved in organizations dedicated to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Visions of America A History of the United States, books a La Carte Edition. Pearson College Div, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 The National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) is established to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for women. In 1920 The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was formed to create equal rights and a safe workplace for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline2.html#ixzz3Vlm8PLZb Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.: Timeline of Events (1921-1979).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 a group called Financial Women's Association (FWA), was formed. It is an organization established by a group of Wall Street women. The goal was: to advance professionalism in finance and in the financial services industry with special emphasis on the role and development of women, to attain greater recognition for women's achievements in business, and to encourage women to seek career opportunities in finance and business.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices&gt;[http://www.diversitybestpractices.com/news-articles/20-womens-organizations-you-need-know "20 Women's Organizations You Need to Know"], Diversity Best Practices, February 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by a group of feminists including Betty Friedan. The largest women's rights group in the U.S., NOW seeks to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Nancy. "The American Women's Movement, 1945-2000: A Brief History with Documents." Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1972, the National Association of Female Executives (NAFE) provides education, networking and public advocacy to empower its members to achieve career success and financial security. Members are women executives, business owners, entrepreneurs and others who are committed to NAFE's mission: the advancement of women in the workplace.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices /&gt; Many of these organizations led to legal action and protecting women's rights as workers and empowered women in the workplace.

==Laws protecting women's rights as workers==
[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to [[US President]] and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) and [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzo Abe]] attending the World Assembly for Women in [[Tokyo]] to speak on women's rights and empowerment, 2017]]

International laws protecting women's rights as workers exist through the efforts of various international bodies.  On June 16, 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) passed C189 [[Convention on Domestic Workers|Domestic Workers Convention, 2011]], binding signatories to regulations intended to end abuses of migrant domestic workers. It was anticipated that the Convention would put pressure on non-ratifying countries to support changes to their own laws to meet the change in international standards protecting domestic workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Switzerland – A step forward for domestic workers|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/world/europe/17briefs-Switzerland.html?gwh=9875484B408842FDAE59E701E668F0EF|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a law preventing domestic workers from having residency rights granted to other foreign workers, a move that affected an estimated 100,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeParle|first=Jason|title=Domestic workers convention may be landmark|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/domestic-workers-convention-may-be-landmark.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=world|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILO has previously ratified the [[Equal Remuneration Convention]] in 1951, which came into force in 1953, the [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]], which went into force in 1960 and the [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]], which went into force in 2002. In 1966, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which went into force in 1976. [[UNESCO]] also adopted the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] in 1960, which came into force in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, went into force in 2003. The [[Home Work Convention]], adopted by the ILO, went into force in 2000;the Convention protects the rights of persons doing paid work out of their home, which is frequently women workers. It offers equal protection regarding working conditions, safety, remuneration, social security protection, access to training, minimum age of employment, and maternity protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human trafficking]] often targets young women who are abducted and sent outside their own country to work as domestic workers, often in conditions of extreme exploitation. A number of international laws have been ratified to address human trafficking of women and children.

Maternity protection measures are put in place to insure that women will not be discriminated against in the workplace once they return from having a child. They should also not be exposed to any health hazards while they are pregnant and at work. They are allowed time off for maternity leave as well, which allows them to bond with their child; this aspect of development is crucial for infants to gain proper attachment skills. Employers are expected to hold to these policies. Yet many women on maternity leave receive very small amounts of time off to allow for their health along with their babies' health. The amount of time allowed for maternity leave as well as the pay for maternity leave varies by country, with Sweden having the longest amount off with 68 weeks and the United States being one of the worst, with the typical period being 12 weeks without pay.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, S.

==Women in workforce leadership==

Female decision-makers from around Europe are organized in several national and European wide networks. The networks aim to promote women in decision-making positions in politics and the economy across Europe. These networks were founded in the 1980s and are often very different from the "service clubs" founded in the early days of the century, like Soroptimist and Zontas.

"Women in Management" is about women in business in usually male-dominated areas. Their motivation, their ideas and leadership styles and their ability to enter into leadership positions is the subject of most of the different networks.

As of 2009, women represented 20.9% of parliament in Europe (both houses) and 18.4% world average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm|publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union|title=Women in National Parliaments|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, 90 women serve in the U.S. Congress: 18 women serve in the Senate, and 73 women serve in the House Women hold about three percent of executive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm |publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|title=Facts on Women Officeholders, Candidates and Voters|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private sector, men still represent 9 out of 10 board members in European blue-chip companies, The discrepancy is widest at the very top: only 3% of these companies have a woman presiding over the highest decision-making body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The European Union Commission has created a platform for all these networks. It also funded the [[Women to the Top]] program in 2003–2005 to bring more women into top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/nyheter/artikel_1043415.svd|title=Gemensamt krafttag för ett mer jämställt Europa|last=Danielsson|first=Anna|date=2005-01-25|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have been created to promote the presence of women in top responsibilities, in politics and business. One example is EWMD European Women's Management Development (cited above), a European and international network of individual and corporate members, drawn from professional organisations. Members are from all areas of business, education, politics and culture.

Women who are born into the upper class rather than the middle or lower class have a much better chance at holding higher positions of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in the work force if they choose to enter it.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} According to a study published 2015, of the women who held C-suite jobs in the U.S., 94% played [[competitive sports]], 52% at a university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ey.com/gl/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-sport-is-a-critical-lever-in-advancing-women-at-all-levels-according-to-new-ey-espnw-report|title=Sport is a critical lever in advancing women at all levels, according to new EY/espnW report|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to equal participation==
As [[gender role]]s have followed the formation of agricultural and then industrial societies, newly developed [[profession]]s and fields of occupation have been frequently inflected by gender. Some of the ways in which gender affects a field include:

*Prohibitions or restrictions on members of a particular gender entering a field or studying a field
*[[Discrimination]] within a field, including wage, management, and prestige hierarchies
*Expectation that mothers, rather than fathers, should be the primary childcare providers

Note that these gender restrictions may not be universal in time and place, and that they operate to restrict both men and women. However, in practice, norms and laws have historically restricted women's access to particular occupations;civil rights laws and cases have thus primarily focused on equal access to and participation by ''women'' in the workforce. These barriers may also be manifested in hidden bias and by means of many [[microinequities]].

Many women face issues with sexual abuse while working in agriculture fields as well. Many of the women who work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse in order to keep their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because the fact that they are documented will be brought up and may be deported.

===Access to education and training===
[[File:Maasai women at USAID literacy event (6595762621).jpg|thumb|[[Maasai people|Maasai]] women at [[USAID]] literacy event]]
A number of occupations became "[[professionalization|professionalized]]" through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining regulatory bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular [[higher education]]al requirements. As women's access to higher education was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden access to [[Cambridge University]] until 1868, and were encumbered with a variety of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted an equal opportunity policy.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html "Fact Sheet: Women at Cambridge"].&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but access to higher education remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries. Even where access to higher education is formally available, women's access to the full range of occupational choices is significantly limited where access to primary education is limited through social custom.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007"&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to capital===
[[File:Women's business conference bahia brazil.jpg|thumb|Governor of Bahia, Brazil, attending the first state women's business conference]]
Women's access to occupations requiring capital outlays is also hindered by their unequal access (statistically) to capital;this affects occupations such as entrepreneur and small business owner, farm ownership, and investor.&lt;ref&gt;"DEVELOPMENT: Gender Equality Equals Growth", ''World News'', June 2, 2004, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20040208105312/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/may00/23_11_078.html archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous [[microloan]] programs attempt to redress this imbalance, targeting women for loans or grants to establish start-up businesses or farms, having determined that aid targeted to women can disproportionately benefit a nation's economy.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004"&gt;United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) statistics. See Erwin Northoff, "FOOD: Women Farmers are Invisible Actors in Hunger Drama", ''World News'', 2004 February 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  While research has shown that women cultivate more than half the world's food — in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, women are responsible for up to 80% of food production — most such work is family subsistence labor, and often the family property is legally owned by the men in the family.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004" /&gt;

===Discrimination within occupations===
[[File:SHG women running a cabinet manufacturing business (5103677355).jpg|thumb|Women operating a cabinet manufacturing business, India]]
{{See also|Gender pay gap|Glass ceiling|Sexual harassment}}
The idea that men and women are naturally suited for different occupations is known as horizontal segregation.&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;Massey, D. S. Categorically Unequal. New York: Russel Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company for a long period of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, E.F. Opting out and opting in: understanding the complexities of women's career transitions. Career Development International. 12, 218 – 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to earn less money than men, despite establishing equal pay laws.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]'', p.&amp;nbsp;41 (Figure 3.3 "Estimated earnings for women are substantially lower than for men");p.&amp;nbsp;36 (chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the textbook ''Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology'', women are at a higher risk of financial disadvantage in modern-day society than men. Statistical findings suggest that  women are under paid for similar jobs men complete despite having the same qualifications. The statistical data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor suggests that women are discriminated against in the workforce based on gender. The textbook reads, “Women’s wages are also more volatile than men’s wages, and women face a much higher risk of seeing large drops in income than do men” (Kennedy 2008). Anderson clearly demonstrates a significant difference between men and women in the workforce in regards to pay. Women are left more exposed to financial devastation and unemployment. The textbook also mentions that women are often give public positions versus private or leadership positions despite having appropriate work experience, higher education, or necessary skills to qualify. According to the Joint Economic Committee, “Among women heading families, the unemployment rate has grown and is higher than the national unemployment rate and twice as high as that for either married men or married women” (Joint Economic Committee, 2009). In other words, unmarried women who are the head of household are more vulnerable to financial disadvantage than married men or women. The unemployment rate of women compared to men suggests that single women are discriminated against based on gender. Anderson writes, “All women are disproportionately at risk in the current foreclosure crisis, since women are 32% more likely than men to have subprime mortgages (One-third of women, compared to one-fourth of men, have subprime mortgages; and, the disparity between women and men increases in higher income brackets)” (Anderson 265). The statistical information illustrates the dramatic difference between men and women in regards to finances. It can be inferred that men are favored in the workforce over women. Women are discriminated against based on their gender and thus are more likely to struggle financially because of discriminatory employers.

===Actions and inactions of women themselves===
Through a process known as "employee clustering", employees tend to be grouped throughout the workplace both spatially and socially with those of a similar status job. Women are no exception and tend to be grouped with other women making comparable amounts of money. They compare wages with the women around them and believe their salaries are fair because they are average. Some women are content with their lack of wage equality with men in the same positions because they are unaware of just how vast the inequality is.

Furthermore, women as a whole tend to be less assertive and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so.&lt;ref name="women's media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmedia.com|title=Index of /|publisher=Womensmedia.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys are more likely to be pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.&lt;ref&gt;Spade, Joan Z. "Gender and Education in the US." Gender Mosaics: Social Perspectives. Ed. Dana VannoyOxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional issue that contributes to income inequality by gender is that women are much more likely than men to take "breaks" in their careers to have children, often remaining out of the workforce for extended periods of time, while men in the same role or occupation (or other women who do not leave the workforce) most likely are continuing to earn promotions and/or merit-based salary increases. When a woman in this scenario re-enters the workforce, she may be offered a smaller salary or a lower position than she might have merited had she remained in the workforce alongside her colleagues (both male and female) who have not interrupted their careers.

==Gender inequality by social class==
[[File:Mechanic at work seattle.jpg|thumb|upright|Mechanic working on a motorcycle, United States]]
In the last 50 years there have been great changes toward gender equality in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the [[feminist movement]] of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right back out of the labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the [[baby boomer]]s. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.

===Effects on the middle and upper classes===
The addition of women into the workforce was one of the key factors that has increased [[social mobility]] over the last 50 years, although this has stalled in recent decades for both genders. Female children of the middle and upper classes had increased access to higher education, and thanks to job equality, were able to attain higher-paying and higher-prestige jobs than ever before. Due to the dramatic increase in availability of [[birth control]], these high status women were able to delay marriage and child-bearing until they had completed their education and advanced their careers to their desired positions. In 2001, the survey on sexual harassment at workplace conducted by women's nonprofit organisation Sakshi among 2,410 respondents in government and non-government sectors, in five states{{clarification needed|date=December 2018|reason=United States?}}{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} recorded 53 percent saying that both sexes don't get equal opportunities, 50 percent of women are treated unfairly by employers and co-workers, 59 per cent have heard sexist remarks or jokes, and 32 percent have been exposed to pornography or literature degrading women.

In comparison with other sectors, IT organisations may be offering equal salaries to women, and the density of women in technology companies may be relatively high, but this does not necessarily ensure a level playing field. For example, Microsoft (US) was sued because of the conduct of one of its supervisors over e-mail. The supervisor allegedly made sexually offensive comments via e-mail, such as referring to himself as "president of the amateur gynecology club." He also allegedly referred to the plaintiff as the "Spandex Queen. E-harassment is not the sole form of harassment. In 1999, Juno Online faced two separate suits from former employees who alleged that they were told that they would be fired if they broke off their ongoing relationships with senior executives. Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet TV network, was sued in January 2000 after male employees referred to female employees as "bimbos" and forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet. In India, HR managers admit that women are discriminated against for senior Board positions and pregnant women are rarely given jobs but only in private. In addition to this, it has been suggested that there are fewer women in the IT sector due to existing stereotypes that depict the sector as male-orientated. In a recent book, ''Own It: Leadership Lessons From Women Who Do'', author [[Aparna Jain]] interviewed 200 women in senior management and leadership positions in India about the problems they face at the workplace and noted that 86% of the women she spoke to experienced harassment in one form or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/towards-fostering-a-gender-neutral-workplace/story-32TrlU2iOhQfWGGWStcSYL.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues she notes are bias, bullying, sexual harassment and the impact of motherhood on women's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/living/book-review-aparna-jains-own-it-brings-out-of-unarticulated-darkness-the-indescribable-things-that-happen-to-women-at-the-workplace-2614092.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a sexual harassment suit against a senior member shocked the Indian IT sector, as was the sexual harassment case against the [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]]' (Taj Group) CEO, Rakesh Sarna .&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/sexual-harassment-case-against-ihcl-boss-rakesh-sarna-may-have-added-to-cyrus-mistry-woes/articleshow/55361051.cms&lt;/ref&gt; A startling example of institutional mechanisms that allow for an unfettered environment for sexual harassment to fester is the [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] scandal at [[The Energy and Resources Institute]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/hostile-climate-rk-pachauri-reign-teri&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the education system could be the key to encouraging women to take up roles in this sector.

Recognizing the invisible nature of power structures that marginalize women at the workplace, the Supreme Court in the landmark case ''Vaishaka versus High Court of Rajasthan'' (1997) identified sexual harassment as violative of the women's right to equality in the workplace and enlarged the ambit of its definition. The judgment equates a [[hostile work environment]] on the same plane as a direct request for sexual favors. To quote: "Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as: physical contact and advances; a demand or request for sexual favours; sexually coloured remarks; showing pornography; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature". The judgement mandates appropriate work conditions should be provided for work, leisure, health, and hygiene to further ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at the workplace and no woman employee should have reasonable grounds to believe that she is disadvantaged in connection with her employment.

This law thus squarely shifts the onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies are yet to enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, "I have a few IT clients. When I point to the need for a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: "I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.

Not surprisingly many cases go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company policy is the first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing "woman's purity," the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and there is no guarantee that the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement."

===Effects on the working class===
Women in lower wage jobs are more likely to be subject to wage discrimination. They are more likely to bring home far less than their male counterparts with equal job status, and get far less help with housework from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.&lt;ref&gt;Edin, K. and Kefalas, M. (2005). ''Promises I Can Keep: Why poor women put motherhood before marriage. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in the history of this country,{{which|date=January 2014}} there were distinctive socioeconomic stratification among women as there has been among men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;

==Impact issues of female participation in the workforce==
A 2008 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found that women were 46% more likely to call in sick for short time periods than men and a third more likely than men to take short term sick leave.  At 60 days or more, men and women were equal in terms of sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Science Daily]]'', "[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212846.htm Women Take Almost 50 Percent More Short-term Sick Leave Than Men]", ''[[BMJ]]'', 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Women in the workforce have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers to be able to take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scharlach A. E. |author2=Grosswald B. | year = 1997 | title = The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 | url = | journal = Social Service Review | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 335–359 | doi=10.1086/604261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility===
Increased participation of women in the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]] effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well.&lt;ref name=bloom2007&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Bloom |first2=David |last2=Canning |first3=Günther |last3=Fink |first4=Jocelyn |last4=Finlay |year=2009 |title=Fertility, female labor force participation, and the demographic dividend |journal=[[Journal of Economic Growth]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1007/s10887-009-9039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[United Nation]]s data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/RevisedLIMpaper.PDF|title=Female Labour-Force Participation|author=Lin Lean Lim|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}, part of {{cite book|title=Completing the Fertility Transition|year=2009|publisher=[[United Nations]] Publications|isbn=9789211513707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] area, increased female labor participation has been associated with an increased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Note on the Changing Relationship between Fertility and Female Employment Rates in Developed Countries|author1=Namkee Ahn  |author2=Pedro Mira |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=15|issue=4|year=2002|pages=667–682|jstor=20007839 |doi=10.1007/s001480100078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causality analyses indicate that fertility rate influences female labor participation and not as much the other way around.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;

Regarding types of jobs, women who work in nurturing professions such as teaching and health generally have children at an earlier age.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt; It is theorized that women often self-select themselves into jobs with a favorable [[work–life balance]] in order to combine motherhood and employment.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-012-9277-y|author1=Nicoletta Balbo |author2=Francesco C.

==History==

===19th century===
Women have worked at agricultural tasks since ancient times, and continue to do so around the world. The [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and early 19th centuries changed the nature of work in Europe and other countries of the Western world. Working for a [[wage]], and eventually a [[salary]], became part of urban life. Initially, women were to be found doing even the hardest physical labor, including working as "hurriers" hauling heavy coal carts through mine shafts in Great Britain, a job that also employed many children. This ended after government intervention and the passing of the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], an early attempt at regulating the workplace.

During the 19th century, an increasing number of women in Western countries took jobs in factories, such as textile mills, or on assembly lines for machinery or other goods. Women also worked as "[[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s" of produce, flowers, and other market goods, and bred small animals in the working-class areas of [[London]]. [[Piecework]], which involved needlework (weaving, embroidery, winding wool or silk) that paid by the piece completed, was the most common employment for women in 19th century Great Britain. It was poorly paid, and involved long hours, up to 14 hours per day to earn enough wages to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class women were usually involved in some form of paid employment, as it provided some insurance against the possibility that their husband might become too ill or injured to support the family. During the era before [[workers' compensation]] for disability or illness, the loss of a husband's wages could result in the entire family being sent to a Victorian [[workhouse]] to pay debts.

Inequality in wages was to be expected for women. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d. Employers stated they preferred to hire women, because they could be "more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1870 US Census]] was the first United States Census to count "females engaged in each occupation" and provides an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in [[sweatshop]]s. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory “operatives,” but [[teaching]] and the occupations of [[dressmaking]], [[Hatmaking|millinery]], and [[tailoring]] played a larger role. Two-thirds of [[teacher]]s were women. Women could also be found in such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), and hunter and trapper (2).

===20th century===
[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|right|upright "[[We Can Do It!]]" by [[J. Howard Miller]].|In the United States, the "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" image, as it has become known, is an iconic representation of the US government's efforts to exhort women to work during World War II, and has been adapted numerous times to represent working women or, more broadly, women overcoming adversity and other [[proto-feminist]] messages.]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such.&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10"&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p.10. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1972,&lt;/ref&gt; Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until the right man came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p. 9. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the turn of the 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women and a whole coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. H: "Life in the Age of Enterprise", pp. 120-121. Capricorn Books, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[World War I]] made space for women in the workforce, among other economical and social influences. Due to the rise in demand for production from Europe during the raging war, more women found themselves working outside the home.

In the first quarter of the century, women mostly occupied jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, "lace-collar" jobs.&lt;ref name="Green-57"&gt;Green, E: "The Uncertainty of Everyday Life, 1915–1945", pp. 57-58. HarperCollins, 1992,&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1920, [[The New York Times]] ran a head line that read: "the American Woman ... has lifted her skirts far beyond any modest limitation"&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10" /&gt; which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling up their sleeves and skirts and making their way into the workforce.

[[World War II]] created millions of jobs for women. Thousands of American women actually joined the military:
140,000 in the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)]] WAC;
100,000 in the Navy (WAVE);
23,000 in the Marines;
14,000 in the [[Navy Nurse Corps]] and,
13,000 in the Coast Guard.
Although almost none saw combat, they replaced men in noncombat positions and got the same pay as the men would have on the same job. At the same time over 16 million men left their jobs to join the war in Europe and elsewhere, opening even more opportunities and places for women to take over in the job force.&lt;ref name="Green-57"/&gt; Although two million women lost their jobs after the war ended, female participation in the workforce was still higher than it had ever been.&lt;ref name=Moody1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Moody|title=An injury to all : the decline of American Unionism|year=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London|page=22|isbn=0860919293|quote=The rate of participation of women in the labor force rose from about 28% in 1940 to 37% in 1945 and then fell to 30% in 1947.

Newspapers and magazines directed at women encouraged them to keep a tidy home while their husbands were away at work. These articles presented the home as a woman's proper domain, which she was expected to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/05/22/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday May 22, 1949|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era|last=May|first=Elaine Tyler|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=10–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, jobs were still available to women.

===The Quiet Revolution===

The increase of women in the labor force of Western countries gained momentum in the late 19th century. At this point women married early on and were defined by their marriages. If they entered the workforce, it was only out of necessity.

The first phase encompasses the time between the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era gave birth to the "independent female worker." From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, as we enter into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35–44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more "respectable", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of [[marriage bars]], which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more participation in the work force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity.

In the third phase, labeled the "roots of the revolution" encompassing the time from 1950– mid-to-late 1970s, the movement began to approach the warning signs of a revolution. Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and intermittent work force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a "career". To illustrate, most women were secondary earners, and worked in "pink-collar jobs" as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians. The [[sexual harassment]] experienced by these [[Pink-collar worker|pink collar]] workers is depicted in the film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]''. Although more women attended college, it was often expected that they attended to find a spouse—the so-called "M.R.S. degree". Nevertheless, Labor force participation by women still grew significantly.

The fourth phase, known as the "Quiet Revolution", began in the late 1970s and continues on today. Beginning in the 1970s women began to flood colleges and grad schools. They began to enter profession like [[women in medicine|medicine]], law, dental and business. More women were going to college and expected to be employed at the age of 35, as opposed to past generations that only worked intermittently due to marriage and childbirth. This increase in expectations of long-term gainful employment is reflected in the change of majors adopted by women from the 1970s on. The percentage of women majoring in education declined beginning in the 1970s;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} education was once a popular major for women since it allowed them to step into and out of the labor force when they had children and when their children grew up to a reasonable age at which their mothers did not have to serve primarily as caretakers. Instead, majors such as business and management were on the rise in the 1970s, as women ventured into other fields that were once predominated by men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} They experienced an expansion of their horizons and an alteration of what it meant to define their own identity. Women worked before they got married, and since women were marrying later in life{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} they were able to define themselves prior to a serious relationship. Research indicates that from 1965 to 2002, the increase in women's labor force participation more than offset the decline for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2003/wp2003-22.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|title=''Do Women’s and Men’s Labor Market Outcomes Differentially Affect Real Wage Growth and Inflation?''|date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for this big jump in the 1970s has been attributed by some scholars to widespread access to the [[birth control pill]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} While "the pill" was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'', 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the [[age of majority]] had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely as a consequence of the [[Vietnam War]]; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a "big bang" revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldin, Claudia | title = The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education and Family | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 96 | issue = 2 | date = 2006 | pages = 1–21 | doi=10.1257/000282806777212350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupational safety and health ==
Women tend to have different occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[tendonitis]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[stress (psychological)|stress]], respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress may be due to the fact that women are often [[caregiver]]s at home and do [[contingent work]] and [[contract work]] at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is [[homicide]], which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/women/#2|title = Women's Safety and Health Issues at Work|date = June 19, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women are at lower risk for work-related death than men. However, [[personal protective equipment]] is usually designed for typical male proportions, which can create hazards for women who have ill-fitting equipment.&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; Women are less likely to report an occupational injury than men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research is ongoing into occupational hazards that may be specific to women. Of particular interest are potential [[Toxic substance|environmental causes]] of [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] is an occupational hazard for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[insomnia]], and feelings of low self-esteem and alienation. Women are also at higher risk for [[occupational stress]], which can be caused by balancing roles as a parent or caregiver with work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
