After the initial focus on Sanlu—market leader in the budget segment—government inspections revealed the problem existed to a lesser degree in products from 21 other companies, including an [[Arla Foods]]-[[Mengniu]] joint venture company known as Arla Mengniu, [[Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Company|Yili]], and [[Yashili]].&lt;ref name="seized"&gt;{{cite news|date=16 September 2008 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/17/content_10046949.htm |title=China seizes 22 companies with contaminated baby milk powder |agency=Xinhua News Agency |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archivedate=21 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021182912/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/17/content_10046949.htm |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue raised concerns about food safety and political corruption in China, and damaged the reputation of China's food exports. At least 11 countries stopped all imports of Chinese dairy products.  A number of criminal prosecutions were conducted by the Chinese government. Two people were executed, one given a suspended death penalty, three people receiving life imprisonment, two receiving 15-year jail terms,&lt;ref name="penalty"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=China Daily |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-01/23/content_7422983.htm |title=Two get death in tainted milk case |date=23 January 2009 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605213222/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-01/23/content_7422983.htm |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seven local government officials, as well as the Director of the [[Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine]] (AQSIQ), were fired or forced to resign.&lt;ref name="crisisman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/25/content_10112354.htm |title=Crisis management helps China's dairy industry recover |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224171457/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/25/content_10112354.htm |archivedate=24 December 2008 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] referred to the incident as one of the largest food safety events it has had to deal with in recent years, and that the crisis of confidence among Chinese consumers would be hard to overcome. A spokesman said the scale of the problem proved it was "clearly not an isolated accident, [but] a large-scale intentional activity to deceive consumers for simple, basic, short-term profits."&lt;ref name=voa/&gt;  In late October 2008, similar adulteration with melamine was discovered in eggs and possibly other food. The source was traced to melamine being added to animal feed, despite a ban imposed in June 2007 following the [[2007 pet food recalls|scandal over pet food]] ingredients exported to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=China Daily |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-11/01/content_7164471.htm |title=Checks on animal feed 'tightened' |author=Wu Jiao |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430232922/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-11/01/content_7164471.htm |archivedate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Jiang Weisuo]], a 44-year-old general manager of a dairy products plant in Shanxi province, was rumoured to have been murdered in [[Xi'an]] city. It was Weisuo who had first alerted authorities to the scandal. According to the Xi'an Evening News, Jiang died in hospital on 12 November from knife wounds inflicted by his wife, Yang Ping, but the purported murder by his wife was subsequently reported to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1089540/mystery-surrounds-death-milk-whistleblower-jiang-weisuo |title=Mystery surrounds death of milk whistleblower Jiang Weisuo |author=Zhuang Pinghui |work=South China Morning Post |date=24 November 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2013 |archivedate=29 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129013334/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1089540/mystery-surrounds-death-milk-whistleblower-jiang-weisuo |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melamine==
{{Main|Melamine}}
Melamine is used to manufacture [[melamine resin|melamine-formaldehyde resin]], a type of plastic known for its flame-retardant properties and commonly employed in countertops, dry-erase boards, etc. Melamine itself is nitrogen-rich and is sometimes illegally added to food products to increase their apparent protein content. It has also been employed as a [[non-protein nitrogen]], appearing in soy meal, corn gluten meal and cottonseed meal used in cattle feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSPEK166968 |title=Melamine use "rampant" in China feed business |date=25 September 2008 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=26 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930072446/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSPEK166968 |archivedate=30 September 2008 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melamine is known to cause [[renal failure]] and kidney stones in humans and animals when it reacts with [[cyanuric acid]] inside the body. The use of melamine in food production is not approved by WHO or national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/media/faq/QAmelamine/en/ |title=Questions and Answers on melamine |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=3 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929165515/http://www.who.int/csr/media/faq/QAmelamine/en/ |archivedate=29 September 2008 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kjeldahl method|Kjeldahl]] and [[Dumas method|Dumas]] methods used to test for protein levels fail to distinguish between nitrogen in melamine and naturally occurring in [[amino acid]]s, allowing the protein levels to be falsified. Introduced into milk, it can help conceal fraudulent dilution with water.&lt;ref name="melamine"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Chen|title=Melamine&amp;nbsp;– an industry staple|pages=Page A2|work= South China Morning Post|location=Hong Kong|date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melamine adulteration of food products also made headlines when [[2007 pet food recalls|pet food was recalled]] in Europe and the U.S. in 2007.

===Source of contamination===
The World Health Organization (WHO) said melamine may be found "in a variety of milk and milk products at varying levels, from low [[Parts-per notation|ppb]] to [[Parts-per notation|ppm]] ranges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/infosan_events/en/index.html |title=Melamine and Cyanuric acid: Toxicity, Preliminary Risk Assessment and Guidance on Levels in Food |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=3 October 2008 |date=25 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005205857/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/infosan_events/en/index.html |archivedate=5 October 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One academic suggested [[cyromazine]], a melamine derivative pesticide commonly used in China for a long time, is absorbed into plants as melamine; it may therefore have long been present in products such as poultry, eggs, fish, and dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Because of poor animal husbandry, production and storage and the demand for milk far outstripping supplies, the use of other potentially harmful chemical [[Food additive|additives]] such as [[preservative]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]] has been reported by independent media as being commonplace. Quality tests can be falsified with additives: peroxide is added to prevent milk going bad; industrial [[vegetable oil]] is [[Emulsion|emulsified]] and added to boost fat levels; [[whey]] is used to increase [[lactose]] content.&lt;ref name=common&gt;{{cite news|author=Josephine Ma|date=19 September 2008|title=Adding chemicals to milk common: insiders, Page A3|work=South China Morning Post|location=Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=opensecret&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the procurement chain is also implicated, as milk agents are often politically well-connected.&lt;ref name=common/&gt; Farmers report salespeople had, for years, been visiting farms in dairy areas hawking "protein powder" additives, which would often be delivered in unmarked brown paper bags of {{convert|25|kg}} each. A new version of "protein powder", capable of fooling dairies as to protein content, started being peddled approximately two years ago.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} Thus, farmers either added melamine contaminant unwittingly, or turned a blind eye to milk adulteration to ensure their milk was not rejected.&lt;ref name=opensecret/&gt; The big dairy producers were complicit in producing "test-tube milk".&lt;ref name=common/&gt;

''[[Caijing]]'' reported in 2008 that "spiking fresh milk with additives such as melamine" was no longer a secret to Hebei dairy farmers for the past two years. Because of fierce competition for supplies, and the higher prices paid by Mengniu and Yili, Sanlu's procurement became squeezed; its inspection system became compromised "as early as 2005 and allowed milk collection stations to adopt unscrupulous business practices", while government supervision was "practically nonexistent".&lt;ref name=blame&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.caijing.com.cn/2008-10-10/110019183.html |title=Spilling the Blame for China's Milk Crisis |date=10 October 2008 |work=Caijing |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014180405/http://english.caijing.com.cn/2008-10-10/110019183.html |archivedate=14 October 2008 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caijing'' also reported the melamine in the tainted milk may have come from scrap melamine costing ¥700 per tonne—less than one-tenth of the price of 99% pure industrial grade melamine. The melamine production process produces pure melamine by crystallisation; the melamine remaining in the [[mother liquor]] is impure (70%) and unusable for plastics, so it is scrapped. It said Sanlu's baby formula melamine content was a result of tampering by adding low-cost vegetable protein (such as low-grade soya powder), and large amounts of scrap melamine as filler.&lt;ref group=cj name=ex01&gt;"按照目前的三聚氰胺价格，在饲料甚至原料奶中添加这种物质，从经济上而言并不合算。如果奶粉或者液态奶中出现的三聚氰胺是由于添加三聚氰胺废料引起，那么值得担心的不仅仅是这种物质"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrap melamine contains impurities such as cyanuric acid that form more insoluble crystals ([[melamine cyanurate]]) than melamine alone, aggravating the problem.

In late October, the government announced health officials had surveyed 300,000 Beijing families with children less than 3 years old. It disclosed approximately 74,000 families had a child who had been fed melamine-tainted milk, but did not reveal how many of those children had fallen ill as a result.&lt;ref name="tainted eggs"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/world/asia/27china.htm|title=Tainted Eggs From China Discovered in Hong Kong|author=David Barboza|work=The New York Times|date=26 October 2008|accessdate=2 April 2010}} {{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the many months before the scandal was exposed, the media suggest the official figures are likely to be understated. Kidney stones in infants started being reported in several parts of China in the past two years. A number of yet-to-be-officially-acknowledged cases were reported by the media. However, those deaths without an official verdict may be denied compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Urinary calculi specimens were collected from 15 cases treated in Beijing and were analysed as unknown objects for their components at Beijing Institute of Microchemistry using infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The result of the analyses showed the calculi were composed of melamine and [[uric acid]], and the molecular ratio of uric acid to melamine was around 2:1.&lt;ref name="SUN_2009"&gt;{{cite journal

In a study published in 2010, researchers from Peking University studying ultrasound images of infants who fell ill in the 2008 contamination found while most children in a rural Chinese area recovered, 12 percent still showed kidney abnormalities six months later. "The potential for long-term complications after exposure to melamine remains a serious concern", the report said. "Our results suggest a need for further follow-up of affected children to evaluate the possible long-term impact on health, including renal function."&lt;ref name="LIU_2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liu|pmid=20176755|url= http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/abstract/cmaj.091063v1|title=Urinary tract abnormalities in Chinese rural children who consumed melamine-contaminated dairy products: a population-based screening and follow-up study|journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=23 February 2010|doi=10.1503/cmaj.091063 |last2=Ren|first2=A|last3=Yang |first3=L|last4=Gao|first4=J|last5=Pei|first5=L|last6= Ye|first6=R|last7=Qu|first7=Q|last8=Zheng|first8=X|volume=182|issue=5|pages=439–43|pmc= 2842835|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanlu===
The scandal began with revelations of contamination of [[Sanlu Group|Sanlu]] milk products. The New Zealand dairy cooperative [[Fonterra]], which owned a 43% stake in Sanlu, said they were alerted to melamine contamination on 2 August (almost a month before the issue became public), and have said to have pushed hard for a full [[Product recall|public recall]]. Although there was an immediate trade recall, Fonterra said that local administrators refused an official recall.&lt;ref name=alerted&gt;{{cite news|author=Klaudia Lee|date=16 September 2008|title=NZ alerted China to tainted milk, PM says|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|location=Hong Kong|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fonterra]] director had given San Lu management a document detailing the European Union's permitted levels of melamine, but Fonterra chief executive Andrew Ferrier has stated that at no time did Fonterra say small amounts of melamine were acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-28/fonterra-denies-advocating-melamine-use-in-milk/275912|location=New Zealand|work=ABC|first=Kerri|last=Ritchie|title=Fonterra denies advocating melamine use in milk scandal|date=28 December 2009|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warning signs ignored====
From 2005 to 2006, an agent, [[Jiang Weisuo]], from [[Shaanxi]] Jinqiao Dairy Company in northwest China reportedly publicly discussed his fears about unauthorised substances being added to competitors' milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95026204|title=Chinese Milk Worker: Complaints Ignored For Years|work=NPR.org|access-date=27 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His complaints to regulators and dairy makers in 2005 and 2006 never yielded any result; his story was picked up by China Central Television, who ran a report complete with footage of adulteration in progress, yet the Shaanxi Quality and Technical Supervision Bureau said they failed to find evidence of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=opensecret/&gt;

In June, Jiangsu media reported a two-month surge in the number of babies diagnosed with kidney disease; in July, a parent of a sick baby in Hunan questioned Sanlu's [[powdered milk]] and complained to the AQSIQ. Gansu Province sent a report to the Ministry of Health on 16 July to alert that one local hospital had identified an increase in the incidence of kidney ailments among babies in the months earlier, and that most victims had consumed Sanlu's baby formula. The health ministry sent investigators to Gansu in early August.&lt;ref name=blame/&gt;

A [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] investigation revealed Sanlu began receiving complaints about sick infants as far back as December 2007, but did no tests until June 2008. It said leading government officials in Shijiazhuang city had failed to report the contamination to provincial and state authorities (until 9 September) in violation of rules on reporting major incidents involving food safety.&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite news|work=China Daily |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-09/22/content_7048712.htm |title=Probe finds producer knew of toxic milk for months |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025114758/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-09/22/content_7048712.htm |archivedate=25 October 2008 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[People's Daily]]'', Sanlu wrote a letter to Shijiazhuang city government on 2 August 2008, asking for help to "increase control and coordination of the media, to create a good environment for the recall of the company's problem products&amp;nbsp;... to avoid whipping up the issue and creating a negative influence in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/10/01/us-china-milk-idUSTRE48T0L920081001 |author=Ben Blanchard |title=China Milk Scandal Firm Asked For Cover-Up Help |date=1 October 2008 |work=Reuters |accessdate=14 February 2014 |archivedate=15 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215164311/https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/10/01/us-china-milk-idUSTRE48T0L920081001 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to accounts confirmed by media reports and health officials, the company tried to buy off critics and cover up the contamination. In a memo dated 11 August, Beijing-based public relations agency Teller International advised Sanlu to seek cooperation with major search engines to censor negative information. The agency reportedly had repeatedly contacted key account staff at [[Baidu]] and proposed a ¥3&amp;nbsp;million (US$440,000) budget to screen all negative news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Hume |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/648766/Leaked-memo-alleges-milk-cover-up |title=Leaked memo alleges milk 'cover-up' |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |date=27 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140426144231/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/648766/Leaked-memo-alleges-milk-cover-up |archivedate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baidu&gt;{{cite news|date=13 September 2008|url= http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/13/15472456026.shtml|script-title=zh:百度声明：从未答应屏蔽三鹿负面 |trans-title=Baidu declares: We never agreed to bury Sanlu negative news|publisher= [[Sina.com]]|language=Chinese|accessdate=2 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the memo began circulating on the internet, Baidu denounced, in a communiqué on 13 September 2008, the approaches by said agency on several occasions, saying the proposal was firmly rejected, as it violated their corporate principles of unbiased and transparent reporting.&lt;ref name=baidu/&gt;

During the week of 22 December 2008, 17 people involved in producing, selling, buying and adding melamine in raw milk went on trial. Tian Wenhua, former Sanlu general manager, and three other company executives appeared in court in Shijiazhuang, charged with producing and selling milk contaminated with melamine. According to ''Xinhua'', Tian pleaded guilty, and told the court she learned about the tainted milk complaints from consumers in mid-May. She then apparently headed a working team to handle the case, but did not report to the Shijiazhuang city government until 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The State Council ordered the testing of product of all dairy producers, and to this end, some 5,000 inspectors were dispatched.

The events have exposed the often-incestuous relationship between local business and local government. In addition to the tax revenues to local authorities—Sanlu contributed ¥330&amp;nbsp;million in 2007, many companies invite local officials to become "silent partners" in their corporations—in return for "protection" at the political level; former Sanlu chairman Tian Wenhua, was made honorary deputy to the Provincial People's Congress.&lt;ref name=willylam&gt;{{cite news

Consumer panic resulting from the contaminated milk lessened demand for dairy products, causing hardship to more than 2 million Chinese farmers who had nowhere to sell their milk and no means by which to support their dairy cows. Farmers reportedly poured away milk and faced selling cows to a buyerless market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Since the scandal erupted, sales have fallen by 30–40% on a comparative basis, according to the Chinese Dairy Association. The Association estimates the financial effect of the order of ¥20&amp;nbsp;billion, and forecasts that confidence may take up to two years to be fully restored.&lt;ref group=nF name=ex01&gt;"中國奶業協會常務理事王丁棉向記者透露,事件對伊利、蒙牛、光明這三大品牌一線企業的打擊與影響,是較嚴重的。 " 他们的近期产品销售业绩已一落千丈,跌至同期数据的30%–40%。就全国乳品行业而言,它所受到的负面影响也是很大的,此场危机的最低谷波峰期可能要维持至2至3个月之久,至明年中期前仍会处于一个恢复期中。过了恢复期,市场应该开始有明显的反弹,整个事件的阴影淡化直到出现全面的复苏,也许还需要1至 2年的时间。但复苏的速度完全取决于消费者消费信心的恢复与树立。”
王丁棉感慨,这次事件对中国奶业造成的经济损失粗略估计应该超过200亿以上,可谓损失惨重。"&lt;/ref&gt;
In an effort to prop up sales and retain their market share, dairy firms have cancelled their common accord not to use [[sales promotion|promotions]] to fight the sales decline: substantial discounts (including [[BOGOF]]), free gifts and other [[point of sale]] incentives were being offered to shoppers. Their new products are conspicuously labelled "safety inspection passed" to allay consumer fears.&lt;ref group=nF name=ex02&gt;

====Top leaders' comments====
AQSIQ announced the revocation of all exemptions from inspection previously granted to dairy producers, who were asked to cease citing the privilege in their advertisements.

On 9 October 2008, in an attempt to control the damage to Chinese dairy exports, officials at a [[World Trade Organization]] meeting insisted that contamination had been "accidental", directly contradicting the WHO observations.&lt;ref name=stillsick/&gt; Chinese trade representatives criticised countries which have imposed blanket bans on Chinese food products.

====Stepped-up inspection program====
According to a senior quality inspectorate official, the government aimed to establish nearly 400 product testing centres within the next two years, and 80 of these would be food testing centres.

On 24 September 2008, China's newly appointed AQSIQ chief Wang Yong said that the government would "carry out 'forceful' measures to deal with the chemical contamination"; it's inspectors had removed 7,000 tonnes of melamine contaminated dairy products from shops all over China.&lt;ref name=chan/&gt;

On 4 October, the Ministry of Agriculture announced it had drawn up an emergency rescue plan with the Ministry of Finance to give special subsidies to dairy farmers, seriously affected by the lack of demand following the contamination scandal; local governments had already drafted policies to stabilise the dairy industry; 150,000 officials had been sent to overhaul the entire supply chains from cattle feed to milk collection; 18,803 milk-collecting stations had been registered and checked by these officials. The ministry was reported to have investigated 98 dairy producers and farms, banned 151 illegal companies and indicted three manufacturers for feed containing melamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.sina.com/china/2008/1004/189793.html |title=China Central Gov't to Subsidize Dairy Farmers After Tainted Milk Scandal |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=4 October 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archivedate=21 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221215718/http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2008-09/26/content_10113352.htm |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During an investigation into melamine contamination at Yili and Mengniu in Hohhot, police arrested six more people for allegedly selling and mixing melamine into raw milk.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine stated all dairy products made before 14 September will be tested for melamine. They gave notice to all supermarkets, shops, and all city, town and village-level vendors to urgently remove and seal up all powdered milk and liquid milk made before 14 September, pending further testing.

The Ministry of Health and five other government agencies issued a joint statement on 9 October, setting the legally acceptable level of melamine content in infant formula at 1 ppm (1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), and at 2.5ppm in other dairy products (including milk). The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said that any amount exceeding 1 ppm would give reason to suspect its presence was intentional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Public relations====
On 26 September 2008, in order to quell the disquiet over the speech by Zhu Yonglan of the CGOSFSC regarding leaders' insulation from the food-security issues faced by the general population, Xinhua issued a brief statement, in Chinese, denying the existence of the Centre, the award, or any person named Zhu Yonglan, saying these were "purely rumours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2008-09/26/content_10113352.htm |script-title=zh:中央国家机关食品特供中心"相关信息属谣传 |trans-title=Information on Central Government Offices Special Food Supply Centre are only rumours |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |language=zh |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105105831/http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2008-09/26/content_10113352.htm |archivedate=5 January 2009 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September, the AQSIQ tests on baby milk powder produced by 109 companies showed 69 batches from 22 companies to be melamine-contaminated; the State Council attempted to reassure that formula produced by most companies in China was safe. It said: "the number of companies with melamine-tainted milk accounted for 20.18% of the total of powdered milk companies in China; the number of tainted batches accounted for 14.05% of the total batches tested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the suppression of bad news had not improved since the scandal was uncovered: media rigidly adheres to the official line, as ordered; Chinese consumers were ill-informed about the extent of global recalls. It reported local journalists saying that discussion of the causes of the crisis, government responsibility, questions about government complicity with dairy companies, was strictly off limits.&lt;ref name=bandurski&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2 April 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122332462058208791 |title=Press Controls Feed China's Food Problem |author=David Bandurski |date=7 October 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026103319/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122332462058208791 |archivedate=26 October 2013 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pressure on the legal profession====
A group of 90 lawyers from Hebei, Henan and Shandong—the three worst affected provinces—had made ''[[pro bono]]'' offers to assist victims, and a list of their names was published. Organisers of the group declared that they had come under pressure from officials to not get involved in the issue. The Beijing Lawyers' Association, a part of the Communist Party apparatus, asked its members "to put faith in the party and government". Other members of the group have reportedly received less subtle requests. Authorities are said to fear social unrest if lawsuits were unleashed.&lt;ref name=shun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/653669/lawyers-warned-shun-milk-suits |author=Ng Tze-wei |title=Lawyers warned to shun milk suits |page=A2 |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=23 September 2008 |archivedate=6 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206002421/http://www.scmp.com/article/653669/lawyers-warned-shun-milk-suits |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Beijing Hong Kong journal ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' reported that central authorities, fearful of the effect of mass lawsuits, held a meeting with lawyers' groups on 14 September, asking them to "act together, and help maintain stability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Chang Boyang, one of the group of volunteer lawyers, said he had filed a suit in Guangdong against Sanlu on behalf of the parents of one victim. One was already filed in Henan.&lt;ref name="cool reception"/&gt; Chang said that Henan's justice department had ordered 14 Henan lawyers to stop helping the kidney stone victims, saying it had become a political issue. He claims he was told by the official to "follow the arrangements set out by the government", and was further threatened: "If this suggestion is disobeyed, the lawyer and the firm will be dealt with."&lt;ref name=lawyers/&gt; Zhang Yuanxin, lawyer and officer in the Xinjiang Lawyers' Association said that the actions of certain departments in government have "set back the development of the legal profession". He said that it was "intolerable" for government to interfere in the affairs of the judiciary, denying the right of ordinary citizens to sue.&lt;ref name=freeasia/&gt;

An official said that central government had issued instructions placing the cases on hold, pending a decision on how to handle the cases in a unified manner. Furthermore, that court was instructed not to give any written replies or accept Sanlu-related cases in the meantime.&lt;ref name=canaves/&gt;

====On the economic root cause====
[[Stratfor]] believed that the act of adulterating milk and baby food in full knowledge of potentially severe sanctions, including execution, seemed like "an act of desperation". It noted that in 2008 dairy farmers became squeezed by growing costs of livestock, feed, facilities, and government-imposed price caps. Mengniu's share price fell 12% since October 2007 because of higher costs of raw milk (due partly to rising costs of cattle feed) and price controls—anti-inflation measures targeted at the dairy sector announced on 16 January. Milk suppliers accordingly resorted to subtler cost-cutting methods to preserve diminishing profits.&lt;ref name=stratfor&gt;{{cite news|title=China: The Economic Roots of the Milk Scandal|publisher=Stratfor|date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====On the damage caused====
Joseph Sternberg of ''[[the Wall Street Journal]]'' said that Beijing's failures of food-safety act are "much more pernicious, and disgraceful, than at first it appears&amp;nbsp;... [not only has this] milk poisoned thousands of infants with melamine, it also poisons the society at large with fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 October 2008 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122358125053920083?mod=googlenews_wsj|title= Notes on a Milk Scandal|author=Joseph Sternberg|work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyer Bill Marler, speaking at a food safety conference in Beijing, said that this food scare has harmed the "[[made in China]]" brand abroad. He remarked: "If this product had gotten into the United States, it would have been '[[game over]]' for a lot of products in China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The similarities between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't come as a great surprise. Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government unable or unwilling to regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The rewards are instant, and it's not always easy for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored—particularly with a substance like milk, which we have been taught to trust implicitly.&lt;ref name=swill/&gt;
''Bee Wilson, The New York Times''&lt;/div&gt;An op-ed in ''[[the New York Times]]'' compared this to the "[[swill milk scandal]]" in New York in the 1850s in which 8,000 children reportedly died from milk from cows fed swill which was then whitened with [[plaster of Paris]], thickened with starch, eggs and hued with molasses".&lt;ref name=swill&gt;{{cite news

The hopeful news in all this is that in the process of creating so much toxicity both the distressed loans and the distressed food are teaching us important lessons about the limits of scale and regulation that support the massive globalisation of the last decade. We are learning that regulators have lost the ability, if they ever had it, to truly monitor the extent of the danger.&lt;ref name="gumpert"&gt;{{cite news

An article published in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' likened the regulatory failures of the milk scandal to the distressed assets in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], and questioned whether regulators in either case ever understood or truly monitored the extent of the danger.&lt;ref name=gumpert/&gt;

Louis Klarevas, a professor at [[New York University]]'s Center for Global Affairs, said of the products on the list of potentially harmful products reaching the US in recent years were exclusive to China: "Yet as more large-scale&amp;nbsp;labor&amp;nbsp;markets compete for their share of international trade, the incentives to cut corners will increase and the temptation to overlook hazardous goods might become a more common occurrence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/10/24/food-national-security-oped-cx_lk_1025klarevas.html |title=Food: An Issue Of National Security |author=Louis Klarevas |date=23 October 2008 |work=Forbes |accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026024717/http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/10/24/food-national-security-oped-cx_lk_1025klarevas.html |archivedate=26 October 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more positive note [[Bill Durodié]], then a senior fellow at the [[S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies]] in Singapore noted in 10 November 2008 issue of the ''Today'' newspaper there, in response to a question suggesting there may be more such incidents in future due to the more liberal trading relations with China, that: "exposing the Chinese to the world market is probably the fastest way of addressing these issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durodie.net/pdf/Today.pdf Alicia Wong (10 November 2008). Unhealthy business, ''Today'', Singapore]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Unz]] compares the Chinese government and media reaction favorably to the coverage of the [[Vioxx]] scandal in the US, saying that "American journalists seemed to focus more attention on a half-dozen fatalities in China than they did on the premature deaths of as many as 500,000 of their fellow American citizens".&lt;ref name="unz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/chinese-melamine-and-american-vioxx-a-comparison/ |title=Chinese Melamine and American Vioxx: A Comparison |author=Ron Unz |date=18 April 2012 |work=[[The American Conservative]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428100830/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/chinese-melamine-and-american-vioxx-a-comparison/ |archivedate=28 April 2012 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====On the power structure====
[[Hu Xingdou]] (胡星斗), a professor at [[Beijing Institute of Technology]], said: "There hasn't been an effort to establish a moral foundation to the market economy, and this incident is the inevitable result." Hu urged the leadership to transform the way of thinking, to repair the system, rather than dealing with problems as they arise.&lt;ref name="time-23 September 2008"/&gt;

The dairy scandal raises the core question of whether the [[Communist Party of China|ruling Communist Party]] is capable of creating a transparent, accountable regulatory structure within a one-party system. ''Time Magazine'' cited many analysts saying the party's need to maintain control of the economy and of information undermines the independence of any regulatory system.&lt;ref name="warnings"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analyst, Willy Lam, a Senior Fellow at [[The Jamestown Foundation]], indicated that CCP's pervasive control over political and economic resources has resulted in the absence of meaningful systematic checks and balances. "Institutions that could provide some oversight over party and government authorities—for example, the legislature, the courts or the media—are tightly controlled by CCP apparatchiks."&lt;ref name=willylam/&gt; A Beijing-based consultancy, Dragonomics, concurred that "the problem was rooted in the Communist Party's continued involvement in pricing control, company management and the flow of information". Independent regulation was lacking or ineffective as local industries' were so intertwined with local officialdom.&lt;ref name=warnings/&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' noted that while one child in 20 in Shanghai may have kidney damage as a result of drinking contaminated formula milk, on the other hand, "like the emperors of old, the new communist elite enjoy the finest produce from all over China, sourced by a high-security government department."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|location=London|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/china/article4837647.ece|title=China's elite eat pure food as babies die|author=Michael Sheridan|date=28 September 2008|work= The Times|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access Asia, a Shanghai-based consumer consultancy, said Fonterra was a classic example of western executives in China "believ[ing] advice in business books that they must avoid making their local partners 'lose face' at all costs." It suggested that Fonterra paid a heavy price in write-offs, a wrecked business and public condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3073998/China-milk-scandal-threatens-giant-dairy-firm.html |title=China milk scandal threatens giant dairy firm |date=24 September 2008 |author1=Richard Spencer |author2=Peter Foster |work=The Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archivedate=25 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525010431/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3073998/China-milk-scandal-threatens-giant-dairy-firm.html |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Caijing]]'' said the crisis revealed that there had been a "serious dereliction of duty" at the [[AQSIQ]], and that the government had failed as a "night watchman". Citing public consensus that government should limit itself to a supervisory role, it urged the construction of a regulatory system which addressed the role of regulators watching over the production process, avoiding over-regulation, '[[regulatory capture]]' and [[abuse of power]] by regulators. "Keeping the market in order and ensuring independent law enforcement should be part of the mandate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.caijing.com.cn/2008-10-06/110017648.html |title=Tainted Milk: Regulatory Do's and Don'ts |date=6 October 2008 |work=English Caijing |accessdate=9 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010072629/http://english.caijing.com.cn/2008-10-06/110017648.html |archivedate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====On the culture of secrecy====
[[David Bandurski]], journalist and researcher at [[China Media Project]], criticised the crippling media controls by the state combined with "runaway commercial greed", and said that the censorship "suppresses information critical to the well-being of ordinary Chinese".&lt;ref name="bandurski1"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that increased press freedom needs to be a component of any strategy to deal with this and other future food-security lapses in China. Free media in China could compensate for the underdeveloped [[rule of law]], and be important in keeping companies and regulators honest.&lt;ref name=bandurski/&gt; Bandurski cited warnings in the 9 October 2008 issues of ''[[Nanfang Daily]]'' and the ''Information Times'' for consumers to be aware of that problematic dairy stock (that produced before 14 September) have reappeared in some stores under cover of aggressive promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cmp.hku.hk/2008/10/11/1257/ |title=Are poisonous dairy products are still on the shelves in China? |date=11 October 2008 |author=David Bandurski |publisher=Journalism and Media studies centre, Hong Kong University |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727195607/http://cmp.hku.hk/2008/10/11/1257/ |archivedate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former senior party official [[Bao Tong]] said "the more dark secrets are exposed, the better. You can't cure the disease, or save the Chinese people, until you get to the root of the problem." "If the Chinese government tries to play down this incident, there will be no social stability in China, let alone harmony&amp;nbsp;...

==Impact and response==
===International agencies===
Jorgen Schlundt, head of food safety at the WHO criticised China's food-safety system for being "disjointed", saying that "poor communications between ministries and agencies may have prolonged the outbreak of melamine poisoning."&lt;ref name="cull"&gt;{{cite news|title=China melamine scandal prompts mass chicken cull |accessdate=2 April 2010 |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-36252520081031?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews |agency=Reuters |author=Ian Ransom |date=31 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414230406/http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-36252520081031?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews |archivedate=14 April 2009 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Zhao Lianhai]] (赵连海), a Chinese man whose son was sickened by tainted milk earlier that year, started a website called "Home for the Kidney Stone Babies" (结石宝宝之家, jieshibaobao.com), which helped families with children affected by tainted milk share their experiences, in part by maintaining a database of medical records.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=31 December 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB126220137567110673 |first1=Loretta |last1=Chao |first2=Jason |last2=Dean |title=China Is Losing a War Over Internet |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209170350/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB126220137567110673 |archivedate=9 February 2014 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website upset Chinese authorities, who detained Zhao in November 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision_id=172424&amp;item_id=172422 HRIchina.org]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130124350/http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision_id=172424&amp;item_id=172422 |date=30 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrested him in December 2009.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

The Chinese government said that producers violating the law "could have their licenses revoked and be handed over to law enforcement organs". A senior Agriculture Ministry official said that of a quarter of a million feed-makers and animal farms inspected for melamine contamination, inspectors found more than 500 engaged in "illegal or questionable practices". Some 3,700 tonnes of feed with excessive melamine were seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China feed makers guilty |date=1 November 2008 |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_297291.html |agency=Associated Press |work=Straits Times |location=Singapore |archivedate=13 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113185342/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_297291.html |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong regulators have requested certification of exported eggs, but the central government has not yet mounted a centralised response; although mainland authorities already require eggs to be certified as free of avian influenza and [[Sudan red dye]] prior to export following previous food-safety scares, the AQSIQ has declined nationwide testing. Local government, for example Guangdong authorities, have increased random inspections at poultry farms. They declared to "harshly crack down on the unlawful behaviour of illegally manufacturing, selling and using melamine".&lt;ref name=canaves/&gt;

The group aims to improve government coordination and enforcement and to solve systemic food safety problems. As part of its ongoing effort to find and destroy any melamine-tainted milk remaining on the market, the Chinese government announced that it was recalling 170 tons of powdered milk laced with the industrial chemical which was supposed to have been destroyed or buried in 2008 but has recently found to have been repackaged and placed back into the marketplace.&lt;ref name="FSN_2010_02_11"&gt;{{cite news

In July 2010, [[Xinhua]] reported that authorities had seized 64 tonnes of dairy product contaminated with melamine from Dongyuan Dairy Factory, in [[Minhe Hui and Tu Autonomous County|Minhe]] County, in [[Qinghai]], after authorities in [[Gansu]] discovered the contaminated powdered milk. Approximately 38 tonnes of raw materials had been purchased from [[Hebei]], raising the possibility that traders had bought tainted milk that was supposed to have been destroyed after the 2008 scandal. Police have detained the owner and production director of the factory. Powdered milk produced in the plant was mainly sold in [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangsu]], with only a small amount sold in Qinghai. Also, in [[Jilin]], authorities were testing samples of suspect powdered milk produced in [[Heilongjiang]].&lt;ref name=july2010&gt;{{cite news|author=Pliny |title=Melamine tainted milk re-emerges in northwest China plant |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/09/c_13392414.htm |quote=It is possible that traders had bought tainted milk that was supposed to be destroyed after the 2008 scandal, planning to process and resell it, said Wang Zhongxi, deputy chief of the quality control bureau in Gansu |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=9 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ugs4Zbe4?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/09/c_13392414.htm |archivedate= 3 December 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

At the end of June 2010, Beijing lowered the minimum protein level for raw milk, from 2.955 to 2.8%, to discourage dairy farmers from attempting to falsify the passing of protein tests. Wu Heping, secretary general of the Heilongjiang Dairy Industry Association noted that between 75% and 90% of raw milk in some provinces had failed to reach the old protein level standard (in place since 1986) in 2007 and 2008. He said that the new standard reflected "the reality of the domestic dairy farm industry". However, insiders believe this will not stop adulteration because milk price still depends on protein content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=14 July 2010|newspaper=''South China Morning Post''|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/719620/lower-milk-standard-ward-melamine-use|author=Zhuang Pinghui|title=Lower milk standard to ward off melamine use}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abnormal psychology''' is the branch of [[psychology]] that studies unusual patterns of [[behavior]], [[emotion]] and [[thought]], which may or may not be understood as precipitating a [[mental disorder]]. Although many behaviors could be considered as [[abnormality (behavior)|abnormal]], this branch of  psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.pearsonglobalschools.com/asset_mgr/current/201214/PsychologyChapter5.pdf Abnormal psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |last=Barlow |first=David |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |year=2012 |isbn=1-111-34362-4 |location=Belmont, CA, USA |pages=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, functionally, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by "abnormal". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] in regard to the [[mind-body problem]]. There have also been different approaches in trying to [[Classification of mental disorders|classify mental disorders]]. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are [[wikt:subnormal|subnormal]], [[wikt:supernormal|supernormal]] and [[paranormal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0074965 |title=What is abnormal psychology? |year=1930 |last1=Bridges |first1=J. W. |journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=430–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of abnormal psychology studies two types of behaviors: adaptive and [[maladaptive behavior]]s. Behaviors that are maladaptive suggest that some problem(s) exist, and can also imply that the individual is vulnerable and cannot cope with environmental stress, which is leading them to have problems functioning in daily life in their emotions, mental thinking, physical actions and talks. Behaviors that are adaptive are ones that are well-suited to the nature of people, their lifestyles and surroundings, and to the people that they communicate with, allowing them to understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology|publisher=Prentice Hall Inc.|location=USA|author=Sarason Irwin G.|edition=6th|author2=Sarason Barabara R.}}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Clinical psychology]] is the applied field of psychology that seeks to assess, understand and treat psychological conditions in clinical practice. The theoretical field known as 'abnormal psychology' may form a backdrop to such work, but clinical psychologists in the current field are unlikely to use the term 'abnormal' in reference to their practice. [[Psychopathology]] is a similar term to abnormal psychology but has more of an implication of an underlying [[pathology]] (disease process), and as such is a term more commonly used in the medical specialty known as [[psychiatry]].

==History==
{{Main|History of mental disorders}}

===Supernatural traditions===
Throughout time, societies have proposed several explanations of abnormal behavior within human beings. Beginning in some hunter-gatherer societies, [[animist]]s have believed that people demonstrating abnormal behavior are possessed by malevolent spirits. This idea has been associated with [[trepanation]], the practice of cutting a hole into the individual's skull in order to release the malevolent spirits.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansell and Lisa Damour. ''Abnormal Psychology''. Ch 3. pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been difficult to define abnormal psychology, one definition includes characteristics such as statistical infrequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davison|first=Gerald C.|title=Abnormal Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Veronica Visentin|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-470-84072-6|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more formalized response to spiritual beliefs about abnormality is the practice of [[exorcism]]. Performed by religious authorities, exorcism is thought of as another way to release evil spirits who cause pathological behavior within the person. In some instances, individuals exhibiting unusual thoughts or behaviors have been [[exile]]d from society or worse. Perceived [[witchcraft]], for example, has been punished by death. Two Catholic Inquisitors wrote the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (Latin for "The Hammer Against Witches"), that was used by many Inquisitors and witch-hunters. It contained an early taxonomy of perceived deviant behavior and proposed guidelines for prosecuting deviant individuals.

===Asylums===
The act of placing mentally ill individuals in a separate facility known as an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] dates to 1547, when [[King Henry VIII of England]] established the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|St. Mary of Bethlehem asylum]] in London. This hospital, nicknamed Bedlam, was famous for its deplorable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan (2013). ''Abnormal Psychology'' (6th ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0078035384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asylums remained popular throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance era]]. These early asylums were often in miserable conditions. Patients were seen as a “burden” to society and locked away and treated almost as beasts to be dealt with rather than patients needing treatment. However, many of the patients received helpful medical treatment. There was scientific curiosity into abnormal behavior although it was rarely investigated in the early asylums. Inmates in these early asylums were often put on display for profit as they were viewed as less than human. The early asylums were basically modifications of the existing criminal institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Theory &amp; Practice in Psychotherapy &amp; Counseling|last=Fadul|first=Jose A.|publisher=Lulu Press Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-312-34920-9|location=Raleigh, NC|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century the idea of humanitarian treatment for the patients gained much favor due to the work of [[Philippe Pinel]] in France.  He pushed for the idea that the patients should be treated with kindness and not the cruelty inflicted on them as if they were animals or criminals.  His experimental ideas such as removing the chains from the patients were met with reluctance. The experiments in kindness proved to be a great success, which helped to bring about a reform in the way mental institutions would be run..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{globalize|section|date=May 2013}}&lt;!--section exclusively discusses the English speaking parts of the world--&gt;
Institutionalization would continue to improve throughout the 19th and 20th century due to work of many humanitarians such as [[Dorethea Dix]], and the [[mental hygiene movement]] which promoted the physical well-being of the mental patients.  "Dix more than any other figure in the nineteenth century, made people in America and virtually all of Europe aware that the insane were being subjected to incredible abuses."&lt;ref&gt;Rimm, David C., and John W. Somervill. Abnormal Psychology. New York: Academic, 1977. Print.{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this movement millions of dollars were raised to build new institutions to house the mentally ill. Mental hospitals began to grow substantially in numbers during the 20th century as care for the mentally ill increased in them.

By 1939 there were over 400,000 patients in state mental hospitals in the USA.&lt;ref name = Osborn&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11126-009-9109-3 |title=From Beauty to Despair: The Rise and Fall of the American State Mental Hospital |year=2009 |last1=Osborn |first1=Lawrence A. |journal=Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=219–31 |pmid=19633958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hospital stays were normally quite long for the patients, with some individuals being treated for many years.  These hospitals while better than the asylums of the past were still lacking in the means of effective treatment for the patients, and even though the reform movement had occurred; patients were often still met with cruel and inhumane treatment.

Things began to change in the year 1946 when [[Mary Jane Ward]] published the influential book titled “[[The Snake Pit]]” which was made into a popular movie of the same name. The book called attention to the conditions which mental patients faced and helped to spark concern in the general public to create more humane mental health care in these overcrowded hospitals.&lt;ref name = Osborn/&gt;

In this same year the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] was also created which provided support for the training of hospital employees and research into the conditions which afflicted the patients. During this period the Hill-Burton Acts was also passed which was a program that funded mental health hospitals. Along with the Community Health Services Act of 1963, the Hill-Burton Acts helped with the creation of outpatient psychiatric clinics, inpatient general hospitals, and rehabilitation and community consultation centers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Deinstitutionalisation ===
{{POV section|date=May 2013}}&lt;!--Was deinstitutionalisation really all bad??--&gt;
In the late twentieth century however, a large number of mental hospitals were closed due to lack of funding and overpopulation. In England for example only 14 of the 130 psychiatric institutions that had been created in the early 20th century remained open at the start of the 21st century.&lt;ref name = Osborn/&gt; In 1963, President John Kennedy launched the community health movement in the United States as a "bold new approach" to mental health care, aimed at coordinating mental health services for citizens in mental health centers. In the span of 40 years, the United States was able to see an about 90 percent drop in the number of patients in Psychiatric hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan (2013). Abnormal Psychology (6th ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0078035384}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend was not only in the England and the United States but worldwide with countries like Australia having too many mentally ill patients and not enough treatment facilities. Recent studies have found that the prevalence of mental illness has not decreased significantly in the past 10 years, and has in fact increased in frequency regarding specific conditions such as anxiety and mood disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15614263.2010.496561 |title=The thin blue line of mental health in Australia |year=2010 |last1=Clifford |first1=Katrina |journal=Police Practice and Research |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=355–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to a large number of the patients being released while not being fully cured of the disorder they were hospitalized for. This became known as the phenomenon of [[deinstitutionalization]]. This movement had noble goals of treating the individuals outside of the isolated mental hospital by placing them into communities and support systems. Another goal of this movement was to avoid the potential negative adaptations that can come with long term hospital confinements. Many professionals for example were concerned that patients would find permanent refuge in mental hospitals which would take them up when the demands of everyday life were too difficult. However, the patients moved to the community living have not fared well typically, as they often speak of how they feel “abandoned” by the doctors who used to treat them. It also has had the unfortunate effect of placing many of the patients in homelessness. Many safe havens for the deinstitutionalized mentally ill have been created, but it is nevertheless estimated that around 26.2% of people who are currently homeless have some form of a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10597-011-9473-y |title=Characteristics of Homeless Adults with Serious Mental Illnesses Served by Three Street-Level Federally Funded Homelessness Programs |year=2012 |last1=Page |first1=Jaimie |last2=Petrovich |first2=James |last3=Kang |first3=Suk-Young |journal=Community Mental Health Journal |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=699–704 |pmid=22370894}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The placing of these individuals in homelessness is of major concern to their wellbeing as the added stress of living on the streets is not beneficial for the individual to recover from the particular disorder with which they are afflicted. In fact while some of the homeless who are able to find some temporary relief in the form of shelters, many of the homeless with a mental illness "lack safe and decent shelter".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Billy E.

==Explaining abnormal behaviour==

People have tried to explain and control abnormal behavior for thousands of years. Historically, there have been [[Biopsychiatry controversy|three main approaches]] to abnormal behavior: the [[supernatural]], [[biological]], and [[psychological]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;David H. Barlow and Vincent Mark Durand (2004). ''Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach''. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormal psychology revolves around two major [[paradigm]]s for explaining mental disorders, the ''psychological'' paradigm and the ''biological'' paradigm. The psychological paradigm focuses more on the humanistic, cognitive and behavioral causes and effects of psychopathology. The biological paradigm includes the theories that focus more on physical factors, such as [[genetics]] and [[neurochemistry]].

===Supernatural explanations===
In the  first supernatural tradition, also called the demonological method, abnormal behaviors are attributed to agents outside human bodies. According to this model, abnormal behaviors are caused by [[demons]], [[spirits]], or the influences of [[moon]], [[planets]], and [[stars]]. During the Stone Age, [[trepanning]] was performed on those who had [[mental illness]] to literally cut the evil spirits out of the victim's head. Conversely, [[History of China|Ancient Chinese]], [[Ancient Egyptians]], and [[Hebrews]], believed that these were evil demons or spirits and advocated [[exorcism]]. By the time of the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]], mental illnesses were thought to be caused by an imbalance of the [[four humors]], leading to draining of fluids from the [[brain]]. During the [[Medieval]] period, many Europeans believed that the power of [[witches]], [[demons]], and spirits caused abnormal behaviors. People with psychological disorders were thought to be possessed by evil spirits that had to be exercised through [[religious]] rituals. If exorcism failed, some authorities advocated steps such as confinement, beating, and other types of [[torture]] to make the body uninhabitable by [[witches]], [[demons]], and spirits. The belief that witches, demons, and spirits are responsible for the abnormal behavior continued into the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;David H. Barlow and Vincent Mark Durand (2004). ''Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach''. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss alchemist, astrologer, and [[physician]] [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), on the other hand, rejected the idea that abnormal behaviors were caused by [[witches]], [[demons]], and spirits and suggested that people's mind and behaviors were influenced by the movements of the moon and stars.&lt;ref name="page 11"&gt;David H. Barlow and Vincent Mark Durand (2004). ''Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach''. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition is still alive today. Some people, especially in the developing countries and some followers of religious [[sects]] in the developed countries, continue to believe that [[supernatural]] powers influence human behaviors. In Western [[academia]], the supernatural tradition has been largely replaced by the biological and psychological traditions.&lt;ref name="page 26"&gt;David H. Barlow and Vincent Mark Durand (2004). ''Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach''. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological explanations===
In the biological tradition, psychological disorders are attributed to biological causes and in the psychological tradition, disorders are attributed to faulty [[psychological development]] and to [[social context]].&lt;ref name="page 26"/&gt; The medical or biological perspective holds the belief that most or all abnormal behavior can be attributed to a medical factor; assuming all psychological disorders are diseases.&lt;ref name="Purgatory Perspectives: Medical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives: Medical|url=http://www.purgatory.net/merits/medical.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]], who is considered to be the father of Western medicine, played a major role in the biological tradition. Hippocrates and his associates wrote the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] between 450 and 350 BC, in which they suggested that abnormal behaviors can be treated like any other disease. Hippocrates viewed the brain as the seat of [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], and [[wisdom]] and believed that disorders involving these functions would logically be located in the brain.&lt;ref name="page 11"/&gt;

These ideas of Hippocrates and his associates were later adopted by [[Galen]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician. [[Galen]] extended these ideas and developed a strong and influential school of thought within the biological tradition that extended well into the 18th century.

Medical: Kendra Cherry states: "The medical approach to abnormal psychology focuses on the biological causes on mental illness. This perspective emphasizes understanding the underlying cause of disorders, which might include genetic inheritance, related physical disorders, infections and chemical imbalances. Medical treatments are often pharmacological in nature, although medication is often used in conjunction with some other type of psychotherapy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.verywell.com/what-is-abnormal-psychology-2794775|title=What Is Abnormal Psychology?|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|date=May 9, 2016|work=Verywell|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological explanations===

====Underdeveloped Superego====
According to Sigmund Freud's [[structural model]], the Id, Ego and Superego are three theoretical constructs that define the way an individual interacts with the external world as well as responding to internal forces. The Id represents the instinctual drives of an individual that remain unconscious; the superego represents a person's conscience and their internalization of societal norms and morality; and finally the ego serves to realistically integrate the drives of the id with the prohibitions of the super-ego. Lack of development in the Superego, or an incoherently developed Superego within an individual, will result in thoughts and actions that are irrational and abnormal, contrary to the norms and beliefs of society.

====Irrational beliefs====
Irrational beliefs that are driven by unconscious fears, can result in abnormal behavior. [[Rational emotive therapy]] helps to drive irrational and maladaptive beliefs out of one's mind.

==== Sociocultural influences====
The term sociocultural refers to the various circles of influence on the individual ranging from close friends and family to the institutions and policies of a country or the world as a whole. Discriminations, whether based on social class, income, race, and ethnicity, or gender, can influence the development of abnormal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Halgin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple causality===
The number of different theoretical perspectives in the field of psychological abnormality has made it difficult to properly explain psychopathology. The attempt to explain all mental disorders with the same theory leads to reductionism (explaining a disorder or other complex phenomena using only a single idea or perspective).&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;James Hansell and Lisa Damour. ''Abnormal Psychology''. Ch 3. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Most mental disorders are composed of several factors, which is why one must take into account several theoretical perspectives when attempting to diagnose or explain a particular behavioral abnormality or mental disorder. Explaining mental disorders with a combination of theoretical perspectives is known as multiple causality.

The [[diathesis–stress model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2004.09.001 |title=Diathesis stress model for panic-related distress: A test in a Russian epidemiological sample |year=2005 |last1=Zvolensky |first1=Michael J. |last2=Kotov |first2=Roman |last3=Antipova |first3=Anna V. |last4=Schmidt |first4=Norman B. |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=521–32 |pmid=15701361}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the importance of applying multiple causality to psychopathology by stressing that disorders are caused by both precipitating causes and predisposing causes. A precipitating cause is an immediate trigger that instigates a person's action or behavior. A predisposing cause is an underlying factor that interacts with the immediate factors to result in a disorder. Both causes play a key role in the development of a psychological disorder.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt; For example, high neuroticism antedates most types of psychopathology.&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeronimus B.F.|author2=Kotov, R.|author3=Riese, H.|author4=Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291716001653 | doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506 | volume=46 |issue=14| pages=2883–2906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent concepts of abnormality===
* ''Statistical abnormality''&amp;nbsp;– when a certain behavior/characteristic is relevant to a low percentage of the population. However, this does not necessarily mean that such individuals are suffering from mental illness (for example, statistical abnormalities such as extreme wealth/attractiveness)
* ''Psychometric abnormality''&amp;nbsp;– when a certain behavior/characteristic differs from the population's normal dispersion e.g. having an IQ of 35 could be classified as abnormal, as the population average is 100. However, this does not specify a particular mental illness.
* ''Deviant behavior''&amp;nbsp;– this is not always a sign of mental illness, as mental illness can occur without deviant behavior, and such behavior may occur in the absence of mental illness.
* ''Combinations''&amp;nbsp;– including distress, dysfunction, distorted psychological processes, inappropriate responses in given situations and causing/risking harm to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|2003|pp=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
* ''Somatogenic''&amp;nbsp;– abnormality is seen as a result of biological disorders in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Kraeplin, 1883&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has led to the development of radical biological treatments, e.g. lobotomy.
* ''Psychogenic''&amp;nbsp;– abnormality is caused by psychological problems. [[Psychoanalytic]] ([[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]), [[Cathartic]], [[Hypnotic]] and [[Humanistic Psychology]] ([[Carl Rogers]], [[Abraham Maslow]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|2003|pp=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; treatments were all derived from this paradigm. This approach has, as well, led to some esoteric treatments: [[Franz Mesmer]] used to place his patients in a darkened room with music playing, then enter it wearing a flamboyant outfit and poke the "infected" body areas with a stick.

==Classification==

===DSM-5===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
The standard abnormal psychology and psychiatry reference book in North America is the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. The current version of the book is known as DSM-5. It lists a set of [[mental illness|disorders]] and provides detailed descriptions on what constitutes a disorder such as [[Major Depressive Disorder]] or [[anxiety disorder]]. It also gives general descriptions of how frequently the disorder occurs in the general population, whether it is more common in males or females and other such facts.

The DSM-5 identifies three key elements that must be present to constitute a mental disorder. These elements include:
* Symptoms that involve disturbances in behavior, thoughts, or emotions.
* Symptoms associated with personal distress or impairment.
* Symptoms that stem from internal dysfunctions (i.e. specifically having biological and/or psychological roots).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel T. |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |year=2010 |title=Psychology |edition=2nd |chapter=Identifying Psychological Disorders: What is Abnormal? |pages=550–8 [553] |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=emAyzTNy1cUC&amp;pg=PA550 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The diagnostic process uses five dimensions, each of which is identified as an "axis", to ascertain [[symptom]]s and overall functioning of the individual. It is important to note that the DSM-5 no longer uses this axis system. These axes are as follows:
* '''Axis I'''&amp;nbsp;– ''Clinical disorders'', which would include major mental and learning disorders. These disorders make up what is generally acknowledged as a disorder including major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and substance dependence. To be given a diagnosis for a disorder in this axis the patient must meet the criteria for the particular disorder which is presented in the DSM in that particular disorders section. Disorders in this axis are of particular importance because they are likely to have an effect on the individual in many other axes. In fact the first 3 axes are highly related. This axis is similar to what would be considered an illness or disease in general medicine.
* '''Axis II'''&amp;nbsp;– ''Personality Disorders'' and a decrease of the use of intellect disorder.  This is a very broad axis which contains disorders relating to how the individual functions with the world around him or herself. This axis provides a way of coding for long lasting maladaptive personality characteristics that could have a factor in the expression or development of a disorder on Axis I although this is not always the case.  Disorders in this axis include disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, and paranoid personality disorder.  Mental retardation is also coded in this axis although most other learning disabilities are coded in Axis I. This Axis is an example of how the Axes all interact with one another help to give an overall diagnosis for an individual.
* '''Axis III'''&amp;nbsp;– ''General medical conditions'' and "Physical disorders".  The conditions listed here are the ones that could potentially be relevant to the managing or understanding of the case.  Axis III is often used together with an Axis I diagnosis to give a better rounded explanation of the particular disorder. An example of this can be seen in the relationship between major depressive disorder and unremitting pain caused from a chronic medical problem.  This category could also include use of drugs and alcohols as these are often symptoms of a disorder themselves such as substance dependence or major depressive disorder.  Due to the nature of Axis III it is often recommended that the patient visit a medical doctor when he or she is being assessed in order to determine if the problem could potentially require medical intervention such as surgery. When the first 3 axes are used multiple diagnosis are often found which is actually encouraged by the DSM.
* '''Axis IV'''&amp;nbsp;– ''Psychosocial/environmental problems'', which would contribute to the disorder. Axis IV is used to inspect the broader aspects of a person’s situation.  This axis will examine the social and environmental factors that could affect the person’s diagnosis. Stressors are the main focus of this axis and particular attention is paid to stressors that have been present in the past year; however it is not a requirement that the stressor had to form or continued in the past year.  Due to the large number of potential stressors in an individual’s life, therapists often find such stressors via a checklist approach which is encouraged by the DSM.  An example of the checklist approach would be examine the individual’s family life, economic situation, occupation, potential legal problems and so on.  It is crucial that the patient is honest in this section as environmental factors can have a huge impact on the patient especially in certain schools of therapy such as the cognitive approach.
* '''Axis V'''&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Global Assessment of Functioning|Global assessment of functioning]] (often referred to as GAF)'' or "[[Children's Global Assessment Scale]]" (for children and teenagers under the age of 18).  Axis V is a score given to the patient which is designed to indicate how well the individual is handling their situation at the current time.  The GAF is based on a 100-point scale which the examiner will use to give the patient a score.  Scores can range from 1 to 100 and depending on the score on the GAF the examiner will decide the best course of action for the patient.“According to the manual, scores higher than 70  indicate satisfactory mental health, good overall functioning, and minimal or transient symptoms or impairment, scores between 60 and 70 indicate mild symptoms or impairment, while scores between 50 and 60 indicate moderate symptoms, social or vocational problems, and scores below 50 severe impairment or symptoms”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/pedi.2012.26.2.141 |title=Large Variations of Global Functioning over Five Years in Treated Patients with Personality Traits and Disorders |year=2012 |last1=Kvarstein |first1=Elfrida Hartveit |last2=Karterud |first2=Sigmund |journal=Journal of Personality Disorders |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=141–61 |pmid=22486446}}&lt;/ref&gt; As GAF scores are the final Axis of the DSM the information present in the previous 4 axes are crucial for determining an accurate score.

===ICD-10===
The major international nosologic system for the classification of mental disorders can be found in the most recent version of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). The [[ICD|ICD-10]] has been used by [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Member States since 1994. Chapter five covers some 300 mental and behavioral disorders. The ICD-10's chapter five has been influenced by APA's DSM-IV and there is a great deal of concordance between the two. WHO maintains free access to the [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/ ICD-10 Online]. Below are the main categories of disorders:
* '''F00–F09''' Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders
* '''F10–F19''' Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use
* '''F20–F29''' Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders
* '''F30–F39''' Mood [affective] disorders
* '''F40–F48''' Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders
* '''F50–F59''' Behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors
* '''F60–F69''' Disorders of adult personality and behavior
* '''F70–F79''' Mental retardation
* '''F80–F89''' Disorders of psychological development
* '''F90–F98''' Behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence
* '''F99''' Unspecified mental disorder

==Perspectives of Abnormal psychology==
Psychologists may use different perspectives to try to get better understanding on abnormal psychology. Some of them may just concentrate on a single perspective. But the professionals prefer to combine two or three perspectives together in order to get significant information for better treatments.
*Behavioral- the perspective focus on observable behaviors
*Medical- the perspective focus on biological causes on mental illness
*Cognitive- the perspective focus on how internal thoughts, perceptions and reasoning contribute to psychological disorders

==Cause==

===Genetics===
* Investigated through family studies, mainly of monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins, often in the context of [[adoption]]. Monozygotic twins should be more likely than dizygotic twins to have the same disorder because they share 100% of their genetic material, whereas dizygotic twins share only 50%. For many disorders, this is exactly what research shows. But given that monozygotic twins share 100% of their genetic material, it may be expected of them to have the same disorders 100% of the time, but in fact they have the same disorders only about 50% of the time&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/intropsych/pdf/chapter15.pdf{{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* These studies allow calculation of a ''heritability coefficient''.

===Biological causal factors===
* Neurotransmitter [imbalances of neurotransmitters like [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]] and [[GABA]] (Gamma aminobutryic acid)] and hormonal imbalances in the brain{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* Genetic vulnerabilities
* Constitutional liabilities [physical handicaps and temperament]
* Brain dysfunction and neural plasticity
* Physical deprivation or disruption [deprivation of basic physiological needs]

===Socio-cultural factors===
* Effects of urban/rural dwelling, gender and minority status on state of mind
* Generalizations about cultural practices and beliefs may fail to capture the diversity that exists within and across cultural groups, so we must be extremely careful not to stereotype individuals of any cultural group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Child Psychology|last=Mash and Wolfe|first=Eric J. and David A.|publisher=Jon-David Hague|year=2013|isbn=978-1-111-83449-4|location=Belmont, CA|pages=110|quote=Generalizations about cultural practices and beliefs may fail to capture the diversity that exists within and across cultural groups, so we must be extremely careful not to stereotype individuals of any cultural group|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic factors===
* Family systems
* Negatively Expressed Emotion playing a part in schizophrenic relapse and [[anorexia nervosa]].

===Biopsychosocial factors===
* Illness dependent on stress "triggers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|2003|pp=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapies==
;Psychoanalysis (Freud)
[[Psychoanalytic theory]] is heavily based on the theory of the neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]]. These ideas often represented repressed emotions and memories from a patient's childhood. According to psychoanalytic theory, these repressions cause the disturbances that people experience in their daily lives and by finding the source of these disturbances, one should be able to eliminate the disturbance itself.  This is accomplished by a variety of methods, with some popular ones being free association, hypnosis, and insight.  The goal of these methods is to induce a catharsis or emotional release in the patient which should indicate that the source of the problem has been tapped and it can then be helped.  Freud's psychosexual stages also played a key role in this form of therapy; as he would often believe that problems the patient was experiencing were due to them becoming stuck or "fixated" in a particular stage.  Dreams also played a major role in this form of therapy as Freud viewed dreams as a way to gain insight into the unconscious mind. Patients were often asked to keep dream journals and to record their dreams to bring in for discussion during the next therapy session.  There are many potential problems associated with this style of therapy, including resistance to the repressed memory or feeling, and [[negative transference]] onto the therapist. Psychoanalysis was carried on by many after Freud including his daughter Ana Freud and Jacques Lacan.  These and many others have gone on to elaborate on Freud's original theory and to add their own take on defense mechanisms or dream analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kovacevic |first1= Filip|last2= |first2= |year= 2013|title=A Lacanian approach to dream interpretation |journal=[[Dreaming (journal)|Dreaming]] |volume=23  |issue=1 |pages=78–89 |doi=10.1037/a0032206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While psychoanalysis has fallen out of favor to more modern forms of therapy it is still used by some clinical psychologists to varying degrees.

;Behavioral therapy (Wolpe) 
[[Behavior therapy]] relies on the principles of [[behaviorism]], such as involving [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]].  Behaviorism arose in the early 20th century due to the work of psychologists such as James Watson and B. F. Skinner.  Behaviorism states that all behaviors humans do is because of a stimulus and reinforcement.  While this reinforcement is normally for good behavior, it can also occur for maladaptive behavior.  In this therapeutic view, the patients maladaptive behavior has been reinforced which will cause the maladaptive behavior to be repeated.  The goal of the therapy is to reinforce less maladaptive behaviors so that with time these adaptive behaviors will become the primary ones in the patient.

;Humanistic therapy (Rogers)
Humanistic therapy aims to achieve [[self-actualization]] ([[Carl Rogers]], 1961).  In this style of therapy, the therapist will focus on the patient themselves as opposed to the problem which the patient is afflicted with.  The overall goal of this therapy is that by treating the patient as "human" instead of client will help get to the source of the problem and hopefully resolve the problem in an effective manner. Humanistic therapy has been on the rise in recent years and has been associated with numerous positive benefits. It is considered to be one of the core elements needed therapeutic effectiveness and a significant contributor to not only the well being of the patient but society as a whole. Some say that all of the therapeutic approaches today draw from the humanistic approach in some regard and that humanistic therapy is the best way for treat a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=K. J. |last2=Längle |first2=A. |year=2012 |title=The renewal of humanism in psychotherapy: Summary and conclusion |journal=[[Psychotherapy (journal)|Psychotherapy]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=480–1 |doi=10.1037/a0028026 |pmid=23205836}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humanistic therapy can be used on people of all ages; however, it is very popular among children in its variant known as "play therapy".  Children are often sent to therapy due to outburst that they have in a school or home setting, the theory is that by treating the child in a setting that is similar to the area that they are having their disruptive behavior, the child will be more likely to learn from the therapy and have an effective outcome. In play therapy, the clinicians will "play" with their client usually with toys, or a tea party.  Playing is the typical behavior of a child and therefore playing with the therapist will come as a natural response to the child.  In playing together the clinician will ask the patient questions but due to the setting; the questions no longer seem intrusive and therapeutic more like a normal conversation.  This should help the patient realizes issues they have and confess them to the therapist with less difficulty than they may experience in a traditional counselling setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0030318 |title=Head start early mental health intervention: Effects of child-centered play therapy on disruptive behaviors |year=2013 |last1=Bratton |first1=Sue C. |last2=Ceballos |first2=Peggy L. |last3=Sheely-Moore |first3=Angela I. |last4=Meany-Walen |first4=Kristin |last5=Pronchenko |first5=Yulia |last6=Jones |first6=Leslie D. |journal=International Journal of Play Therapy |volume=22 |pages=28–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cognitive behavioural therapy (Ellis and Beck)
Cognitive behavioural therapy aims to influence thought and cognition (Beck, 1977). This form of therapy relies on not only the components of behavioral therapy as mentioned before, but also the elements of cognitive psychology.  This relies on not only the clients behavioral problems that could have arisen from conditioning; but also there negative schemas, and distorted perceptions of the world around them.  These negative schemas may be causing distress in the life of the patient; for example the schemas may be giving them unrealistic expectations for how well they should perform at their job, or how they should look physically.  When these expectations are not met it will often result in maladaptive behaviors such as depression, obsessive compulsions, and anxiety.  With cognitive behavior therapy; the goal is to change the schemas that are causing the stress in a persons life and hopefully replace them with more realistic ones.  Once the negative schemas have been replaced, it will hopefully cause a remission of the patients symptoms.  CBT is considered particularly effective in the treatment of depression and has even been used lately in group settings.  It is felt that using CBT in a group setting aids in giving its members a sense of support and decreasing the likelihood of them dropping out of therapy before the treatment has had time to work properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0031080 |title=Effectiveness of and dropout from outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for adult unipolar depression: A meta-analysis of nonrandomized effectiveness studies |year=2013 |last1=Hans |first1=Eva |last2=Hiller |first2=Wolfgang |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=81 |pages=75–88 |pmid=23379264 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBT has been found to be an effective treatments for many patients even those who do not have diseases and disorders typically thought of as psychiatric ones. For example, patients with the disease multiple sclerosis have found a lot of help using CBT.  The treatment often helps the patients cope with the disorder they have and how they can adapt to their new lives without developing new problems such as depression or negative schemas about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0029132 |title=A randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adjusting to multiple sclerosis (the saMS trial): Does CBT work and for whom does it work? |year=2013 |last1=Moss-Morris |first1=Rona |authorlink1=Rona Moss-Morris |last2=Dennison |first2=Laura |last3=Landau |first3=Sabine |last4=Yardley |first4=Lucy |last5=Silber |first5=Eli |last6=Chalder |first6=Trudie |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=251–62 |pmid=22730954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[RAND]], therapies are difficult to provide to all patients in need. A lack of funding and understanding of symptoms provides a major roadblock that is not easily avoided. Individual symptoms and responses to treatments vary, creating a disconnect between patient, society and care givers/professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB4533/index1.html|title= Are People With Mental Illness Getting the Help They Need? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">Dr '''Archibald Inglis''' [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|PRCSE]] (1801&amp;ndash;1889) was a 19th-century Scottish surgeon who served as President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] for the period 1853 to 1855. He was a keen amateur botanist and chaired the Edinburgh Botanical Society.

==Life==
[[File:33 Albany Street, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|33 Albany Street, Edinburgh]]
He was born on 1 December 1801&lt;ref&gt;Grave of Archibald Inglis, Dean Cemetery&lt;/ref&gt; at Post House Stair on Parliament Close off the [[Royal Mile]] in [[Edinburgh]] the son of Dr Andrew Inglis (d.1834) and grandson of [[William Inglis (surgeon)|Dr William Inglis]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office directory 1801&lt;/ref&gt; His house was remodelled and readdressed as 16 Parliament Square following the rebuilding of the law courts in Edinburgh.

His father served as President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] from 1808 to 1810. His grandfather had served twice in this same role: 1782-1784 and 1790-1792.

Archibald studied Medicine at [[Edinburgh University]] from around 1817 to 1821, gaining his doctorate (MD) in 1824.

His family home was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Edinburgh]] in 1824. His family then relocated to a then-new townhouse at 11 Albany Street in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1825&lt;/ref&gt; Archibald inherited the house on his father's death in 1834 and lived there for most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office directories 1835 to 1855&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh from 1827&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5499423/pdf/transmedchirsocedinb81205-0002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 he succeeded [[James Scarth Combe]] as President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]. He was succeeded in turn in 1855 by [[Andrew Wood (surgeon)|Dr Andrew Wood]].

He lived his later years at 33 Albany Street and died there in 1889. He is buried in [[Dean Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/71883488/archibald-inglis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He married Isabella Weir (1813-1877), daughter of Major James Weir and brother of Dr Thomas Graham Weir.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/71884219/isabella-weir-inglis&lt;/ref&gt; They had at least eight children. Their son James Weir Inglis (1839-1901) died in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/10128531/james-weir-inglis&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest son, Archibald, emigrated to [[Canada]] and lived until 1937.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58435778/archibald-inglis

'''Biostatistics''' are the application of [[statistics]] to a wide range of topics in [[biology]]. It encompasses the design of biological [[experiment]]s, especially in [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[agriculture]] and [[fisheries|fishery]]; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. A major branch is medical biostatistics, which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Biostatistics|author=[[Abhaya Indrayan]]|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn= 978-1-4398-8414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

=== Biostatistics and Genetics ===

Biostatistical modeling forms an important part of numerous modern biological theories. [[Genetics]] studies, since its beginning, used statistical concepts to understand observed experimental results. Some genetics scientists even contributed with statistical advances with the development of methods and tools. [[Gregor Mendel]] started the genetics studies investigating genetics segregation patterns in families of peas and used statistics to explain the collected data. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of Mendel's Mendelian inheritance work, there were gaps in understanding between genetics and evolutionary Darwinism. [[Francis Galton]] tried to expand Mendel’s discoveries with human data and proposed a different model with fractions of the heredity coming from each ancestral composing a infinite series. He called this the theory of "[[Francis Galton|Law of Ancestral Heredity]]". His ideas were strong disagreed by [[William Bateson]], who followed Mendel's conclusions, that genetic inheritance were exclusively from the parents, half from each of them. This led to a vigorous debate between the biometricians, who supported Galton's ideas, as [[Walter Weldon]], [[Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire]] and [[Karl Pearson]], and Mendelians, who supported Bateson's (and Mendel's) ideas, such as [[Charles Davenport]] and [[Wilhelm Johannsen]]. Later, biometricians could not reproduce Galton conclusions in different experiments, and Mendel’s ideas prevailed. By the 1930s, models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis.

Solving these differences also allowed to define the concept of population genetics and brought together genetics and evolution. The three leading figures in the establishment of [[population genetics]] and this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology.

* [[Ronald Fisher]] developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work studying the crop experiments at [[Rothamsted Research]], including in his books [[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]] (1925) end [[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]] (1930). He gave many contributions to genetics and statistics. Some of them include the [[ANOVA]], [[p-value]] concepts, [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher’s exact test]] and [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher’s equation]] for [[population dynamics]]. He is credited for the sentence “Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunter|first1=Chris |title=Quantitative Genetics|journal=Nature|date=10 December 2008|volume=456|issue=7223 |pages=719|doi=10.1038/456719a|pmid=19079046 |bibcode=2008Natur.456..719G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sewall G. Wright]] developed [[F-statistics]] and methods of computing them and defined [[inbreeding coefficient]].
* [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s book, ''The Causes of Evolution'', reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics. Also developed the theory of [[primordial soup]].

These and other biostatisticians, [[mathematical biology|mathematical biologists]], and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together [[evolutionary biology]] and [[genetics]] into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be [[Statistics|quantitative]]ly modeled.

In parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in ''On Growth and Form'' also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.

Despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not [[qualitative data|qualitatively]] apparent. One anecdote describes [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] banning the [[Friden, Inc.|Friden calculator]] from his department at [[Caltech]], saying "Well, I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, I'm not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in [[placer mining]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf|title=Academic Economics: Strengths and Faults After Considering Interdisciplinary Needs|author=Charles T. Munger|date=2003-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biostatistics and Medicine ===

Statistical concepts also are present in [[clinical trials]] and [[epidemiological studies]]. These fields have their own history of biostatistics developments. In the 18th century, statistical methods were used to decide whether the application of certain treatments were effective, such as the insertion of [[smallpox]] pustules under an individual’s skin in the hope of creating a mild case of the disease that would induce later immunity. Since this actually put patients at risk of contracting a potentially fatal form of the disease, this treatment became the subject of much controversy. [[John Arbuthnot]] in 1722 studied the chances of people dying by naturally-occurring smallpox as compared to inoculation-induced smallpox. On the basis of the statistical studies, it was concluded that inoculation was preferred. Later, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and [[Jean d’Alembert]] developed more robust statistical methods for the same problem, both based on the proportion of people who died.&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1= J.Rosser |title=History of Biostatistics|journal=Encyclopedia of Biostatistics|date=5 July 2005|doi=10.1002/0470011815.b2a17065|isbn= 978-0470849071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[James Lind]] were the first to propose groups of test of hypotheses. He applied this method to solve an outbreak of scurvy. For this, he is considered the “father” of clinical trial. In 1835, [[Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis]] proposed the “numerical method” to argue
that the practice of bloodletting was actually doing more harm than good for the patients.  In 1840, [[Louis Denis Jules Gavarret]] publish the [[Louis Denis Jules Gavarret|Principes Généraux de Statistique Médicale]] in which he pointed out that Louis’s averages could vary between what he called “limits of oscillation” (or [[confidence interval]]) if multiple samples were taken from the same population. Karl Pearson also expanded his methods to medicine, despite his main goal was to explicit the statistical implications of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name="Matthews" /&gt;

== Research planning ==

Any research in [[life sciences]] is proposed to answer a [[scientific question]] we might have. To answer this question with a high certainty, we need [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] results. The correct definition of the main [[hypothesis]] and the research plan will reduce errors while taking a decision in understanding a phenomenon. The research plan might include the research question, the hypothesis to be tested, the [[experimental design]], [[data collection]] methods, [[data analysis]] perspectives and costs evolved. It is essential to carry the study based on the three basic principles of experimental statistics: [[randomization]], [[Replication (statistics)|replication]], and local control.

=== Research question ===

The research question will define the objective of a study. The research will be headed by the question, so it needs to be concise, at the same time it is focused on interesting and novel topics that may improve science and knowledge and that field. To define the way to ask the [[scientific question]], an exhaustive [[literature review]] might be necessary. So, the research can be useful to add value to the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nizamuddin|first1=Sarah L.|last2=Nizamuddin|first2=Junaid|last3=Mueller|first3=Ariel|last4=Ramakrishna|first4=Harish|last5=Shahul|first5=Sajid S.|title=Developing a Hypothesis and Statistical Planning|journal=Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia|date=October 2017|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1878–1882|doi=10.1053/j.jvca.2017.04.020|pmid=28778775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypothesis definition ===

Once the aim of the study is defined, the possible answers to the research question can be proposed, transforming this question into a [[hypothesis]]. The main propose is called [[null hypothesis]] (H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and is usually based on a permanent knowledge about the topic or an obvious occurrence of the phenomena, sustained by a deep literature review. We can say it is the standard expected answer for the data under the situation in [[Experiment|test]]. In general, H&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; assumes no association between &lt;sub&gt;treatments&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, the [[alternative hypothesis]] is the denial of H&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;. It assumes some degree of association between the treatment and the outcome. Although, the hypothesis is sustained by question research and its expected and unexpected answers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As an example, consider groups of similar animals (mice, for example) under two different diet systems. The research question would be: what is the best diet? In this case, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; would be that there is no difference between the two diets in mice [[metabolism]] (H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: μ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the [[alternative hypothesis]] would be that the diets have different effects over animals metabolism (H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: μ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

The [[hypothesis]] is defined by the researcher, according to his/her interests in answering the main question. Besides that, the [[alternative hypothesis]] can be more than one hypothesis. It can assume not only differences across observed parameters, but their degree of differences (''i.e.'' higher or shorter).

=== Sampling ===

Usually, a study aims to understand an effect of a phenomenon over a [[population]]. In [[biology]], a [[population]] is defined as all the [[individuals]] of a given [[species]], in a specific area at a given time. In biostatistics, this concept is extended to a variety of collections possible of study. Although, in biostatistics, a [[population]] is not only the [[individuals]], but the total of one specific component of their [[organisms]], as the whole [[genome]], or all the sperm [[cells]], for animals, or the total leaf area, for a plant, for example.

It is not possible to take the [[Measurement|measures]] from all the elements of a [[population]]. Because of that, the [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] process is very important for [[statistical inference]]. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is defined as to randomly get a representative part of the entire population, to make posterior inferences about the population. So, the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] might catch the most [[Statistical variability|variability]] across a population.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal| doi= 10.1177/0115426507022006629| pmid= 18042950| title= Biostatistics Primer: Part I| journal= Nutrition in Clinical Practice| volume= 22| issue= 6| pages= 629–35| year= 2017| last1= Overholser| first1= Brian R| last2= Sowinski| first2= Kevin M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sample size]] is determined by several things, since the scope of the research to the resources available. In [[clinical research]], the trial type, as [[inferiority]], [[Equivalence (measure theory)|equivalence]], and [[superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity is a key in determining sample [[size]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Experimental design ===
[[Experimental designs]] sustain those basic principles of [[design of experiments|experimental statistics]]. There are three basic experimental designs to randomly allocate [[treatment group|treatments]] in all [[Quadrat|plots]] of the [[experiment]]. They are [[completely randomized design]], [[randomized block design]], and [[factorial designs]]. Treatments can be arranged in many ways inside the experiment. In [[agriculture]], the correct [[experimental design]] is the root of a good study and the arrangement of [[treatment group|treatments]] within the study is essential because [[environment (systems)|environment]] largely affects the [[Quadrat|plots]] ([[plants]], [[livestock]], [[microorganisms]]). These main arrangements can be found in the literature under the names of “[[lattice model (physics)|lattices]]”, “incomplete blocks”, “[[split plot]]”, “augmented blocks”, and many others. All of the designs might include [[Scientific control|control plots]], determined by the researcher, to provide an [[Estimation theory|error estimation]] during [[inference]].

In [[clinical studies]], the [[sample (statistics)|sample]]s are usually smaller than in other biological studies, and in most cases, the [[environment (systems)|environment]] effect can be controlled or measured. It is common to use [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled clinical trials]], where results are usually compared with [[observational study]] designs such as [[case–control]] or [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szczech|first1=Lynda Anne|last2=Coladonato|first2=Joseph A.|last3=Owen|first3=William F.|title=Key Concepts in Biostatistics: Using Statistics to Answer the Question "Is There a Difference?"|journal=Seminars in Dialysis|date=4 October 2002|volume=15|issue=5|pages=347–351|doi=10.1046/j.1525-139X.2002.00085.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data collection ===

Data collection methods must be considered in research planning, because it highly influences the sample size and experimental design.

Data collection varies according to type of data. For [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] data, collection can be done with structured questionnaires or by observation, considering presence or intensity of disease, using score criterion to categorize levels of occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandelowski|first1=Margarete|title=Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Sampling, Data Collection,  and Analysis Techniques in Mixed-Method Studies|journal=Research in Nursing &amp; Health|date=2000|volume=23|issue=3|pages=246–255|doi=10.1002/1098-240X(200006)23:3&lt;246::AID-NUR9&gt;3.0.CO;2-H|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7825}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[quantitative data]], collection is done by measuring numerical information using instruments.

In agriculture and biology studies, yield data and its components can be obtained by [[metric measure]]s. However, pest and disease injuries in plats are obtained by observation, considering score scales for levels of damage. Especially, in genetic studies, modern methods for data collection in field and laboratory should be considered, as high-throughput platforms for phenotyping and genotyping. These tools allow bigger experiments, while turn possible evaluate many plots in lower time than a human-based only method for data collection.
Finally, all data collected of interest must be stored in an organized data frame for further analysis.

== Analysis and data interpretation ==

=== Descriptive Tools ===
{{Main| Descriptive Statistics}}

Data can be represented through [[Table (information)|tables]] or [[chart|graphical]] representation, such as line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plot. Also, [[Central tendency|measures of central]] tendency and [[Statistical dispersion|variability]] can be very useful to describe an overview of the data. Follow some examples:

* '''Frequency tables'''

One type of tables are the [[frequency]] table, which consists of data arranged in rows and columns, where the frequency is the number of occurrences or repetitions of data. Frequency can be:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sangakoo.com/en/unit/absolute-relative-cumulative-frequency-and-statistical-tables|title=Absolute, relative, cumulative frequency and statistical tables – Probability and Statistics|last=Maths|first=Sangaku|website=www.sangakoo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Absolute''': represents the number of times that a determined value appear;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;N = f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + ... + f_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Relative''': obtained by the division of the absolute frequency by the total number;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;n_i = \frac{f_i}{N}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the next example, we have the number of genes in ten [[operon]]s of the same organism.

&lt;math&gt;Genes = 2,3,3,4,5,3,3,3,3,4&lt;/math&gt;

[[Line graph]]s represent the variation of a value over another metric, such as time. In general, values are represented in the vertical axis, while the time variation is represented in the horizontal axis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Biostatistics.

* '''Bar chart'''

A [[bar chart]] is a graph that shows categorical data as bars presenting heights (vertical bar) or widths (horizontal bar) proportional to represent values. Bar charts provide an image that could also be represented in a tabular format.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the bar chart example, we have the birth rate in [[Brazil]] for the December months from 2010 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The sharp fall in December 2016 reflects the outbreak of [[Zika virus]] in the birth rate in [[Brazil]].

* '''Histograms'''

[[File:Example_histogram.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Example_histogram.png|thumb|'''Example of a histogram.'''|350x350px]]The [[histogram]] (or frequency distribution) is a graphical representation of a dataset tabulated and divided into uniform or non-uniform classes. It was first introduced by [[Karl Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Karl|date=1895-01-01|title=X. Contributions to the mathematical theory of evolution.—II.

* '''Scatter Plot'''

A [[scatter plot]] is a mathematical diagram that uses Cartesian coordinates to display values of a dataset. A scatter plot shows the data as a set of points, each one presenting the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and another variable on the vertical axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing through statistics|last=Utts|first=Jessica M.|date=2005|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|isbn=978-0534394028|edition= 3rd|location=Belmont, CA|oclc=56568530}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also called also called '''scatter graph''', '''scatter chart''', '''scattergram''', or '''scatter diagram'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basic statistics|last=B.|first=Jarrell, Stephen|date=1994|publisher=Wm.

* '''Mean'''
{{Main| Mean}}

The [[arithmetic mean]] is the sum of a collection of values (&lt;math&gt;{x_1+x_2+x_3+\cdots +x_n}&lt;/math&gt;) divided by the number of items of this collection (&lt;math&gt;{n}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\right ) = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Median'''
{{Main| Median}}

The [[median]] is the value in the middle of a dataset.

* '''Mode'''
{{Main| Mode (statistics)}}

The [[mode (statistics)|mode]] is the value of a set of data that appears most often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Econometrics|last=Gujarati|first=Damodar N.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Box Plot'''
 
[[Box plot]] is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data. The maximum and minimum values are represented by the lines, and the interquartile range (IQR) represent 25–75% of the data. [[Outlier]]s may be plotted as circles.

* '''Correlation Coefficients'''

Although correlations between two different kinds of data could be inferred by graphs, such as scatter plot, is necessary validate this though numerical information. For this reason, correlation coefficients are required. They provide a numerical value that reflects the strength of an association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Pearson Correlation Coefficient'''

[[File:Correlation_coefficient.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Correlation_coefficient.png|right|thumb|400x400px|Scatter diagram that demonstrates the Pearson correlation for different values of ''ρ.'']][[Pearson correlation coefficient]] is a measure of association between two variables, X and Y. This coefficient, usually represented by ''ρ'' (rho) for the population and ''r'' for the sample, assumes values between −1 and 1, where ''ρ''  = 1 represents a perfect positive correlation, ''ρ'' = -1 represents a perfect negative correlation, and ''ρ'' = 0 is no linear correlation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Inferential Statistics ===
{{Main| Statistical inference}}

It is used to make [[inference]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|title=Essentials of Biostatistics in Public Health &amp; Essentials of Biostatistics Workbook: Statistical Computing Using Excel|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume=33|issue=2|pages=196–197|doi=10.1111/j.1753-6405.2009.00372.x|issn=1326-0200|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Bio-statistics: An Overview With the Help of Software|last=IJSMI|first=Editor|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=978-1725921221|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; about an unknown population, by estimation and/or hypothesis testing. In other words, it is desirable to obtain parameters to describe the population of interest, but since the data is limited, it is necessary to make use of a representative sample in order to estimate them. With that, it is possible to test previously defined hypotheses and apply the conclusions to the entire population. The [[Standard error| standard error of the mean]] is a measure of variability that is crucial to do inferences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* [[Statistical hypothesis testing|Hypothesis testing]]

Hypothesis testing is essential to make inferences about populations aiming to answer research questions, as settled in "Research planning" section. Authors defined four steps to be set:&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

# ''The hypothesis to be tested'': as stated earlier, we have to work with the definition of a [[null hypothesis]] (H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), that is going to be tested, and an [[alternative hypothesis]]. But they must be defined before the experiment implementation. 
# ''Significance level and decision rule'': A decision rule depends on the [[significance level|level of significance]], or in other words, the acceptable error rate (α). It is easier to think that we define a ''critical value'' that determines the statistical significance when a [[test statistic]] is compared with it. So, α also has to be predefined before the experiment.
# ''Experiment and statistical analysis'': This is when the experiment is really implemented following the appropriate [[Design of experiments|experimental design]], data is collected and the more suitable statistical tests are evaluated.
# ''Inference'': Is made when the [[null hypothesis]] is rejected or not rejected, based on the evidence that the comparison of [[p-value]]s and α brings. It is pointed that the failure to reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; just means that there is not enough evidence to support its rejection, but not that this hypothesis is true.

* [[Confidence intervals]]

A confidence interval is a range of values that can contain the true real parameter value in given a certain level of confidence. The first step is to estimate the best-unbiased estimate of the population parameter. The upper value of the interval is obtained by the sum of this estimate with the multiplication between the standard error of the mean and the confidence level. The calculation of lower value is similar, but instead of a sum, a subtraction must be applied.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Statistical considerations ==

=== Power and statistical error ===

When testing a hypothesis, there are two types of statistic errors possible: [[Type I error]] and [[Type II error]]. The type I error or [[False positives and false negatives|false positive]] is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis and the type II error or [[False positives and false negatives|false negative]] is the failure to reject a false [[null hypothesis]]. The [[significance level]] denoted by α is the type I error rate and should be chosen before performing the test. The type II error rate is denoted by β and [[Statistical power|statistical power of the test]] is 1 − β.

=== p-value ===

The [[p-value]] is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as or more extreme than those observed, assuming the [[null hypothesis]] (H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is true. It is also called the calculated probability. It is common to confuse the p-value with the [[Statistical significance|significance level (α)]], but, the α is a predefined threshold for calling significant results. If p is less than α, the null hypothesis (H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19503|pmid=26961635|title=Statisticians issue warning over misuse of P values|journal=Nature|volume=531|issue=7593|pages=151|year=2016|last1=Baker|first1=Monya|bibcode=2016Natur.531..151B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple testing ===

In multiple tests of the same hypothesis, the probability of the occurrence of [[False positives and false negatives|falses positives]] [[Family-wise error rate|(familywise error rate)]] increase and some strategy are used to control this occurrence. This is commonly achieved by using a more stringent threshold to reject null hypotheses. The [[Bonferroni correction]] defines an acceptable global significance level, denoted by  α* and each test is individually compared with a value of  α =  α*/m. This ensures that the familywise error rate in all m tests, is less than or equal to  α*. When m is large, the Bonferroni correction may be overly conservative. An alternative to the Bonferroni correction is to control the [[False discovery rate|false discovery rate (FDR)]]. The FDR controls the expected proportion of the rejected [[Null hypothesis|null hypotheses]] (the so-called discoveries) that are false (incorrect rejections). This procedure ensures that, for independent tests, the false discovery rate is at most q*. Thus, the FDR is less conservative than the Bonferroni correction and have more power, at the cost of more false positives.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamini, Y. &amp; Hochberg, Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological) 57, 289–300 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mis-specification and robustness checks ===

The main hypothesis being tested (e.g., no association between treatments and outcomes) is often accompanied by other technical assumptions (e.g., about the form of the probability distribution of the outcomes) that are also part of the null hypothesis. When the technical assumptions are violated in practice, then the null may be frequently rejected even if the main hypothesis is true. Such rejections are said to be due to model mis-specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statlect.com/glossary/null-hypothesis|title=Null hypothesis|website=www.statlect.com|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verifying whether the outcome of a statistical test does not change when the technical assumptions are slightly altered (so-called robustness checks) is the main way of combating mis-specification.

=== Model selection criteria ===

[[Model selection|Model criteria selection]] will select or model that more approximate true model. The [[Model selection|Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)]] and The [[Model selection|Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)]] are examples of asymptotically efficient criteria.

== Developments and Big Data ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}

Recent developments have made a large impact on biostatistics. Two important changes have been the ability to collect data on a high-throughput scale, and the ability to perform much more complex analysis using computational techniques. This comes from the development in areas as [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies, [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Machine learning]] ([[Machine learning in bioinformatics]]).

=== Use in high-throughput data ===

New biomedical technologies like [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[DNA sequencing|next-generation sequencers]] (for genomics) and [[mass spectrometers|mass spectrometry]] (for proteomics) generate enormous amounts of data, allowing many tests to be performed simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayden|first1=Erika Check|title=Biostatistics: Revealing analysis|journal=Nature|date=8 February 2012|volume=482|issue=7384|pages=263–265|doi=10.1038/nj7384-263a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Careful analysis with biostatistical methods is required to separate the signal from the noise. For example, a microarray could be used to measure many thousands of genes simultaneously, determining which of them have different expression in diseased cells compared to normal cells. However, only a fraction of genes will be differentially expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Efron|first1=Bradley|title=Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model|journal=Statistical Science|date=February 2008|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1214/07-STS236|arxiv=0808.0572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multicollinearity]] often occurs in high-throughput biostatistical settings. Due to high intercorrelation between the predictors (such as [[gene expression]] levels), the information of one predictor might be contained in another one. It could be that only 5% of the predictors are responsible for 90% of the variability of the response. In such a case, one could apply the biostatistical technique of dimension reduction (for example via principal component analysis). Classical statistical techniques like linear or logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis do not work well for high dimensional data (i.e. when the number of observations n is smaller than the number of features or predictors p: n &lt; p). As a matter of fact, one can get quite high R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-values despite very low predictive power of the statistical model. These classical statistical techniques (esp. least squares linear regression) were developed for low dimensional data (i.e. where the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p: n &gt;&gt; p). In cases of high dimensionality, one should always consider an independent validation test set and the corresponding residual sum of squares (RSS) and R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the validation test set, not those of the training set.

Often, it is useful to pool information from multiple predictors together. For example, [[Gene Set Enrichment Analysis]] (GSEA) considers the perturbation of whole (functionally related) gene sets rather than of single genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramanian|first1=A.|last2=Tamayo|first2=P.|last3=Mootha|first3=V. K.|last4=Mukherjee|first4=S.|last5=Ebert|first5=B. L.|last6=Gillette|first6=M. A.|last7=Paulovich|first7=A.|last8=Pomeroy|first8=S. L.|last9=Golub|first9=T. R.|last10=Lander|first10=E. S.|last11=Mesirov|first11=J. P.|title=Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 2005|volume=102|issue=43|pages=15545–15550|doi=10.1073/pnas.0506580102|pmid=16199517|pmc=1239896|bibcode=2005PNAS..10215545S}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gene sets might be known biochemical pathways or otherwise functionally related genes. The advantage of this approach is that it is more robust: It is more likely that a single gene is found to be falsely perturbed than it is that a whole pathway is falsely perturbed. Furthermore, one can integrate the accumulated knowledge about biochemical pathways (like the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]]) using this approach.

=== Bioinformatics advances in databases, data mining, and biological interpretation ===

The development of [[biological database]]s enables storage and management of biological data with the possibility of ensuring access for users around the world. They are useful for researchers depositing data, retrieve information and files (raw or processed) originated from other experiments or indexing scientific articles, as [[PubMed]]. Another possibility is search for the desired term (a gene, a protein, a disease, an organism, and so on) and check all results related to this search. There are databases dedicated to [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] ([[dbSNP]]), the knowledge on genes characterization and their pathways ([[KEGG]]) and the description of gene function classifying it by cellular component, molecular function and biological process ([[Gene ontology|Gene Ontology]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jcp.21218|pmid=17654500|title=Bioinformatics|journal=Journal of Cellular Physiology|volume=213|issue=2|pages=365–9|year=2007|last1=Moore|first1=Jason H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to databases that contain specific molecular information, there are others that are ample in the sense that they store information about an organism or group of organisms. As an example of a database directed towards just one organism, but that contains lots of data about it, is the ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' genetic and molecular database – [https://www.arabidopsis.org/ TAIR]. [http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/ Phytozome], in turn, stores the assemblies and annotation files of dozen of plant genomes, also containing visualization and analysis tools. Moreover, there is an interconnection between some databases in the information exchange/sharing and a major initiative was the [[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration]] ([http://insdc.org INSDC]) which relates data from [https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html DDBJ], [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ EMBL-EBI], and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ NCBI].

Nowadays, increase in size and complexity of molecular datasets leads to use of powerful statistical methods provided by computer science algorithms which are developed by [[machine learning]] area. Therefore, data mining and machine learning allow detection of patterns in data with a complex structure, as biological ones, by using methods of [[Supervised learning|supervised]] and [[unsupervised learning]], regression, detection of [[Cluster analysis|clusters]] and [[Association rule learning|association rule mining]], among others.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; To indicate some of them, [[self-organizing map]]s and [[k-means clustering|''k''-means]] are examples of cluster algorithms; [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] implementation and [[support vector machine]]s models are examples of common machine learning algorithms.

Collaborative work among molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, statisticians and computer scientist is important to perform an experiment correctly, going from planning, passing through data generation and analysis, and ending with biological interpretation of the results.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

=== Use of computationally intensive methods ===

On the other hand, the advent of modern computer technology and relatively cheap computing resources have enabled computer-intensive biostatistical methods like [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]] and [[Re-sampling (statistics)|re-sampling]] methods.

In recent times, [[random forests]] have gained popularity as a method for performing [[statistical classification]]. Random forest techniques generate a panel of decision trees. Decision trees have the advantage that you can draw them and interpret them (even with a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics). Random Forests have thus been used for clinical decision support systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In these [[medicine]] contents, it's important to consider the design and analysis of the [[clinical trial]]s. As one example, there is the assessment of severity state of a patient with a prognosis of an outcome of a disease.

With new technologies and genetics knowledge, biostatistics are now also used for [[Systems medicine]], which consists in a more personalized medicine. For this, is made a integration of data from different sources, including conventional patient data, clinico-pathological parameters, molecular and genetic data as well as data generated by additional new-omics technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/emm.2017.290|pmid=29497170|pmc=5898894|title=Whither systems medicine?|journal=Molecular Medicine|volume=50|issue=3|pages=e453|year=2018|last1=Apweiler|first1=Rolf|last2=et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[Population genetics]] and [[Statistical genetics]] in order to link variation in [[genotype]] with a variation in [[phenotype]]. In other words, it is desirable to discover the genetic basis of a measurable trait, a quantitative trait, that is under polygenic control. A genome region that is responsible for a continuous trait is called [[Quantitative trait locus]] (QTL). The study of QTLs become feasible by using [[molecular marker]]s and measuring traits in populations, but their mapping needs the obtaining of a population from an experimental crossing, like an F2 or [[Recombinant inbred strain]]s/lines (RILs). To scan for QTLs regions in a genome, a [[gene map]] based on linkage have to be built. Some of the best-known QTL mapping algorithms are Interval Mapping, Composite Interval Mapping, and Multiple Interval Mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10709-004-2705-0|pmid=15881678|title=QTL mapping and the genetic basis of adaptation: Recent developments|journal=Genetica|volume=123|issue=1–2|pages=25–37|year=2005|last1=Zeng|first1=Zhao-Bang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, QTL mapping resolution is impaired by the amount of recombination assayed, a problem for species in which it is difficult to obtain large offspring. Furthermore, allele diversity is restricted to individuals originated from contrasting parents, which limit studies of allele diversity when we have a panel of individuals representing a natural population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1746-4811-9-29|pmid=23876160|pmc=3750305|title=The advantages and limitations of trait analysis with GWAS: A review|journal=Plant Methods|volume=9|pages=29|year=2013|last1=Korte|first1=Arthur|last2=Farlow|first2=Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the [[Genome-wide association study]] was proposed in order to identify QTLs based on [[linkage disequilibrium]], that is the non-random association between traits and molecular markers. It was leveraged by the development of high-throughput [[SNP genotyping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3835/plantgenome2008.02.0089|title=Status and Prospects of Association Mapping in Plants|journal=The Plant Genome Journal|volume=1|pages=5|year=2008|last1=Zhu|first1=Chengsong|last2=Gore|first2=Michael|last3=Buckler|first3=Edward S|last4=Yu|first4=Jianming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Animal breeding|animal]] and [[plant breeding]], the use of markers in [[Selective breeding|selection]] aiming for breeding, mainly the molecular ones, collaborated to the development of [[marker-assisted selection]]. While QTL mapping is limited due resolution, GWAS does not have enough power when rare variants of small effect that are also influenced by environment. So, the concept of Genomic Selection (GS) arises in order to use all molecular markers in the selection and allow the prediction of the performance of candidates in this selection. The proposal is to genotype and phenotype a training population, develop a model that can obtain the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of individuals belonging to a genotyped and but not phenotyped population, called testing population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2017.08.011|pmid=28965742|title=Genomic Selection in Plant Breeding: Methods, Models, and Perspectives|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=22|issue=11|pages=961–975|year=2017|last1=Crossa|first1=José|last2=Pérez-Rodríguez|first2=Paulino|last3=Cuevas|first3=Jaime|last4=Montesinos-López|first4=Osval|last5=Jarquín|first5=Diego|last6=De Los Campos|first6=Gustavo|last7=Burgueño|first7=Juan|last8=González-Camacho|first8=Juan M|last9=Pérez-Elizalde|first9=Sergio|last10=Beyene|first10=Yoseph|last11=Dreisigacker|first11=Susanne|last12=Singh|first12=Ravi|last13=Zhang|first13=Xuecai|last14=Gowda|first14=Manje|last15=Roorkiwal|first15=Manish|last16=Rutkoski|first16=Jessica|last17=Varshney|first17=Rajeev K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of study could also include a validation population, thinking in the concept of [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]], in which the real phenotype results measured in this population are compared with the phenotype results based on the prediction, what used to check the accuracy of the model.

As a summary, some points about the application of quantitative genetics are:
* This has been used in agriculture to improve crops ([[Plant breeding]]) and [[livestock]] ([[Animal breeding]]). 
* In biomedical research, this work can assist in finding candidates [[gene]] [[allele]]s that can cause or influence predisposition to diseases in [[human genetics]]

=== Expression data ===

Studies for differential expression of genes from [[RNA-Seq]] data, as for [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] and [[microarrays]], demands comparison of conditions. The goal is to identify genes which have a significant change in abundance between different conditions. Then, experiments are designed appropriately, with replicates for each condition/treatment, randomization and blocking, when necessary. In RNA-Seq, the quantification of expression uses the information of mapped reads that are summarized in some genetic unit, as [[exon]]s that are part of a gene sequence. As [[microarray]] results can be approximated by a normal distribution, RNA-Seq counts data are better explained by other distributions. The first used distribution was the [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] one, but it underestimate the sample error, leading to false positives. Currently, biological variation is considered by methods that estimate a dispersion parameter of a [[negative binomial distribution]]. [[Generalized linear model]]s are used to perform the tests for statistical significance and as the number of genes is high, multiple tests correction have to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1186/gb-2010-11-12-220| pmid =21176179| pmc =3046478| title =From RNA-seq reads to differential expression results| journal =Genome Biology| volume =11| issue =12| pages =220| year =2010| last1 =Oshlack| first1 =Alicia| last2 =Robinson| first2 =Mark D| last3 =Young| first3 =Matthew D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of other analysis on [[genomics]] data comes from microarray or [[proteomics]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression Microarray Data|author1=Helen Causton |author2=John Quackenbush |author3=Alvis Brazma |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Microarray Gene Expression Data Analysis: A Beginner's Guide|author=Terry Speed|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often concerning diseases or disease stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Biostatistics for Complex Diseases|author1=Frank Emmert-Streib |author2=Matthias Dehmer |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn= 978-3-527-32585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==

There are a lot of tools that can be used to do statistical analysis in biological data. Most of them are useful in other areas of knowledge, covering a large number of applications. Here are brief descriptions of some of them:

* [https://www.vsni.co.uk/software/cycdesign/ CycDesigN]: A computer package developed by VSNi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsni.co.uk/|title=VSNi|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that helps the researchers create experimental designs and analyze data coming from a design present in one of three classes handled by CycDesigN. These classes are resolvable, non-resolvable, partially replicated and [[Crossover study|crossover designs]]. It includes less used designs the Latinized ones, as t-Latinized design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.2134/agronj15.0144| title=Beyond Latin Squares: A Brief Tour of Row-Column Designs| journal=Agronomy Journal| volume=107| issue=6| pages=2263| year=2015| last1=Piepho| first1=Hans-Peter| last2=Williams| first2=Emlyn R| last3=Michel| first3=Volker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[SAS (software)|SAS]]: A data analysis software widely used, going through universities, services and industry. Developed by a company with the same name ([[SAS Institute]]), it uses [[SAS language]] for programming.
* [[R (programming language)|R]]: An open source environment and programming language dedicated to statistical computing and graphics. It is an implementation of [[S]] language maintained by [https://cran.r-project.org/ CRAN]. In addition to its functions to read data tables, take descriptive statistics, develop and evaluate models, its repository contains packages developed by researchers around the world. This allows the development of functions written to deal with the statistical analysis of data that comes from specific applications. In the case of Bioinformatics, for example, there are packages located in the main repository (CRAN) and in others, as [[Bioconductor]]. It is also possible to use packages under development that are shared in hosting-services as [[GitHub]].
* [[ASReml]]: Another software developed by [https://www.vsni.co.uk/ VSNi] that can be used also in R environment as a package. It is developed to estimate variance components under a general linear mixed model using [[restricted maximum likelihood]] (REML). Models with fixed effects and random effects and nested or crossed ones are allowed. Gives the possibility to investigate different [[Covariance matrix|variance-covariance]] matrix structures.
* [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]]: A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software for [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]], including tools and methods for visualization, clustering, regression, association rule, and classification. There are tools for cross-validation, bootstrapping and a module of algorithm comparision. Weka also can be run in other programming languages as Perl or R.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;
* [[Orange (software)|Orange]]: A programming interface for high-level data processing, data mining and data visualization. Include tools for gene expression and genomics.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

== Scope and training programs ==

Almost all educational programmes in biostatistics are at [[postgraduate]] level. They are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture, or as a focus of application in departments of statistics.

In the United States, where several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as [[epidemiology]]. Thus, departments carrying the name "biostatistics" may exist under quite different structures. For instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of [[public health]], will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and [[clinical trial]]s as well as bioinformatics. In larger universities around the world, where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. In general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics program is twofold: (i) statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and (ii) statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry ([[quality control]]), business and [[economics]] and biological areas other than medicine.

'''Birk-Barel syndrome''' is a rare genetic disorder associated with the [[KCNK9]] gene. Signs and symptoms include [[mental retardation]], [[hypotonia]], [[hyperactivity]], and [[syndromic facies]].&lt;ref&gt;https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10358/birk-barel-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to imprinting, mutations in the maternal copy of KCNK9 cause the condition, while mutations in the paternal copy do not. As such, this condition can only be inherited from the mother.&lt;ref&gt;https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/kcnk9-imprinting-syndrome/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7225">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Jordan]]'''. The country had a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on capital punishment between 2006 and 2014. 11 executions were performed in 2015, and 15 executions were performed in 2017.

The method of execution is [[hanging]], previously [[Execution by shooting|shooting]] was the sole method.&lt;ref name=deathpworld&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Jordan |title=Jordan |publisher=Death Penalty Worldwide |date=28 June 2013 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Between 2000 and the imposition of a moratorium in 2006 there had been 41 executions, either for murder, terrorism or sexual offences.&lt;ref name=achrs&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.achrs.org/english/images/stories/news/pdf/Death%20Penalty%20Report%202010.pdf |title=Amman Center for Human Rights Studies 5th Annual Report, The Death Penalty in the Arab World 2010 |publisher=Amman Center for Human Rights Studies |pp=19 |date=2010 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 King [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] stated that: "in coordination with the European Union, we would like to modify our Penal Code. Jordan could soon become the first country in the Middle East without capital punishment."&lt;ref name=jordantimes/&gt;

In 2006 the Jordanian cabinet launched a plan to limit the number of capital offences from sixteen to ten.&lt;ref name=sputnik&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20141221/1016088778.html |title=Jordan Executes 11 Men After Lifting of Eight Year Execution Ban |publisher=Sputnik.com |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 and 2010 Jordan abstained to vote on the [[United Nations moratorium on the death penalty]].&lt;ref name=achrs/&gt;

In November 2014 the Jordanian cabinet formed a committee to explore whether Jordan should reinstate the application of capital punishment.&lt;ref name=jordantimes/&gt;

On 21 December 2014 eleven persons were hanged, all men which were convicted of murder in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30567738 |title=Jordan ends death penalty moratorium with 11 executions |publisher=BBC |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/12/jordan-hangs-11-after-lifting-execution-ban-201412218257159168.html |title=Jordan hangs 11 after lifting execution ban |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first executions since June 2006, 122 sentences of capital punishment had been handed out since.&lt;ref name=aljazeera/&gt; Shortly before the executions Interior Minister [[Hussein Al-Majali]] had stated that capital punishment might be reinstated due to a major debate on the subject, and with the public believing that a recent rise in crime was caused by non-application of the death penalty.&lt;ref name=aljazeera/&gt; The lifting of the moratorium was criticized by human rights organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/21/jordan-hangs-11-men-death-penalty |title=Jordan hangs 11 men after eight-year halt to death penalty |publisher=The Guardian |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2015, shortly after discovering Jordanian pilot [[Muath al-Kasasbeh]] had been killed by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], Jordan executed [[Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi]] and [[Ziad Khalaf Raja al-Karbouly]]. Both had been convicted of terrorist offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rod Norland and Ranya Kadri |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/world/middleeast/isis-said-to-burn-captive-jordanian-pilot-to-death-in-new-video.html?_r=0 |title=Jordan Executes 2 Prisoners After ISIS Video of Pilot’s Death |publisher=New York Times |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016 local media reported that a government committee had recommended the execution of 13 offenders, out of 80 investigated cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rana Husseini |url=http://jordantimes.com/news/local/no-decision-yet-death-row-cases-%E2%80%94-official |title=No decision yet on death row cases — official |publisher=The Jordan Times |date=17 February 2016 |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

15 executions were carried on dawn of 4 March 2017; 10 convicted with terrorism and the remaining 5 with "heinous" murder and rape of minors. Those convicted with terrorism were part of a bomb attack against the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad in 2003 that left dozens killed, an attack in Amman in 2006 in which a tourist was killed, a foiled terror plot in [[Irbid]] in 2016 that planned to bomb several civilian targets, an attack on intelligence officers in 2016 that left 5 dead and the assassination of Jordanian writer [[Nahed Hattar]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39165220|title=Jordan executes 15 prisoners, 10 convicted of terror charges|work=BBC|date=4 March 2017|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital crimes==
Capital punishment is possible amongst others for murder, rape, terrorism, aggravated robbery, drug trafficking, illegal possession and use of weapons, war crimes, treason and espionage.&lt;ref name=sputnik/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Jordan |title=The Death Penalty in Jordan |publisher=Death Penalty Worldwide |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal process==
In recent years most verdicts of capital punishment have been handed out by the [[State Security Court]].&lt;ref name="HoodHoyle2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger G. Hood|author2=Carolyn Hoyle|title=The Death Penalty: A Worldwide Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSZwglgRnHsC&amp;pg=PA248|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-922846-1|pages=248–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases in which capital punishment is sentenced receive an automatic appeal.&lt;ref name=bdhrl&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154464.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Jordan |publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor - United States Department of State |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 93 of the [[Constitution of Jordan]] holds that "no death sentence may be carried out unless ratified by the King. Every such sentence shall be submitted to him by the Council of Ministers along with the council’s view on it."&lt;ref name=jordantimes&gt;{{cite web|author=Rana Husseini |url=http://jordantimes.com/panel-to-examine-whether-to-reinstate-executions |title=‘Panel to examine whether to reinstate executions’ |publisher=The Jordan Times |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several categories of persons are excluded from being subjected to capital punishment. These are those under the age of 18, pregnant women, the mentally ill and mentally retarded.&lt;ref name=deathpworld/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">'''Caving in Tunisia''' is a relatively rare [[Sport in Tunisia|sport]]  in the country. [[Caving]] emerged in the late 1970s and includes a limited number of practitioners. [[Tunisia]] has a number of sites suitable for the sport. 

==Practice ==
The caving club of [[Bizerte]] began in 1979, in the youth house in the city, and particularly aroused the interest of the club [[Association Jeunes Science de Tunisie|Youth Science]] Bizerta. In 1981, a second club was opened in [[Zaghouan]], while Tunisian speleologists began to participate in  national and international speleological meetings. 
== Sites ==
===Cave  Mine===

[[Image:Descente vers2éme salle gr de la mine tunisia.jpg|thumb | right | 220px | speleologist descending]] 

The two massive caves Jebel Serj and Jebel Bargou are important places for caving. They culminate respectively {{formatnum: 1309}} and (m) {{formatnum: 1268}} m and are oriented southwest and northeast. The first of these is composed of two parallel ridges separated by deep notch. All of the backbone is formed by massive [[Aptian]] land whose [[limestone]]'s reef summit are almost all of [[outcrop]]s. The sides of the [[djebel]] are very pronounced, forming a  safe fold structure.
  
The site is interesting, both from the ecological point of view and that of archeology. There are sources emerging in wild vegetation and Roman ruins such as the bridge Sidi Amara. 
[[File:Pont sur l'oued Djilf.jpg|thumb|right|Roman bridge Sidi Amara.]]
There are many caves, the most important step is the cave of El Kef Biadh whose access is via a series of wells or galleries, most of which come from [[Mine (deposit)|mining]]. The first large room of {{formatnum: 1608}} m long and 267 metres deep shelters [[concretion]]s and huge boulders; its walls are covered with bushes of [[Stalactite|Eccentric]]. The hall ends with a [[diaclases]] which opens a well. It measures about 150 metres long and 50 metres wide. The vault is located some thirty metres above the ground. 

It then goes to the second room that looks much like the previous one with the presence of concretions and basins . This last room is closed on a crack up to two metres above the ground. There is a significant colony of [[Chiroptera|bat]]. The second room is over 200 meters long and 75 metres wide and has a vault located about forty metres above the ground in places.

=== Cave Nefza ===

[[Image:Draperie Nefza.jpg|thumb | right | 220px | Draprerie]] 
[[Image:Stalactites nefza Tunisia.jpg|thumb | left | 220px | Stalactite]] 

The cave [[Nefza]] is an extension of the mine Ghanguet Kef at Jebel El Damous which peaked at about 202 metres. The latter is formed by land dating from the [[Cretaceous]], the [[Eocene]], and the [[Oligocene]]. At these sites are deposits of [[zinc]] and [[lead]]. 

The cavity, with a total length of 310 metres and a height of 60 metres, contains a tectonic accident: its cross section shows a general shape of a triangle with a straight wall western wall and a shaped Eastern staircase reversed. A gallery of thirty metres, covered in concentric circles and ovals, about eight metres above the ground, leads to a first room that leads to two lanes of forty metres in length, at different levels, leading to a large room in which there are two columns of stalagmites. A narrow conduit leads to a third room containing concretions and eccentrics. At this level, progress is blocked by a narrow conduit. 

===Caves Joumine ===
The region of [[Joumine]] has land dating to the [[Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous]]. The caves in this area are located more precisely in the region Errouaha.

Access to the cave of El Blida is difficult: it is entered through a narrow conduit that leads to a very small room leading into the main room; the passage between these two rooms is made through a slope of approximately 20°. 

Access to the cave of Bou Touil is relatively easy: the entrance is from a fairly broad which leads to narrow corridors on the left side. It leads to a large room with good [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s and columns. A large, steep (about 45 ° to 50 °) corridor in the back is ended by a narrow passage that stops the progression. This cave has been subject to a thorough study, including [[petrography]] and [[mineralogy]] analysis performed on many samples. 

=== Cave  Ichkeul ===
The Ichkeul cave is located in the Jebel Ichkeul, located about twenty kilometres from the city of [[Bizerte]] in the [[National Park Ichkeul]] covering an area of {{formatnum: 12600}} hectares including a [[Lac Ichkeul|lake]] of {{formatnum: 8500}} hectares. [[Limestone]], [[Dolomite|Dolomitic]], and [[marble]] rocks date from [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] and are located above a collapsed ditch.

The cave itself has a narrow entrance allowing access to a vast room with large cracks along the length of the walls and showing several cavities. The room is followed by a narrow corridor formed by the wall and giant [[calcite|calcitic]] concretions, which ends with a stack of 32 metres. On the sides of the second room there are draperies, small stalactites and young stalagmites. The cave is well lit and ventilated, and it has a diverse wildlife, including bats, birds and reptiles.

'''Chloramination''' is the treatment of [[drinking water]] with a [[chloramine]] [[disinfectant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wqa.org/pdf/TechBulletins/TB-Chloramine.pdf Chloramines], Water Quality Association&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[chlorine]] and small amounts of [[ammonia]] are added to the water one at a time which react together to form chloramine (also called combined chlorine), a long lasting [[disinfectant]]. Chloramine disinfection is used in both small and large water treatment plants.

== Use ==

In the United States, the maintenance of what is called a "residual" of disinfectant that stays in the water distribution system while it is delivered to people's homes is required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

The EPA regulations give two choices for disinfectant residual — chlorine or chloramine. Many major water agencies are changing to chloramine to better meet current and anticipated federal drinking water regulations and to protect the [[public health]].

== Chlorine versus chloramine ==

There are many similarities between chlorine and chloramine. Both provide effective residual disinfection with minimal risk to public health. Both are [[toxic]] to [[fish]] and [[amphibians]]. Both chlorine and chloramine react with other compounds in the water to form what are called "disinfection byproducts".

The difference is that chlorine forms many byproducts, including [[trihalomethane]]s (THM) and [[haloacetic acids]] (HAA), whereas chloramine forms a significantly lower amount of THMs and HAAs but also forms [[N-Nitrosodimethylamine|''N''-nitrosodimethylamine]] (NDMA). One of the principal benefits of chloramine is that its use reduces the overall levels of these regulated contaminants compared to chlorine.

== Adverse effects ==

Chloramine is toxic to fish and amphibians. Chloramine, like chlorine, comes in direct contact with their bloodstream through fish [[gills]] and must be removed from water added to aquariums and fish ponds. It must also be removed from water prior to use in [[dialysis]] machines, since water comes into direct contact with the bloodstream during treatment. Since the 1980s, most dialysis machines are built with filters to remove chloramines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8914698 | volume=3 | title=Chloramine removal from water used in hemodialysis. | date=Oct 1996 | journal=Adv Ren Replace Ther | pages=337–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chloramine is generally considered a problem in [[brewing]] beer; like chlorine it can react with and change some of the natural plant flavors that make up the beer, and it may slow or alter the yeast. Because chloramine dissipates much more slowly than chlorine from water, beer-makers prefer carbon filtration and / or [[Campden tablets]] to neutralize it in the water.&lt;ref&gt;http://morebeer.com/articles/removing_chloramines_from_water&lt;/ref&gt;

People have no trouble digesting chlorine or chloramine at the levels found in public drinking water; this water is not introduced directly into the human bloodstream. In the United States, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] set minimum and maximum health-based safe levels for chloramine in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/disinfectants.cfm EPA basic information about chloramines&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, similar oversight agencies may set [[drinking water quality standards]] for chloramine.

Two home builders filed lawsuits against Moulton Niguel Water District in 2012, (in Orange County CA), arguing that pinhole leaks in copper water piping in their homes was due to faulty water treatment with chloramine.  Pinhole leaks cause expensive damage to people's homes, and the builders claim that they must repipe houses at great expense to deal with the problem.  Officials observed that only the two builders have filed suit, but as of late 2013 the number of lawsuits had expanded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/water-340682-leaks-copper.html, {{cite web |url=http://www.newmeyeranddillion.com/pdf/Claims_Against_Water_Districts_Over_Copper_Pipe_Leaks_Form.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729011039/http://www.newmeyeranddillion.com/pdf/Claims_Against_Water_Districts_Over_Copper_Pipe_Leaks_Form.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://atozleakdetection.com/pinhole-leaks-plague-south-county-home-owners/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== N-nitrosodimethylamine ===

Much of the recent discussion about chloramine has focused on [[N-nitrosodimethylamine]] (NDMA), and it is critical to distinguish between chloramine and NDMA. NDMA can be a byproduct of chloramination or chlorination, but drinking water is not a major source of exposure to NDMA. The biggest sources of human exposure to NDMA are [[tobacco]] smoke, chewing tobacco, [[bacon]] and other cured meats, [[beer]], fish, [[cheese]], toiletries, [[shampoo]]s, cleansers, interior air of cars, and household [[pesticides]]. In addition, NDMA can form in the stomach during digestion of foods or drugs that contain [[Amine#Aliphatic amines|alkylamines]], which are naturally occurring compounds.

At very high levels—100,000 times greater than even the highest levels seen in a recent survey of chlorinated and chloraminated drinking waters—NDMA may cause serious human health problems, such as liver disease. Such effects are seen at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 parts per million in water; for comparison a study conducted by the California Department of Health Services in 1999 and 2000 found the highest level of NDMA in drinking water that had been treated with chloramine was 0.00006 parts per million. In that study, most of the concentrations of NDMA were far lower than that, and many water samples in the California Department of Health Services study, including those from the [[San Francisco Public Utilities Commission]] water system taken in 2000, did not have any detectable concentrations of NDMA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/pages/NDMA.aspx California Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chlorella vulgaris''''' is a green [[microalgae]] mainly used as a medical treatment in [[Japan]]. It thought to have potential for [[biofuel]] production or as a food additive.

==Introduction==
''C. vulgaris'' is a green [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] microalgae in the genus ''[[Chlorella]]'', which has been present on earth since the [[Precambrian]] period.&lt;ref name="safi2014"&gt;Safi, C., Zebib, B., Merah, O., Pontalier, P. Y., &amp; Vaca-Garcia, C. (2014). Morphology, composition, production, processing and applications of ''Chlorella vulgaris'': A review. Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy Reviews, 35, 265-278. doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2014.04.007&lt;/ref&gt; This unicellular algae was discovered in 1890 by [[Martinus Beijerinck|Martinus Willem Beijerinck]] as the first microalgae with a well-defined nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;Beijerinck, M. W. (1890). Culturversuche mit Zoochlorellen, Lichenengonidien und anderen niederen Algen. Bot. Zeitung, 48, 781-785.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 1990s, German scientists noticed the high protein content of ''C. vulgaris'' and began to consider it as a new food source. Japan is currently the largest consumer of Chlorella, mostly because of its medical properties.&lt;ref name="kitada2009"&gt;Kitada, K., Machmudah, S., Sasaki, M., Goto, M., Nakashima, Y., Kumamoto, S., &amp; Hasegawa, T. (2009). Supercritical CO2 extraction of pigment components with pharmaceutical importance from ''Chlorella vulgaris''. Journal of chemical technology and biotechnology, 84(5), 657-661.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="safi2014" /&gt;

==Production==
The world annual production of the various species of ''[[Chlorella]]'' was 2000t (dry weight) in 2009, with the main producers being Germany, Japan and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="safi2014" /&gt; ''C. vulgaris'' constitutes an excellent candidate for production due to its high resistance against rough conditions and invading organisms. In addition, the production of the various organic macromolecules of interest (proteins, lipids, starch) differ depending on the technique used to create biomass and can be therefore targeted.&lt;ref name="safi2014" /&gt; Under more hostile conditions, the biomass decreases but lipids and starch contents increase.&lt;ref&gt;Pribyl, P., Cepak, V., &amp; Zachleder, V. (2012). Production of lipids in 10 strains of Chlorella and Parachlorella, and enhanced lipid productivity in ''Chlorella vulgaris''. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 94(2), 549-561. doi:10.1007/s00253-012-3915-5&lt;/ref&gt; Under favourable conditions, protein content raises along with the biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Chisti, Y. (2007). Biodiesel from microalgae. Biotechnol Adv, 25(3), 294-306. doi:10.1016/j.biotechadv.2007.02.001&lt;/ref&gt; Different growth techniques have been developed. They exploit the [[autotroph]]ic, [[heterotroph]]ic or [[mixotroph]]ic properties of ''C. vulgaris''. Growing ''C. vulgaris'' autotrophically is illustrated by the closed photo-[[bioreactor]]. Harvesting the biomass is then generally done by [[centrifugation]] due to the high process efficiency (95% recovery). Other techniques exist as well, such as [[flocculation]], [[filtration]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee, D. J., Liao, G. Y., Chang, Y. R., &amp; Chang, J. S. (2012). Coagulation-membrane filtration of ''Chlorella vulgaris''. Bioresour Technol, 108, 184-189. doi:10.1016/j.biortech.2011.12.098&lt;/ref&gt; [[Froth flotation|flotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Y. L., Juang, Y. C., Liao, G. Y., Ho, S. H., Yeh, K. L., Chen, C. Y., . . . Lee, D. J. (2010). Dispersed ozone flotation of ''Chlorella vulgaris''. Bioresour Technol, 101(23), 9092-9096. doi:10.1016/j.biortech.2010.07.016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Bioenergy===
''C. vulgaris'' is seen as a promising source of [[bioenergy]]. It may be a good alternative to the current [[biofuel]] crops, like soybean, corn or rapeseed, as it is more productive and does not compete with food production.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, A., Nigam, P. S., &amp; Murphy, J. D. (2011). Renewable fuels from algae: An answer to debatable land based fuels. Bioresource Technology, 102(1), 10-16. doi: 10.1016/j.biortech.2010.06.032&lt;/ref&gt; It can produce large amount of [[lipid]]s, up to 20 times more than crop,&lt;ref&gt;Demirbas, M. F. (2011). Biofuels from algae for sustainable development. Applied Energy, 88(10), 3473-3480. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.01.059&lt;/ref&gt; which have a suitable profile for [[biodiesel]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, K. G., Brown, R. C., Homsy, S., Martinez, L., &amp; Sidhu, S. S. (2013). Fast pyrolysis of microalgae remnants in a fluidized bed reactor for bio-oil and biochar production. Bioresource Technology, 127, 494-499. doi: 10.1016/j.biortech.2012.08.016&lt;/ref&gt; This microalgae also contains high amount of [[starch]], good enough for the production of [[Ethanol|bioethanol]].&lt;ref name="safi2014" /&gt; However, microalgal biofuels are still far from being competitive with fossil fuels, regarding their high production costs and controversial sustainability.&lt;ref name="safi2014" /&gt;

[[File:PassmoreEdwards.jpg|thumb|right|Passmore Edwards Cottage Hospital in [[Acton, London]]. Built c. 1900, it was funded by [[John Passmore Edwards]].]]A '''cottage hospital''' is a semi-obsolete type of small hospital in the United Kingdom.[[File:RuyigiHopital.JPG|thumb|right|260px|A cottage hospital in [[Ruyigi]], [[Burundi]].]]
The original concept was a small rural building having several beds.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"&gt;The Cottage Hospitals 1859–1990, Dr. Meyrick Emrys-Roberts, Tern Publications, Motcombe, Dorset. 1991, {{ISBN|0-9517136-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The advantages of such a hospital in villages were the provision of care which avoided long journeys to county or voluntary hospitals, facilities to deal more immediately with emergencies, and familiarity the local physician might have with their patients that may affect their treatment.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"/&gt; This local knowledge of the patient would probably have been lost had they been referred to their nearest county hospital, as was typical for poorer patients.

Some of these buildings continued to be known as cottage hospitals until recent times. In particular, several are still recognisable in [[Scotland]] within the infrastructure of [[NHS Grampian]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], [[Dumfries and Galloway|Dumfries &amp; Galloway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumfries and Galloway Hospitals |url=http://www.nhsdg.scot.nhs.uk/Hospitals/Hospitals_in_the_Region|publisher=Dumfries and Galloway Health Board|accessdate= 12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]] in [[England]], an example being the [[Aldeburgh Cottage Hospital]], which is still working as a traditional cottage hospital. The term [[community hospital]] is now applied to most of these buildings where they are used to deliver healthcare, reflecting the wider range of services that are provided in more modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Hospital toolkit |url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/287732/05-07_Community_Hospitals_Toolkit.pdf |publisher=Royal College of Nursing|date= March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Following [[King Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1536-40, only a few hospitals remained in use: [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']], [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St Bartholomew's]], the [[Bethlehem Hospital]] for the insane and two [[Lock Hospital|lock hospital]]s for the treatment of syphilis. From the mid-16th century until the Voluntary Hospital Movement in the early part of the 18th century there was a dearth of hospital care in the UK.

The first voluntary hospital created to provide free care through the philanthropic action of doctors and surgeons for the ill poor was the [[French Hospital (La Providence)|French Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;The French Hospital | {{cite web|url=http://www.frenchhospital.org.uk/french-hospital-history/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402170343/http://www.frenchhospital.org.uk/french-hospital-history/|archivedate=2015-04-02|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Finsbury]], London, started in 1718 by [[Huguenots|Huguenot]] immigrants.  The movement developed with the opening of [[Westminster Hospital]] near [[St James's Park]]. This was followed by the commissioning of [[St George's Hospital|St George’s Hospital]] at Hyde Park Corner. Over the next 50 years, voluntary hospitals were built across the UK with a larger number in the south of England, although one of the largest voluntary hospitals opened in Edinburgh in 1729. Funding was problematic in the early years as the development of voluntary hospitals competed with government, county and local funding for the provision of care under the [[Poor Law]] Acts of 1722 and 1782. The County Hospitals received enormous public charity support. Alongside these care facilities were dispensaries.

Accommodated in a single building, they provided what is now called out-patient and day-patient care. Medicines (termed ‘physics’) were prescribed, and minor surgical procedures as well as [[Fire cupping|cupping]] and [[bloodletting|bleeding]] were carried out, the patient returning to their home after treatment.&lt;ref name="cotthosp" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Accounts of Harlington, Harmondsworth and Cranford Cottage Hospital, published June 1913.jpg|thumbnail|&lt;sub&gt;Accounts of Harlington, Harmondsworth and Cranford Cottage Hospital, west Middlesex, published June 1913. For the year 1912-1913 the hospital treated 46; of which 24 from Harlington; 18 Harmondsworth; 2 Cranford; with 2 passers by who had accidents.&lt;/sub&gt;]]
[[File:Harlington, Harmondsworth and Cranford Cottage Hospital patient list 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|Harlington, Harmondsworth and Cranford Cottage Hospital's 1912-1913 patient list.]]

In 1818 the village surgeon, Mr. [[Henry Lilley Smith]] opened a dispensary in [[Southam]], [[Warwickshire]]. This comprised an 8 bed-roomed cottage with 4 beds. It was for the use of manual labourers and their families. Except in name this facility fulfills the broad definition of a cottage hospital.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"/&gt; p20

In 1827 Sir [[Astley Cooper]] converted some cottages at [[Piccotts End]], close to Hemel Hempstead, into the first cottage hospital providing free medical services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/piccottsend.htm Dacorum Heritage Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308044633/http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/piccottsend.htm |date=2005-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1842 saw the commissioning of a cottage hospital in [[Wellow, Nottinghamshire|Wellow]], [[Nottinghamshire]] with 6 beds and managed by a board which included many eminent gentlemen. Mr. W Squire Ward was the surgeon on its inception and remained so for 25 years. One nurse was employed with occasional assistance and a wide range of surgical interventions were successfully carried out.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"/&gt; p21

Between 1855 and 1898, 294 cottage hospitals were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|year=|isbn=|location=London|page=50|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 Albert Napper converted a small cottage into a hospital in the village of [[Cranleigh]] in Surrey. This hospital opened because Mr Napper was concerned that there were no local hospital facilities for the poor in the village. [[Saint Thomas Hospital|St Thomas’ Hospital]] was the nearest voluntary hospital and that was about 45 kilometres away on unmade roads, a dangerous journey for an ill person. The only other possibility for care was in a local [[workhouse]] infirmary but this was some 12 kilometres away in Guildford, had no trained nurses and carried the real (at that time) risk of the patient being stigmatized as a pauper. The third possibility was to stay at home; in those days and for poor people this condition is indicated by Horace Swete, a village surgeon in [[Wrington]] in [[Somerset]], UK, in his book of 1870.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"/&gt;

{{bq|1=To those who visit their poorer neighbours, the sick room of the cottager is a familiar object, the cottage itself generally consisting, at the best, of a kitchen and a back shed, with perhaps two bedrooms, which are often without a fireplace; the windows, small, low and frequently not made to open; the laboring man, who has met with a severe accident, with difficulty is carried up the narrow staircase&amp;nbsp;– generally of the stepladder description&amp;nbsp;– and is placed on a bed utterly unfit for the treatment of a broken limb, and which his restless tossings has disordered. Perhaps he may possess a coverlid or counterpane; but more generally the top covering of a sick man’s bed is the collection of unused clothes in the house; the floor , generally occupied by some ingeniously-constructed temporary bedding for the wife and younger children; no useful sanitary arrangements to be obtained; the patient parched with thirst, and with the capricious appetite of illness, turns his head away from the badly cooked food; the wife, tired out with bad nights, and "worritted" with the children who are constantly crying; added to which may be the close, sickening steam of ‘washing out a few things’, which some neighbour with well-meant kindness has dropped in to do, keeping up an incessant chatter of village gossip that drives the sick man wild, and here we have a tolerably fair picture of the cottage home in sickness."&lt;ref name="swete"&gt;Horace Swete, Handy Book of Cottage Hospitals, Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co., London and Weston-super-Mare, 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The moneyed class could afford much better conditions and treatment in private hospital without the risk of loss of employment, a slide in poverty or worse.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"/&gt;

Albert Napper’s sympathy for the poorer classes were shared by the Reverend JH Sapter, Rector of Cranley and they fostered the idea of finding some accommodation for the care and nursing of the ill poor. Then an occurrence of a single incident is recorded by Swete as being the catalyst for the development of the cottage hospital.  Rev. Sapter was riding across the common in Cranley when he heard of a serious accident. The victim had been carried to a nearby cottage and when Sapter arrived he found Albert Napper and two assistants amputating the leg of the injured man. This incident confirmed for both men the need for some local facility where sick or injured people could receive urgent care. The Rev. Sapter made a cottage available, rent-free, which after being whitewashed and simply furnished opened after a few weeks as the first cottage hospital.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swete"/&gt;

That same cottage still exists today at the entrance to Cranleigh Village Hospital.

Mr Napper proceeded to admit local patients to the Village Hospital, as it was called, and kept records from the start. Among the first 100 patients he recorded “[[Bone fracture|compound fracture]] of both bones in the leg”, “extensive [[Scar|cicatrix]] from a burn”, “chronic pneumonia in both lungs”, “multiple injuries” and amputation of fingers in a boy”.&lt;ref name="cotthosp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23681">'''DSM-IV codes''' are the classification found in the '''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision''', also known as ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]]'', a manual published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) that includes all currently recognized [[mental illness|mental health]] disorders.  The DSM-IV codes are thus used by mental health professionals to describe the features of a given mental disorder and indicate how the disorder can be distinguished from other, similar problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner (2011)''Psychology'' (2nd Edition), page 552, Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

The coding system utilized by the DSM-IV is designed to correspond with codes from the [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases]], Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, commonly referred to as the ICD-9-CM. Since early versions of the DSM did not correlate with ICD codes and updates of the publications for the ICD and the DSM are not simultaneous, some distinctions in the coding systems may still be present.  For this reason, it is recommended that users of these manuals consult the appropriate reference when accessing diagnostic codes

Note that '''NOS''' is an abbreviation for ''Not Otherwise Specified'', indicating a cluster of symptoms that do not clearly fit in any single diagnostic category. NOS is often a provisional diagnosis pending additional information or testing.

For an alphabetical list, see [[DSM-IV codes (alphabetical)]].

[[Image:DanielNunezdelPrado1.JPG|right|thumb|'''Dr Daniel Nuñez del Prado''']]

'''Dr. Daniel Nuñez del Prado''' (29 July 1840 in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]] – 1891) was a revolutionary Bolivian doctor of medicine. His parents were Dr Maria José Nuñez del Prado and Isabel del Valle. His brother, Eduardo Nuñez del Prado, was also a doctor of medicine.

President [[Mariano Melgarejo]] expelled Nuñez del Prado from Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Nunez del Prado Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/daniel-nunez-del-prado-9202a8c04000641f8000000016b3e188#|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason was that Rosa Zeballos Tomayo, the wife of Nuñez del Prado denied General Melgarejo access to her house during a parade. It is one of the historical buildings in the city of La Paz. Years later, Don Daniel urgently was requested to attend a patient who had been shot dead in Lima. The patient was General Melgarejo. The last confession from former president Melgarejo was that he was with Don Daniel Nuñez del Prado.

{{PoliticsUK}}

The '''Department of Health and Social Care''' ('''DHSC''') is a [[British government departments|department of Her Majesty's Government]], responsible for government policy on [[health]] and adult [[social care]] matters in England, along with a few elements of the same matters which are not otherwise [[devolved government|devolved]] to the [[Scottish government|Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Assembly Government|Welsh Government]] or [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland Executive]]. It oversees the English [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS). The department is led by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]] with two [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]] and three [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State]].

The Department of Health develops policies and guidelines to improve the quality of care and to meet patient expectations.

The department carries out some of its work through [[Quango|arms-length bodies (ALBs)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arms-length-bodies/our-arms-length-bodies |title=[Withdrawn&amp;#93; Arm's length bodies |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; including executive [[non-departmental public body|non-departmental public bodies]] such as [[NHS England]] and the [[NHS Digital]], and [[executive agency|executive agencies]] such as [[Public Health England]] and the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA).

==History==
The Department of Health was formally created in 1988, through The Transfer of Functions (Health and Social Security) Order. 
Like many others, the department with responsibility for the nation's health has had different names and included other functions over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/21/detail.html | title=Health Departments | publisher=The National Archives | work=ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk | accessdate=7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, several bodies were formed for specific consultative duties and dissolved when they were no longer required. There were two incarnations of the Board of Health (in 1805 and 1831) and a General Board of Health (1854 to 1858) that reported directly into the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. Responsibility for health issues was also at times, and in part, vested in [[Local board of health|local health boards]] and, with the emergence of modern local government, with the Local Government Act Office, part of the Home Office. In the early part of the 20th century, medical assistance was provided through National Health Insurance Commissions.

The first body which could be called a department of government was the Ministry of Health, created through the [[Ministry of Health Act 1919]], consolidating under a single authority the medical and public health functions of central government. The co-ordination of local medical services was expanded in connection with emergency and wartime services, from 1935 to 1945, and these developments culminated in the establishment of the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] in 1948.

In 1968, the Ministry of Health was dissolved and its functions transferred (along with those of the similarly dissolved Ministry of Social Security) to the newly created [[Department of Health and Social Security]] (DHSS). Twenty years later, these functions were split back into two government departments, forming the [[Department of Social Security]] (DSS) and the Department of Health.

After the [[2018 British cabinet reshuffle]], the department was renamed to the '''Department of Health and Social Care'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-hunt-new-job-theresa-11818996|title=Jeremy Hunt has got a new job in Theresa May's Cabinet reshuffle after an hour inside Number 10|author=Mikey Smith|date=8 January 2018|newspaper=Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The department's headquarters and ministerial offices are at 39 [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]], [[London]].  The department moved from its previous location in Richmond House, Whitehall in November 2017. Its other principal offices are [[Skipton House]] ([[Elephant and Castle]]), Wellington House near [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] and [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry House]] in [[Leeds]]. Wellington House is now mainly occupied by staff from the department's arms-length bodies. New King's Beam House near [[Blackfriars Bridge]] was formerly a Department of Health office prior to the expiry of its lease in October 2011. [[Alexander Fleming House]] and [[Hannibal House]] were previously used by the department. The archives are at [[Nelson, Lancashire]].

==Ministers==
The Department of Health ministers are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministers|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers|website=GOV.UK|publisher=[[HM Government]]|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/opposition-holding/ |title=Her Majesty's Official Opposition - Departments and Shadow Ministers |website=www.parliament.uk |publisher=[[UK Parliament]] |accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Image:QuarryHouseLeeds.jpg|Quarry House: a DH building shared with the Department for Work and Pensions at [[Quarry Hill, Leeds]] (known locally as 'The Kremlin').|thumb|300px]]

===Introduction of user charges for NHS services===
The publication of [[Ara Darzi, Baron Darzi of Denham|Professor Lord Darzi]]'s review of the NHS&lt;ref name="Darzi report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085825?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=168197&amp;Rendition=Web |title=High Quality Health Care For All |format=PDF |work= |date=30 June 2008 |author=Professor Lord Darzi KBE |publisher=The [[Department of Health]] |accessdate=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompted criticism of the government and the department of health claiming that it paved the way for user charging,&lt;ref name="Pollock"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/01/nhs.health1 |title=Lord Darzi's report paves the way for Labour to charge for NHS care | publisher=The Guardian |author=Allyson Pollock |work= |accessdate=3 July 2008 |date=1 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so contradicting the [[NHS Plan 2000]] which stated that "user charges are unfair and inequitable in they increase the proportion of funding from the unhealthy, old and poor compared with the healthy, young and wealthy".&lt;ref name="NHS plan 2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4002960 |title=The NHS Plan: a plan for investment, a plan for reform |publisher=The Department of Health |work= |accessdate=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also introduces the concept of [[personal health budgets|personal budgets]].

===Fragmentation of NHS services===
Darzi's report&lt;ref name="Darzi report"/&gt; splits previously integrated services into 'core', 'additional' and 'enhanced' services, which critics say will lead to abandoning the open-ended duty of care on which the NHS was founded.&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt;

==="Superbugs" and PFI===
Fatal outbreaks of [[Antibiotic resistance|antibiotic-resistant]] [[bacteria]] ("superbugs"), such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) and ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', in NHS hospitals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4324281.stm | title=Labour hails fall in MRSA cases | publisher=BBC news | date=7 March 2005 | accessdate=28 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to criticism of the DH's decision to outsource cleaning via [[private finance initiative]] contracts as "cutting corners on cleaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/05/nhygiene105.xml | title=NHS trust warned over hygiene breaches | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=30 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Deep Clean" initiative announced by the Department of Health was criticised by infection control experts and by the Lancet as a gimmick which failed to address the causes of in-hospital infections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thelancet,|title=The traditional white coat: goodbye, or au revoir? |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9593 |page=1102 |year=2007 |pmid=17905145 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61487-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the firms doing the work as an attempt to avoid paying for regular better cleaning,&lt;ref name="BBC_deepclean_fire"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7181837.stm |publisher=BBC News|title=Hospital deep cleaning under fire |accessdate=30 March 2008 |date=14 January 2008 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by NHS managers as ineffective.&lt;ref name="BBC_deepclean_fire"/&gt;

It also attracted criticism because only a quarter of the £60m funding for the scheme actually went to hospitals, and because a number of hospitals missed the completion target,&lt;ref name="BBC_deepclean_miss"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7319160.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Hospital deep clean target missed |date=29 March 2008| accessdate=30 March 2008 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of June 2008 one in four NHS trusts was not meeting the government's standards on hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher = BBC news| title = NHS trusts 'failing on hygiene'| accessdate = 16 June 2008| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7453037.stm | date=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prescribing===
Its advice to primary care on prescribing drugs such as [[proton pump inhibitors]] has been criticised as wasteful.&lt;ref name="Balliol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/bandopubs/RAMnhsfu/NHSfutur.html |title=Waste in the NHS: the problem, its size, and how we can tackle it |author=Andrew Moore |publisher=[[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] |date=6 October 2000 |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611194458/http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/Bandolier/bandopubs/RAMnhsfu/NHSfutur.html |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical training===
The DH has attracted criticism for its disastrous handling of the outcome of [[Modernising Medical Careers]], in particular in the changes it made to the specialist training of doctors and the [[Medical Training Application Service]] (MTAS). These changes left "29,193 junior doctors from the UK and overseas... chasing 15,600 posts..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/health/johnson+recruitment+reform+bungled/625757 | title=Johnson: Recruitment reform bungled | publisher=Channel 4 News | date=25 July 2007 | accessdate=2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in accusations that the DH had broken the law by refusing to reveal scores to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1821521.ece |title=Health Department ‘broke law over doctors’ job test scores’ |publisher=Times Online |accessdate=26 March 2008 |date=22 May 2007 | location=London | first=Nigel | last=Hawkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately there was a [[judicial review]] and a boycott of the system by senior doctors across the country.&lt;ref name="BBC 20070307"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC news |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2008 |title=Review into doctor recruitment |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6423307.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MTAS was eventually scrapped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Guardian |date=16 May 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/16/politics.health |title=Hewitt backs down in junior doctor row |author=John Carvel | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patricia Hewitt]], the then Secretary of State for Health, resigned{{Clarify|date=September 2008}} following accusations that she had lied to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] over the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/health/hewitt+misled+commons+over+mtas/519657 |publisher=Channel 4 |title=Hewitt 'misled Commons' over MTAS |accessdate=26 March 2008 |date=19 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the abolition of MTAS, anger among the medical profession continued, with the [[British Medical Association]] commenting of the DH response that "Not only is this response too late, it does not go far enough".&lt;ref name="BBC 20070307"/&gt;

The [[John Tooke|official government inquiry into MMC]] recommended that the responsibility for medical training be removed from the DH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3149316.ece |publisher=The Times |date=8 January 2008 |author=Nigel Hawkes, Health Editor |title=Department of Health ‘must be stripped of doctors’ training role’ |accessdate=26 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurrent NHS reorganisation===
Successive DH ministerial teams have been criticised for repeated reorganisations of the NHS in England, where primary care commissioning responsibility, in particular, has been allocated to four different sets of organisations in the last ten years: PCGs,{{clarify|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--What are PCGs, PCTs, and Clinical Commissioning Groups?--&gt; small area PCTs (e.g. covering a rural local authority district or part of a city), larger-area PCTs (e.g. covering a whole County), PCT clusters (e.g. quarter of London or South of Tyne and Wear) and the currently unspecified Clinical Commissioning Groups. The tendency to introduce each reorganisation before its predecessor has had time to settle down and generate improved performance has attracted censure amongst healthcare professions in the UK and beyond, including reference to the ironic concept of 'redisorganization'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16319441 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.98.12.563 | pmc=1299350 | volume=98 | title=A surrealistic mega-analysis of redisorganization theories | date=December 2005 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=563–8 |vauthors=Oxman AD, Sackett DL, Chalmers I, Prescott TE }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Andrew Lansley's promise before the 2010 general election not to impose top-down reorganisation, followed by the instigation from ministerial level of one of the [[Andrew Lansley#Proposed reform|most fundamental NHS reorganisations yet envisaged]], has generated especially widespread opprobrium, although some commentators have also suggested that this is to some extent completing the job started under the Blair administration.

The NHS as of 1 April 2013 is no longer situated within the DH, as NHS England also went 'live' at the same time. Therefore, the DH has a further scrunity role of NHS services and commissioning. (See Arms Length Bodies section).

==Information technology==
In recent years the Department of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.co.uk/cio100/department-of-health/4156/ |title=Department of Health's CIO Company Profile &amp;#124; CIO UK |publisher=Cio.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the NHS have come under considerable scrutiny for its use of IT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Leo |url=http://www.cio.co.uk/news/3209439/tories-vow-nhs-it-and-management-is-number-one-priority/ |title=Tories vow NHS IT and management is 'number one priority' |publisher=Cio.co.uk |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since being elected to power in 1997 the Labour government had sought to modernise the NHS through the introduction of IT. Although the policy is correct in aim, many claim its execution is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Leo |url=http://www.cio.co.uk/news/3208648/nhs-study-damns-electronic-patient-records-systems/ |title=NHS study damns electronic patient records systems |publisher=Cio.co.uk |date=2009-12-14 |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 a new leadership team was established, CIO for Health, Christine Connelly, and director of programme and system delivery Martin Bellamy. Previous CIO Richard Granger was believed to have been the most highly paid civil servant in the UK and was a controversial figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knights |first=Miya |url=http://www.cio.co.uk/article/351/granger-the-final-word/?otc=44 |title=Technology high on transport review agenda |publisher=Cio.co.uk |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connelly left the DH for a position in the Cabinet Office in June 2009 and was replaced by Tim Donohoe and Carol Clarke.

Connelly's role is to "deliver the Department's overall information strategy and integrating leadership across the NHS", according to the DH's website. That strategy, known as the National Programme for IT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Leo |url=http://www.cio.co.uk/news/3208249/chancellor-threatens-future-of-nhs-it-programme/ |title=Chancellor threatens future of NHS IT programme |publisher=Cio.co.uk |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is intended to do nothing less than revolutionise NHS information workflow and is costed at about £12.7bn. The success or otherwise of Connelly's reign will be based on her promise to end delays of electronic medical records. She has said that if there is not clear progress by November 2009, a new plan could be hatched.

On the eve of the departure of Fujitsu as an outsourcing partner, Connelly said in April 2009 that she would open up sourcing to competition at "acute" sights in the south of England and offer toolkits by March 2010 to allow more local configuration of systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intellectuk.org/blog/tag/christine-connelly/&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, MPs criticised DH for its confidentiality agreement with key supplier CSC and in March the department was admonished by the Information Commissioner for its records management. In May 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he was considering scrapping the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/software/2011/05/13/nhs-patient-records-project-faces-axe-says-cameron-39747397/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518131703/http://www.silicon.com/technology/software/2011/05/13/nhs-patient-records-project-faces-axe-says-cameron-39747397/ |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010-11 staffing cuts==
In response to Government spending reduction targets following the 2008-9 [[Financial crisis of 2007-2010|international financial crisis]] and subsequent [[Great Recession#In the United Kingdom|recession]], DH in common with several other Government Departments resorted to large-scale staffing reductions. In order to minimise redundancy costs, the predominant impact was upon DH staff not employed through a traditional civil service 'headcount' contract, with a resultantly emphasised effect upon more recent or innovative work-streams dependent upon seconded or externally hosted staff. This has attracted criticism from several of the professional and patient communities of interest concerned, for instance as regards the impact upon [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies]] (IAPT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2011/02/02/116215/civil-service-cuts-put-mental-health-strategy-at-risk.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710054821/http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2011/02/02/116215/civil-service-cuts-put-mental-health-strategy-at-risk.htm |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the withdrawal of the practical assistance available to the NHS and local authorities via the [[National Support Teams]].

==Devolution==

Most health policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved to the department's counterparts:
* the [[Scottish Government]] [[Health and Wellbeing Directorate]]
* the [[Welsh Government]]
* the [[Department of Health (Northern Ireland)|Department of Health]], [[Northern Ireland Executive]]

A number of health issues are, however, wholly or partly reserved to Westminster:

'''Scotland''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_14#sch5-pt2 |title=Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part II |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* regulation of the [[health profession]]s
* [[xenotransplantation]]
* [[embryology]], [[surrogacy]] and [[human genetics]]
* [[medicines]], medical supplies and [[poisons]]

'''Northern Ireland''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980047_en_12#sch3 |title=Northern Ireland Act 1998, Schedule 3 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=1998-06-25 |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[xenotransplantation]]
* [[surrogacy]]
* human [[fertilisation]] and [[embryology]]
* human [[genetics]]

In Northern Ireland, [[abortion]] law is a criminal justice matter and is devolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TheyWorkForYou |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-07-13d.286452.h&amp;s=abortion+speaker%3A10232#g286452.r0 |title=House of Commons, Written answers and statements |publisher=Theyworkforyou.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wales'''

Under the Welsh devolution settlement, specific policy areas are transferred to the [[Welsh Government]] rather than reserved to Westminster. As the distinction between Government and actual health services is seen as less pronounced than in England, the main source of information about current developments is the [[NHS Wales]] article.

{{Politics of the Isle of Man}}
The '''Department of Health and Social Care''' ({{lang-gv|Rheynn Slaynt as Kiarail y Theay}}) is the largest (by number of personnel and budget) of the seven departments of the [[Isle of Man Government]]. It was created on 1 April 2014 as a result of a merger of health and social care services from the former [[Department of Health (Isle of Man)|Department of Health]] and [[Department of Social Care (Isle of Man)|Department of Social Care]].  The intention to merge the two Departments was announced on 2 December 2013 as part of the [[Council of Ministers of the Isle of Man|Council of Ministers']] plans to modernize ministerial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/news/?altTemplate=ViewCategorisedNews&amp;id=19745 |title=Chief Minister announces move to smaller, stronger Government |publisher=Cabinet Office| accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The move was by and large a reversal of one element of the restructuring of the Isle of Man Government in April 2010 which saw the former [[Department of Health and Social Security (Isle of Man)|Department of Health and Social Security]] split to form the [[Department of Health (Isle of Man)|Department of Health]] and the [[Department of Social Care (Isle of Man)|Department of Social Care]].

'''Direct BS/MD''' Programs, also known as Combined BS/MD programs or Dual degree program, offered by specific [[universities]] and [[colleges]] across the [[United States|America]] that awards a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in Science (B.S.) and a [[Medical Degree]] (M.D.). Depending on the program, the student may earn a Bachelor's Degree in Arts (B.A.). These programs are highly competitive and are directed toward high school students who are interested in medicine. Some universities like [[Texila American University]] waive the [[MCAT]] exam for admission into the program's affiliated medical school while other program require a certain score on the MCAT. There are over 70 programs in the country that offer this type of admission for high school students.

'''Donald Hunter'''  [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]] (11 February 1898 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1978) was  a British [[physician]] and author of a classic text on [[occupational medicine]], ''The Diseases of Occupations''.

== Life and works ==
Hunter was born in the [[East End of London]]. His father was George Hunter, a deputy [[engineer]] in the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]]. He entered [[The London Hospital]] in 1915 but left in [[World War I]] to become a [[surgeon]] probationer RNVR in ''HMS Faulkner'' in the [[Dover]] Patrol. After the war, he returned to The London Hospital and qualified in 1920.

Following a series of house appointments, he became first assistant to [[Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn|Lord Dawson of Penn]] (1864–1945)  and then was appointed Assistant Physician to The London Hospital in 1927. He  completed his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1922 and [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]] in 1929.

Hunter became [[curator]] to the Medical School Museum in 1933, and during his 30 years in office collected specimens said to ‘represent almost all that is worth having in [[morbid anatomy]]’. He later became Director of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council’]]s Department for Research in Industrial Medicine at The London Hospital.  In 1925 he married Mathilda Bugnion, daughter of a [[Lutheran]] [[Pastor]] from [[Lausanne]], Switzerland. They had four children, two of whom became doctors.

In 1935 he gave a series of lectures to the [[Derby]] Medical Society on [[occupational diseases]]. These lectures were followed by other publications, often jointly with colleagues. These all culminated in his 1955 book ''The Diseases of Occupations'' which became a classic "as soon as it was published". It was said that he wrote all 1000 pages by getting up at 5 a.m. for 18 months. It has been criticized as "perhaps lacking in balance" and being "sometimes irrelevant" but "always entertaining and gaining immeasurably from its readability and its impact on the medical profession."

There followed a [[Penguin Books|Penguin Book]] ''Health in Industry'' published in 1959.  Hunter was founder [[Editor]] of the [[Occupational and Environmental Medicine|British Journal of Industrial Medicine]].

== Memorials==
Hunter's memory is preserved not only by his book but also by a Donald Hunter Room at the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. There is also a Donald Hunter House in London which provides accommodation for students.

'''Drug rehabilitation''' is the process of medical or [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] treatment for dependency on [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[Medical prescription|prescription drugs]], and [[street drugs]] such as [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]] or [[amphetamines]]. The general intent is to enable the patient to confront [[substance dependence]], if present, and cease [[substance abuse]] to avoid the [[psychological]], legal, financial, social, and physical consequences that can be caused, especially by extreme abuse. Treatment includes medication for depression or other disorders, [[counseling]] by experts and sharing of experience with other [[Addiction|addicts]].&lt;ref name="drugfree.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drugfree.org/learn/drug-and-alcohol-news/investigation-uncovers-fraud-by-california-rehab-clinics/|title=Investigation Uncovers Fraud by California Rehab Clinics - Partnership for Drug-Free Kids - Where Families Find Answers|work=Partnership for Drug-Free Kids - Where Families Find Answers|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological dependency==
Psychological dependency is addressed in many drug rehabilitation programs by attempting to teach the patient new methods of interacting in a drug-free environment. In particular, patients are generally encouraged, or possibly even required, to not associate with peers who still use the addictive substance. [[Twelve-step program]]s encourage addicts not only to stop using alcohol or other drugs, but to examine and change habits related to their [[Substance use disorder|addictions]]. Many programs emphasize that recovery is a permanent process without culmination. For legal drugs such as alcohol, complete abstention—rather than attempts at [[moderation]], which may lead to [[relapse]]—is also emphasized ("One is too many, and a thousand is never enough.") Whether moderation is achievable by those with a history of abuse remains a controversial point, but is generally considered unsustainable.&lt;ref name="losangelesconsumerattorney.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://losangelesconsumerattorney.com/fraudulent-health-care-and-private-insurance-claims-in-drug-and-alcohol-rehab-facilities/|title=Fraudulent Insurance Claims in Alcohol and Drug Rehab Centers|website=losangelesconsumerattorney.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of treatment==
The brain’s chemical structure is impacted by drugs of abuse and these changes are present long after an individual stops using. This change in brain structure increases the risk of relapse, making treatment an important part of the rehabilitation process.&lt;ref name="Principles of Effective Treatment"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abuse|first1=National Institute on Drug|title=Principles of Effective Treatment|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/principles-effective-treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of programs offer help in drug rehabilitation, including: [[Residential treatment center|residential treatment]] (in-patient/ out-patient), local [[support group]]s, extended care centers, recovery or [[sober house]]s, addiction counselling, mental health, and medical care. Some rehab centers offer age- and gender-specific programs.

In a survey of treatment providers from three separate institutions (the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, Rational Recovery Systems and the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors){{where|date=September 2012}} measuring the treatment provider's responses on the Spiritual Belief Scale (a scale measuring belief in the four spiritual characteristics [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] identified by Ernest Kurtz); the scores were found to [[Explained variance|explain]] 41% of the [[Analysis of variance|variance]] in the treatment provider's responses on the Addiction Belief Scale (a scale measuring adherence to the [[Disease model of addiction|disease model]] or the free-will model addiction).&lt;ref name="SCHALER1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaler |first=Jeffrey Alfred |title=Addiction Beliefs of Treatment Michael Vick Providers: Factors Explaining Variance |journal=Addiction Research &amp; Theory |volume=4 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=367–384 |doi=10.3109/16066359709002970 |issn=1476-7392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific research since 1970 shows that effective treatment addresses the multiple needs of the patient rather than treating addiction alone.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  In addition, medically assisted [[drug detoxification]] or [[alcohol detoxification]] alone is ineffective as a treatment for addiction.&lt;ref name="Principles of Effective Treatment"/&gt; The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends detoxification followed by both medication (where applicable) and [[Behaviour therapy|behavioral therapy]], followed by [[relapse prevention]].  According to NIDA, effective treatment must address medical and mental health services as well as follow-up options, such as community or family-based recovery support systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/TreatMeth.html/ NIDA InfoFacts: Treatments Approaches for Drug Addiction] National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Retrieved on 2010-08-17&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the methodology, patient motivation is an important factor in treatment success.

For individuals addicted to prescription drugs, treatments tend to be similar to those who are addicted to drugs affecting the same brain systems. Medication like [[methadone]] and [[buprenorphine]] can be used to treat addiction to prescription opiates, and behavioral therapies can be used to treat addiction to prescription stimulants, benzodiazepines, and other drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drugabuse.gov/PODAT/faqs2.html#faq15/ Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment] National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of behavioral therapy include:
* [[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]], which seeks to help patients to recognize, avoid and cope with situations in which they are most likely to relapse.
* Multidimensional [[family therapy]], which is designed to support recovery of the patient by improving family functioning.
* [[Motivational interviewing]], which is designed to increase patient motivation to change behavior and enter treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motivational Interviewing|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/co-occurring/topics/training/motivational.aspx|publisher=SAMHSA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213144535/http://www.samhsa.gov/co-occurring/topics/training/motivational.aspx|archivedate=13 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Motivational incentives, which uses [[positive reinforcement]] to encourage abstinence from the addictive substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Motivational incentives research in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network.|journal=Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Mid Atlantic Node | pmid=20307797 | doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2009.12.010|volume=38 Suppl 1|pmc=2866424|vauthors=Stitzer ML, Petry NM, Peirce J |pages=S61-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment can be a long process and the duration is dependent upon the patient’s needs and history of abuse.  Research has shown that most patients need at least 3 months of treatment and longer duration's are associated with better outcomes.&lt;ref name="Principles of Effective Treatment"/&gt;

===Medications===
Certain opioid medications such as [[methadone]] and more recently [[buprenorphine]] (In America, "[[Subutex]]" and "[[Suboxone]]") are widely used to treat addiction and dependence on other opioids such as heroin, [[morphine]] or [[oxycodone]]. [[Opioid replacement therapy|Methadone and buprenorphine are maintenance therapies]] intended to reduce cravings for opiates, thereby reducing [[illegal drug use]], and the risks associated with it, such as disease, arrest, [[incarceration]], and death, in line with the philosophy of [[harm reduction]]. Both drugs may be used as maintenance medications (taken for an indefinite period of time), or used as detoxification aids.&lt;ref name=NEPOD04&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mattick RP |author2=Digiusto E |author3=Doran CM |author4=O'Brien S |author5=Shanahan M |author6=Kimber J |author7=Henderson N |author8=Breen C |author9=Shearer J |author10=Gates J |author11=Shakeshaft A |author12=NEPOD Trial Investigators |title=National Evaluation of Pharmacotherapies for Opioid Dependence (NEPOD): Report of Results and Recommendations |publisher=National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, Sydney.

According to the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA), patients stabilized on adequate, sustained doses of methadone or buprenorphine can keep their jobs, avoid crime and violence, and reduce their exposure to HIV and [[Hepatitis C]] by stopping or reducing injection drug use and drug-related high risk [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]]. [[Naltrexone]] is a long-acting [[opioid antagonist]] with few side effects. It is usually prescribed in [[outpatient]] medical conditions.  Naltrexone blocks the euphoric effects of alcohol and opiates.  Naltrexone cuts relapse risk during the first 3 months by about 36%.&lt;ref name="NEPOD04" /&gt; However, it is far less effective in helping patients maintain abstinence or retaining them in the drug-treatment system (retention rates average 12% at 90 days for naltrexone, average 57% at 90 days for buprenorphine, average 61% at 90 days for methadone).&lt;ref name=NEPOD04/&gt;

[[Ibogaine]] is a [[hallucinogen]]ic drug promoted by certain fringe groups to interrupt both physical dependence and psychological craving to a broad range of drugs including narcotics, stimulants, alcohol, and nicotine. To date, there have never been any controlled studies showing it to be effective, and it is not accepted as a treatment by physicians, pharmacists, or addictionologist. There have also been several deaths related to ibogaine use, which causes [[tachycardia]] and [[long QT syndrome]]. The drug is an illegal Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, and the foreign facilities in which it is administered from tend to have little oversight, and range from motel rooms to one moderately-sized rehabilitation center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K.R. Alper |author2=H.S. Lotsof |author3=C.D. Kaplan |year=2008 |title=The Ibogaine Medical Subculture |journal=J.

A few antidepressants have been proven to be helpful in the context of smoking cessation/nicotine addiction, these medications include bupropion and nortriptyline.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Jared Wilson|title=Pharmacotherapy for Substance Use Disorders|journal=Medical Clinics of North America|date=July 2016|volume=100|issue=4|pages=891–910|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2016.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of nor-epinephrine and dopamine and has been FDA approved for smoking cessation, while nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant which has been used to aid in smoking cessation it has not been FDA approved for this indication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Acamprosate]], [[disulfiram]] and [[topiramate]] (a novel [[anticonvulsant]] [[sulphonated]] sugar) are also used to treat alcohol addiction. Acamprosate has shown effectiveness for patients with severe dependence, helping them to maintain abstinence for several weeks, even months.&lt;ref name="CLINICIAN SUPPORT MATERIALS"&gt;{{cite web|title=CLINICIAN SUPPORT MATERIALS|url=https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/CliniciansGuide2005/clinicians_guide18.htm|website=pubs.niaaa.nih.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disulfiram (also called Antabuse) produces a very unpleasant reaction when drinking alcohol that includes flushing, nausea and palpitations. It is more effective for patients with high motivation and some addicts use it only for high-risk situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drugabuse.gov/PODAT/Evidence.html#Pharm/ Pharmacotherapies] National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Retrieved on 2010-08-17&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who wish to continue drinking or may be likely to relapse, should not take disulfiram as it can result in the disulfiram-alcohol reaction mentioned previously, which is very serious and can even be fatal &lt;ref name="CLINICIAN SUPPORT MATERIALS"/&gt;

Nitrous oxide, also sometimes known as laughing gas, is a legally available gas used for purposes that include anesthesia during certain dental and surgical procedures, as well as food preparation and the fueling of rocket and racing engines. Substance abusers also sometimes use the gas as an inhalant. Like all other inhalants, it's popular because it provides consciousness-altering effects while allowing users to avoid some of the legal issues surrounding illicit or illegal drugs of abuse. Abuse of nitrogenous oxide can produce significant short-term and long-term damage to human health, including a form of oxygen starvation, called hypoxia, brain damage, and a serious vitamin B12 deficiency that can lead to nerve damage.

Although dangerous and addictive in its own right, nitrogenous oxide has been shown to be an effective treatment for a number of addictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daynes|first=G|author2=Gillman MA|title=Psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide prevents craving after withdrawal from alcohol, cannabis and tobacco|journal=Int J Neurosci|year=1994|volume=76|pages=13–16|doi=10.3109/00207459408985987|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillman MA|title=Analgesic nitrous oxide for addictive withdrawal|journal=S Afr Med J|year=1994|volume=84|pages=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South African Brain Research Institute|url=http://www.sabri.org.za/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential treatment===
In-patient residential treatment for alcohol abuse is usually quite expensive without proper insurance.  Most American programs follow a traditional 28–30 day program length.  The length  is based solely upon providers' experience. During the 1940's, clients stayed about one week to get over the physical changes, another week to understand the program, and another week or two to become stable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

These include, but are not limited to AA, NA, CA, Al-Anon&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One recent study suggests the importance of family participation in residential treatment patient retention, finding "increased program completion rate for those with a family member or significant other involved in a seven-day family program."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPherson|first=Carson|last2=Boyne|first2=Holly|last3=Willis|first3=Robert|date=2017|title=The Role of Family in Residential Treatment Patient Retention [pre-print]|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/5152|journal=International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=933–941|doi=10.1007/s11469-016-9712-0|issn=1557-1874|archive-url=|via=|ol-access=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental treatment===
''[[The Nature of Things]]'', a [[CBC Television]] program by [[David Suzuki]], explored an experimental drug treatment by Dr. [[Gabor Maté (physician)|Gabor Maté]] in which the substance [[Ayahuasca]] was used to treat addicts in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Jungle Prescription |series=The Nature of Things |serieslink=The Nature of Things |network=CBC-TV |airdate=10 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==
The definition of recovery remains divided and subjective in drug rehabilitation, as there are no set standards for measuring recovery. The Betty Ford Institute defined recovery as achieving complete abstinence as well as personal well-being&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naadac.org/assets/1959/betty_ford_recovery_definition.pdf|title="What is recovery? A working definition from the Betty Ford Institute"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies have considered "near abstinence" as a definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naadac.org/assets/1959/whitewl2012_recoveryremission_from_substance_abuse_disorders.pdf|title=Recovery/Remission from Substance Use Disorders|last=White|first=William L.|date=March 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide range of meanings has complicated the process of choosing rehabilitation programs.

==Criminal justice==
Drug rehabilitation is sometimes part of the [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]]. People convicted of minor drug offenses may be sentenced to rehabilitation instead of prison, and those convicted of [[driving while intoxicated]] are sometimes required to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. There are a great number of ways to address an alternative sentence in a drug possession or DUI case; increasingly, American courts are willing to explore outside-the-box methods for delivering this service.  There have been lawsuits filed, and won, regarding the requirement of attending Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step meetings as being inconsistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution, mandating separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Egelko | first = Bob | title = Appeals court says requirement to attend AA unconstitutional | date = 8 September 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-08 | publisher = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/08/BA99S1AKQ.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6FA63303852632AC8825734F0059D078/$file/0615474.pdf?openelement|title=United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, individuals can be court ordered to drug rehabilitation by the state through legislation like the [[Marchman Act]].

==Counseling==
Traditional addiction treatment is based primarily on counseling.

Counselors help individuals with identifying behaviors and problems related to their addiction. It can be done on an individual basis, but it's more common to find it in a group setting and can include crisis counseling, weekly or daily counseling, and drop-in counseling supports. Counselors are trained to develop recovery programs that help to reestablish healthy behaviors and provide coping strategies whenever a situation of risk happens. It's very common to see them also work with family members who are affected by the addictions of the individual, or in a community to prevent addiction and educate the public. Counselors should be able to recognize how addiction affects the whole person and those around him or her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos067.htm/ Counselors] United States Department of Labor. Retrieved on 2010-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
Counseling is also related to "Intervention"; a process in which the addict's family and loved ones request help from a professional to get an individual into drug treatment. This process begins with a professionals' first goal: breaking down denial of the person with the addiction. Denial implies lack of willingness from the patients or fear to confront the true nature of the addiction and to take any action to improve their lives, instead of continuing the destructive behavior. Once this has been achieved, the counselor coordinates with the addict's family to support them on getting the individual to drug rehabilitation immediately, with concern and care for this person. Otherwise, this person will be asked to leave and expect no support of any kind until going into drug rehabilitation or alcoholism treatment.  An intervention can also be conducted in the workplace environment with colleagues instead of family.

One approach with limited applicability is the [[Sober Coach]]. In this approach, the client is serviced by the provider(s) in his or her home and workplace – for any efficacy, around-the-clock – who functions much like a [[nanny]] to guide or control the patient's behavior.

=== Twelve-step programs ===
The [[disease model of addiction]] has long contended the maladaptive patterns of alcohol and substance use displays addicted individuals are the result of a lifelong disease that is biological in origin and exacerbated by environmental contingencies. This conceptualization renders the individual essentially powerless over his or her problematic behaviors and unable to remain sober by himself or herself, much as individuals with a terminal illness being unable to fight the disease by themselves without medication. Behavioral treatment, therefore, necessarily requires individuals to admit their addiction, renounce their former lifestyle, and seek a supportive social network who can help them remain sober. Such approaches are the quintessential features of [[Twelve-step programs]], originally published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alcoholics Anonymous |title=Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services |date=June 2001 |isbn=1-893007-16-2 |oclc=32014950 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches have met considerable amounts of criticism, coming from opponents who disapprove of the spiritual-religious orientation on both psychological&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bandura, A. |title=A sociocognitive analysis of substance abuse: An agentic perspective |journal=Psychological Science |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=214–7 |year=1999 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and legal&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ron (7 December 2006).

Different results have been reached for other drugs, with the twelve steps being less beneficial for addicts to illicit substances, and least beneficial to those addicted to the physiologically and psychologically addicting [[opioid]]s, for which [[opiate replacement therapy|maintenance therapies]] are the gold standard of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moos RH, Finney JW, Ouimette PC, Suchinsky RT |title=A comparative evaluation of substance abuse treatment: I.

=== SMART Recovery ===
[[SMART Recovery]] was founded by Joe Gerstein in 1994 by basing [[REBT]] as a foundation.

=== Client-centered approaches ===
In his influential book, ''Client-Centered Therapy'', in which he presented the [[Person-centered psychotherapy|client-centered approach]] to therapeutic change, psychologist [[Carl Rogers]] proposed there are three necessary and sufficient conditions for personal change: unconditional positive regard, accurate empathy, and genuineness. Rogers believed the presence of these three items, in the [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic relationship,]] could help an individual overcome any troublesome issue, including but not limited to [[alcohol abuse]]. To this end, a 1957 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ends EJ, Page CW |title=A study of three types of group psychotherapy with hospitalized male inebriates |journal=[[Q J Stud Alcohol]] |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=263–77 |date=June 1957 |pmid=13441877 }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the relative effectiveness of three different psychotherapies in treating alcoholics who had been committed to a state hospital for sixty days: a therapy based on [[two-factor learning theory]], [[Person-centered psychotherapy|client-centered therapy]], and [[psychoanalytic therapy]]. Though the authors expected the two-factor theory to be the most effective, it actually proved to be deleterious in the outcome. Surprisingly, client-centered therapy proved most effective. It has been argued, however, these findings may be attributable to the profound difference in therapist outlook between the two-factor and client-centered approaches, rather than to client-centered techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cartwright AK |title=Are different therapeutic perspectives important in the treatment of alcoholism? |journal=[[Br J Addict]] |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=347–61 |date=December 1981 |pmid=6947809 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1981.tb03232.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors note two-factor theory involves stark disapproval of the clients' "irrational behavior" (p.&amp;nbsp;350); this notably negative outlook could explain the results.

A variation of Rogers' approach has been developed in which clients are directly responsible for determining the goals and objectives of the treatment.  Known as Client-Directed Outcome-Informed therapy (CDOI), this approach has been utilized by several drug treatment programs, such as [[Arizona's Department of Health Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Division of Behavioral Health Services, ADHS/DBHS Best Practice Advisory Committee |title=Client Directed, Outcome-Informed Practice (CDOI) |url=http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/cdoi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychoanalysis ===
[[Psychoanalysis]], a psychotherapeutic approach to behavior change developed by [[Sigmund Freud]] and modified by his followers, has also offered an explanation of substance abuse. This orientation suggests the main cause of the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, and at the same time to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesized specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesized to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of teratogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophobia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hopper E |title=A psychoanalytical theory of 'drug addiction': unconscious fantasies of homosexuality, compulsions and masturbation within the context of teratogenic processes |journal=Int J Psychoanal |volume=76 |issue=Pt 6 |pages=1121–42 |date=December 1995 |pmid=8789164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of [[social cognitive theory]] to addiction—and indeed, to behavior in general—which holds human beings to regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.

=== Relapse prevention ===
An influential [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] approach to addiction recovery and therapy has been Alan Marlatt's (1985) Relapse Prevention approach.&lt;ref name="Marlatt 1985"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marlatt |first=G. Alan |chapter=Cognitive factors in the relapse process |title=Relapse prevention: maintenance strategies in the treatment of addictive behaviors |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-89862-009-0 |editor1-last=Gordon |editor1-first=Judith R. |editor2-last=Marlatt |editor2-first=G. Alan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marlatt describes four psycho-social processes relevant to the addiction and [[relapse]] processes: [[self-efficacy]], outcome expectancy, attributions of causality, and decision-making processes. Self-efficacy refers to one's ability to deal competently and effectively with high-risk, relapse-provoking situations. Outcome expectancy refer to an individual's expectations about the [[psychoactive]] effects of an addictive substance. Attributions of causality refer to an individual's pattern of beliefs that relapse to drug use is a result of internal, or rather external, transient causes (e.g., allowing oneself to make exceptions when faced with what are judged to be unusual circumstances). Finally, decision-making processes are implicated in the relapse process as well. Substance use is the result of multiple decisions whose collective effects result in a consumption of the intoxicant. Furthermore, Marlatt stresses some decisions—referred to as apparently irrelevant decisions—may seem inconsequential to relapse, but may actually have downstream implications that place the user in a high-risk situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/substance-abuse/drug-rehabilitation/cognitive-models-addiction-recovery|title=Cognitive Models of Addiction Recovery {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: As a result of heavy traffic, a recovering alcoholic may decide one afternoon to exit the highway and travel on side roads. This will result in the creation of a high-risk situation when he realizes he is inadvertently driving by his old favorite bar. If this individual is able to employ successful [[coping skill|coping strategies]], such as distracting himself from his cravings by turning on his favorite music, then he will avoid the relapse risk (PATH 1) and heighten his efficacy for future abstinence. If, however, he lacks coping mechanisms—for instance, he may begin ruminating on his cravings (PATH 2)—then his efficacy for abstinence will decrease, his expectations of positive outcomes will increase, and he may experience a lapse—an isolated return to substance intoxication. So doing results in what Marlatt refers to as the Abstinence Violation Effect, characterized by guilt for having gotten intoxicated and low efficacy for future abstinence in similar tempting situations. This is a dangerous pathway, Marlatt proposes, to full-blown relapse.

=== Cognitive therapy ===
An additional cognitively-based model of substance abuse recovery has been offered by [[Aaron Beck]], the father of [[cognitive therapy]] and championed in his 1993 book  ''Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Aaron T. |last1=Beck |first2=Fred D. |last2=Wright |first3=Cory F. |last3=Newman |first4=Bruce S. |last4=Liese |title=Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse |chapter=Ch 11: Focus on Beliefs |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSWUXLKeVZgC&amp;pg=PA169 |date=16 January 2001 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-659-2 |pages=169–186 |author-link=Aaron Beck }}&lt;/ref&gt; This therapy rests upon the assumption addicted individuals possess core beliefs, often not accessible to immediate consciousness (unless the patient is also depressed). These core beliefs, such as "I am undesirable," activate a system of addictive beliefs that result in imagined anticipatory benefits of substance use and, consequentially, craving. Once craving has been activated, permissive beliefs ("I can handle getting high just this one more time") are facilitated. Once a permissive set of beliefs have been activated, then the individual will activate drug-seeking and drug-ingesting behaviors. The cognitive therapist's job is to uncover this underlying system of beliefs, analyze it with the patient, and thereby demonstrate its dysfunctional. As with any cognitive-behavioral therapy, [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework assignments]] and behavioral exercises serve to solidify what is learned and discussed during treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addiction &amp; Alcohol Rehab, Alcohol Detox, Drug Rehabilitation in Peterborough, UK.|url=http://www.addictionrehabpeterborough.co.uk/|website=Addiction Rehab Peterborough|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotion regulation and mindfulness ===
A growing literature is demonstrating the importance of [[emotion regulation]] in the treatment of substance abuse. Considering that [[nicotine]] and other psychoactive substances such as [[cocaine]] activate similar psycho-pharmacological pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendelson JH, Sholar MB, Goletiani N, Siegel AJ, Mello NK |title=Effects of low- and high-nicotine cigarette smoking on mood states and the HPA axis in men |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=1751–63 |date=September 2005 |pmid=15870834 |pmc=1383570 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an emotion regulation approach may be applicable to a wide array of substance abuse. Proposed models of affect-driven tobacco use have focused on [[negative reinforcement]] as the primary driving force for addiction; according to such theories, tobacco is used because it helps one escape from the undesirable effects of [[nicotine withdrawal]] or other negative moods.&lt;ref name=Carmody07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carmody TP, Vieten C, Astin JA |title=Negative affect, emotional acceptance, and smoking cessation |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=499–508 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18303707 |doi=10.1080/02791072.2007.10399889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), is showing evidence that it is effective in treating substance abuse, including the treatment of [[Polysubstance dependence|poly-substance abuse]] and cigarette smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruiz |first=F.

==Behavioral models==
{{Main|Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training}}
Behavioral models make use of principles of functional analysis of drinking behavior. Behavior models exist for both working with the substance abuser ([[Community Reinforcement Approach]]) and their family ([[Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training]]). Both these models have had considerable research success for both efficacy and effectiveness. This model lays much emphasis on the use of problem-solving techniques as a means of helping the addict to overcome his/her addiction.

== Criticism ==
Despite ongoing efforts to combat addiction, there has been evidence of clinics billing patients for treatments that may not guarantee their recovery.&lt;ref name="drugfree.org"/&gt;  This is a major problem as there are numerous claims of fraud in drug rehabilitation centers, where these centers are billing insurance companies for under delivering much needed medical treatment while exhausting patients' insurance benefits.&lt;ref name="losangelesconsumerattorney.com"/&gt;  In California, there are movements and laws regarding this matter, particularly the California Insurance Fraud Prevention Act (IFPA) which declares it unlawful to unknowingly conduct such businesses.&lt;ref name="losangelesconsumerattorney.com" /&gt;

Under the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity Act, rehabilitation centers are able to bill insurance companies for substance abuse treatment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/megyn-kelly/florida-s-billion-dollar-drug-treatment-industry-plagued-overdoses-fraud-n773376|title=Fatal overdoses, fraud plague Florida's booming drug treatment industry|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With long wait lists in limited state-funded rehabilitation centers, controversial private centers rapidly emerged.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One popular model, known as the Florida Model for rehabilitation centers, is often criticized for fraudulent billing to insurance companies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under the guise of helping patients with opioid addiction, these centers would offer addicts free rent or up to $500 per month to stay in their "sober homes", then charge insurance companies as high as $5,000 to $10,000 per test for simple urine tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Little attention is paid to patients in terms of addiction intervention as these patients have often been known to continue drug use during their stay in these centers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since 2015, these centers have been under federal and state criminal investigation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  As of 2017 in California, there are only 16 investigators in the CA Department of Health Care Services investigating over 2,000 licensed rehab centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SFORZA|first1=TERI|last2=et al.|title=How some Southern California drug rehab centers exploit addiction|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2017/05/21/how-some-southern-california-drug-rehab-centers-exploit-addiction/|website=ocregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{medref|date=July 2014}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] can be classified into two types: [[ionizing radiation]] and [[non-ionizing radiation]], based on the capability of a single [[photon]] with more than 10&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] energy to ionize oxygen or break [[chemical bond]]s. [[Ultraviolet]] and higher frequencies, such as [[X-ray]]s or [[gamma ray]]s are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see ''[[radiation]]'' and ''[[radiation poisoning]]''. By far the most common health hazard of radiation is [[sunburn]], which causes over one million new skin cancers annually.&lt;ref name=Cleaver /&gt;

==Types of hazards==

===Electrical hazards===
Very strong radiation can induce current capable of delivering an electric shock to persons or animals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It can also overload and destroy electrical equipment. The induction of currents by oscillating magnetic fields is also the way in which solar storms disrupt the operation of electrical and electronic systems, causing damage to and even the explosion of power distribution transformers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/storms.html|title=Solar Storms and You: Human Impacts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; blackouts (as occurred in [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|1989]]), and interference with electromagnetic signals (''e.g.'' radio, TV, and telephone signals).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/podcasts/media/Blackout/Blackout_part4.htm Transcript of "Blackout: The Sun-Earth Connection", Part 4: When Solar Plasma Distorts Earth's Magnetic Field]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I don't have time to do research to find another, more stable reference, such as from a scientific journal or textbook, but these one from NASA cover the subject with, I think, adequate authority to justify the sentence. --&gt;

===Fire hazards===
Extremely high power electromagnetic radiation can cause electric currents strong enough to create sparks (electrical arcs) when an induced voltage exceeds the [[breakdown voltage]] of the surrounding medium (''e.g.'' air at 3.0 MV/m). These sparks can then ignite flammable materials or gases, possibly leading to an explosion.

This can be a particular hazard in the vicinity of [[explosives]] or [[pyrotechnics]], since an electrical overload might ignite them. This risk is commonly referred to as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) by the [[United States Navy]] (USN). [[United States Military Standard]] 464A (MIL-STD-464A) mandates assessment of HERO in a system, but USN document OD 30393 provides design principles and practices for controlling electromagnetic hazards to ordnance.&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|title= Acquisition Safety - Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Hazards|publisher= Naval Safety Center - United States Navy|accessdate= 2014-07-30|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140808041218/http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|archivedate= 2014-08-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the risk related to fueling is known as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Fuel (HERF). NAVSEA OP 3565 Vol. 1 could be used to evaluate HERF, which states a maximum power density of 0.09&amp;nbsp;W/m² for frequencies under 225&amp;nbsp;MHz (i.e. 4.2 meters for a 40&amp;nbsp;W emitter).&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen" /&gt;

===Biological hazards===
{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health#Non-thermal effects}}
The best understood biological effect of electromagnetic fields is to cause [[dielectric heating]]. For example, touching or standing around an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] while a high-power [[transmitter]] is in operation can cause severe burns. These are exactly the kind of burns that would be caused inside a [[microwave oven]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

This heating effect varies with the power and the [[frequency]] of the electromagnetic energy, as well as the distance to the source. A measure of the heating effect is the [[specific absorption rate]] or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The [[IEEE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | title = Standard for Safety Level with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3KHz to 300GHz  | journal = IEEE Std  | volume = C95.1-2005&lt;!--Should this be appended here?:" - IEEE"--&gt;  | issue =  | pages =  | publisher = IEEE  | date = October 2005  | url = https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/C95.1-2005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many national governments have established safety limits for exposure to various frequencies of electromagnetic energy based on [[Specific absorption rate|SAR]], mainly based on [http://www.icnirp.de ICNIRP] Guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection |title=Guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields (up to 300 GHz) |journal=Health Physics |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=494–522 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9525427 |url=http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113052702/http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which guard against thermal damage.

There are publications which support the existence of complex biological and neurological effects of weaker ''non-thermal'' electromagnetic fields (see [[Bioelectromagnetics]]), including weak ELF magnetic fields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Delgado JM, Leal J, Monteagudo JL, Gracia MG |title=Embryological changes induced by weak, extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=533–51 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7107514 |pmc=1167891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harland JD, Liburdy RP |title=Environmental magnetic fields inhibit the antiproliferative action of tamoxifen and melatonin in a human breast cancer cell line |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=555–62 |year=1997 |pmid=9383244 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1997)18:8&lt;555::AID-BEM4&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modulated RF and microwave fields.&lt;ref name="Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO 2006 885–90"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO |title=Mobile phone affects cerebral blood flow in humans |journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=885–90 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16495939 |doi=10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599|title=Microwave frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression|last=Pal|first=Martin|date=2016|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.jchemneu.2015.08.001|volume=75|journal=Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy|pages=43–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental mechanisms of the interaction between biological material and electromagnetic fields at non-thermal levels are not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Binhi|first= Vladimir N|others= Repiev, A &amp; Edelev, M (translators from Russian)|title= Magnetobiology: underlying physical problems |publisher= Academic Press|location= San Diego|year= 2002|pages= 1–16|isbn= 978-0-12-100071-4|oclc= 49700531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescent lighting==
[[Fluorescent light]] bulbs and tubes internally produce [[ultraviolet]] light. Normally this is converted to visible light by the [[phosphor]] film inside a protective coating. When the film is cracked by mishandling or faulty manufacturing then UV may escape at levels that could cause sunburn or even skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mironava|first=T. |author2=Hadjiargyrou, M. |author3=Simon, M. |author4=Rafailovich, M.

==EMR effects on the human body by frequency==
[[File:For Your Own Health (13942406865) (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Warning sign next to a transmitter with high field strengths]]

While the most acute exposures to harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation are immediately realized as burns, the health effects due to chronic or occupational exposure may not manifest effects for months or years.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Extremely-low frequency===
High-power, [[extremely low frequency|extremely-low-frequency]] RF with electric field levels in the low kV/m range are known to induce perceivable currents within the human body that create an annoying tingling sensation. These currents will typically flow to ground through a body contact surface such as the feet, or arc to ground where the body is well insulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/elf_ehc/en/index.html Extremely Low Frequency Fields Environmental Health Criteria Monograph No.238], chapter 5, page 121, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shortwave]] (1.6 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) [[diathermy]] heating of human tissue only heats tissues that are good electrical conductors, such as [[blood vessels]] and [[muscle]]. [[Adipose tissue]] (fat) receives little heating by induction fields because an electrical current is not actually going through the tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html ReBound shortwave diathermy (SWD)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130604/http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html |date=2014-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio frequency fields===
{{See also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
This designation of mobile phone signals as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) (e.g. its IARC, see below) has often been misinterpreted as indicating that of some measure of risk has been observed{{snd}} however the designation indicates only that the possibility could not be conclusively ruled out using the available data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cell phones, cancer, and children |author1=Boice JD Jr |author2=Tarone RE |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |year=2011 |volume=103 |issue=16 |pages=1211–3 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djr285 |pmid=21795667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)]] classified mobile phone radiation as [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]] "possibly carcinogenic" (''rather than'' [[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]] "probably carcinogenic" nor the "is carcinogenic" Group 1). That means that there "could be some risk" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.&lt;ref name="WHO_IARC_110531"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf |format= PDF|title= IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans |work=press release N° 208 |publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] concluded in 2014 that "A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/ |title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile phones - Fact sheet N°193 |publisher= World Health Organization |date=October 2014 |accessdate= 2 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euitt.upm.es/estaticos/catedra-coitt/web_salud_medioamb/Informes/informes_PDF/rf/HealthCanada/99ehd237.pdf Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields in the Frequency Range from 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz], Canada Safety Code 6, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millimeter waves===
Recent technology advances in the developments of [[millimeter wave scanner]]s for [[airport security]] and [[WiGig]] for [[personal area network]]s have opened the 60&amp;nbsp;GHz and above microwave band to SAR exposure regulations.  Previously, microwave applications in these bands were for point-to-point satellite communication with minimal human exposure. Radiation levels in the millimeter wavelength represent the high microwave band or close to Infrared wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieice.org/proceedings/EMC09/pdf/22S1-1.pdf Characterization of 60GHz Millimeter-Wave Focusing Beam for Living-Body Exposure Experiments, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Masaki KOUZAI et al., 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared===
[[Infrared]] wavelengths longer than 750&amp;nbsp;nm can produce changes in the lens of the eye. [[Glassblower's cataract]] is an example of a heat injury that damages the [[anterior lens]] capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for many hours a day.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
 
Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of [[arc welding]], infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does.  This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Visible light===
Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the [[retina]] of the eye, or even the [[skin]]. To control the risk of injury, various specifications &amp;ndash; for example ANSI Z136 in the US, and IEC 60825 internationally &amp;ndash; define "classes" of lasers depending on their power and wavelength.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Regulations prescribe required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles during operation (see [[laser safety]]).

As with its infrared and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary [[flash blindness]].  Some sources state that there is no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.&lt;ref name=TWI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/health-and-safety-faqs/faq-what-is-the-minimum-safe-distance-from-the-welding-arc-above-which-there-is-no-risk-of-eye-damage/ |title=What is the minimum safe distance from the welding arc above which there is no risk of eye damage? |publisher=The Welding Institute (TWI Global) |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultraviolet===
Short-term exposure to strong ultraviolet sunlight causes [[sunburn]] within hours of exposure.

Ultraviolet light, specifically [[UV-B]], has been shown to cause [[cataracts]] and there is some evidence that sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sliney DH |title=UV radiation ocular exposure dosimetry |journal=Doc Ophthalmol |volume=88 |issue=3–4 |pages=243–54 |year=1994 |pmid=7634993 |doi=10.1007/bf01203678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most UV light from the sun is filtered out by the atmosphere and consequently airline pilots often have high rates of cataracts because of the increased levels of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rafnsson | first = V |author2=Olafsdottir E |author3=Hrafnkelsson J |author4=Sasaki H |author5=Arnarsson A |author6=Jonasson F  | title = Cosmic radiation increases the risk of nuclear cataract in airline pilots: a population-based case-control study | journal = Arch Ophthalmol | volume = 123 | pages = 1102–5 | doi = 10.1001/archopht.123.8.1102 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16087845 | issue = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hypothesized that [[Ozone depletion|depletion of the ozone layer]] and a consequent increase in levels of UV light on the ground may increase future rates of cataracts.&lt;ref name="Dobson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R.| last1 = Dobson| title = Ozone depletion will bring big rise in number of cataracts| journal = BMJ| volume = 331| issue = 7528| pages = 1292–1295| year = 2005| pmid = | pmc = 1298891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7528.1292-d }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the lens filters UV light, so once that is removed via surgery, one may be able to see UV light.&lt;ref name=Komarnitsky&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.komar.org/faq/colorado-cataract-surgery-crystalens/ultra-violet-color-glow/ |title=Case study of ultraviolet vision after IOL removal for Cataract Surgery |author=Komarnitsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]] can lead to [[melanoma]] and other skin malignancies.&lt;ref name=Cleaver&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Cleaver JE, Mitchell DL |veditors=Bast RC, Kufe DW, Pollock RE | title = Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition = 5th | publisher = B.C.

In addition to sunlight, other sources include [[tanning beds]], and bright desk lights.  Damage is cumulative over one's lifetime, so that permanent effects may not be evident for some time after exposure.&lt;ref name=UVAware&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uvawareness.com/uv-info/uv-exposure.php |title=UV Exposure &amp; Your Health |publisher=UV Awareness |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Ultraviolet|actinic rays]]) can damage the [[corneal epithelium]].  This is most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude, and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from bright surfaces, such as snow, water, and sand.  UV generated by a [[welding]] arc can similarly cause damage to the cornea, known as "arc eye" or welding flash burn, a form of [[photokeratitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/799025-overview|publisher=Medscape|title=Ultraviolet keratitis|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EORTC Logo.png|thumb|EORTC Logo]]
The '''European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer''' ('''EORTC''') is an [[international]] [[non-profit organization]] with a scientific goal created in 1962 by [[Europe]]an [[cancer]] specialists. The organization’s head office is located in [[Brussels]]. Today, the co-ordination and analysis center includes over 150 staff members from many different nationalities. Since 1972, the [[National Cancer Institute]] has had a liaison office nearby to promote cooperation and coordination of cancer research in the United States and Europe.

== Mission, history, and background ==
EORTC’s mission is to promote, coordinate, analyze and publish clinical cancer research carried out by about 20 co-operating and multidisciplinary groups consisting of all types of cancer related specialists: [[radiotherapy|radiotherapists]], [[surgery|surgeons]], medical [[oncology|oncologists]], [[pathology|pathologists]], [[immunology|immunologists]], etc., to improve the treatment, and therefore the survival and [[quality of life]], of all cancer patients.

'''''European focus and a global partnership'''''

EORTC is the only organization which carries out clinical studies at European level for all types of cancer. These activities allow the compilation of data on a large number of patients, ensuring that valid and convincing [[statistics]] are made available as quickly as possible. The multidisciplinary expertise of EORTC makes the organization an ideal partner for other academic networks. Co-operative [[clinical trial]]s aiming rare tumors and frequent tumor sub-entities (identified by molecular changes) can therefore be carried out efficiently, ensuring the credibility of results and their rapid implementation. This partnership is not limited to European academic groups but also extends to both the American and Canadian National Cancer Institutes and several Australian networks.

'''''A rigorous and independent methodology'''''

The scientific design and analysis of each study is always carried out independently. EORTC also supports valuable co-operation between researchers, clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry to evaluate innovative molecules and shorten the period between the discovery of a new medication and its actual use.

== The EORTC in figures ==
* Over 300 universities or affiliated hospitals in over 30 countries
* 2,500 doctors
* Each year some 6,500 new patients enrolled in EORTC trials
* Over 10 years, 67,000 patients recruited in EORTC clinical studies

== 50 years of concrete and applied results ==
The EORTC has designed new benchmark treatments, in particular for: 
* Improving the survival of patients suffering from [[testicular cancer]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[leukemia]] (child or adult), [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumor]], [[brain tumor]], etc.
* Avoiding a [[laryngectomy]] for 42% of patients with [[larynx cancer]] 
* Carrying out [[Breast-conserving surgery|surgery which is less mutilating]] in the case of [[breast cancer]]
* Improving the [[quality of life]] for patients (ambulatory care, fertility preservation, etc.)
* Effectively controlling [[Opportunistic infection|infections]] for patients with [[leukemia]], etc.

== Funding for the EORTC ==

'''''EORTC Charitable Trust'''''

The EORTC Charitable Trust was created in 1976 to collect the necessary funds for EORTC to function with the cooperation of national cancer leagues involved in the fight against cancer (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Norway, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Sweden, etc.). [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] is the Honorary President and Sir Christopher Mallaby chairs the Board of Directors of the EORTC Charitable Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EORTC Charitable Trust|url=http://www.eortc.org/about-us/eortc-charitable-trust|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Transparent and diversified financing'''''

EORTC research is supported by the EORTC Charitable Trust, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States of America, Fonds Cancer (FOCA), and the Belgian National Lottery. The [[European Commission]] provides support only for selected projects. Partnerships with the [[pharmaceutical industry]] have been set up within the framework of special studies approved by an independent peer review committee. Nevertheless, more than 70% of clinical studies led by EORTC focus on [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] that have already been commercialized or on combined strategies such as [[radiotherapy]] and [[surgery]] and consequently these studies require financial support from other sources. Additional contributions and sponsorship are vital to cover these scientific activities where the main goal is to effectively promote European cancer clinical research.

'''Feminists for Life of America''' ('''FFL''') is a non-profit, [[pro-life feminism|pro-life feminist]], [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/ngo/pdf/INF_List.pdf "List of NGOs in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as of 18 September 2008"], [[UN Economic and Social Council]]&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1972, and now based in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], the organization describes itself as "shaped by the core [[Feminism|feminist]] values of [[justice]], non-discrimination, and non-violence".&lt;ref name="Living the Legacy of Pro-Life Feminism"&gt;{{cite web

Feminists for Life professes to "stand on more than two hundred years of [[pro-life feminism|pro-life feminist]] history", continuing a tradition of nineteenth-century [[American feminists]] such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].&lt;ref name="AmFemV12N1P5"&gt;''The American Feminist'' vol. 12 no. 1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been challenged by critics who question comparisons between 19th and 20th century views on abortion, as well as the attribution of certain quotations to Anthony.

==Origins==
Feminists for Life was founded by Pat Goltz and Cathy Callaghan in [[Ohio]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/human-life-review.htm |title=Feminists for Life on Campus |last1=Meehan |first1=Mary |date=Summer 2008 |work=Human Life Review |publisher=The Human Life Foundation |accessdate=Sep 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919181715/http://feministsforlife.org/news/human-life-review.htm |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goltz and Callaghan met in a [[judo]] club on the campus of [[Ohio State University]], where Callaghan was a [[Tenure (academic)|tenured]] professor of [[linguistics]]. In 1974, Goltz was expelled from the [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio, chapter of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) for arguing that abortion violated [[feminist]] principles,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N2TJQrViGEsC Dennis Doyle, "Catholic Social Teaching and Movements", ''The Church Emerging from Vatican&amp;nbsp;II: A Popular Approach to Contemporary Catholicism'' (1992), p.212.]&lt;/ref&gt; although she and Callaghan were not expelled from national NOW membership.

==Mission and purpose==
FFL describes itself as a non-sectarian, non-partisan, [[grassroots]] organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/who/joinus.htm FFL's mission, p.2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903004605/http://www.feministsforlife.org/who/joinus.htm |date=2005-09-03 }}, feministsforlife.org, accessed January 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and its members as believing in "the strength of women and the potential of every human life", refusing "to choose between women and children", believing that "no woman should be forced to choose between sacrificing her education and career plans and sacrificing her child", and as rejecting violence and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/who/aboutus.htm FFL's mission, p.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227055953/http://www.feministsforlife.org/who/aboutus.htm |date=2009-12-27 }}, feministsforlife.org, accessed January 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

FFL uses "pro-women" arguments in order to convince women that abortion is "immoral". Goltz argued that the legalization of abortion allowed sexually exploitative men to avoid responsibilities, like paying for child support, and run away from their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, M.

With respect to abortions allegedly required to save the life of the mother, FFL states that it "refuse[s] to choose between women and children".&lt;ref name=QA&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/Q&amp;A/Q3.htm FFL Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905141903/http://www.feministsforlife.org/Q%26A/Q3.htm |date=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FFL contends that doctors sometimes advise abortion because "they are unaware of other options, or because they are pressured by fear of [[Medical malpractice|malpractice]] suits". FFL argues that physicians "should treat both patients and do what they can to save both lives [because] [t]his is what was done before the [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' decision]] was handed down".&lt;ref name=QA /&gt; With respect to [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic pregnancies]] (which are not medically classified as abortion), FFL states that, "Since the child has no chance of survival, and the mother can survive if the pregnancy is ended, we must do what we can to save her. To let both die would not be pro-life."&lt;ref name="Pro Woman Answers"&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/taf/2005/PWA2005.pdf "Pro-Woman Answers to Pro-Choice Questions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919125626/http://feministsforlife.org/taf/2005/PWA2005.pdf |date=2010-09-19 }}, ''The American Feminist'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

FFL's pro-life positions have been criticized by some traditional feminists. [[Katha Pollitt]], columnist for ''[[The Nation]]'', argues that FFL seeks to make abortion illegal in all cases, including those of rape, incest, health, major fetal defects, and "even some abortions most doctors would say were necessary to save the woman's life".&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/feminists-fetal-life Katha Pollitt, "Feminists for (Fetal) Life"], ''The Nation'', Aug. 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Former FFL board member Sharon Long responded that, "FFL opposes the criminalization of women (as almost everyone in the pro-life movement does) and focuses our efforts on freeing women from abortion by addressing the issues reported by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] - and working along with pro-choice advocates to check off our task list".&lt;ref&gt;Long, Sharon.

Some commentators have criticized FFL for not promoting contraception. Katha Pollitt says that she asked Serrin Foster about it, and that Foster replied in part that [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the Pill]] did not work for teenagers, which Pollitt said was a belief she knew to be false.&lt;ref name=Pollitt/&gt; Foster has said that FFL members hold a wide range of beliefs about contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michel.

In 1994, Foster began to visit college campuses to deliver her speech "The Feminist Case ''Against'' Abortion".&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; FFL established a college outreach program in 1996.&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; The program provides information, excluding contraception but including the coercive factors that drive college women to choose between their education and bearing children.

For a college audience, FFL designed a promotional campaign that challenged [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]] advocacy and provided information for pregnant women, not including how to obtain an abortion. FFL members created several kits for student activists, a kit for residential advisers and psychological counselors, a feminist history kit for libraries, and challenging ads for college audiences, in addition to the resources available through FFL's website.&lt;ref&gt;"The Feminist Case ''Against'' Abortion" was included in the ''Women's Rights'' anthology of the ''Great Speeches in History'' book series (2001, {{ISBN|0-7377-0773-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the eight "Question Abortion" posters offered in 2000 touched upon political issues, one of these saying "No law can make the wrong choice right".&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; One poster used an image of Susan B. Anthony and an out-of-context quote of hers determined two years earlier by FFL historian Mary Krane Derr to be about [[Estate (law)|estate law]], not abortion.&lt;ref name=Derr1998/&gt; Other posters recast [[Pro-choice|choice]] as the "imperative to have an abortion", or implied that life was better before abortion rights, back when abortion was illegal.&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; FFl also has more controversial posters that verify their anti abortion stance even in the terms of rape or incest.&lt;ref name="NWSA" /&gt; FFL reports that its College Outreach Program has reached more than 5 million students since 1994, and that the rate of abortion among college-educated women has dropped by 30%.&lt;ref name=college&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministsforlife.org/cop/index.htm |title=College Outreach Program |accessdate= |work=Feminists for Life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902045659/http://www.feministsforlife.org/cop/index.htm |archivedate=2006-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of the college program is to get members of college campuses to help advocate for student parenting as a way to reduce the prevalence of abortion.&lt;ref name="NWSA" /&gt; This is an example of "common ground" advocacy. Both sides of the abortion issues are coming together in attempt to work together to find solutions for other issues relating to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Joffe, C. (1997). Abortion as single-issue politics. ''Society'', ''34''(5), 25-29.&lt;/ref&gt; "

In 1997 [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]]'s ''INsider'' called FFL's growing College Outreach Program the "newest and most challenging concept in anti-choice organizing" and predicted it could "have a profound impact" on college campuses.&lt;ref name=college /&gt;

FFL believes that there should be daycares on college campuses', dorm housing for women with children, and maternity coverage in health insurances.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;BAILEY, C. (2006). "Taking Back the Campus": Right-Wing Feminism as the "Middle Ground" ''Feminist Teacher,'' ''16''(3), 173-188. {{jstor|40535471}}&lt;/ref&gt; They blame Pro-Choice activists for failing to secure provisions that would help make motherhood an easier choice for women.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=="Women Deserve Better" campaign==
Feminists for Life's "Women Deserve Better" campaign was launched in 2003 on the 30th anniversary of ''Roe v. Wade''. FFL described it as "a long-term public education effort examining the failure of abortion. The campaign aims to refocus the nation on the reasons women feel pressured into abortion and to promote women-centered solutions".&lt;ref name=wdb&gt;Feminists for Life. Serrin M. Foster. [http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/wdb smf.htm "Women Deserve Better than Abortion"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic message of the campaign, featured on billboards, posters, and placards, was "Abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women. Women deserve better than abortion."&lt;ref name=wdb/&gt;

"Abortion is not a measure of society's success in meeting the needs of women", explained Foster, "it's a measure of its failure. Why celebrate failure? Abortion is a symptom of—never a solution to—the problems faced by women... abortion has completely failed as a social policy designed to aid women...women have had to settle for far less than they need and deserve".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/WDBSMF150.pdf "Women Deserve Better than Abortion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216002721/http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/WDBSMF150.pdf |date=2006-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Women Deserve Better" and the "Refuse to Choose" slogans reflected what FFL saw as integrated aspects of their philosophy. Foster explained: "We refuse to choose between women and children. We refuse to choose between sacrificing our education and career plans or sacrificing our children".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/Some%20Feminists%20Not%20Marching.htm "Some Feminists Won't Participate in 'March for Women's Lives'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902051148/http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/Some%20Feminists%20Not%20Marching.htm |date=2006-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major legislative goal of FFL's "Women Deserve Better" campaign was the passage of the [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Students Act]] by Congress. The Elizabeth Cady Stanton Act was first introduced into the [[United States Senate]] by [[Elizabeth Dole]] on November 8, 2005, and into the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by [[Melissa Hart (politician)|Melissa Hart]] the next day. The first Capitol Hill briefing on the legislation took place on February 15, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/ECS/index.htm Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908182454/http://www.feministsforlife.org/ECS/index.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was criticized by writer [[Emily Bazelon]] in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' as a "largely hollow 'message bill'".&lt;ref name=Bazelon&gt;[[Emily Bazelon|Bazelon, Emily]] (January–February 2007) [http://motherjones.com/politics/2007/01/suffragette-city "Suffragette City: Pro-life Feminists."] ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Politics, Current Affairs. Retrieved on January 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bazelon opined that the 10 million dollars provided by the bill would be "paltry" when spread nationwide.&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt; Bazelon quoted [[Frances Kissling]], leader of the [[pro-choice]] organization [[Catholics for Choice|Catholics for a Free Choice]], as calling the bill "not serious", and adding that "if we support these message bills that don't really give women much help, then the real message we send is that we're not strongly committed to women".&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt;

On July 12, 2010, Feminists for Life announced that the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Student Services Act had been incorporated as the basis of one of three components in the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]'s Pregnancy Assistance Fund.&lt;ref name="Feminists for Life"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Major Victory for Pregnant &amp; Parenting Students |url=http://feministsforlife.org/news/major-victory.htm |publisher=Feminists for Life |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919195817/http://feministsforlife.org/news/major-victory.htm |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] announced that "The Act appropriates $25 million for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2019 for the purpose of awarding competitive grants to States and Indian tribes or reservations.

A quote by suffragist and lecturer Mattie Brinkerhoff, from an 1869 letter to the editor of ''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]'', appears on the inside front cover of almost every issue of FFL's magazine, ''The American Feminist'': &lt;blockquote&gt;When a man steals to satisfy hunger, we may safely conclude that there is something wrong in society—so when a woman destroys the life of her [[unborn child]], it is an evidence that either by education or circumstances she has been greatly wronged".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]'', 4(9):138–9, September 2, 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

FFL cites the writings of Stanton, a likely practitioner of contraception to enable family planning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sisters: The Lives of America's Suffragists |last=Baker |first=Jean H. |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=0-8090-8703-0 |pages=106–107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tnXjui0T_qAC&amp;pg=PA106 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an opponent of the [[Comstock laws]] restricting education about contraception and abortion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America |last=Brodie |first=Janet Farrell |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location= |isbn=0-8014-8433-2 |pages=278–280 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wbeoi0rGvpkC&amp;pg=PA279 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who began her fight for women's rights about 12 years earlier than Anthony. Known for her radical stance on many divisive issues of the day, Stanton helped organize the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, in Seneca Falls, New York. Stanton wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let woman assert herself in all her native purity, dignity, and strength, and end this wholesale suffering and murder of helpless children.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cady Stanton, ''The Revolution'' 1(4):57–59, January 29, 1868&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

=== Early years ===
In the 1970s, FFL founders Pat Goltz and Cathy Callaghan met many other pro-life feminists who similarly were or felt excluded from women's organizations during the [[Women's Liberation]] Movement's second wave. In protest, Goltz and dozens of other pro-life feminists picketed the National NOW convention, hoping to draw attention to the controversy. The plan backfired when most media sources failed to pick up the story, and the few that did only mentioned that the pickets were by a pro-life group, failing to convey the full meaning of the protest.

Goltz later drew attention to what she saw as the growing trend of pro-life feminism and hostility against it from the feminist establishment. While testifying before a Congressional panel in 1975, Goltz stated, "The National Organization for Women suppresses any woman who is pro-life. It does not matter how sincere her feminism on the basic issues." (Senate Testimony, 1975)

The newsletter, ''Sisterlife'', was first published during Goltz's tenure as national president. Originally the ''Feminists for Life Journal'', the newsletter got its unique name from a letter to Goltz by a member of the Canadian chapter of FFL, who instead of closing her letter with the customary "In Sisterhood", wrote "In Sisterlife". Editors conferred the title on the newsletter, feeling that it reflected what they saw as a dedication to life from conception to natural death.

===Mid-1970s===
FFL was active in the ten-year battle to ratify the ill-fated [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). The organization's commitment to the ERA formed with the organization, during Goltz's presidency. Unlike Goltz, Callaghan was not immediately convinced of the need for the amendment, having achieved success as a professor at [[Ohio State University]]. Callaghan soon changed her mind, however, and began to support the amendment. In 1973, Goltz published an article (included in the anthology, ''Pro-Life Feminism: Yesterday and Today'') disparaging the fact that the widespread fear of abortion on demand had blocked the ratification of ERA in Ohio at the time, and that it would eventually kill the amendment's ratification.

Like many other feminist groups of the women's liberation movement, the personal experiences of members of FFL were what informed their drive for equality and social justice. Many pro-life feminists had experiences with [[pregnancy discrimination]], abortion, rape, [[child molestation]]. Their stories were published in various journals, newsletters, and other publications. Many of these stories were included in the anthology, ''Pro-Life Feminism: Different Voices''.

After five years as president of FFL, Goltz retired. In 1977, organizational management was moved to Wisconsin. The group's activities focused on being a presence at both pro-life and feminist events, distributing literature, and writing letters to various publications. A national workshop that became an annual conference for pro-life feminists was launched during this time. Many members supported both the Equal Rights Amendment and a [[Human Life Amendment]] as "complementary in their concern for human life".&lt;ref&gt;"Reflecting as FFL Celebrates Its Tenth Birthday" and "HLA ''and'' ERA—Inedible Alphabet Soup?" in ''Pro-Life Feminism: Different Voices,'' {{ISBN|0-919225-22-5}}, pp. 17, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

FFL's work for the Equal Rights Amendment was met with a great deal of resistance, including strong resistance at pro-E.R.A. demonstrations, when FFL members attempted to distribute Pro-Life/Pro-E.R.A. tracts. In the late 1970s, Goltz spoke with the legendary [[suffragist]] [[Alice Paul]], who authored the original Equal Rights Amendment. Paul conveyed to Goltz her belief that abortion was inconsistent with feminism, and that many of the founding mothers of feminism disapproved.&lt;ref&gt;[Feminist History: Voices of our Feminist Foremothers {{cite web |url=http://www.feministsforlife.org/history/foremoth.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518030706/http://www.feministsforlife.org/history/foremoth.htm |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}]&lt;/ref&gt; She also related her fear that the increased attempts to link abortion to [[Equal Rights Amendment|E.R.A.]] would prevent the amendment's ratification, and eventually end feminism as well.

===1980s===
In June 1984, at the annual FFL meeting in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], peace activist [[Rachel MacNair]] was elected president of FFL.&lt;ref name=Paynter2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitch.com/gyrobase/mind-field/Content?oid=2175415&amp;showFullText=true |last=Paynter |first=Ben |title=Mind Field – Rachel MacNair has come up with a theory to bring peace.

Under MacNair, FFL began to receive more national exposure through media interviews, involvement in a broad spectrum of pro-life issues, and invitations to speak at pro-life events. By 1989, FFL was quoting 19th-century feminists who were described as opposed to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Crisis |volume=7 |page=4 |title=Second Thoughts on Feminism |last=Novak |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Novak |publisher=Brownson Institute |quote=Feminists for Life, a group of women's advocates who oppose abortion, have unearthed quotations showing that many of the founders of the feminist movement had grave reservations about abortion.

Anthony List]] as a [[political action committee]] working against abortion through electing pro-life candidates.&lt;ref name=Kennedy1997&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Angela |title=Swimming against the tide: feminist dissent on the issue of abortion |year=1997 |publisher=Open Air |page=117 |isbn=1-85182-267-4 |quote=Rachel MacNair&amp;nbsp;...is the founder of the Susan B. Anthony List...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In June 1994, the organization relocated its national office to Washington, D. C., where FFL re-organized its structure, and updated its image: The ''Sisterlife'' newsletter was renamed as ''The American Feminist'' magazine, a website was created, and new outreach programs were developed, including the College Outreach Program. FFL also became more involved in political advocacy, working to ensure the passage of the [[Violence Against Women Act]], the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], and enhanced enforcement for child support. Child exclusion provisions in the Welfare Reform Act were opposed by FFL.

===2000s===
At the 2002 March for Life, which observes the anniversary of the Supreme Court's ''Roe v. Wade'' decision, several members of the [[Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians]] (PLAGAL) were arrested for attempting to march under the PLAGAL banner, on the orders of Nellie Gray, holder of the permit for the march. Foster came out publicly in support of PLAGAL, saying she also had had similar run-ins with Gray in the past.

===Feminists for Life International===

==== International outreach program ====
In 2004, FFL launched an International Outreach Program, reflecting that abortion is a global issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/international/index.htm FFL International index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903003728/http://www.feministsforlife.org/international/index.htm |date=2005-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FFL's "Global Vision":

::Feminists for Life advocates for
:::*increased education standards and opportunities for the poor, especially for girls
:::*increased employment opportunities for all women, especially poor women and others who have been excluded
:::*micro-loans and other business assistance for low-income women to start businesses and purchase land
:::*health care for mother and child, before and after birth, including pre-natal care, assisted delivery, post-partum care, emergency services, immunizations, disease prevention and treatment, especially for the HIV/AIDS pandemic
:::*sustainable development that provides clean water, sanitation, housing, and food
:::*child care for the working poor, and regulations to protect vulnerable women and children from forced labor
:::*protection for women and children from violence, including sex trafficking
:::*measures to rescue women trapped in domestic violence
:::: (''The American Feminist'' vol. 12 no. 1, p. 20)

"Abortion doesn't put food on the table, or provide clean water. After an abortion, a woman returns to the same situation that drove her there. One abortion is too many. It means we have failed women", argued FFL's international outreach director Marie Smith. "What women want and need is full participation as citizens, equal access to resources and opportunities, and enforced legal protection against discrimination, violence, and oppression... Education is the most empowering choice for any woman's future."&lt;ref&gt;''The American Feminist'' vol. 12 no. 1, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; FFL refers to early American feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who said, "There must be a remedy for such a crying evil as [abortion]. But where shall it be found, at least where begin, if not the complete enfranchisement and elevation of woman?"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]'', 1(10):146–7 March 12, 1868&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, FFL was granted [[Consultative Status|special consultative status]] as a [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Governmental Organization]] (NGO) by the [[United Nations]]' [[UN Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/PRUN2-05.htm "New Voice for Women and Children at United Nations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418090624/http://www.feministsforlife.org/news/PRUN2-05.htm |date=2005-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====FFL International====
Feminists for Life International is the international organization beyond its national groups Feminists for Life of America, and Feminists for Life of Ireland, which focuses on global violations of women's rights, particularly poverty, sex trafficking, domestic violence, and abortion.

The Spring-Summer Edition 2002 of "The American Feminist" was devoted to monitoring crimes against women around the world, including abortion, sex trafficking, bride burning, female genital mutilation, forced illiteracy, and sweatshop labor.&lt;ref name=Foster2002&gt;Foster, Serrin, ed. (Spring, Summer 2002) [http://www.feministsforlife.org/taf/2002/SpringSummer2002/SpringSummer2002.pdf "Crimes Against Women Around The World."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201604/http://www.feministsforlife.org/taf/2002/SpringSummer2002/SpringSummer2002.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} ''The American Feminist'', volume 9, number 1. Retrieved on January 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Three other editions of the organization's newsletter were specifically devoted to monitoring sex trafficking.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Feminists for Life International also supported the United Nations' [[Millennium Development Goals]] by publishing a statement saying, "Feminists for Life believes that the Millennium Development Goals are life-affirming targets that, if achieved, will greatly improve billions of lives around the globe. Women and children will be freed from lives of poverty, hunger, death, disease, and despair. We support the promotion of these goals and work to ensure that all members of society, including the unborn, benefit from their promotion and achievement." FFL's international director and UN representative Marie Smith cautioned, however, that "[w]omen's advocates must unite and direct our full attention to addressing the unmet needs of women - life-saving health care and nutrition, eliminating poverty through education and work opportunities, protecting women and children from violence and exploitation. Abortion is a sign that women's needs have not been met, and women deserve better."&lt;ref name=Smith2005/&gt; "While Feminists for Life was gratified that the concluding document of the Summit was not compromised by the insertion of 'sexual or reproductive rights' (code for abortion), we believe caution must be taken with language that was adopted into the document. The inclusion, 'Ensuring equal access to reproductive health', is problematic. While 'reproductive health' has never been defined by the members of the United Nations to include abortion, proponents of abortion often use a broad definition of this term that includes abortion as a part of fertility regulation."&lt;ref name=Smith2005/&gt; "Political word games do not serve women. Word games distract us and delay our efforts to help those in greatest need".&lt;ref name=Smith2005&gt;Smith, Marie (2005) [http://www.feministsforlife.org/international/MDG2005.htm ''United Nations Millennium Development Summit.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612082051/http://feministsforlife.org/international/MDG2005.htm |date=2007-06-12 }} Feminists for Life. Retrieved on January 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Smith published an editorial in 2005 in the ''Washington Times'' on the growing problem of sex trafficking of young Americans in the United States as a result of homelessness, child abuse, and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Times'', Editorial/Op-Ed. Marie Smith, [https://web.archive.org/web/20051211190258/http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20050428-095319-7893r.htm ''Homegrown sex trafficking'']. Archived webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

====FFL of Ireland====
Feminists for Life also had an international branch in Ireland, known as Feminists for Life of Ireland, now defunct. The group was once headed by [[Breda O'Brien]], who was profiled by ''The American Feminist'''s project "Herstory Worth Repeating".

Feminists for Life of Ireland worked with other groups such as Feminists Against Eugenics.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====FFL New Zealand (1978–1983)====
Founded in response to correspondence with American founder Goltz, Feminists for Life New Zealand (1978-1983) was founded by [[Connie Purdue]] (who also founded the New Zealand National Organization for Women) and romance writer [[Daphne Clair de Jong]], who, like their American counterparts Goltz and Callaghan, found themselves at odds with the feminist establishment's endorsement of abortion.

During this period, de Jong authored "Abortion and Feminism; the Great Inconsistency" and "The Feminist Sell-Out" for the ''[[New Zealand Listener]]''. The articles attacked pro-choice ideology as inconsistent with feminist principles, and as a pandering to a male system devised by men, for men. However, de Jong soon drifted away from the organization, disheartened at the increasingly social conservative membership and wholesale [[anti-feminist]] agenda of the organization.

Feminists for Life of New Zealand no longer exists. After 1984, it was known as "Women for Life". Although it began as a pro-life feminist organization, the organization gradually changed from a secular liberal organization to a Christian conservative pressure group, which reflected the increasingly socially conservative views of its late founder [[Connie Purdue]]. It then changed its name to the "Family Education Network", which published "Off the Fence" until it ceased publication in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22818">'''Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien''' ('''College of Physicians in Vienna''') is a [[medical society]] with a long-standing tradition in [[Austria]]. Its principal task is the continuing education of [[medical practitioner]]s. The society's headquarter is the [[Billrothhaus]] in the 9th district of [[Vienna]].

The organization's main task is the education of medics and the presentation of new scientific findings in the field of medicine. For this purpose, the Gesellschaft der Ärzte organizes scientific events, runs a [[library]] and publishes educational videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url     = http://billrothhaus.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=174| title   = Gesellschaft der Ärzte| accessdate = 2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's president is the radiologist [[Walter Hruby]].

== History ==

=== Early stages===
[[File:Franz Wirer.jpg|thumb|Franz Wirer]]

35 years prior to the foundation of the Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien, young physicians met to discuss relevant scientific information. These meetings were the basis for the society's formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last      = Isidor Fischer| series= Gesellschaft der Ärzte Wien| title      = Geschichte der Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien: 1837 - 1937| publisher     = Springer| date       = 1938| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ärztevereinigung'' (physician's club) was founded in 1802 by Johann Anton Heidmann (1775–1855). Its members subscribed to medical [[Academic journal|journal]]s then passed them on to other members. The scientific results where discussed during weekly meetings in the apartment of Dr. Heidmann and, after 1804, that of Dr. Malfatti. Other famous members of the club were Ludwig Freiherr von Türkheim, Franz Wirer and [[Johann Friedrich Osiander]]. This association published a yearly journal, the ''Gesundheitstaschenbuch'' (Health Manual).&lt;ref name="GDÄ-Geschichte"&gt;{{cite web| url     = http://www.billrothhaus.at/images/stories/downloads/Holczabek_GdAe.pdf| title   = Die Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien - location der Information und des Gedankenaustauschs| accessdate = 2013-10-08 | last   = Holczabek| first = Wilhelm| publisher    = Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien| pages  = 1–2| date= 2008-01-20| format  = pdf, 31kb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ärzteforum'' (physicians' forum) was founded in the early 1830s and had very renowned medics amongst its members, including Ignaz Rudolf Bischoff, university professor at the Josephinum in Vienna, Johann Hassinger, who later was deemed surgeon general, Heinrich Herzfelder, later the Chief Physician in the Israelite Hospital, Ludwig Wilhelm Mauthner von Mauthstein, founder of St. Anna children's hospital and the first professor of [[pediatrics]], as well as the practicing physician Rudolph von Vivenot.

=== Beginnings of the Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien ===
[[File:Wien Zentrum ed 2009 PD a 20091007 056.JPG|thumb|Assembly hall of the old University of Vienna: the first headquarter of the Gesellschaft der Ärzte – today it is the headquarter of the Academy of Sciences.]]
[[File:Theodor Billroth.jpg|thumb|Theodor Billroth]]

Franz Wirer and Ludwig Türkheim, who both were [[Rector (academia)|rector]]s at the [[University]], are considered "the founding fathers" of the organization; however, this was not possible until the [[privy councilor]] Andreas Joseph von Stifft, who was against the creation of the society, died. Their main goal by creating the Gesellschaft der Ärzte was to promote the health sciences as art and science, prior to the goals of the Ärztevereinigung. Additionally, they hoped to use it as a platform to formulate their response to the ongoing [[cholera epidemic]].

Over time, their objectives changed. In 1839, the society changed its focus to promoting [[drug science]]s. The foundation of the Royal Academy of Sciences ("Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften") in 1847 also helped to promote the medical sciences. While the theoretical subjects such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[anatomy]] and [[biology]] were discussed in the Academy and published in its journal "Denkschrift", the College of Physicians focused on pathology, experimental anatomy, medical chemistry and, in particular, [[clinical medicine]]. It is due to the influence of the academy and the college that the faculty of medicine broadened their limited scope beyond medical education and focused increasingly on science and research.

In 1837, the foundation of the society was finally officially approved. The charter members were of course Franz Wirer and Ludwig Turkheim, as well as Johann Malfatti, the general practitioners Gerhard Brants and Joseph von Vering, the director of the general hospital Franz Xaver Güntner, the professor of pathology and pharmacy Leopold Franz Hermann, the climatologist Rudolph von Vivenot, the president of the faculty Johann Nepomuk von Raimann and the professors of the Josephinic Academy Friedrich Jäger von Jaxtthal and Ignaz Rudolf Bischoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title   = Verhandlungen der k.k. Gesellschaft der Ärzte zu Wien.(Erster Band)| publisher  = Braumüller und Seidel| location     = Wien| date    = 1842/44| accessdate = 2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first president was Johann Malfatti, who was succeeded by Franz Wirer in 1841. The number of members was at first regulated to a maximum of 40 but raised over time (100 members in 1839, 200 members in 1859).

One of the goals of the society was to establish and nurture a library. Today, it has one of the largest private medical-scientific book collections in the world. The first librarian of the yet-to-be-built library, circa 1840, was the district physician Hermann Hieronymus Beer. The first significant contribution was made by the second president of the society, Franz Wirer, who bequeathed his private book collection to the Gesellschaft der Ärzte after his death.

All the scientific meetings of the society where documented and published in "Zeitschrift der k.k. Gesellschaft der Ärzte" and later in "Wiener klinische Wochenschrift".

Under the presidency of Franz Wirer, the members were divided into four sections: [[pharmacology]], [[pathology]], [[hygiene]] and [[therapy]]. The members were free to choose their affiliation. This compartmentalization led to an increased number of meetings, as many as 45 per year. After the disbanding of the sections, the frequency decreased to 25 to 35 meetings per year.

=== Second medical school ===
[[File:Rokitansky Carl.jpg|thumb|Rokitansky Carl]]

After Carl Rokitansky was elected president of the society, in 1850, the association focused increasingly on the natural sciences, leading to a new direction for medicine and to the dawning the new era of the Second Medical School (Zweite Wiener Medizinische Schule). The transition towards education is strictly linked to Carl Rokitansky, Joseph Skoda and Ferdindand Hebra. It marks the elevated status of medicine from the philosophic era to one in which scientific discoveries and clinical manifestations were correlated to pathological findings.

During [[World War I]], the frequency of scientific meetings decreased due to difficulties, and addressed mainly [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s, diseases and injuries caused by the war.

Under the [[National Socialist]] Regime a law was pushed through in 1938 which stated that any organization had to be led by national socialists. This law marked the abolition of the Gesellschaft der Ärzte. The commissarial conductor of this time was a member of the [[NSDAP]], Adolf Irtl. A few weeks later, the "Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft" (Viennese Medical Society) was founded, and Otto Planner-Plan was appointed as [[chairman]].&lt;ref name="Krankenanstalten" /&gt; It basically assumed all tasks from the College of Physicians, but, due to the war, meetings were rare.

=== After World War II ===
The end of [[World War II]] was equivalent to the abolition of the Wiener Medizinische Gesellschaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title   = Wiener Zeitung - Österreichisch-kaiserliche Wiener Zeitung| date    = 1948-08-17| language= de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold Arzt, the chairman of the university's dermatology clinic, began to rebuild the Gesellschaft der Ärzte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     =  Wiedmann| first = A.| title     = Die Wiedererrichtung der Gesellschaft der Ärzte zu Wien| location       = Wien| series= Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift| volume      = 58| date      = 1946| pages    = 13–14| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the property of the organization was lost during the war. The library had been moved to a barn in the very north of Austria to protect it from air raids. However, it was under threat from humidity and theft. The Billrothhaus also suffered damage from the war. Thanks to the members funds for both the repairs and the library retrieval were amassed.

The society was re-established and officially approved in April 1946. Wolfgang Denk was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;Amtsblatt der Stadt Wien. 27 February 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Springer publishing took over the publication of the "Wiener klinische Wochenschrift", which had been discontinued in 1945.&lt;ref name="KH" /&gt;

Karl Hermann Spitzy, who gained international renown for his work with penicillin, was president from 1982 to 1991. Franz Kainberger, who is leading the organization today, assumed the presidency after Karl Heinz Tragl, who served from 2007 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url    = http://www.billrothhaus.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=262&amp;func_com=1| title  = Neues Präsidium der Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien| accessdate= 2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and community medicine ==

=== Scientific meetings ===
The most important function of the College of Physicians is the organization of lectures and discussion forums which showcase important health topics and new scientific findings. In the immediate post-war years, the College focused on infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], [[typhus]], pest, [[Smallpox|pox]], [[erysipelas]], [[rabies]] but more than anything else, the cholera epidemic. Some of the members' important discoveries even made their way into hospital routine. Karl Eduard Hammerschmidt presented a [[sphygmometer]] in 1843, an innovative device to analyze the heartbeat and the arterial pulse. The section of pharmacology contributed to the creation of an Apothecaries Act for the Kaiserstaat Austria, to prevent [[materialist]]s and spice merchants from selling drugs.

Many lectures dealt with [[childbed fever]] which was dreaded due to its high mortality rate. Johann Klein played an important role in these discussions. The medical students under his supervision used to visit the obstetrics ward directly after leaving the [[autopsy]] site, without washing their hands. Klein had several arguments with [[Ignaz Semmelweis]], who attributed childbed fever to this behavior. In 1845 and 1848 the society's journal "Zeitschrift der k.k. Gesellschaft der Ärzte" published articles which encouraged all physicians to follow Semmelweis' recommendations. In 1850 Ignaz Semmelweis gave a lecture and reported his findings to the society's members.

To handle increasing demand of water in Vienna, the College of Physicians initiated the "Drei-Quellen-Projekt" (Three Springs Project), which made it possible to access water from surrounding springs. The project was officially introduced by [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I]] in 1873. As the percent of Vienna's population with clean water rose, there was a drastic decline in cholera cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last      = Drenning| first= A.| series= Magistrat der Stadt Wien, Abt. 31 - Wasserwerke| title      = Die I. Wiener Hochquellenwasserleitung - Anlass der 100-date-Feier| location        = Vienna| date       = 1973-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to infectious diseases, the post-WW II society focused on the progress in [[antibiotics]], [[radiotherapy]], [[surgery]] and [[cortison]]e for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.

Since 2000, the lectures have also addressed the study of medicine in Austria because the educational system came under fire.

=== Therapy ===
Following a discussion about [[quackery]], the medical profession was forced to become more rigorous in clinical practice. The College of Physicians is responsible for two prominent therapeutic progresses: one is the application of electric current in therapeutic measures, the other is the establishment of a laboratory for chemical analysis in the [[Vienna General Hospital]]. This laboratory opened the gate to a large number of scientific discoveries, such as the pathomechanism of [[diabetes]]. Florian Heller presented a reagent to measure the sugar level in urine, which was subsequently adopted into hospital routine. By 1874, the laboratory had become a state-of-the-art chemical analysis unit, and after 1889, through the influence of [[Ernst Freud]], advanced further, becoming an innovative research institute which developed techniques pertaining to blood coagulation, [[cell membrane]]s, gastric autodigestion, the effect of [[insulin]] and other biologic processes.&lt;ref name="KH"&gt;{{cite book| last   = Karl Heinz Tragl| title   = Geschichte der Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien seit 1838 - als Geschichte der Medizin in Wien| publisher  = Böhlau| ISBN    = 978-3-205-78512-5| date    = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, significant progress was also made in the areas of [[microbiology]] and surgery. [[Carl Koller]] discovered the anesthetic effect of [[cocaine]] and Ludwig Türck, who later became the first tenured professor of laryngology, invented a [[laryngoscope]] and marked the birth of endoscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     = Türck|first = Ludwig| title     = Der Kehlkopfrachenspiegel und die Methode seines Gebrauches| series = Zeitschrift der kaiserl. königl. Gesellschaft der Ärzte zu Wien| edition    = 26| date      = 1858| pages    = 401–409| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first endoscope was continuously refined, and in 1879, the Nietze-Leiter-cystoscope, which is used to examine the urinary bladder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     = Nitze| first = Max| title     = Eine neue Beobachtungs- und Unterschungsmethoder für Harnröhre, Harnblase und Rectum| series= Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift| edition = 29| date      = 1871| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; was presented in a meeting of the College of Physicians. Further modifications made the first esophago- and gastroscopy, by Carl Stoerk and Joseph Leiter, possible. Subsequently, Johann von Mikulicz perfected the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     = Stoerk| first = Carl| title     = Die Untersuchung des Oesophagus mit dem Kehlkopf- spiegel| series = Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift| edition = 31| date      = 1881| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     = Mikulicz-Radecki| first = Johann| title     = Über Gastroskopie und Ösophagoskopie| series= Centralblatt für Chirurgie| edition    = 43| date      = 1881| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; using it to make the first endoscopic diagnosis of gastric cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     = Seydl| first = Günther| title     = Geschichte der Gastroenteroskopie| publisher    = Literas Universitätspublisher| series= Wiens Rolle in der Geschichte der Gastroenterologie| date      = 2002| language= de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another project initiated by the college was the foundation of a hospital in Mariahilf - Vienna's sixth district. Although the construction was approved and initiated, it was halted by World War I.&lt;ref name="Krankenanstalten"&gt;{{cite book| last = Karl Heinz Tragl| title = Kronik der Wiener Krankenanstalten| publisher= Böhlau| location   = Wien| date  = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Koch discovered the [[tuberculosis]] pathogen, which led to enormous progress in the battle against this disease. The College of Physicians established a committee for prevention and therapy of tuberculosis and finally published a report with four crucial points: informing the population, reducing exposure to pathogens by improving equipment hygiene, preventing infection, establishing diagnostic and treatment methods through bacteriological tests, by isolating people exposed to tuberculosis, and providing work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| series= Gesellschaft der Ärzte| title      = Bericht über das 64. Gesellschaftsdate 1900-1901| location        = Vienna| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] wrote a letter to Franz Exner and informed him of his finding - the [[X-ray]]. This led to intensive research in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| series= Die Presse| title      = Eine sensationelle Entdeckung| location        = Vienna| date       = 1896-01-05| pages     = 1–2| accessdate    = 2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days later (even before Röntgen had a chance to present his findings in Würzburg), the College of Physicians presented the first radiograph of a shotgun injury. The first radiologic atlas was published by Josef Maria Eder and Eduard Valenta in February 1896.&lt;ref name="KH" /&gt; Even the first angiogram was produced in Vienna by Eduard Haschek and the idea to use X-rays in radiotherapy came from Leopold Freund, who very successfully treated a [[naevus]] with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     = Weiss| first = Konrad| title     = In memoriam Leopold Freund| publisher    = Springer| location       = Vienna| series= Wiener klinische Wochenschrift| edition    = 59| date      = 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
In 1901, the journal “Wiener klinische Wochenschrift” published an article by [[Karl Landsteiner]] entitled “Über Agglutinationserscheinungen normalen menschlichen Blutes”, which is seen as the foundation of grouping; this changed the picture in medicine completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last     = Landsteiner| first = Karl| title     = Ueber Agglutinationserscheinungen normalen menschlichen Blutes| location       = Vienna| series= Wiener klinische Wochenschrift| date      = 1901| language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the discovery of the AB0 blood group system, Landsteiner received the nobel prize in 1939.

[[File:Billrothhaus.jpg|thumb|Billrothhaus from outside]]

The meetings of the society initially took place in the consistory room at the old university. At this point it was not possible to establish a much needed library. Due to the growing audience, the society moved to the 4th floor of the Domkapitel at Stephansplatz in 1841, where a library and a reading room could be built. the group relocated many times again until 1855, when the government provided a gratis flat for them at Teinfaltstraße; this was the soviety's headquarter for the next forty years. The last relocation occurred on July 23, 1893, into a new building, Frankgasse 8, named after Theodor Billroth. Today, the Billrothhaus remains the headquarter of the College of Physicians, also housing the society's library.

=== Library ===
{{main|Billrothhaus#Library}}

The library was one of the primary goals of the association. Since its foundation, the collection has grown, through donations and swaps, as well as contributions by members. Today, the Billrothhaus library is one of the most precious book collections worldwide.

[[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] is a major public health concern and cause of death in many parts of Africa. Although the continent is home to about 15.2 percent of the world's population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/world_population.htm|title=World Population by continents and countries - Nations Online Project|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than two-thirds of the total infected worldwide – some 35 million people – were Africans, of whom 15 million have already died.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|last=Kwame and Gates|first=Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] alone accounted for an estimated 69 percent of all people living with HIV&lt;ref name="2012 Facts"&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/epidemiology/2012/gr2012/20121120_FactSheet_Global_en.pdf "Global Fact Sheet", Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS, 20 November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and 70 percent of all AIDS deaths in 2011.&lt;ref name="dUNAIDSi ck 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 | url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids//documents/epidemiology/2012/gr2012/20121120_UNAIDS_Global_Report_2012_with_annexes_en.pdf | accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa most affected, AIDS has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of 20 and 49 by about twenty years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of Africa is declining, largely as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of The Modern World|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries in [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]] have significantly lower prevalence rates, as their populations typically engage in fewer high-risk cultural patterns that have been implicated in the virus' spread in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title=UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic 2010 | url=http://www.unaids.org/globalreport/documents/20101123_GlobalReport_full_en.pdf | accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCTHIV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ams.ac.ir/AIM/NEWPUB/07/10/4/0012.htm | title=Religious and cultural traits in HIV/AIDS epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa | format=PDF | accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern Africa]] is the worst affected region on the continent. As of 2011, HIV has infected at least 10 percent of the population in [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[HIV/AIDS in Malawi|Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Prevalence of HIV, total (% of population ages 15-49) | url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, a number of initiatives have been launched in various parts of the continent to educate the public on HIV/AIDS. Among these are combination prevention programmes, considered to be the most effective initiative, such as the [[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]] campaign and the [[Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation]]'s outreach programs.&lt;ref name="DTHF"&gt;{{cite web | title=Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation: What we do | url=http://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/page/work | publisher=Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation | accessdate=27 May 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116014630/https://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/page/work/ | archivedate=16 January 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 special report issued by the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS), the number of HIV positive people in Africa receiving [[Management of HIV/AIDS|anti-retroviral]] treatment in 2012 was over seven times the number receiving treatment in 2005, "with nearly 1 million added in the last year alone".&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2013/may/20130521prupdateafrica|title=UNAIDS|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Special Report"&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/document/2013/05/20130521_Update_Africa.pdf "Special Report: How Africa Turned AIDS Around", Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} The number of AIDS-related deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 33 percent less than the number in 2005.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 | url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/epidemiology/2012/gr2012/20121120_UNAIDS_Global_Report_2012_with_annexes_en.pdf | accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of new HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 25 percent less than the number in 2001.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

In an article entitled "The Impact of HIV &amp; AIDS in Africa", the charitable organization [[AVERT]] wrote:
{{quotation
|HIV ... has caused immense human suffering in the continent. The most obvious effect ... has been illness and death, but the impact ... has ... not been confined to the health sector; households, schools, workplaces and economies have also been badly affected. ...
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In sub-Saharan Africa, people with HIV-related diseases occupy more than half of all hospital beds. ... [L]arge numbers of healthcare professionals are being directly affected.... Botswana, for example, lost 17% of its healthcare workforce due to AIDS between 1999 and 2005.
 ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The toll of HIV and AIDS on households can be very severe. ... [I]t is often the poorest sectors of society that are most vulnerable.... In many cases, ... AIDS causes the household to dissolve, as parents die and children are sent to relatives for care and upbringing. ... Much happens before this dissolution takes place: AIDS strips families of their assets and income earners, further impoverishing the poor. ... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ... epidemic adds to food insecurity in many areas, as agricultural work is neglected or abandoned due to household illness. ... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost invariably, the burden of coping rests with women. Upon a family member becoming ill, the role of women as carers, income-earners and housekeepers is stepped up. They are often forced to step into roles outside their homes as well. ... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Older people are also heavily affected by the epidemic; many have to care for their sick children and are often left to look after orphaned grandchildren. ... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hard to overemphasise the trauma and hardship that children ... are forced to bear. ... As parents and family members become ill, children take on more responsibility to earn an income, produce food, and care for family members. ... [M]ore children have been orphaned by AIDS in Africa than anywhere else. Many children are now raised by their extended families and some are even left on their own in child-headed households. ... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIV and AIDS are having a devastating effect on the already inadequate supply of teachers in African countries.... The illness or death of teachers is especially devastating in rural areas where schools depend heavily on one or two teachers. ... [I]n Tanzania[,] for example[,] ... in 2006 it was estimated that around 45,000 additional teachers were needed to make up for those who had died or left work because of HIV.... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIDS damages businesses by squeezing productivity, adding costs, diverting productive resources, and depleting skills. ... Also, as the impact of the epidemic on households grows more severe, market demand for products and services can fall. ... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS is erasing decades of progress in extending life expectancy. ... The biggest increase in deaths ... has been among adults aged between 20 and 49 years. This group now accounts for 60% of all deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.... AIDS is hitting adults in their most economically productive years and removing the very people who could be responding to the crisis. ... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As access to treatment is slowly expanded throughout the continent, millions of lives are being extended and hope is being given to people who previously had none. Unfortunately though, the majority of people in need of treatment are still not receiving it, and campaigns to prevent new infections ... are lacking in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/aids-impact-africa.htm|title=Impact of HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins of HIV/AIDS in Africa==
{{main|Origin of AIDS}}
[[File:HIV-1 subtype prevalence in 2002.png|400px|thumb|right|Historical prevalence of [[Subtypes of HIV|HIV-1 subtypes]] (2002).]]

The earliest known cases of human HIV infection have been linked to western equatorial Africa, probably in southeast [[Cameroon]] where groups of the [[central chimpanzee|central common chimpanzee]] live. "Phylogenetic analyses ... revealed that all [[HIV-1]] strains known to infect humans, including HIV-1 groups M, N, and O, were closely related to just one of these SIVcpz lineages: that found in P. t. troglodytes [Pan troglodytes troglodytes i.e. the central chimpanzee]." The disease is associated with the preparation for human consumption of flesh from freshly killed chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prn.org/index.php/progression/article/origin_of_the_aids_pandemic_58|title=Origin of the AIDS Pandemic|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/26/aids.topstories3|title=Hunt for origin of HIV pandemic ends at chimpanzee colony in Cameroon|author=Ian Sample|work=the Guardian|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current hypotheses also include that, once the virus jumped from chimpanzees or other apes to humans, the colonial medical practices of the 20th century helped HIV become established in human populations by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5450391 | title=Origin of AIDS Linked to Colonial Practices in Africa | publisher=NPR | accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus likely moved from primates to humans when hunters came into contact with the blood of infected primates. The hunters then became infected with HIV and passed on the disease to other humans through bodily fluid contamination. This theory is known as the "Bushmeat theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharp P. M. |author2=Bailes E. |author3=Chaudhuri R. R. |author4=Rodenburg C. M. |author5=Santiago M.

HIV made the leap from rural isolation to rapid urban transmission as a result of urbanization that occurred during the 20th century. There are many reasons for which there is such prevalence of AIDS in Africa. One of the most formative explanations is the poverty that dramatically impacts the daily lives of Africans. The book, Ethics and AIDS in Africa: A Challenge to Our Thinking, describes how "Poverty has accompanying side-effects, such as prostitution (i.e. the need to sell sex for survival), poor living conditions, education, health and health care, that are major contributing factors to the current spread of HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name="Van Niekerk A. 2005"&gt;A., Van Niekerk A., and Loretta M. Kopelman. Ethics &amp; AIDS in Africa: The Challenge to Our Thinking. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers believe HIV was gradually spread by river travel. All the rivers in Cameroon run into the [[Sangha River]], which joins the [[Congo River]] running past [[Kinshasa]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Trade along the rivers could have spread the virus, which built up slowly in the human population. By the 1960s, about 2,000 people in Africa may have had HIV,&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt; including people in Kinshasa whose tissue samples from 1959 and 1960 have been preserved and studied retrospectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snhs-plin.barry.edu/bioinfromatics/Worobey_HIV_diversity_nature07390_2008.pdf "Letter: Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960", ''Nature'', authored by Michael Worobey, Marlea Gemmel, Dirk E. Teuwen, Tamara Haselkorn, Kevin Kunstman, Michael Bunce, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, Jean-Marie M. Kabongo, Raphael M. Kalengay, Eric Van Marck, M. Thomas P. Gilbert, and Steven M. Wolinsky, 2 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The first epidemic of HIV/AIDS is believed to have occurred in Kinshasa in the 1970s, signalled by a surge in opportunistic infections such as [[cryptococcal meningitis]], [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/history-aids-africa.htm|title=History of HIV &amp; AIDS in Africa|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/58/3/273.long|title=The historical question of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in the 1960s in the Congo River basin area in relation to cryptococcal          meningitis.|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a fatal disease caused by the slow-acting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The virus multiplies in the body until it causes immune system damage, leading to diseases of the AIDS syndrome. HIV emerged in Africa in the 1960s and traveled to the United States and Europe the following decade. In the 1980s it spread silently across the globe until it became a pandemic, or widespread. Some areas of the world were already significantly impacted by AIDS, while in others the epidemic was just beginning. The virus is transmitted by bodily fluid contact including the exchange of sexual fluids, by blood, from mother to child in the womb, and during delivery or breastfeeding. AIDS first was identified in the United States and France in 1981, principally among homosexual men. Then in 1982 and 1983, heterosexual Africans also were diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the late 1980s, international development agencies regarded AIDS control as a technical medical problem rather than one involving all areas of economic and social life. Because public health authorities perceived AIDS to be an urban phenomenon associated with prostitution, they believed that the majority of Africans who lived in "traditional" rural areas would be spared. They believed that the heterosexual epidemic could be contained by focusing prevention efforts on persuading the so-called core transmitters—people such as sex workers and truck drivers, known to have multiple sex partners—to use condoms. These factors retarded prevention campaigns in many countries for more than a decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although many governments in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] denied that there was a problem for years, they have now begun to work toward solutions.

AIDS was at first considered a disease of gay men and drug addicts, but in Africa it took off among the general population. As a result, those involved in the fight against HIV began to emphasize aspects such as preventing transmission from mother to child, or the relationship between HIV and poverty, inequality of the sexes, and so on, rather than emphasizing the need to prevent transmission by unsafe sexual practices or drug injection. This change in emphasis resulted in more funding, but was not effective in preventing a drastic rise in HIV prevalence.&lt;ref name=HIV_Today&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Elizabeth Pisani]]|title=HIV Today|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=Sep 3, 2011|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128286.100-instant-expert-hiv-today.html?full=true}}, pp. iv-v.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global response to HIV and AIDS has improved considerably in recent years. Funding comes from many sources, the largest of which are the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Timeline of AIDS|url=http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/aids-timeline/|work=AIDS.gov|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS), the number of HIV positive people in Africa receiving [[Management of HIV/AIDS|anti-retroviral treatment]] rose from 1 million to 7.1 million between 2005 and 2012, an 805% increase. Almost 1 million of those patients were treated in 2012.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Special Report"/&gt; The number of HIV positive people in [[South Africa]] who received such treatment in 2011 was 75.2 percent higher than the number in 2009.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

Additionally, the number of AIDS-related deaths in 2011 in both Africa as a whole and Sub-Saharan Africa alone was 32 percent less than the number in 2005.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Special Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt; The number of new HIV infections in Africa in 2011 was also 33 percent less than the number in 2001, with a "24% reduction in new infections among children from 2009 to 2011".&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Special Report"/&gt; In Sub-Saharan Africa, new HIV positive cases over the same period declined by 25%.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt; According to UNAIDS, these successes have resulted from "strong leadership and shared responsibility in Africa and among the global community".&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Press Release"/&gt;

===Public education initiatives===

Numerous public education initiatives have been launched to curb the spread of HIV in Africa.

===The role of stigma===
{{tone|section|date=April 2015}}
HIV and AIDS has attracted a stigmatization that is overwhelming. This is due to many factors such as a lack of understanding of the disease, lack of access to treatment, the media, knowing that AIDS is incurable, and prejudices brought on by a cultures beliefs.&lt;ref name="biomedcentral.com|accessdate=2015-04-25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=Monika ML dos|last2=Kruger|first2=Pieter|last3=Mellors|first3=Shaun E.|last4=Wolvaardt|first4=Gustaaf|last5=Ryst|first5=Elna van der|title=An exploratory survey measuring stigma and discrimination experienced by people living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa: the People Living with HIV Stigma Index|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014-01-27|volume=14|issue=1|pages=80|pmid=24461042|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com|accessdate=2015-04-25|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-80|pmc=3909177}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When HIV/AIDS became a global disease, African leaders played ostrich and said that it was a gay disease found only in the West and Africans did not have to worry because there were no gays and lesbians in Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bongmba|first1=Elias Kifon|title=Facing a pandemic: the African church and the crisis of HIV/AIDS|date=2007|publisher=Baylor University Press|location=Waco, Tex.|isbn=978-1-932792-82-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africans were blind to the already huge epidemic that was infesting their communities. The belief that only homosexuals could contract the diseases was later debunked as the number of heterosexual couples living with HIV increased. Unfortunately there were other rumors being spread by elders in Cameroon. These "elders speculated that HIV/AIDS was a sexually transmitted disease passed on from Fulani women only to non-Fulani men who had sexual contact with them. They also claimed if a man was infected as a result of having sexual contact with a Fulani woman, only a Fulani healer could treat him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bongmba|first1=Elias Kifon|title=Facing a pandemic: the African church and the crisis of HIV/AIDS|date=2007|publisher=Baylor University Press|location=Waco, Tex.|isbn=978-1-932792-82-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This communal belief is shared by many other African cultures who believe that HIV and AIDS originated from women. Because of this belief that men can only get HIV from women many "women are not free to speak of their HIV status to their partners for fear of violence".&lt;ref name="biomedcentral.com|accessdate=2015-04-25"/&gt;  In general HIV carries a negative stigma in Sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately This stigma makes it very challenging for Sub-Saharan Africans to share that they have HIV because they are afraid of being an outcast from their friends and family. In every Sub-Saharan community HIV is seen as the bringer of death. The common belief is that once you have HIV you are destined to die. People seclude themselves based on these beliefs. They don't tell their family and live with guilt and fear because of HIV. However, there is a way to treat HIV and AIDs the problem is that many are just not aware of how HIV is spread or what effects it has on the body. "80.8% of participants would not sleep in the same room as someone who was HIV positive, while 94.5% would not talk to someone who was HIV positive".&lt;ref name="biomedcentral.com|accessdate=2015-04-25"/&gt;

Social stigma plays a significant role in the state of HIV and AIDS infection in Africa. "In a normatively HIV/AIDS-stigmatizing Sub Saharan African communities, this suspicion of one's status by others is also applicable to individuals who are not HIV positive, but who may wish to utilize healthcare services for preventative purposes. This group of individuals under fear of suspicion may avoid being mistakingly identified as stigmatized by simply avoiding HARHS utilization." (151)&lt;ref name="Van Niekerk A. 2005"/&gt;

"At the individual level, persons living with HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa likely want to conceal their stigmatized identities whenever possible in order to gain these rewards associated with having a 'normal' identity. The rewards of being considered normal' in the context of high-HIV-prevalence Sub-Saharan Africa are varied and great... such rewards for which there is empirical support in this context include perceived sexual freedom, avoidance of discrimination, avoidance of community or family rejection, avoidance of losing one's job or residence, and avoidance of losing one's sexual partners. Other potential rewards of being considered normal include avoidance of being associated with promiscuity or prostitution, avoidance of emotional, social and physical isolation and avoidance of being blamed for others' illness" (150).&lt;ref name="Van Niekerk A. 2005"/&gt;

====Combination prevention programmes====

The [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] defines combination prevention programmes as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;rights-based, evidence-informed, and community-owned programmes that use a mix of biomedical, behavioural, and structural interventions, prioritised to meet the current HIV prevention needs of particular individuals and communities, so as to have the greatest sustained impact on reducing new infections. Well-designed ... programmes are carefully tailored to national and local needs and conditions; focus resources on the mix of programmatic and policy actions required to address both immediate risks and underlying vulnerability; and ... are thoughtfully planned and managed to operate synergistically and consistently on multiple levels (e.g. individual, relationship, community, society) and over an adequate period of time. ... Using different prevention strategies in combination is not a new idea. ... [C]ombination approaches have been used effectively to generate sharp, sustained reductions in new HIV infections in diverse settings. Combination prevention reflects common sense, yet it is striking how seldom the approach has been put into practice. ... Prevention efforts to date have overwhelmingly focused on reducing individual risk, with fewer efforts made to address societal factors that increase vulnerability to HIV. ... UNAIDS' combination prevention framework puts structural interventions—including programmes to promote human rights, to remove punitive laws that block the AIDS response, and to combat gender inequality and HIV related stigma and discrimination—at the centre of the HIV prevention agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/20111110_JC2007_Combination_Prevention_paper_en.pdf "Combination HIV Prevention: Tailoring and Coordinating Biomedical, Behavioural and Structural Strategies to Reduce New HIV Infections", Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2010, pages 8-10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"It is the consensus in the HIV scientific community that [[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]] [(ABC)] principles are vital guides for public health intervention, but are better bundled with biomedical prevention approaches; lone behavioral change approaches are not likely to stop the global pandemic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Combination Prevention: New Hope for Stopping the Epidemic|publisher=|pmc=3642362 | pmid=23456730|doi=10.1007/s11904-013-0155-y|volume=10|year=2013|journal=Curr HIV/AIDS Rep|pages=169–86|author=Vermund SH, Hayes RJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uganda]] has replaced its ABC strategy with a combination prevention programme because of an increase in the annual HIV infection rate. Most new infections were coming from people in long-term relationships who had multiple sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/uganda-hiv-prevention-no-longer-just-abc/1383791.html|title=In Uganda, HIV Prevention No Longer Just ABC|work=VOA|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom====

The [[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]] (ABC) strategy to prevent HIV infection promotes safer sexual behavior and emphasizes the need for fidelity, fewer sexual partners, and a later age of sexual debut. The implementation of ABC differs among those who use it. For example, the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] has focused more on abstinence and fidelity than condoms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/pepfar.htm|title=Funding for HIV and AIDS|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Uganda]] has had a more balanced approach to the three elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm|title=HIV Prevention Programmes|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of ABC is controversial. At the [[XVI International AIDS Conference, 2006|16th International AIDS Conference]] in 2006, African countries gave the strategy mixed reviews. In [[Botswana]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;[M]uch of the ABC message was getting through, but ... it was not making much of a difference. ... A program called Total Community Mobilization sent 450 AIDS counselors door-to-door, giving prevention advice, urging HIV testing and referring infected people to treatment. ... People who had talked to the counselors were twice as likely to mention abstinence and three times as likely to mention condom use when asked to describe ways to avoid infection. However, they were no more likely than the uncounseled to mention being faithful as a good strategy. The people who had been counseled were also twice as likely to have been tested for HIV in the previous year, and to have discussed that possibility with a sex partner. However, they were just as likely to have a partner outside marriage as the people who had not gotten a visit from a counselor, and they were no more likely to be using a condom in those liaisons.&lt;ref name="Mixed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081401458.html|title=Africa Gives 'ABC' Mixed Grades|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Nigeria]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a somewhat different result in a study of young Nigerians, ages 15 to 24, most unmarried, living in the city and working in semiskilled jobs. People in specific neighborhoods were counseled with an ABC message as part of a seven-year project funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] and its British counterpart. ... The uncounseled group showed no increase in condom use—it stayed about 55 percent. In the counseled group, however, condom use by women in their last nonmarital sexual encounter rose from 54 percent to 69 percent. For men, it rose from 64 percent to 75 percent. Stigmatizing attitudes appeared to be less common among the counseled group. ... But ... "We did not see a reduction in the number of partners," said Godpower Omoregie, the researcher from Abuja who presented the findings.&lt;ref name="Mixed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Kenya]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;A survey of 1,400 Kenyan teenagers found a fair amount of confusion about ABC's messages. ... Half of the teenagers could correctly define abstinence and explain why it was important. Only 23 percent could explain what being faithful meant and why it was important. Some thought it meant being honest, and some thought it meant having faith in the fidelity of one's partner. Only 13 percent could correctly explain the importance of a condom in preventing HIV infection. About half spontaneously offered negative opinions about condoms, saying they were unreliable, immoral and, in some cases, were designed to let HIV be transmitted.&lt;ref name="Mixed"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Swaziland|Eswatini]] in 2010 announced that it was abandoning the ABC strategy because it was a dismal failure in preventing the spread of HIV. "If you look at the increase of HIV in the country while we've been applying the ABC concept all these years, then it is evident that ABC is not the answer," said Dr. Derek von Wissell, Director of the National Emergency Response Council on HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/90183/SWAZILAND-ABC-approach-to-be-shelved|title=IRIN Africa - SWAZILAND: ABC approach to be shelved - Swaziland - HIV/AIDS (PlusNews) - Prevention - PlusNews|work=IRINnews|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Combating HIV fatigue====

One of the greatest problems faced by African countries that have high prevalence rates is "HIV fatigue".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Africans are not interested in hearing more about a disease that they already have heard about constantly.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} To address this, novel approaches are required.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1999, the [[Henry J.

===African Union's efforts===

====AIDS Watch Africa====

During the Abuja [[African Union]] Summit on HIV/AIDS in April 2001, the heads of state and heads of government of [[Botswana]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Africa]], and [[Uganda]] established the AIDS Watch Africa (AWA) advocacy platform. The initiative was formed to "accelerate efforts by Heads of State and Government to implement their commitments for the fight against HIV/AIDS, and to mobilize the required national and international resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AIDS Watch Africa (AWA) - Jan 06 - Minutes of the Meeting of AWA | url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/conferences/past/2006/july/summit/doc/AWA/Jan%2006%20-MINUTES%20OF%20THE%20MEETING%20OF%20AWA%20Jan%2006.pdf | publisher=AIDS WATCH AFRICA | accessdate=29 May 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019070858/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/Past/2006/July/summit/doc/AWA/Jan%2006%20-MINUTES%20OF%20THE%20MEETING%20OF%20AWA%20Jan%2006.pdf | archivedate=19 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, AWA was revitalized to include all of Africa and its objectives were broadened to include malaria and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/ASSEMBLY AU DEC 391 - 415 (XVIII) _E.pdf Decision 395, "Decisions, Resolution, and Declarations", Assembly of the Union, Eighteenth Ordinary Session, 29–30 January 2012, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roadmap on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, TB and Malaria Response in Africa====

In 2012, the [[African Union]] adopted a ''Roadmap on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, TB and Malaria Response in Africa''.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Press Release"/&gt;
This Roadmap presents a set of practical African-sourced solutions for enhancing shared responsibility and global solidarity for AIDS ... responses in Africa on a sustainable basis by 2015. The solutions are organized around three strategic pillars: diversified financing; access to medicines; and enhanced health governance. The Roadmap defines goals, results and roles and responsibilities to hold stakeholders accountable for the realization of these solutions between 2012 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/Shared_Res_Roadmap_Rev_F%5B1%5D.pdf "Roadmap on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, TB and Malaria Response in Africa", African Union, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventing HIV transmission from pregnant women to children===

The [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] reported that the following sixteen African nations in 2012 "ensure[d] that more than three-quarters of pregnant women living with HIV receive antiretroviral medicine to prevent transmission to their child": [[Botswana]], [[Gabon]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Rwanda]], [[São Tomé and Principe]], [[Seychelles]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS Press Release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

==Causes and spread==

===Behavioral factors===

High-risk behavioral patterns have been cited as being largely responsible for the significantly greater spread of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other parts of the world. Chief among these are the traditionally liberal attitudes espoused by many communities inhabiting the subcontinent toward multiple sexual partners and pre-marital and outside marriage sexual activity.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RCTHIV"/&gt; HIV transmission is most likely in the first few weeks after infection, and is therefore increased when people have more than one sexual partner in the same time period. In most of the developed world outside Africa, this means HIV transmission is high among [[prostitute]]s and other people who may have more than one sexual partner concurrently. Within the cultures of sub-Saharan Africa, it is relatively common for both men and women to be carrying on sexual relations with more than one person, which promotes HIV transmission.&lt;ref name=HIV_Today/&gt; This practice is known as concurrency, which Helen Epstein describes in her book, ''The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight against AIDS'', in which her research into the sexual mores of Uganda revealed the high frequency with which men and women engage in concurrent sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Helen. The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight against AIDS. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in sub-Saharan Africa AIDS is the leading killer and a large reason for the high transmission rates is because of the lack of education provided to youth. When infected, most children die within one year because of the lack of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nsamenang|first1=A. Bame|title=Factors Influencing the development of psychology in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=June 1995|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Bamenda, Cameroon|pages=61–104|accessdate=9/11/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire population in Sub-Saharan Africa is being infected with HIV, from men to women, and from pregnant woman to children. Rather than having more of a specific group infected, male or female, the ratio of men and women infected with HIV are quite similar. With the HIV infection, 77% of men, women, and children, develop AIDS, and die in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of those deaths, “more than 90% of AIDS orphans and children [were] infected with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Cock, Mbori-Ngacha, and Marum|first=Kevin M., Dorothy, and Elizabeth|year=2002|title=Shadow on the Continent: Public Health and HIV/AIDS in Africa in the 21st Century.|url=|journal=The Lancet |volume=|pages=68|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)09337-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of money is an obvious challenge, although a great deal of aid is distributed throughout developing countries with high HIV/AIDS rates. For African countries with advanced medical facilities, [[patent]]s on many drugs have hindered the ability to make low cost alternatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Susan Hunter, "Black Death: AIDS in Africa", Palrave Macmillan 2003 chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural disasters and conflict are also major challenges, as the resulting economic problems people face can drive many young women and girls into patterns of sex work in order to ensure their livelihood or that of their family, or else to obtain safe passage, food, shelter or other resources.&lt;ref name="ODIhiv"&gt;Samuels, Fiona (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2645&amp;title=hiv-aids-emergencies HIV and emergencies: one size does not fit all],  London: Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Emergencies can also lead to greater exposure to HIV infection through new patterns of sex work. In [[Mozambique]], an influx of humanitarian workers and transporters, such as truck drivers, attracted sex workers from outside the area.&lt;ref name="ODIhiv"/&gt; Similarly, in the [[Turkana District]] of northern [[Kenya]], drought led to a decrease in clients for local sex workers, prompting the sex workers to relax their condom use demands and search for new truck driver clients on main highways and in peri-urban settlements.&lt;ref name="ODIhiv"/&gt;

===Health industry===
Sub-Saharan "Africans have always appreciated the importance of health care because good health is seen as necessary for the continuation and growth of their lineage".&lt;ref name="Intercultural Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richmond|first1=Yale|last2=Gestrin|first2=Phyllis|title=Into Africa a guide to Sub-Saharan culture and diversity|date=2009|publisher=Intercultural Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780984247127 |url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10430707|accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without proper health the culture will not be able to thrive and grow. Unfortunately, "health services in many countries are swamped by the need to care for increasing numbers of infected and sick people. Ameliorative drugs are too expensive for most victims, except for a very small number who are affluent".&lt;ref name="Intercultural Press"/&gt; The greatest number of sick people with the least number of doctors, Sub-Saharan Africa "has 11 percent of the world's population but carries 24 percent of the global disease burden. With less than 1 percent of global health expenditure and only 3 percent of the world's health workers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sud|first1=Neha|title=Health &amp; Education in Africa|url=http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/REGION__EXT_Content/Regions/Sub-Saharan+Africa/Investments/HealthEducation/|website=International Finance Corporation|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When family members get sick with HIV or other sicknesses, family members often end up selling most of their belongings in order to provide health care for the individual. Medical facilities in many African countries are lacking. Many health care workers are also not available, in part due to lack of training by governments and in part due to the wooing of these workers by foreign medical organisations where there is a need for medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/davidhshinn/Home/african-migration-and-the-brain-drain |title=African Migration and the Brain Drain&amp;nbsp;— David Shinn |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many individuals who get a medical degree end up leaving Sub-Saharan Africa to work abroad "either to escape instability or to practice where they have better working conditions and a higher salary".&lt;ref name="Health"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health|url=http://www.our-africa.org/health|website=Our Africa|accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many low income communities are very far away from a hospital and they cannot afford to bus there or pay for medical attention once they arrive. "Healthcare in Africa differs widely, depending on the country and also the region – those living in urban areas are more likely to receive better healthcare services than those in rural or remote regions".&lt;ref name="Health"/&gt; It is very common to just wait out a sickness or seek help from a neighbor or relative.  Currently antiretroviral therapy is the closest to a cure. However, many hospitals lack enough antiretroviral drugs to treat everyone. This may be because most Sub-Saharan African countries invest "as little as 1-4 dollars per capita, [so] overseas aid is a major source of funding for healthcare".&lt;ref name="Health"/&gt; Many overseas organizations are very hesitant to give antiretroviral drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa because they are expensive, which means that there is only so much they can give. Relying on other countries for help in general requires more paperwork and faith in another country very far away. Also, delivery of drugs and other aid takes many month and years to arrive in the hands of those that need help.

===Medical factors===

====Circumcision====

According to a 2007 report, male and female circumcision were statistically associated with an increased incidence of HIV infection among the females in [[Kenya]] and the males in Kenya, [[Lesotho]], and [[Tanzania]] who self-reported that they both underwent the procedure and were virgins.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Kenyan females: 3.2 percent versus 1.4 percent. Kenyan males: 1.8 percent versus 0.0 percent. Lesothoan males: 6.1 percent versus 1.9 percent. Tanzanian males: 2.9 percent versus 1.0 percent.&lt;/ref&gt; "Among adolescents, regardless of sexual experience,
circumcision was just as strongly associated with prevalent HIV infection." Circumcised adults, however, were statistically less likely to be HIV positive than their uncircumcised counterparts, especially among older age groups.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Kenyan females: 4.8 percent versus 12.2 percent. Kenyan males: 4.0 percent versus 25.4 percent. Lesothoan males: 26.3 percent versus 28.8 percent. Tanzanian males: 8.5 percent versus 10.8 percent.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brewer Devon D. |author2=Potterat John J. |author3=John M.

Similarly, a randomized, controlled intervention trial in [[South Africa]] from 2005 found that male circumcision "provides a degree of protection against acquiring HIV infection [by males], equivalent to what a vaccine of high efficacy would have achieved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020298|journal=PLOS Medicine|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020298|volume=2|title=Randomized, Controlled Intervention Trial of Male Circumcision for Reduction of HIV Infection Risk: The ANRS 1265 Trial|pages=e298|pmid=16231970|pmc=1262556|date=November 2005|author=Auvert B, Taljaard D, Lagarde E, Sobngwi-Tambekou J, Sitta R, Puren A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical suspicion====
[[File:Angolan community members at HIV AIDS outreach event (5686747785).jpg|thumb|400px|right|An HIV/AIDS educational outreach session in [[Angola]].]]

There are high levels of medical suspicion throughout Africa, and there is evidence that such distrust may have a significant impact on the use of medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1525/maq.2000.14.2.159 | last1 = Feldman-Savelsberg | first1 = P. | last2 = Ndonko | first2 = F.

===Pharmaceutical industry===

African countries are also still fighting against what they perceive as unfair practices in the international pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Meier, Benjamin Mason: International Protection of Persons Undergoing Medical Experimentation: Protecting the Right of Informed Consent, Berkeley journal of international law [1085-5718] Meier yr:2002 vol:20 iss:3 pg:513 -554&lt;/ref&gt; Medical experimentation occurs in Africa on many medications, but once approved, access to the drug is difficult.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Drug companies must make a return on the money they invest on research and work to obtain patents on their intellectual capital investments which restrict generic alternatives production.

These pharmaceuticals insist that drugs should be purchased through them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

South African scientists in a combined effort with American scientists from [[Gilead Sciences]] recently tested and found effective a [[tenofivir]]-based anti-retroviral vaginal gel that could be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis.

Since the epidemic is widespread, African governments sometimes relax their laws in order to get research conducted in their countries which they would otherwise not afford.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  However, global organizations such as the [[Clinton Foundation]], are working to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medications in Africa and elsewhere. For example, the philanthropist [[Inder Singh (philanthropist)|Inder Singh]] oversaw a program which reduced the cost of pediatric HIV/AIDS drugs by between 80 and 92 percent by working with manufacturers to reduce production and distribution costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD7keapMjHc |title=Inder Singh, Executive Vice President for the Clinton Foundation, on Expanding Access to Health Care |publisher=Wharton Magazine |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manufacturers often cite distribution and production difficulties in developing markets, which create a substantial barrier to entry.

===Political factors===

Major African political leaders have denied the link between HIV and AIDS, favoring alternate theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Mark Schoofs]] |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-07-04/news/debating-the-obvious/ |title=Debating the Obvious&amp;nbsp;— Page 1 - News&amp;nbsp;— New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=2000-07-04 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific community considers the evidence that HIV causes AIDS to be conclusive and rejects [[AIDS denialism|AIDS-denialist]] claims as pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories, faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data. Despite its lack of scientific acceptance, AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the former presidency of [[Thabo Mbeki]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Subtype factor===
In Africa, [[Subtypes of HIV|subtype]] C of HIV-1 is very common, whereas it is rare in America or Europe. People with subtype C progress to AIDS faster than those with subtype A, the predominant subtype in America and Europe (see [[HIV disease progression rates#HIV subtype variation and effect on progression rates]]).

===Religious factors===

Pressure from some religious leaders has resulted in the banning of a number of safe-sex campaigns, including condom promoting advertisements being banned in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mark Schoofs | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21859665 | title=Kenya condom advert pulled after religious complaints | publisher=BBC | date=20 March 2013 | accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Care delivery==
Many people living with HIV in low and middle income countries who need antiretroviral therapy are unable to access or remain in care. This is often because of the time and cost required to travel to health centres as well as an inadequate number of trained staff such as medical doctors and specialists to provide treatment. One approach to improve access to HIV care is to provide antiretroviral therapy close to people’s homes. A systematic review found that when antiretroviral treatment was initiated at the hospital but followed up at a health centre closer to home, fewer patients died or were lost to follow up. The research also did not detect a difference in the numbers of patients who died or were lost to follow up when they received maintenance treatment in the community rather than in a health centre or hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kredo|first=T|author2=Ford, N |author3=Adeniyi, FB |author4= Garner, P |title=Decentralising HIV treatment in lower- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jun 27, 2013|volume=6|pages=CD009987|pmid=23807693 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009987.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
[[File:Archbishop Desmond Tutu gets an HIV test on The Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation's Tutu Tester, a mobile test unit that brings healthcare right to your doorstep.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] gets an HIV test on the [[Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation]]'s Tutu Tester, a mobile test unit.]]

Prevalence measures include everyone living with HIV and AIDS, and present a delayed representation of the epidemic by aggregating the HIV infections of many years. Incidence, in contrast, measures the number of new infections, usually over the previous year. There is no practical, reliable way to assess incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Prevalence in 15- to 24-year-old pregnant women attending [[prenatal care|antenatal clinics]] is sometimes used as an approximation. The test done to measure prevalence is a serosurvey in which blood is tested for the presence of HIV.

Health units that conduct serosurveys rarely operate in remote rural communities, and the data collected also does not measure people who seek alternate healthcare. Extrapolating national data from antenatal surveys relies on assumptions which may not hold across all regions and at different stages in an epidemic.

Recent national population or household-based surveys collecting data from both sexes, pregnant and non-pregnant women, and rural and urban areas, have adjusted the recorded national prevalence levels for several countries in Africa and elsewhere{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}. These, too, are not perfect: people may not participate in household surveys because they fear they may be HIV positive and do not want to know their test results. Household surveys also exclude migrant labourers, who are a high risk group.

Thus, there may be significant disparities between official figures and actual HIV prevalence in some countries.

A minority of scientists claim that as many as 40 percent of HIV infections in African adults may be caused by unsafe medical practices rather than by sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaaction.org/docs02/hiv0210t.htm Africa: HIV/AIDS through Unsafe Medical Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405133553/http://www.africaaction.org/docs02/hiv0210t.htm |date=2005-04-05 }}. Africaaction.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization states that about 2.5 percent of HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa are caused by unsafe medical injection practices and the "overwhelming majority" by unprotected sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2003/statement5/en/ WHO | Expert group stresses that unsafe sex is primary mode of transmission of HIV in Africa]. Who.int (2003-03-14). Retrieved on 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional prevalence==

In contrast to areas in North Africa and the Horn of Africa, traditional cultures and religions in much of Sub-Saharan Africa have generally exhibited a more liberal attitude vis-a-vis female out-of-marriage sexual activity. The latter includes practices such as multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex, high-risk cultural patterns that have been implicated in the much greater spread of HIV in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="RCTHIV"/&gt;

===North Africa===

Uniquely among countries in this region, Morocco's HIV prevalence rate has increased from less than 0.1 percent in 2001 to 0.2 percent in 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

===Horn of Africa===

As with North Africa, the HIV infection rates in the [[Horn of Africa]] are generally quite low. This has been attributed to the Muslim nature of many of the local communities and adherence to Islamic morals.&lt;ref name="RCTHIV"/&gt;

Ethiopia's HIV prevalence rate has decreased from 3.6 percent in 2001 to 1.4 percent in 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt; The number of new infections per year also has decreased from 130,000 in 2001 to 24,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

===Eastern Africa===
[[File:Kenya2006- worldaidsday- contesto- COSV (3).jpg|thumb|400px|right|[[World AIDS Day]] 2006 event in [[Kenya]].]]
HIV infection rates in eastern Africa are generally moderate to high.

====Kenya====
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Kenya}}

[[Kenya]], according to a 2008 report from the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]], had the third largest number of individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa living with HIV.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"&gt;{{cite news | last=Fortunate | first=Edith | title=Rich Kenyans hardest hit by HIV, says study | url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Rich-Kenyans-hardest-hit-by-HIV-says-study/-/1056/1644816/-/ic3raiz/-/index.html | accessdate=19 May 2013 | newspaper=Daily Nation | date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had the highest prevalence rate of any country outside of Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt; Kenya's HIV infection rate dropped from around 14 percent in the mid-1990s to 5 percent in 2006,&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/&gt; but rose again to 6.2 percent by 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt; The number of newly infected people per year, however, decreased by almost 30 percent, from 140,000 in 2001 to 100,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

As of 2012, [[Nyanza Province]] had the highest HIV prevalence rate at 13.9 percent, with the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]] having the lowest rate at 0.9 percent.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt;

Christian men and women also had a higher infection rate than their Muslim counterparts.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt; This discrepancy was especially marked among women, with Muslim women showing a rate of 2.8 percent versus 8.4 percent among Protestant women and 8 percent among Catholic women.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt; HIV was also more common among the wealthiest than among the poorest (7.2 percent versus 4.6 percent).&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt;

Historically, HIV had been more prevalent in urban than rural areas, although the gap is closing rapidly.&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt; Men in rural areas are now more likely to be HIV-infected (at 4.5 percent) than those in urban areas (at 3.7 percent).&lt;ref name="UNAIDSKEN"/&gt;

====Tanzania====
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Tanzania}}

Between 2004 and 2008, the HIV incidence rate in [[Tanzania]] for ages 15–44 slowed to 3.37 per 1,000 person-years (4.42 for women and 2.36 for men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Estimates of HIV incidence from household-based prevalence surveys|publisher=|pmc=3535828 | pmid=19915447|doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e32833062dc|volume=24|year=2010|journal=AIDS|pages=147–52|author=Hallett TB, Stover J, Mishra V, Ghys PD, Gregson S, Boerma T}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newly infected people per year increased slightly, from 140,000 in 2001 to 150,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt; There were also significantly fewer HIV infections in [[Zanzibar]], which in 2011 had a prevalence rate of 1.0 percent compared to 5.3 percent in mainland Tanzania.&lt;ref name="Survey"&gt;[http://www.nbs.go.tz/takwimu/this2012/THMIS2011-12FReport.zip ''Tanzania HIV/AIDS and Malaria Indicator Survey 2011-12'', authorized by the [[Tanzania Commission for AIDS]] (TACAIDS) and the Zanzibar Commission for AIDS; implemented by the [[National Bureau of Statistics of Tanzania|Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics]] in collaboration with the Office of the Chief Government Statistician (Zanzibar); funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]], TACAIDS, and the [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health and Social Welfare]], with support provided by [[ICF International]]; data collected 16 December 2011 to 24 May 2012; report published in Dar es Salaam in March 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020181026/http://www.nbs.go.tz/takwimu/this2012/THMIS2011-12FReport.zip |date=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uganda====
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Uganda}}

[[Uganda]] has registered a gradual decrease in its HIV rates from 10.6 percent in 1997, to a stabilized 6.5-7.2 percent since 2001.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RCTHIV"/&gt; This has been attributed to changing local behavioral patterns, with more respondents reporting greater use of contraceptives{{Citation needed|reason=sources say otherwise see discussion page|date=November 2012}} and a two-year delay in first sexual activity as well as fewer people reporting casual sexual encounters and multiple partners.&lt;ref name="RCTHIV"/&gt;

The number of newly infected people per year, however, has increased by over 50 percent, from 99,000 in 2001 to 150,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt; More than 40 percent of new infections are among married couples, indicating widespread and increasing [[infidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/infidelity-root-cause-of-ugandas-chaning-aids-epidemic/1644720.html|title=Uganda's Soaring HIV Infection Rate Linked to Infidelity|work=VOA|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924143332/http://www.voanews.com/content/infidelity-root-cause-of-ugandas-chaning-aids-epidemic/1644720.html|archivedate=24 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase has caused alarm. The director of the Centre for Disease Control – Uganda, [[Wuhib Tadesse]], said in 2011 that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;for every person started on antiretroviral therapy, there are three new HIV infections[,] and this is unsustainable. We are ... very concerned. ... [C]omplacence could be part of the problem. Young people nowadays no longer see people dying; they see people on ARVs but getting children. We need to re-examine our strategies.... Leaders at all levels are spending ... [more] time in workshops than in the communities to sensitive the people[,] and this must stop."&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201107180564.html "Uganda: 25,000 Babies Born With HIV/Aids Annually", ''The Monitor'', reported by Yasiin Mugerwa, reprinted on the website of ''allAfrica.com'', 17 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Western Africa===

Western Africa has generally moderate levels of infection of both [[subtypes of HIV|HIV-1 and HIV-2]]. The onset of the HIV epidemic in the region began in 1985 with reported cases in Benin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2002/08/health-benin-growing-number-of-aids-orphans|title=HEALTH-BENIN: Growing Number of AIDS Orphans|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mali,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apin.harvard.edu/Chapter2.pdf "Chapter 2: The Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria", contributed by Abdulsalami Nasidi and Tekena O. Harry, in the book "AIDS in Nigeria: A Nation on the Threshold", edited by Olusoji Adeyi, Phyllis J. Kanki, and Oluwole Odutolu, Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Harvard University Press, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed in 1986  by Burkina Faso,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Côte d'Ivoire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnacl531.pdf "Epidemological Fact Sheet on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections", UNAIDS/WHO Working Group on Global HIV/AIDS and STI Surveillance, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Liberia,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and Senegal.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The epidemic began in Niger, Sierra Leone, and Togo in 1987; in The Gambia, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau in 1989; and in Cape Verde in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

HIV prevalence in western Africa is lowest in Senegal and highest in Nigeria, which has the second largest number of people living with HIV in Africa after [[South Africa]]. Nigeria's infection rate (number of patients relative to the entire population), however, is much lower (3.7 percent) compared to South Africa's (17.3 percent).

The main driver of infection in the region is [[prostitution|commercial sex]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In the Ghanaian capital of [[Accra]], for example, 80 percent of HIV infections in young men had been acquired from women who sell sex.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In Niger in 2011, the national HIV prevalence rate for ages 15–49 was 0.8 percent while for sex workers it was 36 percent.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, HIV and AIDS were virtually unheard of in southern Africa. However, it is now the worst-affected region in the world. Currently, [[HIV/AIDS in Swaziland|Eswatini]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Lesotho|Lesotho]] have the highest and second highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, respectively.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2011" /&gt; Of the nine southern African countries ([[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]), four are estimated to have an infection rate of over 15 percent.

In Botswana, the number of newly infected people per year has declined by 67 percent, from 27,000 in 2001 to 9,000 in 2011. In Malawi, the decrease has been 54 percent, from 100,000 in 2001 to 46,000 in 2011. All but two of the other countries in this region have also recorded major decreases (Namibia, 62 percent; Zambia, 54 percent; Zimbabwe, 47 percent; South Africa, 38 percent; Eswatini, 32 percent). The number has remained virtually the same in Lesotho and Mozambique.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2012"/&gt;

Aside from polygynous relationships, which can be quite prevalent in parts of Africa,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} there are also widespread practices of sexual networking that involve multiple overlapping or concurrent sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Economy of AIDS in Africa'', edited by Nana K.

A 2008 study in Botswana, Namibia, and Eswatini found that intimate partner violence, extreme poverty, education, and partner income disparity explained almost all of the differences in HIV status among adults aged 15–29 years. Among young women with any one of these factors, the HIV rate increased from 7.7 percent with no factors to 17.1 percent. Approximately 26 percent of young women with any two factors were HIV positive, with 36 percent of those with any three factors and 39.3 percent of those with all four factors being HIV-positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Choice-Disability and HIV Infection: A Cross Sectional Study of HIV Status in Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland|publisher=|pmc=3254870 | pmid=21390539|doi=10.1007/s10461-011-9912-3|volume=16|year=2012|journal=AIDS Behav|pages=189–98|author=Andersson N, Cockcroft A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most HIV infections found in southern Africa are [[subtypes of HIV|HIV-1]],{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} the world's most common HIV infection. It predominates everywhere except for western Africa, where [[subtypes of HIV|HIV-2]] is more frequent.

{{main|HIV/AIDS in Swaziland}}

As of 2011, the HIV prevalence rate in Eswatini was the highest in the world at 26.0 percent of persons aged 15–49.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS 2011"/&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] wrote in 2005,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The immense scale of AIDS-related illness and deaths is weakening governance capacities for service delivery, with serious consequences on food security, economic growth[,] and human development. AIDS undermines the capacities of individuals, families, communities[,] and the state to fulfill their roles and responsibilities in society. If current trends are not reversed, the longer-term survival of Swaziland as a country will be seriously threatened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/africa/programmedocs/SWAZILAND_-_ENGLISH.pdf "Draft country programme document for Swaziland (2006-2010)", United Nations Development Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The HIV epidemic in Eswatini has reduced its life expectancy at birth to 49 for men and 51 for women (based on 2009 data).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/swz/en|title=WHO - Swaziland|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy at birth in 1990 was 59 for men and 62 for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688?lang=en|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on 2011 data, Eswatini's crude death rate of 19.51 per 1,000 people per year was the third highest in the world, behind only Lesotho and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.12?lang=en|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV/AIDS in 2002 caused 64 percent of all deaths in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afro.who.int/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=57 "Country Health System Fact Sheet: Swaziland", World Health Organization, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar was first produced from sugarcane plants in northern India sometime after the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|ref=harv | last1=Sato|first1=Tsugitaka|title=Sugar in the Social Life of Medieval Islam|date=2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004277526|page=01|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/sugar-social-life-medieval-islam}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation of the word “sugar” is thought to be from Sanskrit, and Sanskrit literature from India, written between 1500 - 500 B.C. provides the first documentation of the cultivation of sugar cane and of the manufacture of sugar in the Bengal region of India. The Sanskrit name for a crudely made sugar substance was guda, meaning “to make into a ball or to conglomerate.”

The history of [[sugar]] has five main phases:

# The extraction of sugar cane juice from the [[sugarcane]] plant, and the subsequent domestication of the plant in tropical Southeast Asia sometime around 8,000 B.C.
# The invention of manufacture of cane sugar granules from sugarcane juice in India a little over two thousand years ago, followed by improvements in refining the crystal granules in India in the early centuries A.D.
# The spread of cultivation and manufacture of cane sugar to the medieval Islamic world together with some improvements of production methods.
# The spread of cultivation and manufacture of cane sugar to the West Indies and tropical parts of the Americas beginning in the 16th century, followed by more intensive improvements in production in the 17th through 19th centuries in that part of the world.
# The development of beet sugar, high fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Known worldwide by the end of the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], sugar was very expensive&lt;ref name=MedievalPriceOfSugar /&gt; and was considered a "[[Spice trade|fine spice]]",{{sfn|Bernstein|2009|p=205}} but from about the year 1500, technological improvements and New World sources began turning it into a much cheaper bulk commodity.{{sfn|Bernstein|2009|p=207}}

==The spread of sugarcane cultivation==
[[File:Saccharum officinarum - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-125.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Saccharum officinarum]]'' - sugar cane]]
The people of [[New Guinea]] were probably the first to [[Domestication|domesticate]] sugarcane, sometime around 8,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/sugar/cohen-text|title=Sugar|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After domestication, its cultivation spread rapidly to [[Southeast Asia]] and [[southern China]]. [[India]], where the process of refining cane juice into granulated crystals was developed, was often visited by imperial convoys (such as those from China) to learn about cultivation and sugar refining.{{sfn|SKIL|2014|p=[http://www.sucrose.com/lhist.html]}} By the sixth century AD, sugar cultivation and processing had reached Persia, and from there that knowledge was brought into the Mediterranean by the Arab expansion.{{sfn|Parker|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EXzgcB-pb2YC&amp;pg=PA10 10]}} "Wherever they went, the [medieval] Arabs brought with them sugar, the product and the technology of its production."{{sfn|Mintz|1986|p=25}}

Spanish and Portuguese exploration and conquest in the fifteenth century carried sugar south-west of [[Iberia]]. [[Henry the Navigator]] introduced cane to [[Madeira]] in 1425, while the Spanish, having eventually subdued the [[Canary Islands]], introduced sugar cane to them.{{sfn|Parker|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EXzgcB-pb2YC&amp;pg=PA10 10]}} In 1493, on his second voyage, [[Christopher Columbus]] carried sugarcane seedlings to the [[New World]], in particular [[Hispaniola]].{{sfn|Parker|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EXzgcB-pb2YC&amp;pg=PA10 10]}}

==Early use of sugarcane in India==
Sugarcane originated in tropical [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|Sharpe|1998}} Different species likely originated in different locations with ''S. barberi'' originating in [[India]] and ''S. edule'' and ''S. officinarum'' coming from [[New Guinea]].{{sfn|Sharpe|1998}}

Originally, people chewed sugarcane raw to extract its sweetness. [[India]]ns discovered how to crystallize sugar during the [[Gupta dynasty]], around 350 AD.{{sfn|Adas|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&amp;pg=PA311 2341]}}

There are lot of mentions in Tamil [[Sangam literature|sangam literatures]] like [[Purananuru]], [[Ainkurunuru]], [[Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai|Perumpaanaatruppadai]], [[Pattinappaalai|Paṭṭiṉappālai]] and [[Akanaṉūṟu|Akananuru]] about cultivation of sugarcane, sugarcane juice extraction using machines, and sugar extraction in the Tamil regions of South India. It is mentioned in Purananuru (392): here, the sugar cane is brought to Tamil land from an unknown place during the [[Sangam period]]. In Purananuru and Ainkurunuru, sugarcane juice extraction with use of huge machineries was compared with the sound made by elephants and the smoke produced during the process of making of sugar spread over a heap of unwinnowed paddy was like clouds over mountains.

Indian sailors, consumers of clarified butter and sugar, carried sugar by various [[trade routes]].{{sfn|Adas|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&amp;pg=PA311 311]}} Travelling Buddhist monks brought sugar crystallization methods to China.{{sfn|Kieschnick|2003}}  During the reign of [[Harsha]] (r. 606&amp;ndash;647) in [[North India]], Indian envoys in [[Tang Dynasty|Tang China]] taught sugarcane cultivation methods after [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626&amp;ndash;649) made his interest in sugar known, and China soon established its first sugarcane cultivation in the seventh century.{{sfn|Sen|2003|pp=38–40}} Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 AD, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining.{{sfn|Kieschnick|2003|p=258}} In South Asia, the [[Middle East]] and [[China]], sugar became a staple of cooking and [[dessert]]s.

Early refining methods involved grinding or pounding the cane in order to extract the juice, and then boiling down the juice or drying it in the sun to yield sugary solids that looked like [[gravel]]. The Sanskrit word for "sugar" (''sharkara'') also means "gravel" or "sand".&lt;ref&gt;"sugar, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/193624. Accessed 25 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] use the term "gravel sugar" ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 砂糖) for what the West knows as "table sugar".

In the year 1792, sugar rose by degrees to an enormous price in Great Britain. The [[East India Company]] was then called upon to lend their assistance to help in the lowering of the price of sugar. On 15 March 1792, his Majesty's Ministers to the British Parliament, presented a report related to the production of refined sugar in British India. Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, reported that refined sugar could be produced in India&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bihargatha.in/early-agriculture-based-enterprenureships/sugar-concerns bihargatha.in]&lt;/ref&gt; with many superior advantages, and a lot more cheaply than in the West Indies.

==Cane sugar in the medieval era in the Muslim World and Europe==
[[File:Spread sugarcane.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|The westward diffusion of sugarcane in pre-Islamic times (shown in red), in the medieval [[Muslim world]] (green), and in the 15th century by the Portuguese on the Madeira archipelago, and by the Spanish on the Canary Islands archipelago (islands west of Africa, circled by violet lines)&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Andrew.

There are records of knowledge of sugar among the ancient Greeks and Romans, but only as an imported medicine, and not as a food. For example, the Greek physician [[Dioscorides]] in the 1st century (AD) wrote: "There is a kind of coalesced honey called ''sakcharon'' [i.e. sugar] found in reeds in India and [[Arabia Felix|Eudaimon Arabia]] [i.e. Yemen&lt;ref&gt;There is no evidence from Yemen itself that sugarcane was cultivated in Yemen before the start of the Islamic era. There is plentiful evidence that Yemen imported goods from India in the pre-Islamic era (see e.g. ''[[Periplus of the Erythrean Sea]]''). Hence historians today tend to believe that when Dioscorides was writing in the 1st century AD, Yemen imported sugar from India; and, that it did not produce it locally, and that the sugar that Dioscorides obtained in Greece was an import from Yemen but ultimately became an import from India. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y96agmiQP7gC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage The Sugar Cane Industry: An Historical Geography from its Origins to 1914], by J.H. Galloway, year 1989, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;] similar in consistency to salt and brittle enough to be broken between the teeth like salt. It is good dissolved in water for the intestines and stomach, and [can be] taken as a drink to help [relieve] a painful bladder and kidneys."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Book Two of Dioscorides' ''Materia Medica''. The book is downloadable from links at the Wikipedia [[Dioscorides]] page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]], a 1st-century (AD) Roman, also described sugar as medicinal: "Sugar is made in Arabia as well, but Indian sugar is better. It is a kind of honey found in cane, white as gum, and it crunches between the teeth. It comes in lumps the size of a hazelnut. Sugar is used only for medical purposes."&lt;ref name=faas&gt;[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=YXGlAr17oekC }} Patrick Faas (2003). ''Around the Roman Table: Food and Feasting in Ancient Rome''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p.&amp;nbsp;149.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the medieval era, Arab entrepreneurs adopted sugar production techniques from India and expanded the industry. Medieval Arabs in some cases set up large [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s equipped with on-site [[Sugar refinery|sugar mills or refineries]]. The cane sugar plant, which is native to a tropical climate, requires both a lot of water and a lot of heat to thrive. The cultivation of the plant spread throughout the medieval Arab world using artificial irrigation. Sugar cane was first grown extensively in medieval Southern Europe during the period of [[Emirate of Sicily|Arab rule in Sicily]] beginning around the 9th century.{{sfn|Sato|2014|p=30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art143.htm|title=Sugar Cane in Sicily&amp;nbsp;— Best of Sicily Magazine|website=www.bestofsicily.com|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Sicily, [[Al-Andalus]] (in what is currently southern Spain) was an important center of sugar production, beginning by the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;''Salobreña: Rutas y senderos / Countryside Paths and Walks'', ed. by Juan Manuel Pérez, trans. by Deborah Green (Salobreña: Ayuntamiento de Salobreña, 2009), {{ISBN|8487811132}}, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Trillo San José and Gari Amtmann, '[http://revistaselectronicas.ujaen.es/index.php/ATM/article/download/1685/1463 Un castillo junto al río Laroles: ¿Šant Afliy?]', ''AyTM'', 8 (2001), 305-23 (p. 309).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Arab world, sugar was exported throughout Europe. The volume of imports increased in the later medieval centuries as indicated by the increasing references to [[sugar consumption]] in late medieval Western writings. But cane sugar remained an expensive import. Its price per pound in 14th and 15th century England was about equally as high as imported spices from tropical Asia such as mace (nutmeg), ginger, cloves, and pepper, which had to be transported across the Indian Ocean in that era.&lt;ref name="MedievalPriceOfSugar"&gt;One source for the price of cane sugar in late medieval England is the annual account books of a large abbey at Durham, which recorded the purchases of many different goods for use in the abbey, including sugar and various spices, giving the quantity bought and the price paid, with records existing for many years in the 14th and 15th centuries. Selections from these account books are online in two volumes at Archive.org: [https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28Account%20Rolls%20of%20the%20Abbey%20of%20Durham%20%29%20AND%20creator%3A%28surtees%29 ''Extracts from the Account Rolls of the Abbey of Durham'']. In the Durham Abbey account books the word for sugar is spelled Zuker (year 1299), succre (1309), sucore (1311), Zucar (1316), suker (1323), Zuccoris (1326), Succoris (1329), sugre (1363), suggir (1440).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clive Ponting|Ponting]] traces the spread of the cultivation of sugarcane from its introduction into [[Mesopotamia]], then the [[Levant]] and the islands of the eastern Mediterranean, especially [[Cyprus]], by the 10th century.{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=353}} He also notes that it spread along the coast of East Africa to reach [[Zanzibar]].{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=353}}

[[Crusades|Crusaders]] brought sugar home with them to Europe after their campaigns in the [[Holy Land]], where they encountered caravans carrying "sweet salt". Early in the 12th century, Venice acquired some villages near [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and set up estates to produce sugar for export to Europe, where it supplemented honey as the only other available sweetener.{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOenYGilfd8C&amp;pg=PA481 481]}}
Crusade chronicler [[William of Tyre]], writing in the late 12th century, described sugar as "a most precious product, very necessary for the use and health of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Barber|first1=Malcolm|edition=2nd |title=The two cities: medieval Europe, 1050–1320 |year= 2004|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-17415-2|page=14 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7Kkm7cgT_xkC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first record of sugar in English is in the late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED43692&amp;egs=all&amp;egdisplay=compact UMich ''Middle English Dictionary''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ponting recounts the reliance on slavery of the early European sugar entrepreneurs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The crucial problem with sugar production was that it was highly labour-intensive in both growing and processing. Because of the huge weight and bulk of the raw cane it was very costly to transport, especially by land, and therefore each estate had to have its own factory. There the cane had to be crushed to extract the juices, which were boiled to concentrate them, in a series of backbreaking and intensive operations lasting many hours. However, once it had been processed and concentrated, the sugar had a very high value for its bulk and could be traded over long distances by ship at a considerable profit. The [European sugar] industry only began on a major scale after the loss of the Levant to a resurgent Islam and the shift of production to Cyprus under a mixture of Crusader aristocrats and Venetian merchants. The local population on Cyprus spent most of their time growing their own food and few would work on the sugar estates. The owners therefore brought in slaves from the Black Sea area (and a few from Africa) to do most of the work. The level of demand and production was low and therefore so was the trade in slaves — no more than about a thousand people a year. It was not much larger when sugar production began in Sicily.

In the Atlantic ocean [the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]], once the initial exploitation of the timber and raw materials was over, it rapidly became clear that sugar production would be the most profitable way of getting money from the new territories. The problem was the heavy labour involved because the Europeans refused to work except as supervisors. The solution was to bring in slaves from Africa. The crucial developments in this trade began in the 1440's...{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOenYGilfd8C&amp;pg=PA481 481]}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 1390s, a better press was developed, which doubled the amount of juice that was obtained from the sugarcane and helped to cause the economic expansion of sugar plantations to [[Andalusia]] and to the [[Algarve]]. It started in [[Madeira]] in 1455, using advisers from Sicily and (largely) Genoese capital for the mills. The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders keen to bypass Venetian monopolies. "By 1480 Antwerp had some seventy ships engaged in the Madeira sugar trade, with the refining and distribution concentrated in Antwerp. The 1480's saw sugar production extended to the Canary Islands. By the 1490's Madeira had overtaken Cyprus as a producer of sugar."{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOenYGilfd8C&amp;pg=PA482 482]}}
African slaves also worked in the sugar plantations of the Kingdom of Castile around Valencia.{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOenYGilfd8C&amp;pg=PA482 482]}}

In the 16th century Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]], the author of the [[Shulchan Aruch]], the code of Jewish law, mentions the use of sugar mixed with the juice of lemons and water by Jews in Cairo, Egypt to make [[lemonade]] on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. (Orech Chayim, Hilchot Shabbat)

==Sugar cultivation in the New World==
[[File:Triangular trade.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Triangular trade - slaves were imported into the Caribbean Islands to plant and harvest [[sugar cane]].]]
{{See also|Slavery in the British and French Caribbean}}
&lt;!--The Spanish sugar industry flourished for less than a century. Spanish failure left the way open for the Portuguese, particularly after the latter took possession of Brazil in 1500, and thus dominated global sugar [[Production (economics)|production]]. By the end of the sixteenth century, Brazil was producing the highest income of any [[colony]] in the world. Initially, the Portuguese used indigenous labour, switching to African slaves as the former either died or fled.

The Dutch founded the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] in 1621 to gain a position in New World sugar production in Brazil, and eventually their sugar income rose above the income that the Portuguese were getting from their sugar production facilities in Brazil. From 1636, the Netherlands received the largest income from sugar production in Brazil. Problems in Brazil in the 1640s led to further Dutch expansion, this time into the Caribbean.

Unlike cotton and tobacco, sugar is complicated and time-consuming to grow and process. More so than tobacco, and even more so than cotton, sugar demanded far more labour, capital and expertise for successful cultivation and processing.

During the 1630s, the price of sugar stayed low due to the vast amounts being produced in Brazil by the Dutch. A fall in yields and political disturbance in Brazil saw a sudden rise in its value, setting the stage for the triumph of sugar on the world stage. The domestic distractions of the English Civil War led to effective Dutch control of English settlements such as Barbados.

--&gt;The Portuguese took sugar to [[History of Brazil|Brazil]]. By 1540, there were 800 [[cane sugar mill]]s in [[Santa Catarina (island)|Santa Catarina]] Island and there were another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, [[Demarara]], and [[Surinam]]. The first sugar harvest happened in [[Hispaniola]] in 1501; and many sugar mills had been constructed in [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]] by the 1520s.{{sfn|Benitez-Rojo|1996|p=93}}

The approximately 3,000 small sugar mills that were built before 1550 in the New World created an unprecedented demand for [[cast iron]] [[gear]]s, levers, axles and other implements. Specialist trades in mold-making and iron casting developed in Europe due to the expansion of sugar production. Sugar mill construction sparked development of the technological skills needed for a nascent [[industrial revolution]] in the early 17th century.{{sfn|Benitez-Rojo|1996|p=93}}

After 1625, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] carried sugarcane from South America to the Caribbean islands, where it was grown from [[Barbados]] to the [[Virgin Islands]].

Contemporaries often compared the worth of sugar with valuable commodities including [[musk]], [[pearl]]s, and [[spice]]s. Sugar prices declined slowly as its production became multi-sourced, especially through British colonial policy. Formerly an indulgence of only the rich, the consumption of sugar also became increasingly common among the poor as well. Sugar [[Production (economics)|production]] increased in mainland North American colonies, in [[Cuba]], and in [[Brazil]]. The labour force at first included European [[indentured servant]]s and local [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] slaves. However, European diseases such as [[smallpox]] and African ones such as [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] soon reduced the numbers of local [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]]s.{{sfn|Benitez-Rojo|1996|p=93}} Europeans were also very susceptible to malaria and yellow fever, and the supply of indentured servants was limited. African [[Slavery|slaves]] became the dominant source of plantation workers because they were more resistant to [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], and because the [[Atlantic slave trade|supply of slaves]] was abundant on the African coast.{{sfn|Watts|2001}}{{sfn|Wood|1996|p=89}}

During the 18th century, sugar became enormously popular. Britain, for example, consumed five times as much sugar in 1770 as in 1710.{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=510}}
By 1750 sugar surpassed grain as "the most valuable commodity in European trade&amp;nbsp;— it made up a fifth of all European imports and in the last decades of the century four-fifths of the sugar came from the British and French colonies in the West Indies."{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=510}}
The sugar market went through a series of [[economic boom|boom]]s. The heightened demand and production of sugar came about to a large extent due to a great change in the eating habits of many Europeans. For example, they began consuming [[jam]]s, [[candy]], tea, coffee, cocoa, processed foods, and other sweet victuals in much greater amount. Reacting to this increasing craze, the islands took advantage of the situation and set about producing still more sugar. In fact, they produced up to ninety percent of the sugar that the western Europeans consumed. Some islands proved more successful than others when it came to producing the product. In Barbados and the British [[Leeward Islands]] sugar provided 93% and 97% respectively of exports.

Planters later began developing ways to boost production even more. For example, they began using more farming methods when growing their crops. They also developed more advanced mills and began using better types of sugarcane. In the eighteenth century "the French colonies were the most successful, especially Saint-Domingue, where better irrigation, water-power and machinery, together with concentration on newer types of sugar, increased profits."{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=510}}
Despite these and other improvements, the price of sugar reached soaring heights, especially during events such as the revolt against the Dutch&lt;ref&gt;On the Caribbean island of Curaçao, there were slave rebellions in 1716, 1750, 1774, and 1795, the latter led by the slave [[Tula (Curaçao)|Tula]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Sugar remained in high demand, and the islands' planters knew exactly how to take advantage of the situation.

On right is "white officer", the European overseer. Slave workers toil during the harvest. To the left is a flat-bottomed vessel for cane transportation.]]
As Europeans established sugar plantations on the larger Caribbean islands, prices fell, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. By the 18th century all levels of society had become common consumers of the former luxury product. At first most sugar in Britain went into tea, but later [[candy|confectionery]] and [[chocolate]]s became extremely popular. Many Britons (especially children) also ate jams.{{sfn|Wilson|2011}} Suppliers commonly sold sugar in the form of a [[sugarloaf]] and consumers required [[sugar nips]], a pliers-like tool, to break off pieces.

Sugarcane quickly exhausts the [[soil]] in which it grows, and planters pressed larger islands with fresher soil into production in the nineteenth century as demand for sugar in Europe continued to increase: "average consumption in Britain rose from four pounds per head in 1700 to eighteen pounds in 1800, thirty-six pounds by 1850 and over one hundred pounds by the twentieth century."{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOenYGilfd8C&amp;pg=PA698 698]}}
In the 19th century Cuba rose to become the richest land in the Caribbean (with sugar as its dominant crop) because it formed the only major island [[landmass]] free of mountainous terrain. Instead, nearly three-quarters of its land formed a rolling plain — ideal for planting crops. Cuba also prospered above other islands because Cubans used better methods when harvesting the sugar crops: they adopted modern milling methods such as [[watermill]]s, enclosed furnaces, [[steam engine]]s, and vacuum pans. All these technologies increased productivity. Cuba also retained slavery longer than the most of the rest of the Caribbean islands.{{sfn|Ponting|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOenYGilfd8C&amp;pg=PA698 698–9]}}

After the [[Haitian Revolution]] established the independent state of [[Haiti]], sugar production in that country declined and [[History of Cuba|Cuba]] replaced Saint-Domingue as the world's largest producer.

Long established in [[Brazil]], sugar production spread to other parts of [[South America]], as well as to newer European colonies in [[Africa]] and in the Pacific, where it became especially important in [[Fiji]]. [[Mauritius]], [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and [[Queensland]] in Australia started growing sugar. The older and newer sugar production areas now tended to use indentured labour rather than slaves, with workers "shipped across the world ... [and] ... held in conditions of near slavery for up to ten years... In the second half of the nineteenth century over 450,000 indentured labourers went from India to the British West Indies, others went to Natal, Mauritius and Fiji (where they became a majority of the population). In Queensland workers from the Pacific islands were moved in. On [[Hawaii]], they came from [[China]] and [[Japan]]. The Dutch transferred large numbers of people from [[Java]] to [[Surinam]]."{{sfn|Ponting|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOenYGilfd8C&amp;pg=PA739 739]}}
It is said that the sugar plantations would not have thrived without the aid of the African slaves. In [[Colombia]], the planting of sugar started very early on, and entrepreneurs imported many African slaves to cultivate the fields. The industrialization of the Colombian industry started in 1901 with the establishment of [[Manuelita]], the first steam-powered sugar mill in South America, by [[Latvian Jews|Latvian Jewish]] immigrant [[James Martin Eder]].

== The rise of beet sugar ==
[[File:Šurany cukrovar1.jpg|thumb|[[Sugar refinery]] in [[Šurany]] (Slovakia) founded in 1854 (a picture is from 1900).]]
:''More information in the History section at [[Sugar beet]]''

In 1747 the German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf|Andreas Marggraf]] identified sucrose in [[Sugar beet|beet root]].&lt;ref&gt;Marggraf (1747) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJQDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Experiences chimiques faites dans le dessein de tirer un veritable sucre de diverses plantes, qui croissent dans nos contrées"] [Chemical experiments made with the intention of extracting real sugar from diverse plants that grow in our lands], ''Histoire de l'académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres de Berlin'', pages 79-90.&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery remained a mere curiosity for some time, but eventually Marggraf's student [[Franz Carl Achard|Franz Achard]] built a sugar beet processing factory at [[Cunern]] in [[Silesia]] (in present-day [[Konary, Wołów County|Konary]] in Poland), under the patronage of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] (reigned 1797–1840). While never profitable, this plant operated from 1801 until it suffered destruction during the [[Napoleonic War]]s (ca. 1802–1815).

[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], cut off from Caribbean imports by a British [[blockade]], and at any rate not wanting to fund British merchants, banned imports of sugar in 1813. A beet sugar industry emerged, especially after [[Jean-Baptiste Quéruel]] industrialized the operation of [[Benjamin Delessert]].

In the developed countries, the sugar industry relies on machinery with a low requirement for manpower. A large beet refinery producing around 1,500 tonnes of sugar a day needs a permanent workforce of about 150 for 24-hour production.

Sugar beets provide approximately 30% of world sugar production.

== Mechanization ==

Beginning in the late 18th century, the production of sugar became increasingly mechanized. The [[steam engine]] first powered a sugar mill in [[Jamaica]] in 1768, and soon after, steam replaced direct firing as the source of process heat.

In 1813 the [[Great Britain|British]] chemist [[Edward Charles Howard]] invented a method of refining sugar that involved boiling the cane juice not in an open kettle, but in a closed vessel heated by steam and held under partial vacuum. At reduced pressure, water boils at a lower temperature, and this development both saved fuel and reduced the amount of sugar lost through [[caramelization]]. Further gains in fuel-efficiency came from the [[multiple-effect evaporator]], designed by the [[United States]] engineer [[Norbert Rillieux]] (perhaps as early as the 1820s, although the first working model dates from 1845). This system consisted of a series of vacuum pans, each held at a lower pressure than the previous one. The vapors from each pan served to heat the next, with minimal heat wasted. Modern  industries use multiple-effect evaporators for evaporating water.

The process of separating sugar from [[molasses]] also received mechanical attention: David Weston first applied the [[centrifuge]] to this task in [[Hawaii]] in 1852.

In the United States and Japan, [[high-fructose corn syrup]] has replaced sugar in some uses, particularly in soft drinks and processed foods.

The process by which high-fructose corn syrup is produced was first developed by Richard O. Marshall and Earl R. Kooi in 1957.{{sfn|Marshall|Kooi|1957}} The industrial production process was refined by Dr. Y. Takasaki at Agency of Industrial Science and Technology of Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan in 1965–1970. High-fructose corn syrup was rapidly introduced to many processed foods and [[soft drink]]s in the United States from around 1975 to 1985.

A system of sugar tariffs and sugar quotas imposed in 1977 in the United States significantly increased the cost of imported sugar and U.S. producers sought cheaper sources. High-fructose corn syrup, derived from corn, is more economical because the domestic U.S. price of sugar is twice the global price&lt;ref name="Grist 10.05.2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2006/5/10/135951/485 |work=[[Grist]] |author=Tom Philpott |title=ADM, high-fructose corn syrup, and ethanol |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the price of [[maize|corn]] is kept low through government subsidies paid to growers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iatp.org/iatp/factsheets.cfm?accountID=258&amp;refID=89968 Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203158/http://www.iatp.org/iatp/factsheets.cfm?accountID=258&amp;refID=89968 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/1127_corn_acreage_production_and_value_by.html|title=Corn--Acreage, Production, and Value, by Leading States statistics - USA Census numbers|website=www.allcountries.org|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-fructose corn syrup became an attractive substitute, and is preferred over cane sugar among the vast majority of American food and beverage manufacturers.  Soft drink makers such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] use sugar in other nations, but switched to high-fructose corn syrup in the United States in 1984.&lt;ref name="Freedom 04.1998"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0498d.asp |title=The Great Sugar Shaft |author=James Bovard |date=April 1998 |work=Freedom Daily |publisher=The Future of Freedom Foundation |accessdate=9 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829181738/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0498d.asp |archivedate=29 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average American consumed approximately {{convert|37.8|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of high-fructose corn syrup in 2008, versus {{convert|46.7|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of sucrose.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/FoodConsumption/FoodAvailQueriable.aspx | title=U.S. per capita food availability&amp;nbsp;– Sugar and sweeteners (individual) | publisher=[[Economic Research Service]] | date=2010-02-16| accessdate=2010-03-12}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years it has been hypothesized that the increase of high-fructose corn syrup usage in processed foods may be linked to various [[Fructose#Potential health effects|health conditions]], including [[metabolic syndrome]], [[hypertension]], [[dyslipidemia]], [[hepatic steatosis]], [[insulin resistance]], and [[obesity]]. However, there is to date little evidence that high-fructose corn syrup is any unhealthier, calorie for calorie, than sucrose or other simple sugars. The fructose content and fructose:glucose ratio of high-fructose corn syrup do not differ markedly from clarified apple juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46575508_Sugar_composition_of_depectinized_apple_juices_Composicao_de_acucares_em_sucos_de_macas_despectinizados|title=Sugar composition of depectinized apple juices Composição de açúcares em sucos de maçãs despectinizados|first1=Gilvan|last1=Wosiacki|first2=Alessandro|last2=Nogueira|first3=Frederico|last3=Denardi|first4=Renato|last4=Vieira|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2018|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers hypothesize that fructose may trigger the process by which fats are formed, to a greater extent than other simple sugars.&lt;ref name="Samuel 2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Samuel|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most commonly used blends of high-fructose corn syrup contain a nearly one-to-one ratio of fructose and glucose, just like common sucrose, and should therefore be metabolically identical after the first steps of [[sucrose phosphorylase|sucrose metabolism]], in which the sucrose is split into fructose and glucose components. At the very least, the increasing prevalence of high-fructose corn syrup has certainly led to an increase in added sugar calories in food, which may reasonably increase the incidence of these and other diseases.&lt;ref name="Collino 2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collino|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--==Sweet potatoes==
After the 21st century it was discovered that sugar can be obtained from sweet potatoes. And in some areas of South Asia this practice is common by sugar mill owners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}--&gt;

'''Hypodysfibrinogenemia''', also termed '''congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia''', is a rare hereditary [[List of fibrinogen disorders|fibrinogen disorder]] cause by mutations in one or more of the genes that encode a factor critical for [[blood clotting]], [[fibrinogen]]. These mutations result in the production and circulation at reduced levels of fibrinogen at least some of which is dysfunctional.&lt;ref name="pmid28211264"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casini A, Brungs T, Lavenu-Bombled C, Vilar R, Neerman-Arbez M, de Moerloose P | title = Genetics, diagnosis and clinical features of congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia: a systematic literature review and report of a novel mutation | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 876–888 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28211264 | doi = 10.1111/jth.13655 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypodysfibrinogenemia exhibits [[Penetrance#Degrees of penetrance|reduced penetrance]], i.e. only some family members with the mutated gene develop symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casini A, de Moerloose P, Neerman-Arbez M | title = Clinical Features and Management of Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiencies | journal = Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 366–74 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27019462 | doi = 10.1055/s-0036-1571339 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28550239"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caimi G, Canino B, Lo Presti R, Urso C, Hopps E | title = Clinical conditions responsible for hyperviscosity and skin ulcers complications | journal = Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2017 | pmid = 28550239 | doi = 10.3233/CH-160218 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disorder is similar to a form of [[dysfibrinogenemia]] termed congenital dysfibrinogenemia. However, congenital dysfibrinogenemia differs form hypodysfibrinogenemia in four ways. Congenital dysfibrinogenemia involves: the circulation at normal levels of fibrinogen at least some of which is dysfunctional; a different set of causative gene mutations; a somewhat different mix of clinical symptoms; and a much lower rate of penetrance.&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28550239"/&gt;

Hypodysfibrinogenemia causes episodes of pathological bleeding and thrombosis due not only to low levels of circulating fibrinogen but also to the dysfunction of a portion of the circulating fibrinogen. The disorder can lead to very significant bleeding during even minor surgical procedures and women afflicted with the disorderoften suffer significant bleeding during and after giving child birth, higher rates of miscarriages, and [[menorrhagia]], i.e. [[abnormal uterine bleeding|abnormally heavy bleeding]] during the [[menstruation|menstrual period]].&lt;ref name="pmid28211264"/&gt;

== Presentation ==
In of study of 32 individuals diagnoses with hypodysfibrinogenemia, 41% presented with episodic bleeding, 43% presented with episodic thrombosis, and 16% were asymptomatic, being detected by abnormal blood tests.&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"/&gt; Bleeding and thrombosis generally begin in adulthood with the average age at the time of presentation and diagnosis being 32 years. Bleeding is more frequent and severe in women of child-bearing age; these women may suffer miscarriages, [[menometrorrhagia]], and excessive bleeding during child birth and/or the [[postpartum]] period. Excessive bleeding following major or minor surgery, including dental extractions, occurs in both females and males with the disorder. Thrombotic complications of the disorder are often (~50%) recurrent and can involve central and peripheral arteries, deep and superficial veins. Thrombotic events may be serious and involve occlusion of a [[cerebral artery]] leading to [[stroke]], [[Hepatic portal systems|splanchnic venous thrombosis]], and [[pulmonary thrombosis]] presumptively secondary to [[deep vein thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid28211264"/&gt;

== Fibrinogen ==
Circulating fibrinogen is a [[glycoprotein]] made of two [[Protein trimer|trimers]] each of which is composed of three polypeptide chains, [[Fibrinogen alpha chain|Aα]] (also termed α) encoded by the ''FGA'' gene, [[Fibrinogen beta chain|Bβ]] (also termed β) encoded by the ''FGB'' gene, and γ encoded by the ''FGG'' gene. All three genes are located on the long or "q" arm of human chromosome 4 (at [[Locus (genetics)#Nomenclature|positions]] 4q31.3, 4q31.3, and 4q32.1, respectively) and are the sites where mutations occur that code for a dysfunctional fibrinogen and/or reduced fibrinogen levels which are the cause of congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia.&lt;ref name="pmid27019463"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neerman-Arbez M, de Moerloose P, Casini A | title = Laboratory and Genetic Investigation of Mutations Accounting for Congenital Fibrinogen Disorders | journal = Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 356–65 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27019463 | doi = 10.1055/s-0036-1571340 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27784620"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duval C, Ariëns RA | title = Fibrinogen splice variation and cross-linking: Effects on fibrin structure/function and role of fibrinogen γ' as thrombomobulin II | journal = Matrix Biology | volume = 60-61 | issue = | pages = 8–15 | year = 2017 | pmid = 27784620 | doi = 10.1016/j.matbio.2016.09.010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
Congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia is inherited as an [[autosomal dominant]] disorder caused by at least 32 different types of single mutations. Ten of these mutations are in the ''FGA'' gene, 5 in the ''FGB'' gene, and 17 in the FGG gene. The mutations are mainly [[missense mutations]] with [[nonsense mutation|nonsense]] and [[Frameshift mutation]]s each occurring in 12.5% of cases.&lt;ref name="pmid28211264"/&gt; The causes of two fibrinogen abnormalities that characterize hypodysfibrinogenemia, i.e. circulation at reduced levels of fibrinogen at least some of which is dysfunctional, reflect different molecular mechanisms:&lt;ref name="pmid27019463"/&gt; 
# A [[heterozygous]] mutation in one of the two copies of either  the ''FGA, FGB,'' or ''FGG'' gene leads to production of a fibrinogen that is both dysfunctional and poorly secreted into the blood stream, e.g. fibrinogen Vlissingen, fibrinogen Philadelphia, and fibrinogen Freiburg.  
# A [[homozygous]] mutation in both copies of one of the cited genes leads to production of a fibrinogen that is both dysfunctional and poorly secreted into the blood stream, e.g. fibrinogen Otago,  fibrinogen Marburg, and fibrinogen Sfax.
# Two different mutations (see [[Compound heterozygosity]]) occur in each of the two copies of one of the cited genes, with one mutation coding for reduced formation of a functionally normal circulating fibrinogen and the second mutation coding for the circulation of a dysfunctional fibrinogen, e.g. fibrinogen Leipzig.
# Two different mutations occur in one copy of the cited genes, with one mutation causing hypofibrinogenemia and the other mutation coding for a dysfunctional fibrinogen, e.g. fibrinogen Keokuk.

The following Table adds further information on the just cited examples of hypodysfibrinogenemias. The Table gives: '''a)''' each mutated protein's trivial name; '''b)''' the gene mutated (i.e. ''FGA, FGB,'' or ''FGG''), its mutation site (i.e. numbered nucleotide in the [[cloned]] gene), and name of the nucleotides (i.e. [[cytosine|C]], [[thymine|T]], [[adenine|A]], [[guanine|G]]) at these sites before&gt;after the mutation; '''c)''' the name of the altered fibrinogen peptide (Aα, Bβ, or λ) and the amino acids (using [[amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|standard abbreviations]]) occurring before-after the mutation at the numbered amino acid(s) sites in the circulating mutated fibrinogen; '''d)''' the [[pathophysiology]] for the mutated fibrinogen's misfunction(s); and '''e)''' the clinical consequence(s) of the mutation. Unless noted as a deletion (del) or frame shift (fs), all mutations are [[missense mutation|missense]] or [[nonsense mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid28211264"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27019463"/&gt; A [[nonsense mutation]] causing a premature [[stop codon]] and thereby a shorten polypeptide chain is notated by an X (PSC) after the altered amino acid codon.

== Diagnosis ==
Hypodysfibrinogenemia is usually diagnosed in individuals who: have a history of abnormal bleeding or thrombosis or are a [[Consanguinity|close blood relative]] of such an individual. Initial laboratory findings include a decrease in serum fibrinogen mass levels as measured by [[immunoassay]] plus a reduction in inducible blood clot formation so that the ratio of functionally-detected fibrinogen mass (i.e. detected in induced clots) to immunoassay-detected fibrinogen mass is abnormally low, i.e. &lt;0.7. This contrast with individuals with congenital dysfibrinogenemia who exhibit normal levels of fibrinogen as measured by immunoassay but low functionally-detected to immunoassay-detected fibrinogen mass ratios, i.e. &lt;0.7. Where available, specialized laboratories can conduct studies to define the exact gene mutation(s) and fibrinogen abnormalities underlying the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid28211264"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25816717"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casini A, Neerman-Arbez M, Ariëns RA, de Moerloose P | title = Dysfibrinogenemia: from molecular anomalies to clinical manifestations and management | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 909–19 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25816717 | doi = 10.1111/jth.12916 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Blood relatives of the [[proband]] case should be evaluated for the presence of hypodysfibrinogenemia. Individuals with the disorder need to be advised on its inheritance, complications, and preventative measures that can be taken to avoid bleeding and/or thrombosis. Since &gt;80% of individuals may develop bleeding or thrombosis complications of the disorder, asymptomatic individuals diagnosed with hydposyfibrinogenemia are best handled at a specialized center in order to benefit from multidisciplinary management.&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"/&gt;

Measures to prevent and/or treat complications of hypodysfibrinogenemia should be tailored to the personal and family history of the individual by a specialized center. Individuals with a personal or family history of bleeding are considered to be of low risk of bleeding when their functional fibrinogen levels are &gt;1 gram/liter for major surgery, &gt;0.5 gram/liter for minor surgery, &gt;0.5 to 1-2 gram/liter for spontaneous bleeding (depending on its severity), &gt;0.5 to &gt; 1 gram/liter for the first two trimesters of pregnancy, and &gt;1 to &lt;2 gram/liter for the last trimester of pregnancy and postpartum period. Functional fibrinogen below these levels should be treated preferably with fibrinogen concentrate or if not available, fibrinogen-rich [[cryoprecipitate]] or plasma to attain low risk levels of functional fibrinogen.&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"/&gt; [[Antifibrinolytic]] drugs such as [[tranexamic acid]] or (ε-aminocaproic acid) may be considered as an alternative preventative or therapeutic treatments in cases of minor surgery, dental extractions, mucosal bleeding, or other episodes of mild bleeding.&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27019463"/&gt; In individuals with a personal or family history of thrombosis, should be considered for long-term [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulation drugs]] such as [[low molecular weight heparin]], [[Warfarin|coumadin]], or [[rivaroxaban]].&lt;ref name="pmid27019462"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2199">The '''Jaeger chart''' is an [[eye chart]] used in testing near [[Visual acuity|vision acuity]]. It is a card on which paragraphs of text are printed, with the [[Text size|text sizes]] increasing from 0.37mm to 2.5mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medical Assisting Administrative and Clinical Competencies |first1=Michelle |last1=Blesi |first2=Barbara |last2=Wise |first3=Cathy |last3=Kelley-Arney |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7XMJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA888 |pages=888–890}}&lt;/ref&gt; This card is to be held by a patient at a fixed distance from the eye dependent on the J size being read. The smallest print that the patient can read determines their visual acuity.&lt;ref name="PalPal2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=G.K. &amp; Pal|author2=Pal|author3=Pravati|title=Textbook Of Practical Physiology - 2Nd Edn.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpUAihQ7Ib4C&amp;pg=PA328|date=1 February 2006|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-2904-5|pages=328–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original 1867 chart had a text containing seven paragraphs and a corresponding seven-point scale.&lt;ref name="khurana"&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory and Practice of Optics and Refraction |author=Khurana |publisher=Elsevier India |year=2008 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYeD3VHi8OsC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaeger cards are not standardized, and the variability of the actual size of test letters on different Jaeger cards currently in use is very high.&lt;ref name="Col2007"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=August |last1=Colenbrander | first2=Paul E.| last2=Runge |title=Can Jaeger Numbers be Standardized?

More commonly, distance vision acuity is tested using the [[Snellen chart]], familiarly seen wall mounted with a large letter at the top.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">'''Dr Kevin James Fagan''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] (5 February 1909 - 1992) was an Australian doctor and [[World War II]] hero.

After attending [[St Ignatius' College, Riverview]] on a bursary, Fagan was Dux of the School in both 1925 and 1926, enabling him to study [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|Medicine]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. He lived on campus at [[St John's College, University of Sydney]] from 1927-32.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After graduation, he returned to [[Tasmania]] and became Superintendent of Hobart General Hospital in 1937. Shortly after the outbreak of [[World War II]] he joined the Army Medical Corps and was posted to [[Singapore]] in 1942 with the 8th Division. He was soon a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese, first in [[Changi Prison|Changi]] and later on the infamous [[Thai-Burma Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raafawa.org.au/air_mail/FebMar05/Airmail_p3.pdf Profile], raafawa.org.au; accessed 12 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&amp;veteranId=182820 Profile], ww2roll.gov.au; accessed 12 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

An outstanding surgeon, he was every bit as influential in his care of the sick and injured soldiers as the high-profile Sir [[Weary Dunlop]]. One of many testimonies from the [[Australian War Memorial]] reads:
: 'To many an unfortunate digger and others who rolled and tossed and cried out with the well nigh insufferable agony of those….. ulcers came a man who ceased suffering and pain and taking limbs off in many cases he put them on the road to home again. Yes Major Fagan, the diggers’ children will hear your name spoken with feelings of gratitude for many a long day to come. For the noble work you did, your name will be memorable'.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74831">This is a summary of notable incidents that have taken place at various independently owned [[amusement parks]], [[water parks]] or [[theme parks]].  This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that have a significant impact on the parks or park operations, or are otherwise significantly newsworthy.

The term ''incidents'' refers to major accidents, injuries, deaths and significant crimes. While these incidents are required to be reported to regulatory authorities for investigation, attraction-related incidents usually fall into one of the following categories:
*Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance.
*Caused by negligence on the part of the guest.  This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to break park rules.
* The result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues.
* [[Act of God]] or a generic accident (e.g. slipping and falling) that is not a direct result of an action on anyone's part.

==Action Park==
{{main article|Action Park}}
* On July 8, 1980, a 19-year-old park employee was riding the ''Alpine Slide'' when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents"/&gt;
* On July 24, 1982, a 15-year-old boy drowned in the ''Tidal Wave Pool''.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents"&gt;[http://www.rideaccidents.com/water.html Water Ride Fatalities 1972-1997] at rideaccidents.com, retrieved January 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* On August 1, 1982, a 27-year-old man from [[Long Island]] got out of his tipped [[kayak]] on the ''Kayak Experience'' to ride it. While doing so, he stepped on a grate that was either in contact with, or came too close to, a section of live [[wire|wiring]] for the underwater fans that somehow became exposed and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into [[cardiac arrest]]. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby [[Warwick (village), New York|Warwick, New York]] where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; The park at first disputed that the [[electric current]] caused his death, saying there were no [[burn (injury)|burns]] on his body, but the [[coroner]] responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based [[electrocution]].&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt; The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was "just a nick," while others said it was closer to 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm). The state's [[New Jersey Department of Labor|Labor Department]] found that the fan was properly maintained and installed and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however it also said that the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents" /&gt; While the park said it was vindicated, it never reopened the ride, saying that people would be afraid to go on it afterwards.&lt;ref name="Traction Park"&gt;Austin, Joanne; "Revisiting Traction ... Er, ''Action'', Park," ''[[Weird NJ]]'', October 2005, pages 20-24&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1984, a fatal heart attack suffered by one visitor was unofficially believed to have been triggered by the shock of the cold water in the pool beneath the ''Tarzan Swing''. The water on the ride and in that swimming area was 50-60&amp;nbsp;°F (10-16&amp;nbsp;°C) while other water areas were in the 70-80&amp;nbsp;°F (21-27&amp;nbsp;°C) range more typical of swimming pools. The ''Tarzan Swing'' and the ''Cannonball ''ride in this area were operated by spring water.&lt;ref name="Traction Park" /&gt;
* On August 27 of that year, a 20-year-old from [[Brooklyn]] drowned in the ''Tidal Wave Pool''
* On July 19, 1987, an 18-year-old from [[Queens]] drowned in the ''Tidal Wave Pool''.&lt;ref name="Water Ride Accidents" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Adventure Park at Grants Mill==
* On May 10, 2018, the park management closed the park permanently and had attractions dismantled, after receiving 49 code violations from city and fire inspections. Most of the violations were related to exposed wiring. The park originally opened on October 5, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* On May 26, 1985, a 29-year-old man was killed while riding the ''Cyclone''. He stood up and struck his head on a crossbeam.
* On August 23, 1988, a 26-year-old man was killed after falling from the ''Cyclone''. The man was a maintenance worker and was the only passenger at the time, riding in the back seat of the train during his lunch break.  Apparently, he eluded the safety bar and was seen standing up as the train began its descent down the first hill. He fell {{convert|30|ft|m}} and landed on a crossbeam of a lower section of track. He was killed instantly. The ride was closed following the incident, but was reopened a day later after safety inspectors concluded that the ride was safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rideaccidents.com/coasters.html|title=U.S. Roller Coaster Fatalities (1972-1997)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thunder River Rapids Ride===
{{main article|Thunder River Rapids Ride incident}}
*On October 25, 2016, four people—two men aged 35 and 38, and two women aged 32 and 42—were killed when the raft they were riding hit another stopped raft, causing it to flip. Eyewitness accounts noted that the water level in the channel had dropped prior to the incident, but the drop did not trigger a sensor that would have stopped the ride. Investigators believe that the occupied raft was pushed up onto a stopped raft by a conveyor belt, at first mounting the stopped raft then flipping over. Of the six passengers aboard the raft, two children—aged 10 and 12—were ejected from the raft but survived, while the two men were believed to be crushed under the raft and the two women were trapped underneath the conveyor belt. Dreamworld officials stated that the ride had just passed its annual inspection in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-25/four-people-dead-ride-at-dreamworld-gold-coast/7963880|title=Dreamworld: Four people killed on Thunder River Rapids ride at Gold Coast theme park|publisher=ABC News|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/33001335/one-person-seriously-injured-at-dreamworld/#page1|title=Four dead in Gold Coast tragedy: Dreamworld closed indefinitely|author=Niamh Hannon|work=Yahoo! 7 News|publisher=Yahoo!|date=October 25, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com.au/national/2016/10/26/20/25/investigators-piecing-together-how-fatal-accident-unfolded|title=Dreamworld tragedy: Investigators piecing together how fatal accident unfolded|work=9news.com.au|publisher=Nine Digital PTY, Ltd.|date=October 26, 2016|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9 [[Ardent Leisure]] chief executive [[Deborah Thomas]] announced that the ride would be permanently closed and demolished.&lt;ref name="rapidsride"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-09/dreamworld-theme-park-demolish-ride-gold-coast/8007870 |title=Dreamworld's Thunder River Rapids Ride to be demolished after theme park deaths |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work=ABC News |date=9 November 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*On June 14, 1986, the fourth car of the yellow train derailed before encountering the third and final loop. The train failed to clear the loop and slid backwards fishtailing wildly and crashing into a concrete pillar. Damage from the derailment caused the lap bars to disengage at some point during the ride, throwing its four passengers at least 25 feet (7.6 m) to the floor below. Three passengers died in the incident, while a fourth was critically injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 19 others were treated for less severe injuries at the nearby Misericordia Community Hospital. An investigation determined that bolts on the left wheel assembly worked loose causing the accident, and that design flaws by Schwarzkopf along with a lack of maintenance by the mall were likely to blame. When Mindbender reopened in January 1987, the trains were redesigned. Existing four-car trains were converted to three-car trains (reducing seating capacity from 16 to 12), and anti-roll back features were installed. The lap bar restraint was retained, but seat belts and shoulder headrests were added.

*On April 2, 2011, a 3-year-old boy from [[Dolton, Illinois]] was killed while he was riding the kiddie coaster with his twin brother at the indoor amusement center. He was struck by a moving train when he fell off the ride about to 3 or 4 feet after he was ejected from his safety restraints and was wedged between one of the cars. The boy was pronounced dead on scene according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office after being taken to a nearby hospital and he died from his injuries. His twin brother was not injured in the accident and was able to get off the ride safely once the train returned to the station. The facility was shut down for a brief time shortly after, but later re-opened along with the ride to make sure it was running properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Boy-3-Dies-on-Roller-Coaster-at-Go-Bananas-Norridge-Family-Amusement-Center-119143109.html|title=Boy, 3, Dies on Indoor Roller Coaster - NBC Chicago|publisher=WMAQ-TV|date=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Raven===
* On May 31, 2003, a 32-year-old female from [[New York City]], died after falling out of ''The Raven'' roller coaster. The victim was visiting the park to attend "Stark Raven Mad 2003", an event hosting roller coaster enthusiasts from around the United States. At approximately 8:00 pm, the victim and her fiancé boarded ''The Raven'' in the last row of the train. Following a safety check of her lap bar and seat belt by a ride operator, the train left the station. Multiple witnesses reported that they saw her "virtually standing up" during the ride's initial and subsequent drops. During the ride's {{convert|69|ft}} drop, also called the fifth drop, she was ejected from the car and onto the tracks. When the train returned to the station, the victim's fiancé, ride operators, and a passenger who was a doctor ran back along the tracks, at which point they found her lying under the structure of the roller coaster at the fifth drop. The doctor, aided by park medical personnel, began [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] until an ambulance arrived.

The characteristic measles [[rash]] is classically described as a generalized [[erythema|red]] [[maculopapular rash|maculopapular]] rash that begins several days after the fever starts. It starts on the back of the ears and, after a few hours, spreads to the head and neck before spreading to cover most of the body, often causing [[itch]]ing.

The rash is said to "stain", changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Measles/Pages/Symptoms.aspx NHS UK: Symptoms of measles.

In developed countries, it is recommended that  children be immunized against measles at 12 months, generally as part of a three-part [[MMR vaccine]] (measles, [[mumps]], and [[rubella]]). The vaccine is generally not given before this age because such infants respond inadequately to the vaccine due to an immature immune system.&lt;ref name="Leuridan2012"/&gt; A second dose of the vaccine is usually given to children between the ages of four and five, to increase rates of immunity. Vaccination rates have been high enough to make measles relatively uncommon. Adverse reactions to vaccination are rare, with fever and pain at the injection site being the most common. Life-threatening adverse reactions occur in less than one per million vaccinations (&lt;0.0001%).&lt;ref name="cubavac"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galindo BM, Concepción D, Galindo MA, Pérez A, Saiz J | title = Vaccine-related adverse events in Cuban children, 1999–2008 | journal = MEDICC Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–43 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22334111 | doi =  | url = http://www.medicc.org/mediccreview/index.php?issue=19&amp;id=237&amp;a=vahtml | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224083721/http://www.medicc.org/mediccreview/index.php?issue=19&amp;id=237&amp;a=vahtml | archivedate = 2012-02-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) has long recommended that all adult international travelers who do not have positive evidence of previous measles immunity receive two doses of MMR vaccine before traveling.&lt;ref name="ACIP2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLean HQ, Fiebelkorn AP, Temte JL, Wallace GS; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Prevention of measles, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, and mumps, 2013: summary recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)|date=14 June 2013|volume=62|issue=RR-04|pages=1–34|pmid=23760231|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a retrospective study of pre-travel consultations with prospective travelers at CDC-associated travel clinics found that of the 16% of adult travelers who were considered eligible for vaccination, only 47% underwent vaccination during the consultation; of these, patient refusal accounted for nearly half (48%), followed by healthcare provider decisions (28%) and barriers in the health system (24%).&lt;ref name="HyleLaRoque2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyle EP, Rao SR, Jentes ES, Parker Fiebelkorn A, Hagmann SHF, Taylor Walker A, Walensky RP, Ryan ET, LaRocque RC|title=Missed Opportunities for Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination Among Departing U.S. Adult Travelers Receiving Pretravel Health Consultations|journal=Ann Intern Med|date=18 July 2017|volume=167|issue=2|pages=77–84|doi=10.7326/M16-2249|pmid=28505632|accessdate=|pmc=5513758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no specific [[antiviral treatment]] if measles develops.&lt;ref name="CDC2018Health"/&gt; Instead the medications are generally aimed at treating superinfections, maintaining good hydration with adequate fluids, and pain relief.&lt;ref name=CDC2018Health/&gt;&lt;!-- Quote = There is no specific antiviral therapy for measles. Medical care is supportive and to help relieve symptoms and address complications such as bacterial infections. --&gt; Some groups are also given [[vitamin A]], like young children and the severely malnourished, which act as an immunomodulator that boosts the antibody responses to measles and decreases the risk of serious complications.&lt;ref name=CDC2018Health/&gt;&lt;!-- Quote = Severe measles cases among children, such as those who are hospitalized, should be treated with vitamin A.

===Medications===
Treatment addresses symptoms, with [[ibuprofen]] or [[paracetamol]] to reduce fever and pain and, if required, a fast-acting [[bronchodilator|medication to dilate the airways]] for cough. As for [[aspirin]], some research has suggested a correlation between children who take aspirin and the development of [[Reye syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casteels-Van Daele M, Van Geet C, Wouters C, Eggermont E | title = Reye syndrome revisited: a descriptive term covering a group of heterogeneous disorders | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 159 | issue = 9 | pages = 641–48 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 11014461 | doi = 10.1007/PL00008399 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/kb0pe634bymrn2ur/ | quote = Reye syndrome is a non-specific descriptive term covering a group of heterogeneous disorders.

Measles is extremely infectious and its continued circulation in a community depends on the generation of susceptible hosts by birth of children. In communities which generate insufficient new hosts the disease will die out. This concept was first recognized in measles by Bartlett in 1957, who referred to the minimum number supporting measles as the [[critical community size]] (CCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=M.S.|title=Measles periodicity and community size|journal=J.

Even in countries where vaccination has been introduced, rates may remain high. Measles is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality. Worldwide, the fatality rate has been significantly reduced by a vaccination campaign led by partners in the [[Measles Initiative]]: the [[American Red Cross]], the United States' [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the WHO. Globally, measles fell 60% from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/media_38076.html UNICEF Joint Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204152400/http://www.unicef.org/media/media_38076.html |date=2015-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for 2008 indicate deaths fell further to 164,000 globally, with 77% of the remaining measles deaths in 2008 occurring within the Southeast Asian region.&lt;ref&gt;WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record, 4th December 2009 [http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8449/en/index.html WHO.int] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026035711/http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8449/en/index.html |date=2013-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five out of six WHO regions have set goals to eliminate measles, and at the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010, delegates agreed on a global target of a 95% reduction in measles mortality by 2015 from the level seen in 2000, as well as to move towards eventual [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]]. However, no specific global target date for eradication has yet been agreed to as of May 2010.&lt;ref name="WHA63_11_15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA63/A63_18-en.pdf |title=Sixty-third World Health Assembly Agenda provisional agenda item 11.15 Global eradication of measles |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329034005/http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA63/A63_18-en.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO63_daily_notes_4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2010/wha63/journal4/en/index.html |title=Sixty-third World Health Assembly notes from day four |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526133925/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2010/wha63/journal4/en/index.html |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States was declared free of circulating measles in 2000 with 911 cases from 2001 to 2011. In 2014 the CDC said endemic measles, rubella, and [[congenital rubella syndrome]] has not returned to the United States.&lt;ref name=PapaniaSeward2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papania MJ, Wallace GS, Rota PA, Icenogle JP, Fiebelkorn AP, Armstrong GL, Reef SE,  Redd SB, Abernathy ES, Barskey AE, Hao L, McLean HQ, Rota JS, Bellini WJ, Seward JF|title=Elimination of endemic measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome from the Western hemisphere: the US experience|journal=JAMA Pediatr|date=February 2014|volume=168|issue=2|pages=148–55|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.4342|pmid=24311021|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1787786|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311005749/http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1787786|archivedate=2015-03-11|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional measles outbreaks persist because of cases imported from abroad, of which more than half are the result of unvaccinated U.S. residents who are infected abroad and infect others upon return to the United States.&lt;ref name=PapaniaSeward2014/&gt; As noted above, the ACIP has long recommended that all adult international travelers who do not have positive evidence of previous measles immunity receive two doses of MMR vaccine before traveling,&lt;ref name="ACIP2013"/&gt; but it has been reported that only 47% of eligible travelers underwent vaccination during pre-travel medical consultations.&lt;ref name="HyleLaRoque2017"/&gt;

Despite the elimination of measles from the United States, there is still cause for concern that cases may come from other countries and infect the population. Measles vaccination throughout the population in order to prevent outbreaks like these is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multistate Measles Outbreak Associated with an International Youth Sporting Event – Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Texas, August–September 2007|website=Www.cdc.gov|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a1.htm|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2014, an outbreak was initiated in [[Ohio]] when two unvaccinated [[Amish]] men returned to the United States from missionary work in the Philippines, harboring asymptomatic measles.&lt;ref name="Gastanaduy2016"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gastañaduy PA, Budd J, Fisher N, Redd SB, Fletcher J, Miller J, McFadden DJ 3rd, Rota J, Rota PA, Hickman C, Fowler B, Tatham L, Wallace GS, de Fijter S, Parker Fiebelkorn A, DiOrio M|title=A Measles Outbreak in an Underimmunized Amish Community in Ohio|journal=N Engl J Med|date=6 October 2016|volume=375|issue=14|pages=1343–54|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1602295|pmid=27705270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their return to a community with low vaccination rates led to an outbreak that rose to include a total of 383 outbreak-related cases across nine counties.&lt;ref name="Gastanaduy2016"/&gt; Of the 383 cases, 340 (89%) occurred in unvaccinated individuals.&lt;ref name="Gastanaduy2016"/&gt;

From January 4 to April 2, 2015, there were 159 cases of measles reported to the CDC. Of those 159 cases, 111 (70%) were determined to have come from an earlier exposure in late December 2014. This outbreak was believed to have originated from the [[Disneyland]] [[theme park]] in California. The Disneyland outbreak was held responsible for the infection of 147 people in seven U.S. states as well as Mexico and Canada, the majority of which were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2015/12/year-in-review-measles-linked-to-disneyland/ |title=Year in Review: Measles Linked to Disneyland |accessdate=2017-05-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519211805/https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2015/12/year-in-review-measles-linked-to-disneyland/ |archivedate=2017-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the cases 48% were unvaccinated and 38% were unsure of their vaccination status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6414a1.htm&amp;#124;website=cdc.gov&amp;#124;accessdate=30|title=Measles – United States, January 4 – April 2, 2015|last=Clemmons|first=Nakia|date=|website=cdc.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial exposure to the virus was never identified.

In 2015, a U.S. woman in [[Washington state]] died of [[pneumonia]], as a result of measles.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of measles}}
[[File:Measles Aztec drawing.jpg|left|thumb|16th-century [[Aztec]] drawing of someone with measles]]
Estimates based on modern molecular biology place the emergence of measles as a human disease sometime after 500 AD&lt;ref name="Furuse2010"/&gt; (the former speculation that the [[Antonine Plague]] of 165–180 AD was caused by measles is now discounted). The first systematic description of measles, and its distinction from smallpox and [[chickenpox]], is credited to the [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Persian]] physician [[Rhazes]] (860–932), who published ''The Book of Smallpox and Measles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cohen SG|title=Measles and immunomodulation|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=121|issue=2|pages=543–44|date=February 2008|pmid=18269930|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.12.1152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given what is now known about the evolution of measles, Rhazes' account is remarkably timely, as recent work that examined the mutation rate of the virus indicates the measles virus emerged from [[rinderpest]] (cattle plague) as a [[Zoonosis|zoonotic disease]] between 1100 and 1200 AD, a period that may have been preceded by limited outbreaks involving a virus not yet fully acclimated to humans.&lt;ref name = Furuse2010&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1186/1743-422X-7-52| issn = 1743-422X| volume = 7| pages = 52| last = Furuse| first = Yuki|author2=Akira Suzuki |author3=Hitoshi Oshitani | title = Origin of measles virus: divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries| journal = Virology Journal| date = 2010-03-04| pmid = 20202190| pmc=2838858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with the observation that measles requires a susceptible population of &gt;500,000 to sustain an epidemic, a situation that occurred in historic times following the growth of medieval European cities.&lt;ref name = Black1966&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(66)90161-5| issn = 0022-5193| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 207–11| last = Black| first = Francis L.| title = Measles endemicity in insular populations: Critical community size and its evolutionary implication| journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology| accessdate = 2014-10-15| date = July 1966| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519366901615| pmid=5965486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations not exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of those natives who had previously survived smallpox. Two years later, measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of [[Honduras]], and it had ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Joseph Patrick | last = Byrne | title = Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A–M | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2008 | page = 413 | isbn = 978-0-313-34102-1 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113180934/http://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | archivedate = 2013-11-13 | df =  }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45743">'''Mental health in the United Kingdom''' involves state, private and community sector intervention in [[mental health]] issues. One of the first countries to build [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]], the [[United Kingdom]] was also one of the first countries to turn away from them as the primary mode of treatment for the mentally ill. It was [[Enoch Powell]] in 1961, then Minister of Health, who led the shift towards [[Care in the Community]], the British version of [[deinstitutionalisation]]. The majority of mental health care is now provided by the [[National Health Service]], assisted by the private and the voluntary sectors.

According to an investigation in 2018, the NHS is struggling to cope with rising demand for mental health care, with a shortage of beds, patients facing long delays in accessing treatment, and receiving inadequate care when they do. Areas of concern include support for pregnant women and new mothers; depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in school-age children and adolescents; and the use of [[medical restraint|restraints]] on mental health patients.

==History==
The [[Madhouses Act 1774]] was the first legislation in the United Kingdom addressing mental health. Privately funded lunatic asylums were widely established during the nineteenth century. The [[County Asylums Act 1808]] permitted, but did not compel, [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]] to provide establishments for the care of "[[Pauperism|pauper]] [[lunatic]]s", so that they could be removed from [[workhouse]]s and [[prison]]s. The [[Lunacy Act 1845]] established the Board of [[Commissioners in Lunacy]]. Justices were forced to build lunatic asylums financed by the [[Rates in the United Kingdom|local rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ayers|first1=Gwendoline|title=England's First State Hospitals|date=1971|publisher=Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine|location=London|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/hospitals/englands-first-state-imbecile-asylums/|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, there were about 36,000 people classified as lunatics in all forms of care in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. About 31,000 were classed as paupers and 5,000 were private patients. Over 17,000 of the paupers were in county asylums or on contract in licensed houses, about 7,000 were in workhouses, while a similar number were living 'with friends or elsewhere'. Ten per cent of [[Workhouse infirmary|workhouse infirmaries]] provided separate insane wards. The Lunacy Act 1862 permitted voluntary admission. Any person who had been a patient in any type of mental hospital during the previous five years could enter a licensed house as a voluntary [[Boarding house|boarder]]. The Lunacy Commissioners could remove lunatics from workhouses to county asylums, and the harmless chronic insane could be moved from the overcrowded asylums to the workhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ayers|first1=Gwendoline|title=England's First State Hospitals|date=1971|publisher=Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine|location=London|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/hospitals/englands-first-state-imbecile-asylums/|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]], established by the [[Metropolitan Poor Act 1867]] built two large asylums for London, [[Leavesden Hospital|Leavesden Mental Hospital]] and [[St Lawrence's Hospital, Caterham|Caterham Asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Lawrence's Hospital, Caterham|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=11891&amp;inst_id=118|website=AIM25|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were built to similar designs by the same architect and each was intended to accommodate 1560 patients in six three-storey blocks for 860 females and five blocks for 700 males. They were both extended by around 500 places within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Lawrence's Hospital|url=http://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/stlawrence.html|website=Lost Hospitals of London|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 there were about 46,500 [[poor law]] mental health cases: 25,500 in county asylums, 1,500 in registered establishments, 11,500 in workhouses and the remainder boarded out with relatives. In 1876, there were nearly 65,000 people classified as mentally disordered in England and Wales. It is not clear that there was actually an increase in the prevalence of mental illness.

From around 1870 there were moves to separate what were then called [[idiot]] children from adults. [[Darenth Park Hospital|Darenth School]] for 500 children with [[learning disabilities]] was opened by the Metropolitan Asylums Board in 1878 and a separate institution next to the school, with accommodation for 1,000 adults, was opened in 1880.

The [[Lunacy Act 1890]] placed an obligation on local authorities to maintain institutions for the mentally ill. By 1938 131,000 patients were in local authority [[mental hospital]]s in England and Wales, and 13,000 in District Asylums in Scotland, where there were also seven Royal Mental Asylums. Mental hospitals were overcrowded and understaffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0116309423|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health services were not integrated with physical health services when the NHS was established in 1948. Shortages of money, staff and buildings continued. [[Confederation of Health Service Employees]] organised an [[overtime]] ban in 1956, the first national [[industrial action]] in the NHS. [[Iain Macleod]] increased capital spending from 1954, hoping to increase bed numbers by 2,800. Rising numbers of patients, especially the elderly, caused a shift in policy away from institutions and towards [[day centre]]s and [[Care in the Community|community care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0116309423|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 [[Enoch Powell]], then [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care|Minister of Health]], made his [[Institutionalisation|Water Tower Speech]]. He said "in fifteen years time there may well be needed not more than half as many places in hospitals for mental illness as there are today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enoch Powell's Water Tower Speech 1961|url=http://studymore.org.uk/xpowell.htm|website=Studymore|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a shift towards [[Care in the Community]], the British version of deinstitutionalisation, which was given further impetus by a series of scandals over long-stay hospitals from 1968 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munson- Barkshire|first1=Amy|title=Scandals in Chronic Sector Hospitals contents|date=1981|publisher=Socialist Health Association|location=Manchester|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/democracy-involvement-and-accountability-in-health/complaints-regulation-and-enquries/the-production-and-reproduction-of-scandals-in-chronic-sector-hospitals-1981/official-inquiry-reports-into-national-health-service-mental-hospitals/|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence of mental health problems==
Most mental health problems are not easily defined. The American [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] and the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] are most generally used. According to [[Mind (charity)|Mind]] about 25% of the adult population will experience a mental health problem each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental health facts and statistics|url=https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/statistics-and-facts-about-mental-health/how-common-are-mental-health-problems/#one|website=MIND|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey reported that 17% of those surveyed in England met the criteria for a common mental disorder and about 37% of those were accessing mental health treatment. Those more severely affected were more likely to be accessing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014 |url=http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21748|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=NHS Digital|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 a survey found that 65% of Britons have experienced a mental health problem, with 26% having had a panic attack and 42% saying they had suffered from depression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mental-health-problems-anxiety-depression-men-women-adults-two-thirds-experience-foundation-a7720266.html Two thirds of adults experience mental health problems such as anxiety or depression, survey finds]. The Independent. Published 8 May 2017. Retrieved 26 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pregnant]] women and new mothers who develop mental health problems get inadequate help from the NHS and how much help they get is subject to a [[postcode lottery]]. Some take their own lives; suicide is the most common cause of death among mothers who gave birth within the previous year. The NHS considers that up to 20% of the 775,000 women who give birth annually have a mental health problem connected with carrying a child or giving birth. This includes [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[Psychosis|psychotic illnesses]] such as [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]]. According to Claire Murdoch, NHS England’s national mental health director, “As recently as 2014, only 3% of the country had good access to perinatal mental health care...".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/19/women-across-uk-denied-mental-healthcare-around-childbirth-say-doctors Women across UK denied mental healthcare around childbirth, say doctors]] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agnes Hann of the [[National Childbirth Trust]] said, "These findings are shocking, and mean that thousands of women experiencing potentially serious perinatal mental health problems are not getting the support they need. Perinatal mental illness can have a severe and long-term impact on mothers, babies and families. In extreme circumstances, it can result in tragedy – suicide is a leading cause of maternal death." From roughly 10% to 20% of women giving birth experience some type of mental illness such as anxiety and depression or more complex problems like [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and [[psychosis]]. With about 665,000 births a year in England 66,500–133,000 women a year develop illnesses. In 2016, 13,000 women were treated by perinatal teams while 800 became [[inpatient]]s. This means the majority were untreated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/30/women-mothers-mental-health-problems-care-nhs-report Thousands of mothers left to cope alone with mental illness] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit cuts and sanctions "are having a toxic impact on mental health" according to the [[UK Council for Psychotherapy]]. Rates of severe anxiety and depression among unemployed people increased from 10.1% in June 2013 to 15.2% in March 2017. In the general population the increase was from 3.4% to 4.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government welfare cuts blamed for 50% surge in mental health issues among unemployed|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cuts-mental-health-unemployed-rise-government-welfare-reforms-blamed-a7841941.html|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=Independent|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2018, it was reported that "hundreds of mental health patients died after NHS care failures". The report found "271 highly vulnerable patients died between 2012 and 2017 after 706 failings by health bodies". Many of these patients took their own lives. The investigation found that the NHS is struggling to cope with rising demand for mental health care, as well as patients facing long delays in accessing treatment and receiving inadequate care when they do. "NHS providers, mental health organisations and charities have warned that NHS services have too few staff". "There are 6,000 fewer mental health nurses in England than in 2010". There was found to have been multiple notices of inadequate supervision of those with a clear suicide risk, NHS staff ignoring families fears of the suicide risk of a loved one and dozens of cases of staff making mistakes with patients medication or failing to properly assess a patients suicide risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/05/hundreds-of-mental-health-patients-dying-after-nhs-care-failures Hundreds of mental health patients died after NHS care failures].

Anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts among children and adolescents are increasing but only half get the treatment they need. Consultant clinical psychologist, Dr. Nihara Krause said,  "Schools face huge challenges in dealing with mental health issues in their students, and teachers are on the front line. They witness first-hand the devastating impact of pressures such as exam anxiety, bullying, and family problems. The consequences of these problems are serious, often life-threatening, and teachers are desperate to help. Yet at a time when the need for preventative, early intervention and specialist services are soaring, schools are finding it increasingly difficult to provide the help their pupils need. There's an urgent need for better support mechanisms in schools, as well as decent funding for the range of mental health services children and young people need."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/23/schoolchildren-facing-mental-help-epidemic Children face mental health epidemic, say teachers]&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one in ten children are believed to have a psychiatric problem. Just 25% of children with mental health conditions get treatment. A child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs) worker said, "My experience in the past eight to 10 years has been a real deterioration in children and adolescents' ability to access services - the thresholds have changed considerably."  At least one and a half million children under age 18 live in areas without 24/7 mental health crisis care.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45607313 Child mental health: Camhs 'not fit for purpose'] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by the [[Education Policy Institute]] suggests referrals to child and adolescent mental health services rose 26% in the five years to 2018. Eating disorders causing weight loss less than 15% from the ideal weight do not get referrals despite [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] guidelines that they should.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45748562 Child mental health referrals up 26% in five years, says report] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor mental health at work affects half of employees. Fewer than 1 in 5 employers offer mental health training to managers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45470517 Poor mental health at work 'widespread'] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suicide ===
{{Main|Suicide in the United Kingdom}}

In the years 2009 through 2011, deaths by suicide numbered 6,045, 5,608 and 5,675 respectively.&lt;ref name="UK suicide rate rises 'significantly' in 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK suicide rate rises 'significantly' in 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21141815|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ONS 2006–2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide rates in the United Kingdom, 2006 to 2010|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_254113.pdf|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2016, 224 inpatients at English psychiatric institutions died of [[Self-harm|self-inflicted injuries]] of whom 134 were men and 90 women. The overall figure seems to be falling. Though men are usually at greater risk of suicide, in 2015, for the first time, twenty women killed themselves compared to fifteen men, and in 2016 the figures were ten women and six men. Campaigners have described women's mental health care by the NHS as "not fit for purpose". Katharine Sacks-Jones of [[Agenda (charity)|Agenda]], which campaigns over risks to women and girls, said, "It is appalling that we are seeing so many self-inflicted deaths of women and girls detained under the [[Mental Health Act 2007|Mental Health Act]]. Many will have been detained precisely because they were at risk to themselves, yet the Mental Health Act is not keeping them safe and is failing to support and protect them. NHS care of women with serious psychological or psychiatric problems needs to take much greater account of the fact that many female patients have suffered violence or abuse. The reality is that the conditions under which the Mental Health Act are enforced are not fit for purpose for women and girls". [[Coroner]]s found at least 271 mental health patients in England and Wales died from 2012 to 2017, sometimes following multiple failings by NHS staff and organisations. This included [[mental health trust]]s, [[General practitioner|GP]] surgeries and [[ambulance]] services. Nearly one in six involved lack of staff, beds or treatment that a patient needed. Deborah Coles of [[INQUEST]], called for mandatory independent investigations into deaths in places where there is mental health care. Coles said, "Our casework bears witness to the escalating rise on the number of highly vulnerable women and girls dying in places where they should be safe. Critical to this is the need for greater oversight, accountability and learning. The lack of an independent investigation system for deaths in mental health settings, unlike that for deaths in police or prison custody, undermines this necessary scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/14/more-than-200-suicides-recorded-at-mental-health-units-over-seven-years More than 200 suicides recorded at mental health units over seven years] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health treatment ==
Improved mental health funding enables people with mental health problems to become more productive workers. Patients diagnosed for the first time with psychosis are too frequently not getting the full recommended care package.

===Children and adolescent services===
{{Main|Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services}}

[[Barnardo's]] claims the government plans for children's therapy are too little too late. According to Barnardo's, children in mental health crisis need to see a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]] within days rather than within a month as the government promises. Further, the proposed plans will not reach more than a quarter of children for years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/childrens-mental-health-crisis-schools-government-green-paper-barnardos-nspcc-a8463061.html Government attacked over child mental health plan and told it is 'sleepwalking into deepening crisis'] ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Matt Blow of [[YoungMinds]] said, "In many areas it is desperately hard for young people to get the support they need, Every day the charity's helpline hears from parents who have been waiting months for an appointment for their child and have nowhere to turn.  Sometimes their children have started to self-harm, become suicidal or dropped out of school during the wait."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43227589 'I tried to kill myself nine times before the NHS helped me'] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Young English people with eating disorders are sent to Scotland because the services they need are not available locally. Being away from friends and family compromises their recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/11/nhs-england-anorexic-patients-scotland-mental-health|title=NHS England sending anorexic patients to Scotland for treatment|first1=Sarah|last1=Marsh|first2=Denis|last2=Campbell|date=11 December 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are concerns that not enough is being done to support people at risk of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38343186|title=Scale of suicide unacceptable, say MPs|date=19 December 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1,039 children and adolescents in England were admitted to beds away from home in 2017-18, many had to travel over 100 miles from home. Many had complex mental health issues frequently involving a risk of self-harm or suicide, like severe depression, eating disorders, psychosis and personality disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/29/children-forced-to-travel-hundreds-of-miles-for-nhs-mental-health-treatment Children forced to travel hundreds of miles for NHS mental health treatment] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017-18 at least 539 children assessed as needing Tier 3 child and adolescent mental health services care waited more than a year to start treatment, according to a [[Health Service Journal]] survey which elicited reports from 33 out of the 50 mental health trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hundreds of children wait more than a year for specialist help |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/revealed-hundreds-of-children-wait-more-than-a-year-for-specialist-help/7023232.article |accessdate=2 October 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=30 August 2108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
The [[King's Fund]] found that 40% of English Mental Health Trusts experienced budget cuts in 2015–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2017/01/leader-nhs-and-black-dog|title=Leader: The NHS and the black dog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Money promised for [[Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services|children's mental health services]] is not reaching frontline services and instead is being used to offset cuts elsewhere. According to the [[Education Policy Institute]] 'Independent Commission on Children and Young People's Mental Health', young people still struggle to get psychiatric help. 23% of children and young people referred to mental health services are turned away due to "high thresholds" to access services. A report claimed, "something has to go drastically wrong before some services will intervene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37983593|title=Child mental health money not making frontline – report|date=15 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas services are so stretched that children only get help if they are suicidal or seriously self harming. Barnardos is not bidding to provide some services because with the limited funding available they do not believe they can provide a safe service.&lt;ref name=Guardian5/5/2018&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/05/children-denied-help-mental-health-attempt-suicide-self-harm-barnardos-local-authority-funding Some children reach brink of suicide before getting help with mental health, charity warns] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of psychiatrists available to treat children and young people with mental health needs is falling despite rising demand.  Patient care is being delayed or limited because staffing numbers have not kept up with growing demand, which experts connect to academic pressures, social media and other issues. Some children's treatment is delayed up to 18 months. Dr Bernadka Dubicka of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] stated,  “With the country facing a crisis in children’s mental health, we need a big expansion of the number of doctors … It is deeply frustrating that the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists is falling.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/08/fall-in-number-of-nhs-psychiatrists-treating-children-in-england Fall in number of NHS psychiatrists treating children in England] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans to change mental health care for young people will come too late for the present generation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/09/mps-take-to-task-plans-to-tackle-mental-health-crisis-among-young Government plans to tackle mental health crisis 'will fail a generation'] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers attending A&amp;E due to psychiatric problems rose by 50% between 2011 and 2016 and reached 165,000 in that year. Patients are suffering psychiatric crises due to lack of earlier intervention. It is suspected{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} that yet more psychiatric cases are recorded as something else like self-harm or attempted suicide. Some trusts claim that 10% of A&amp;E cases are psychiatric. Patients attending A&amp;E due to psychiatric problems have not benefited from early intervention due to years of underfunding. Young people do not get early help and problems escalate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38576368|title=Steep rise in A&amp;E psychiatric patients|first=Nick Triggle and Sophie|last=Woodcock|date=10 January 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are calls for increased provision of in patient psychiatric services and community psychiatric services because otherwise patients will be failed, sometimes with tragic results. A&amp;E is stressful and far from ideal for people in a mental health crisis but many patients in mental distress, some suicidal, have nowhere else to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38576368|title=Steep rise in A&amp;E psychiatric patients|first=Nick Triggle and Sophie|last=Woodcock|date=10 January 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mental health services have increased but many have been cut. Forty per cent of mental health trusts have seen their budget reduced. [[Marjorie Wallace (SANE)|Marjorie Wallace]] of mental health charity [[SANE (charity)|Sane]], said "cuts to services across the country continue and people seeking help are still being failed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-39702976|title=Mental health care cuts in England 'to total £4.5m'|date=25 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract provided 28 inpatient mental health beds for young adults but the service consistently had about 51 inpatients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health beds shortfall puts patients at 'intolerable' risk|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/newsletter/topics/quality-and-performance/mental-health-beds-shortfall-puts-patients-at-intolerable-risk/7018783.article|accessdate=14 July 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health problems among university students have been increasing. Suicides among university students have increased.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] promised to provide £1 billion extra cash by 2021 for mental health in England, to scrap the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] and to introduce a new Mental Health Treatment Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forward Together|url=https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/manifesto2017/Manifesto2017.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2017|publisher=Conservative and Unionist Party|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, [[Jeremy Hunt]] announced plans to create 21,000 new NHS posts.

Large numbers of psychiatric patients are sent out of the area where they live for treatment. In January 2018, 700 patients were sent out of their area and in February that year 650 patients received inpatient treatment outside their area. There are doubts{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} if a target to end the practise by 2020 will be met. Health care professionals frequently spend hours looking for a place with a bed for a patient, preventing them from tending to other patients. Also, treatment away from family, friends and social contacts isolates patients and makes them less likely to recover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/16/mental-health-patient-out-of-area-nhs-care-treatment-jeremy-hunt Mental health patients still sent hundreds of miles for treatment] ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[King's Fund]] stated, "A lack of available beds is leading to high numbers of out-of-area placements for inpatients.

===Medical restraints in the UK===
{{see also|Medical restraint}}
The Millfields Charter is an [[World Wide Web|online]] [[charter]] which promotes an end to the teaching of any prone (face-down) restraint holds to frontline healthcare staff.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20061205031856/http://millfieldscharter.com/&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 the UK government announced that it was considering a ban on the use of face-down restraint in English mental health hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22955917 |title='Excessive' use of face-down restraint in mental health hospitals |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face-down restraints are used more often on women and girls than on men. 51 out of 58 mental health trusts use restraints unnecessarily when other techniques would work. Organisations opposed to restraints include [[Mind (charity)|Mind]] and [[Rethink Mental Illness]]. YoungMinds and Agenda claim restraints are "frightening and humiliating" and "re-traumatise" patients, especially women and girls who have previously been victims of physical and/or sexual abuse.{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=for the stats in the first two sentences and the direct quotations in the fourth}}

The charities{{which?|date=August 2018}} sent an [[open letter]] to health secretary, [[Jeremy Hunt]] showing evidence from 'Agenda, the alliance for women and girls at risk', revealing that patients are routinely restrained in some mental health units while other units use non-physical ways to calm patients or stop self-harm. According to the letter, over half of women with psychiatric problems have suffered abuse, restraint can cause physical harm, can frighten and humiliate the victim. Restraint, especially face-down restraint can re-traumatise patients who previously suffered violence and abuse. "Mental health units are meant to be caring, therapeutic environments, for people feeling at their most vulnerable, not places where physical force is routine."{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=All direct quotations need to be referenced. (see [[WP:BURDEN]])}}

Government guidelines state that face-down restraint should not be used at all and other types of physical restraint are only for last resort. Research by Agenda found one fifth of female patients in mental health units had suffered physical restraint. Some trusts averaged over twelve face-down restraints per female patient. Over 6% of women, close to 2,000, were restrained face-down in total more than 4,000 times. The figures vary widely between regions.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some trusts hardly use restraints, others use them routinely. A woman patient{{who?|date=August 2018}} was in several hospitals and units at times for a decade with mental health issues. She said in some units she suffered restraints two or three times daily. Katharine Sacks-Jones, director of Agenda, maintains trusts use restraint when alternatives would work. Sacks-Jones maintains that women in her group speak to repeatedly describe face-down restraint as a traumatic experience. On occasions, male nurses have used it when a woman did not want her medication. "If you are a woman who has been sexually or physically abused – and mental health problems in women often have close links to violence and abuse – then a safer environment has to be just that: safe and not a re-traumatising experience. ... Face-down restraint hurts, it is dangerous, and there are some big questions around why it is used more on women than men."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/05/stop-face-down-restraint-mentally-ill-charities  End humiliating restraint of mentally ill people, say charities]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of restraints in UK psychiatric facilities is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41914555 Mental health trusts restrain patients 'every 10 minutes'] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016–17 there was the largest number of injuries ever; 3,652 patients were injured by being restrained, data from 48 of England's 56 mental health trusts reveals. Critics say restraints are potentially traumatic even life-threatening for patients. [[Norman Lamb]] said, "Whilst this dramatic increase may be partly explained by improved reporting, the scale of injuries is horrifying. This is also, no doubt, in part due to the stress that many trusts are under, with bed occupancy close to 100% and often relying on agency staff. This amounts to a serious and unacceptable breach of people's human rights. What is most shocking is that some of those against whom restraint is used have suffered abuse in their lives. For them, restraint amounts to an assault, which can be frightening and can completely undermine trust." The most injuries happened at [[Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust#Performance|Southern Health]] (534 cases), [[Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust|Merseycare]] (493) and [[South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust#Services|South London and the Maudsley]] (255). Restraints were used 97,000 times in 2016–17. some trusts have greatly reduced the number of restraints used. Thirteen per cent of trusts have no restraint policy though 2014 government guidance asked all mental health care providers to draw one up. Staff as well as patients need to be protected and standards of training particularly in de-escalation techniques need improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/09/nhs-restraint-techniques-mental-heath-patient-injuries-rise Figures reveal 'alarming' rise in injuries at mental health units] ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The police use stun guns on psychiatric patients including teenagers though this use is controversial and can be life threatening. Gracie Bradley of [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] said, “Given the pain, distress and serious health consequences electro-shock weapons can cause, it’s difficult to see how using them on vulnerable people seeking treatment in mental health hospitals could ever be appropriate or justified.  [Stun guns] can and do kill, which is why they were initially restricted to use by firearms officers – but mission creep has seen them deployed well beyond that.”  [[Norman Lamb]] said the UN defines stun gun use as potentially torture. “It’s seen as a way of avoiding force but this is not a risk-free option and it is particularly shocking when [stun guns] are used against teenagers.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/01/police-stun-guns-mentally-ill-patients-health-uk Police used stun guns on mentally ill patients 96 times in a year] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral support''' is a way of giving support to a person or cause, or to one side in a conflict, without making any contribution beyond the emotional or psychological value of the encouragement.

For example, in a war between two countries or alliances, a third nation may give moral support to one side, without actually participating in the conflict (for example, [[Paraguay]] in [[World War II]]).

Another common example can be found in [[sport]]s. By coming out to watch one's friend's team play a match, one is likely not directly supporting their team in any significant way (especially if there is no charge to attend), but one's friend may still feel encouraged by the moral support of one's presence.

The line between moral support and other forms of help is often hard to draw. For example, some [[sportsperson|athlete]]s report that they play better when the spectators encourage them—and in some cases referees' decisions may be influenced by a partisan crowd.

There is also moral support that one can offer someone who is experiencing a difficult situation. One may not be able to offer any concrete assistance except empathy.

The '''Mother and Child Scheme''' was a [[health care in the Republic of Ireland|healthcare]] programme in Ireland that would later become remembered as a major political crisis involving primarily the [[Irish Government]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the early 1950s.

The scheme was referred to as the '''Mother and Child Service''' in legislation. A brochure, "What the new service means to every family", was prepared. It explained the new service but was not issued to the public. The scheme was engulfed in crisis before this could happen.

==Background==
Since the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 responsibility in the government for healthcare had lain with the [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for Local Government and Public Health]]. No significant reform of healthcare occurred in this time and the Catholic Church still retained effective control through the ownership of hospitals and schools, while family doctors still largely practised in isolation of other medical professionals.

The [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Teachta Dála|T.D.]] [[Seán MacEntee]] started the process of reform as Minister for Local Government &amp; Public Health in 1943. After the [[Second World War]] there was renewed optimism after the depression of the preceding decades. Once [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the Emergency]] was over the political agenda started to shift from [[Irish Civil War]] politics, which had dominated politics, to the domestic agenda and social issues. In particular issues like employment, health and housing came to the fore and this manifested itself in a move away from [[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Fine Gael]].

Regarding healthcare, international trends such as in the [[National Health Service]] of the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe were noticed by the Irish political system. The office of [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] was created as a separate "Minister of the Government" by the 1946 Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1946_38.html Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1946] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130113234/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1946_38.html |date=30 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this act also created the [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social Welfare]]. Problems, such as a high infant mortality, increased concerns and the Fianna Fáil government published a much delayed [[White Paper]] in 1947. This paper was followed by the 1947 Health Act,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1947_28.html Health Act, 1947] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128142738/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1947_28.html |date=28 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the scheme was provided for in Part III of the act. President [[Seán T. O'Kelly|O'Kelly]] convened a meeting of the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]] to consider whether Part III should be referred to the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]], but he decided against doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kelly |last2=Hogan |last3=Whyte |title=The Irish Constitution |edition=4th |publisher=LexisNexis Butterworth |date=2003 |nopp=Y |page=§4.5.110.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Irish general election, 1948|1948 general election]] resulted in the surprise fall of Fianna Fáil from government and instead the [[First Inter-Party Government]] would be left with the responsibility of implementing the scheme.

==The scheme==
In 1948 [[Noël Browne|Dr. Noël Browne]], a new [[Teachta Dála|T.D.]] for [[Clann na Poblachta]], and a socialist, became [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] in a coalition government. Browne was an admirer of Fianna Fáil's 1947 Health Act&lt;ref name="browne149"&gt;Browne 1986, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; and intended to implement its provisions as part of a plan to reduce the alarmingly high rate of child mortality (especially from tuberculosis) in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=S. |date=2011 |title=Stigma and silence: oral histories of tuberculosis |url=http://eprints.ulster.ac.uk/24908/1/Kelly_Oral_history.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Condon |first=D. |date=2008 |title=Pre-immunisation — Ireland in the bad old days |publisher=Irish Health |url=http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=19092 |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hunter |first=N |date=2013 |title=Record low TB rate in Ireland |publisher=Irish Health |url=http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=21870 |accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; modernise the Irish healthcare system and make it free and without means-testing for mothers and their children up to the age of 16.&lt;ref name="browne149"/&gt; He was impressed with the National Health Service in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="browne157"/&gt; and successful medical procedural reforms in Denmark which reduced child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Browne 1986, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; He tackled the domestic health issues and was acclaimed for the results.&lt;ref name="obrien161"&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=M. |last2=O'Brien |first2=C.C. |date=1977 |title=A Concise History of Ireland |location=London |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |page= 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1950, Browne's department formally submitted the scheme to the [[Irish Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Browne 1986, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The Association had originally opposed the 1947 bill, mentioning the "socialisation of medicine."&lt;ref name="browne149"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obrien161"/&gt; They were supported in the coalition cabinet by the experienced Fine Gael [[Teachta Dála|T.D.]] [[Thomas F. O'Higgins|Dr. Thomas F. O'Higgins]], the [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]] and a former member of the executive of the [[Irish Medical Association]].

More important was the opposition of the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]], [[John Charles McQuaid]], who summoned Browne to his palace&lt;ref name="browne157"&gt;Browne 1986, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; and read out a letter to be sent to the [[Taoiseach]], [[John A. Costello]], penned by Dr. James Staunton, [[Bishop of Ferns]], which contained, "...they [the Archbishops and bishops] feel bound by their office to consider whether the proposals are in accordance with Catholic moral teaching," and, "Doctors trained in institutions in which we have no confidence may be appointed as medical officers ... and may give gynaecological care not in accordance with Catholic principles.&lt;ref&gt;[letter quoted from] O'Dowd,M. (ed.) (2002) ''The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing Volume V: Irish Women's writing and traditions.'' New York: New York University Press, p170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browne 1986, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The letter stated that health provision and physical education for children were solely the "right" of parents and not the State's concern. Archbishop McQuaid was the chairman of some boards of directors of Dublin hospitals. He exercised considerable influence concerning medical appointments and control over the religious orders whose members made up much of the administrative and management staff in hospitals, sanatoria etc.&lt;ref&gt;''A medical stalwart now happy in exile.'' Irish Health [online] http://www.irishhealth.com/clin/sexual_health/features2.html?artid=18437. [accessed 2 January 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browne 1986, p.142&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the term "moral teaching" in the letter to the Taoiseach, Browne received supportive advice - in secret - from [[Francis Cremin]], a Maynooth professor of theology and canon law.&lt;ref name="browne157"/&gt;

Some bishops, McQuaid and others feared the scheme could pave the way for [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion]] and birth control. Though some Catholic Church leaders may have been privately sympathetic to Browne and wished to reach an accommodation, what was viewed as Browne's tactless handling of the Catholic Church forced the moderates into silence, allowing the anti-Mother and Child Scheme members of the hierarchy under McQuaid to set the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;According to James Dillon, Browne's cabinet colleague, he had a quiet word with the moderate [[Archbishop of Tuam]], Dr Walsh, in an attempt to defuse the row. Walsh agreed to try to calm down the controversy and secretly meet Browne. When Dillon told Browne, Browne went down to Walsh's residence without first arranging an appointment. Walsh was away on Church business. In what Dillon saw as a disastrous error, Browne travelled to meet the neighbouring bishop, Dr. Dignan, a "lunatic" in Dillon's view and one of Browne's most trenchant critics. They had an argument that inflamed the situation. In revealing that he had originally gone down to see Walsh, Browne compromised the position of the potential go-between, who was forced to row in reluctantly with his more hardline colleagues.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] community also disagreed with the scheme; the ''Church of Ireland Gazette'' saw it as 'communist' interference in the family.

Many doctors disapproved of the scheme, some on principle, others because they feared a loss of income and a fear of becoming a kind of [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servant]], referring to the plan as "[[socialised medicine]]". Browne refused to back down on the issue but received little support even from his Cabinet colleagues, most of whom he had alienated on other matters, notably his failure to attend many cabinet meetings and the lack of support he had shown them in other crises. Isolated in cabinet as a 'loner' who did not consult with his more experienced cabinet colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Kelly et al. (eds), ''Irish Social Policy in Context'' (UCD Press, 1999) p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; he also faced the hostility of his own party leader, [[Sean MacBride]], with whom Browne had also fallen out, as he had with most members of the [[Clann na Poblachta]] Parliamentary Party, who resented his appointment to cabinet over the heads of more senior colleagues, and who were also offended by his treatment of them.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Manning, ''James Dillon: A Biography'' (Wolfhound Press, 2000) p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1951, MacBride demanded Browne's resignation as a [[Clann na Poblachta]] minister. Browne duly submitted his resignation to the [[Taoiseach]] [[John A. Costello]] for submission to [[Seán T. O'Kelly|President O'Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;Dáil Debates: 11 April 1951 [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0125/D.0125.195104110052.html Vol. 125 Col. 641] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607061755/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0125/D.0125.195104110052.html |date=7 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation took effect from 11 April 1951.

In his resignation statement, Browne told the House:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I had been led to believe that my insistence on the exclusion of a means test had the full support of my colleagues in the Government. I now know that it had not. Furthermore, the Hierarchy has informed the Government that they must regard the mother and child scheme proposed by me as opposed to Catholic social teaching. This decision I, as a Catholic, immediately accepted without hesitation.''&lt;ref&gt;Dáil Debates: 12 April 1951 [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0125/D.0125.195104120041.html Vol 125 Col 667].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the subsequent Dáil debate on the resignation, [[Tánaiste]] and Labour Party leader [[William Norton]] claimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...if this matter had been handled with tact, with understanding and with forbearance by the Minister responsible, I believe we would not have had the situation which has been brought about to-day.''&lt;ref&gt;Dáil Debates: 17 April 1951 [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0125/D.0125.195104170044.html Vol 125 Col 954] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607062258/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0125/D.0125.195104170044.html |date=7 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Browne explained his approach to the Dáil by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I might say that my question to their Lordships was: Is this contrary to Catholic moral teaching? The reply, as you all know, was that it is contrary to Catholic social teaching. I was not aware — the Taoiseach can verify this — until I had asked each member of the Cabinet separately what he proposed to do, what he had been given to understand by Dr. McQuaid when that decision was taken. He then told us that that morning he had been informed by Dr. McQuaid that Catholic social teaching and Catholic moral teaching were one and the same thing.''&lt;ref&gt;Dáil Debates: 17 April 1951 [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0125/D.0125.195104170044.html Vol 125 Col 947–948] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607062258/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0125/D.0125.195104170044.html |date=7 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
The following month a [[Irish general election, 1951|general election]] was called and in June 1951 a new government was formed as a result.

A derivative of the scheme was implemented subsequently by the [[Fianna Fáil]] government which returned to power as a result of the general election. This achieved legislative effect in the 1953 Health Act;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1953_26.html Health Act, 1954] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503210938/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1953_26.html |date=3 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this and later legislation that created the [[Voluntary Health Insurance Board]] in 1957 removed the compulsory attempts of government to reform healthcare. Thus what became called the two-tier system was born, the private and public systems existing side-by-side, later reinforced by the [[1970 Health Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA1Y1970.html Health Act, 1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716000935/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA1Y1970.html |date=16 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the next significant legislative reform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3362">'''Multiple Use water Schemes''' (MUS) are low-cost, equitable water supply systems that provide communities with water for both domestic needs and high-value agricultural production, including rearing livestock. They are designed for use in rural areas, inhabited by smallholder farmers, and generally cover ten to 40 households, although some have served many more households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/index.aspx Multiple-use Water Schemes], Issue 11, 2011, [[IWMI]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[International Development Enterprises]] collaborated on a project using MUS to help reduce poverty in [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. Between 2003 and 2008, 12 MUS systems were installed in Himalayan hilly areas  serving a total of about 5000 households. A water poverty mapping technique helped identify the best areas to target. When the impact of the installed systems was evaluated, it showed that low initial investment costs (approximately US$200 per household) could be paid back within a year. This was because the households served with MUS were able to earn additional income of about US$190 per year through sale of surplus produce.

In a water supply system designed for a single use, such as irrigating crops, livestock might damage hardware if they try to access the water, and people needing water for domestic uses might find there is no water provided in months when it is not needed for watering crops. These problems can be overcome when designing water supply systems for multiple uses. For example, steps can be built to provide access for bathing or washing clothes, and access points can be provided to give livestock safe access to water. Sufficient water can be supplied that there is always some available for domestic uses, even at times when the crops do not need water. Other livelihood options can also be considered; for example, using water for fisheries, as well as rearing livestock, growing crops and domestic uses. MUS can benefit women; for example, by reducing the time they have to spend gathering water and by providing water close to their home with which they can grow produce to feed their families and sell on.&lt;ref&gt;van Koppen, B, Moriarty, P. and Boelee, E. ''Multiple-Use Water Services to Advance the Millennium Development Goals'', Research Report 98, [[IWMI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutu and Prowse (2017) offer some estimates from Ethiopia on farmers’ willingness to pay for a multiple-use water supply system. They find that willingness to pay is based on gender, the prevalence of waterborne disease, the time to collect water, contact with extension services, access to credit, level of income and location. Respondents would pay 3.43 per cent of average income to participate. Consideration of how gendered norms influence women’s access to extension, credit and local markets could extend the benefits of such schemes.&lt;ref&gt; Gutu, T. and M. Prowse (2017) ‘What Determines Smallholders’ Willingness to Pay to Improve and Protect Multiple-Use Water Resources? Empirical Evidence from Ethiopia’ Journal of Development Studies http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220388.2016.1265945&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5686">Neuro Biomechanics is based upon the research of [[bioengineering]] researchers, neuro-surgery, orthopedic surgery and biomechanists. Neuro Biomechanics are utilized by neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and primarily by integrated physical medicine practitioners. Practitioners are focused on aiding people in the restoration of biomechanics of the skeletal system in order to measurably improve nervous system function, health, function, quality of life, reduce pain and the progression of degenerative joint and disc disease.

'''Neuro:''' of or having to do with the nervous system. [[Nervous System]]: An [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] system that [[coordinate]]s the activities of muscles, monitors organs, constructs and processes data received from the senses and initiates actions. The human nervous system coordinates the functions of itself and all organ systems including but not limited to the [[cardiovascular system]], [[respiratory system]], [[skin]], [[digestive system]], [[immune system]], hormonal, metabolic, musculoskeletal, [[endocrine system]], blood and [[reproductive system]]. Optimal function of the organism as a whole depends upon the proper function of the nervous system.

'''Biomechanics:''' (biology, physics) The branch of biophysics that deals with the mechanics of the human or animal body; especially concerned with muscles and the skeleton. The study of biomechanical influences upon nervous system function and load bearing joints.

The '''Norwegian Board of Health Supervision''' ({{lang-no|Statens helsetilsyn}}, short name ''Helsetilsynet'') is a national government institution under the [[Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services]]. 

The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision is an independent supervision authority, with responsibility for general supervision of child protection, health and social services in the country. The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision directs the supervision authorities at the [[Counties of Norway|county level]]: the [[County governor (Norway)|Offices of the County Governors]]. 

==Supervision of health and social services in Norway means ensuring that legislation is complied with==

In Norway there are many acts relating to health and social services that:
*lay down requirements for the quality of services
*regulate the practice of health care personnel who have professional authorization 
*give users of health and social services rights, for example those laid down in the Patients’ Rights Act.

Supervision is carried out for all statutory services, including services that are provided by publicly owned hospitals, municipalities, private organizations, and health care personnel who run their own practice.

However, the supervision authorities are independent of political direction, and to a large extent decide themselves about priorities for which services to supervise and which areas supervision shall include. Priorities are decided, among other things, on the basis of information about risk and vulnerability.

The supervision authorities contribute to ensuring that: 
*the needs of the population for health and social services are met 
*services are run in accordance with statutory requirements and acceptable professional standards
*deficiencies in provision of services are prevented 
*resources are used effectively and efficiently.

== Methods used by the supervision authorities ==
=== General supervision ===

General supervision is supervision with an overall perspective, and involves collecting, organizing and interpreting information about health and social services from the perspective of supervision. This information forms the basis for evaluating supply and quality of services.

=== Planned supervision of health and social care institutions ===
System audits are used for supervision of health and social care institutions (municipalities, nursing homes, hospitals etc.), based on internationally accepted methodology. The institutions are investigated by reviewing documents, carrying out interviews, inspecting premises, and carrying out random checks. Conditions that are in breach of laws or regulations (nonconformities) are documented in supervision reports. The supervision authorities follow up nonconformities with the owners and management until the conditions meet the statutory requirements. Each year, the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision designates between two and four areas for countrywide supervision.

=== Individual cases concerning deficiencies in services === 

The Offices of the County Governors information about possible deficiencies in services from many sources (patients, relatives, employers, the police, the mass media). About 2 000 cases are investigated each year to determine whether there has been a breach of laws or regulations. If a breach has occurred, the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision can give an administrative reaction against the institution, in the form of instructions to correct the conditions, or an administrative reaction against health care personnel with authorization, in the form of a warning, revocation of the right to requisition medicinal products, or withdrawal of authorization.

=== Complaints about health and social services and failure to meet statutory rights ===

The Patients’ Rights Act gives the population many rights regarding health services. The Act covers the following:
*the right to essential health care
*assessment by a specialist physician within 30 days
*free choice of hospital
*access to medical records and corrections to records
*patient participation
*information 
*special rights for children
*consent to medical treatment
*individual plans for people who require several different services.

The Social Services Act covers the duty of the municipalities to provide services for the population, such as:
*information, advice and counselling that can help to solve or prevent social problems
*practical help and instruction for people who have special needs for assistance because of illness, functional disabilities, age etc.
*relief for carers and salary for families and people who care for a person with extensive need for care
*support persons and families
*places in institutions and sheltered accommodation
*accommodation for people with special needs. 

Each year, the supervision authorities deal with 6000 to 8000 complaints about these services and rights.

=== Use of the findings and experience gained from supervision ===

The supervision authorities work actively to ensure that agencies that provide health and social services use available sources of information in their work with developing management systems and with improving the quality of services. These sources include: supervision reports, decisions made in individual cases, reports about adverse events, and publications of the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision.

The findings and experience gained from supervision, other sources of information and supervision methodology are available to the public. Most of this information is available on the web site www.helsetilsynet.no. 

== Organization ==

The supervision authorities are the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision (the central office) and the [[County governor (Norway)|Offices of the County Governor]] in the counties. 

The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision has about 85 employees, lawyers, doctors, other types of health care personnel, child welfare and social care personnel and social scientists. 

The Director General MD of the board is Jan Fredrik Andresen. He was appointed to the role in 2012.

A '''nursing school''' is a type of [[Education|educational institution]], or part thereof, providing education and training to become a fully qualified [[nurse]]. The nature of [[Nurse education|nursing education]] and nursing qualifications varies considerably across the world. Since the mid 20th century nursing education in many countries has undergone many enhancements.

==History of nursing schools==

===United Kingdom===
[[Florence Nightingale]] was one of the pioneers in establishing the idea of nursing schools from her base at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], [[London]] in 1860 when she opened the '[[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery|Nightingale Training School for Nurses]]', now part of [[King's College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=King's College London| title=About | url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nursing/About-the-Faculty/index.aspx| accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her intention was to train nurses to a qualified and specialized level, with the key aim of learning to develop observation skills and sensitivity to patient needs, then allow them to work in hospital posts across the [[United Kingdom]] and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Florence Nightingale Museum | title=Florence Nightingale | url=http://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/flo2.htm | accessdate=2007-02-02 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125120531/http://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/flo2.htm | archivedate=2007-01-25 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her influence flourished and nursing is now a course taught at a number of British universities.

Apart from the nursing school of [[King's College London]], the direct descendant of Nightingale's school, the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] was one of the first English institutions to offer the course at degree level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=University of Manchester| title=About the school | url=http://www.nursing.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/ | accessdate=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new building for the [[Manchester Medical School]] was opened in the early 1970s and degree courses in nursing were established about the same time. Nursing education at the university expanded greatly in 1996 when a new School of Nursing and Midwifery was created by transferring the Manchester College of Midwifery and Nursing into the university's Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing.&lt;ref&gt;"This week / next week" (University of Manchester); 7 Oct. 1996, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Entry level courses, sought by most universities, are often five [[Standard Grades]]/[[GCSEs]], including English, maths and a science (preferably biology), and two [[Highers]]/[[A-Levels]]. Mature students, over the age of twenty-one, have the option of entering upon completion of a college access course, and experience in jobs such as being a health/nursing assistant are also worthy for consideration into the course.

Currently, nursing is a three-year course in the UK, with students choosing the branch they want to study from day One e.g. adult, child, mental health, learning disability, or combinations of two (called dual-field). The course consists of a balance between course work in classes and practical placements in a health care setting. The first year is foundation, where students learn anatomy and physiology and basic health care. Newly qualified nurses then have to register with the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] in order to apply for jobs and legally practice.

===United States===
The history of nursing education had a long and varied role in the United States. Before the late 1800s little formal education was available to train nursing students. Education was primarily based on an apprenticeship with a senior nurse who taught bedside care within a hospital or clinic setting. Over time this model changed dramatically. A short chronology of Schools of Nursing in the United States is:

[[Image:Csusnursingpin.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[nursing pin]] awarded to graduates of the nursing school at [[California State University, Sacramento|Sacramento State University]] in the USA.]]
* '''In 1873''', the [[Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing]], of New York City, was founded. It was the first school of nursing in the United States to be founded on the principles of nursing established by Florence Nightingale. The School operated at Bellevue Hospital until its closure in 1969.
* '''1883:''' [https://www.musc.edu/nursing The Medical University of South Carolina College of Nursing] has been traced to its beginning in 1883 when the South Carolina Training School for Nurses was established at the request of Roper Hospital (known then as City Hospital) in Charleston, SC.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waring.library.musc.edu/exhibits/nursing/index.php?g=21|title=Educate and Inspire: The MUSC College of Nursing|first=Brooke E.|last=Fox|date=|website=waring.library.musc.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to an earthquake in 1886 which destroyed the City Hospital, the effort only lasted a few years. However, once the new hospital was built the nursing program was reestablished in 1895 as the Charleston Training School. In 1916, the Board of Commissioners of the Roper Hospital proposed the transfer of the training school to the Medical College of the State of South Carolina, whose school of medicine had been established in Charleston in 1824 and whose faculty was already providing most of the nursing instruction. The proposal was accepted by both the hospital and the Medical College, and in 1919 the Roper Hospital Training School for Nurses became the School of Nursing of the Medical College of the State of South Carolina. In 1969 when the Medical College was designated the [http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/musc/ Medical University of South Carolina], the School of Nursing became the [https://www.musc.edu/nursing College of Nursing].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waring.library.musc.edu/exhibits/nursing/index.php?g=22|title=Educate and Inspire: The MUSC College of Nursing|first=Brooke E.|last=Fox|date=|website=waring.library.musc.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1889:''' The [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing]] was founded in conjunction with the creation of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. As one of the earliest hospital-based nursing schools in the United States school leaders consulted with [[Florence Nightingale]] on the program of education. These same nurse leaders also established what would be become the National League for Nursing Education and helped in establishing the American Nurses Association.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/history8.html About]''. Johns Hopkins Medicine; &amp;#91;cited 26 May 2014&amp;#93;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''In 1909''', the [[University of Minnesota]] offered the first university based nursing program. It offered the first [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] degree and graduated the first bachelor's degree educated nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the School of Nursing|url=http://www.nursing.umn.edu/about/history/historical-overview/index.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418214619/http://www.nursing.umn.edu/about/history/historical-overview/index.htm|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldmark 1923"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nursing and Nursing Education in the United States: Report of the Committee for the Study of Nursing Education|last=Goldmark|first=Josephine|publisher=The Macmillan Company| year=1923|isbn=9785882308154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Nursing|url=http://www.aanac.org/docs/nac-day-2013/nursing-milestones.docx?sfvrsn=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoost and Crawford 2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Nursing: shout up for Collaborative Practice|last=Yoost|first=Barbara|publisher=Elsevier Inc.| year=2016|isbn=9780323295574}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''By 1916''' 13 universities and 3 colleges had developed bachelor's nursing degree programs.&lt;ref name="Goldmark 1923"/&gt;
* '''In 1923''', the [[Yale School of Nursing]] was founded. It became the first School of Nursing to adopt the educational standards from the '''1923''' Goldmark Report that was requested by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. The curriculum was based on an [[Tertiary education|educational]] plan rather than on hospital service needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Yale University| title=Exhibit on the History of the Yale School of Nursing | url=http://info.med.yale.edu/library/exhibits/nursing/nursing1.html | accessdate=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''In 1956''', the [[Columbia University]] School of Nursing became the first in the United States to grant a [[Master of Science in Nursing|master's degree]] in a clinical nursing specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Columbia School of Nursing | title=History of the Columbia School of Nursing | url=http://www.nursing.hs.columbia.edu/about-school/history.html | accessdate=2007-02-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209203709/http://www.nursing.hs.columbia.edu/about-school/history.html | archivedate=2006-12-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States curriculum====
Pre-requisites often include math, English, and other basic level courses. Basic courses in biology, anatomy and physiology are required. Depending on the nursing school, credits can be taken elsewhere, and transferred in, although limitations on time span between taking pre-requisites and applying to nursing programs exist, usually around 5 years, although some schools set no parameters.

Core coursework includes anatomy, physiology, pathology, and pharmacology. Additionally, a strong emphasis is placed on procedural education such as insertion of intravenous and urinary catheters, sterile dressing changes, proper administration of medications, physical examinations, caring bedside manner, and other vital skills. After the first semester basic skills are obtained, students rotate through Obstetrics, Mental Health, Medical, Surgical, Oncology, Critical Care and Pediatric Units to get a holistic view of nursing and what it encompasses. Many nursing students and nursing schools use [[medical informatics|medical and healthcare educational software]] as a study or training aid.

Many schools offer an accelerated bachelor's degree in nursing program. A variation of the Second Degree BSN is the Accelerated BSN. In addition to giving credit for having completed liberal arts requirements, an Accelerated BSN program allows students to complete their undergraduate nursing program's course requirements more quickly than students enrolled in a traditional BSN program. Accelerated BSN programs usually take 12 months to complete, though some programs may run for 16 to 24 months.

The traditional BSN programs may take much longer time. For example, in California, where nursing is a relatively high-paid and in high demand profession, the completion of BSN (including pre-requisites, major courses in the program, and General Education courses of college) may take 5 to 6 years. A 3.0 GPA is often an entrance requirement for many programs. Some more prestigious schools require much higher GPA score to be competitive. Many programs now also require [[Test of Essential Academic Skills|TEAS-V test]] scores to evaluate potential students for entry.  Also, there are other options of [[Associate of Science in Nursing|Associate Degree]] for RN and LPN programs (which in term of nursing training is much shorter and the scope of practice is different than RN). Lastly, the [[Master of Science in Nursing|Master]] level is for experienced RNs to reach a higher education and may expand their scope of practice.

In the [[United States]], students graduate from nursing education programs qualified to take one of the [[NCLEX]] (National Council Licensure Examination) exams, the NCLEX-PN for [[Licensed Practical Nurse]]s (LPNs) or the NCLEX-RN for [[Registered Nurse]]s RNs.

SEF initiates and drives community eye care activities in India by working with Sankara Eye Care Institutions (SECI), India, which runs the "Gift of Vision" rural outreach program through Sankara Eye Hospitals in Coimbatore, [[Krishnankoil|Krishnankovil]], [[Bangalore]], [[Shimoga]], [[Guntur]], Anand, Pammal and Silvassa. Each hospital is set up to become fully self-sustaining within 5 years of service. The Gift of Vision program is based on an "80/20" model, i.e., four free eye surgeries are performed for each paid surgery. Thousands of rural poor have received free eye surgeries.

SEF has its headquarters in [[Milpitas]], [[California|CA]]. It has 100+ energetic volunteer leaders all around the [[United States]].

The majority of SEF's funds is raised through its own events, booths at other events, donations including Founding Memberships, and advertising. Through these fund-raising efforts, SEF has played a pivotal role in increasing the number of free surgeries for the rural poor more than eightfold since 1998. The projected annual rate is 100,000 free eye surgeries in 2009.

Funds collected under specific programs are sent in its entirety to India. In addition, SEF provides extensive feedback to its donors on how the money is used. SEF has been rated [http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=9979 4-star] by Charity Navigator.

'''Current Focus:'''

Funds are being raised to:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Increase the number of free eye surgeries performed annually at the existing Sankara Eye Hospitals, &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Vesalius00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Woodcut from 1543 "''De humani corporis fabrica''" by [[Vesalius]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Thomas Geminus''' (1510 [[Lille]] - May 1562), was a pseudonym for the Flemish refugee Thomas Lambrit/Thomas Lambert, an engraver and printer, active from the 1540s in [[London]], and noted for his 1545 Latin work, ''Compendiosa totius anatomie delineatio, aere exarata'' ("A complete delineation of the entire anatomy engraved on copper") printed by John Herford. Geminus started work in England by working with [[Thomas Raynalde]] and producing "''The byrth of Mankinde''" aka "''The Woman's booke''" in 1545. 

"''The byrth of Mankinde''", was the best English language reference work on [[midwifery]] in the 1500s. Its text was translated from [[Eucharius Rösslin]]'s "''Der schwangern Frauwen und Hebammen Rosengarten''". Its first English edition was a 1540 translation by Richard Jonas. The second, by Thomas Raynalde, appeared in 1545 and saw many editions in the next 100 years. It discussed fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, with the best anatomical descriptions then available. Its illustrations were again after Vesalius via Geminus’s "''Compendiosa''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wellcomelibrary.blogspot.com/2009/06/birth-of-mankind.html Wellcome Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "''Compendiosa totius anatomie''" consisted of 41 unnumbered engraved sheets and was dedicated to [[Edward VI]]. One of the sheets was a fold-out engraving of the external anatomy of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]]; in addition there were 3 engravings of the skeleton, 16 of the muscles, 5 of the arteries and veins, 4 of the nerves, 6 of the organs, 4 of the brain, and one of the eye and its parts, all after woodcuts by [[Vesalius]]. The Latin edition of 1545 had been distributed in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other countries. Geminus wrote in the later English version that it had been produced for the benefit of "unlatined Surgeons". He had employed [[Nicholas Udall]], the playwright, to translate some of the work, while the text was taken from an early translation of [[Henri de Mondeville]]'s "Surgery". The book was a great success, printing three editions in England - one in Latin (1545) and two in English translation (1553 and 1559). 

In his engraved copies, Geminus removed all the detail he regarded as superfluous, notably the background landscapes which had informed Vesalius's images. The copperplate engravings were the first ever to be done in England, and enjoyed a large following in France. [[Jacques Grévin]], the French poet who also happened to be a physician and writer on matters medical, had print editions done from Geminus's plates in 1564, 1565 and a French translation in 1569. Watermarks suggest that the plates for the 1564 Paris edition were printed in London and then transported to Paris.

'''VistAWeb''' is a portal accessible through CPRS (Computerized Patient Recordkeeping System), the graphical user interface for
the ''Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture'' ([[VistA]]), the [[electronic health record]] used throughout the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) medical system (known as the [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA)).

This portal has been implemented throughout the VA system, allowing healthcare providers at remote VA facilities to view records contained within the VistA electronic health record system at the patient's primary facility.

As originally created, the VA health systems has 21 regional data systems (VISN), each with some differences in data collection and storage. The usage of VistA throughout the VA has helped to standardize records, but there has until recently not been an easy way for accessing records from a different VISN service area.

If a patient travels or is injured or sick and visits a VA facility far from their home, VistAWeb will allow the physician or other healthcare provider access to the records at that patient's home institution.

== Introduction ==

Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) VistAWeb is an intranet web application used to review remote patient information found in VistA, the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) system, and the Health Data Repository (HDR) databases. To a large extent, VistAWeb mirrors the reports behavior of the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Remote Data View (RDV). However, by permitting a more robust and timely retrieval of remote-site patient data, VistAWeb is also an enhancement to CPRS/RDV.

There are three ways to access VistAWeb. VistAWeb can be made available by adding it to the CPRS Tools Menu, and it can be selected as the default method of retrieving data from the Remote Data Available button in CPRS. These two methods are referred to as CPRS-spawned versions of VistAWeb. They are compliant with the Health Level 7 (HL7) Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) standards and therefore maintain context with the patient selected in CPRS. As a third option, VistAWeb can be accessed in a standalone mode from its website at [https://vistaweb.med.va.gov/ https://vistaweb.med.va.gov/].

The standalone version of VistAWeb is connected to neither CPRS nor the clinical context management application. Standalone VistAWeb serves an important function for users who have been granted special access to multiple sites, such as for National Programs, Veterans Administration (VA) researchers, and others.

== Usage for record access following natural disaster ==
VistAWeb was also made available broadly, though temporarily, to assist clinical staff with the retrieval of patient information from the sites affected by damage caused by hurricane Katrina.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.104943|last1=Brown|first1=SH|last2=Fischetti|first2=LF|last3=Graham|first3=G|last4=Bates|first4=J|last5=Lancaster|first5=AE|last6=McDaniel|first6=D|last7=Gillon|first7=J|last8=Darbe|first8=M|last9=Kolodner|first9=RM|title=Use of Electronic Health Records in Disaster Response: The Experience of Department of Veterans Affairs After Hurricane Katrina|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/Supplement_1/S136|journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume= 97, Suppl. 1|pages=S136–41 |date=April 2007|pmid=17413082|pmc=1854987|issue=Supplement_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage for record access from DoD ==
VistAWeb was also expanded for to access patient records from the DoD AHLTA patient record system in 2009.  This relied on mapping data from AHLTA  via a bidirectional data exchange system to VistA. Due to errors in the bidirectional exchange system, erroneous data was transmitted to the VA, causing this remote viewer function from DoD sites to be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9166678/VA_closes_Web_portal_to_eHealth_records_cites_data_errors|title=VA closes Web portal to eHealth records, cites data errors
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextgov.com/health/2010/03/glitch-prompts-va-to-shut-e-health-data-exchange-with-defense/46120/|title=Glitch prompts VA to shut e-health data exchange with Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability ==

The VistAWeb package is distributed in the public domain as a module of the VistA software package under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It is therefore available from the VA FTP site, from the VA software distribution office, and in bundled packages. Its capabilities, therefore, can be achieved by a healthcare institution that installs the VistA electronic health record.
