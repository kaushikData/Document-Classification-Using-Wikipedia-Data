{{Human growth and development}}
[[Biology|Biologically]], an '''adult''' is a [[human]] or other [[organism]] that has reached [[sexual maturity]]. In human context, the term ''adult'' additionally has meanings associated with [[social]] and [[Law|legal]] concepts. In contrast to a "[[Minor (law)|minor]]", a '''legal adult''' is a [[person]] who has attained the [[age of majority]] and is therefore regarded as independent, [[self-sufficient]], and [[:wikt:responsible|responsible]]. The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.

Human adulthood encompasses [[Adult development|psychological adult development]]. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and responsibility that may define an
adult character.

In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or [[coming of age]]. This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.

==Biological adulthood==
[[File:RudolfMilly.jpg|right|thumb|270px|A group of adult people]]
Historically and cross-culturally, adulthood has been determined primarily by the start of [[puberty]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} (the appearance of [[secondary sex characteristics]] such as [[menstruation]] in women, [[ejaculation]] in men, and pubic hair in both sexes). In the past, a person usually moved from the status of child directly to the status of adult, often with this shift being marked by some type of coming-of-age test or ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robin| last = Maranz Henig| title = What Is It About 20-Somethings? | date = 2010-08-18| publisher = New York Times| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1 | pages = 10 | accessdate = 2010-09-24 | quote = THE DISCOVERY OF adolescence is generally dated to 1904, with the publication of the massive study "Adolescence," by G. Stanley Hall, a prominent [[psychologist]] and first president of the American Psychological Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the social construct of [[adolescence]] was created, adulthood split into two forms: ''biological adulthood'' and ''social adulthood.'' Thus, there are now two primary forms of adults: biological adults (people who have attained reproductive ability, are fertile, or who evidence secondary sex characteristics) and social adults (people who are recognized by their culture or law as being adults). Depending on the context, ''adult'' can indicate either definition.

Although few or no established dictionaries provide a definition for the two word term biological adult, the first definition of adult in multiple dictionaries includes "the stage of the life cycle of an animal after reproductive capacity has been attained".&lt;ref&gt;''International Dictionary of Medicine and Biology'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Churchill's Medical Dictionary'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the base definition of the word adult is the period beginning at physical sexual maturity, which occurs sometime after the onset of puberty. Although this is the primary definition of the base word "adult", the term is also frequently used to refer to social adults.  The two-word term ''biological adult'' stresses or clarifies that the original definition, based on physical maturity, is being used.

The time of [[puberty]] varies, but usually begins around 10 or 11 years old. Girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12.&lt;ref name="Kail"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kail | first = RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC| title = Human Development: A Lifespan View | isbn = 0495600377 | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | page = 296 |edition = 5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuiling"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schuiling| title = Women’s Gynecologic Health | isbn = 1284125017 | publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] | year = 2016 | page = 22|accessdate=March 20, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTDFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|quote=The changes that occur during puberty usually happen in an ordered sequence, beginning with thelarche (breast development) at around age 10 or 11, followed by adrenarche (growth of pubic hair due to androgen stimulation), peak height velocity, and finally menarche (the onset of menses), which usually occurs around age 12 or 13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

==Legal adulthood==
{{Main|Age of majority}}

Legally, ''adulthood'' typically means that one has reached the age of majority - when parents lose [[parenting]] rights and responsibilities regarding the person concerned. Depending on one's jurisdiction, the age of majority may or may not be set independently of and should not be confused with the minimum ages applicable to other activities, such as engaging in a [[contract]], [[marriage]], [[voting]], having a [[employment|job]], serving in the [[military]], buying/possessing [[firearm]]s, [[driving]], traveling abroad, involvement with [[alcoholic beverages]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[gambling]], being a model or actor in [[pornography]], running for [[President]], etc. Admission of a young person to a place may be restricted because of danger for that person, concern that the place may lead the person to immoral behavior or because of the risk that the young person causes damage (for example, at an exhibition of fragile items).

One can distinguish the legality of acts of a young person, or of enabling a young person to carry out that act, by selling, renting out, showing, permitting entrance, allowing participation, etc. There may be distinction between commercially and socially enabling. Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a [[legal guardian]], or just by an adult. Sometimes there is no requirement, but rather a recommendation.

Using the example of pornography, one can distinguish between:
*being allowed inside an adult establishment
*being allowed to purchase pornography
*being allowed to possess pornography
*another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person pornography, see [[disseminating pornography to a minor]]
*being a [[pornographic actor]]: rules for the young person, and for other people, regarding production, possession, etc. (see [[child pornography]])

With regard to films with violence, etc.:
*another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person a film; a cinema being allowed to let a young person enter

The age of majority ranges internationally from ages 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common age. [[Nigeria|Niger,]] [[Mali]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Cameroon]] define adulthood at age 15, but marriage of girls at an earlier age is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-07-14-legal-ages-of-marriage-across-africa|title=Legal ages of marriage across Africa: Even when it's 18, they are married off at 12!|last=Spooner|first=Samatha|date=July 14, 2014|website=Mail &amp; Guardian Africa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the world, including most of the United States, [[India]] and [[China]], the [[legal]] adult age is 18 (historically 21) for most purposes, with some notable exceptions:

# [[United Kingdom]] (16)
# [[British Columbia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon Territory]] in [[Canada]] (though there are some exceptions in which Canadians may be considered legal adults in certain situations{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}); [[Nebraska]] and [[Alabama]] in [[The United States]], and [[South Korea]] (19)
# [[Indonesia]] (20)
# [[United States]] purchasing [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and entering [[bar]]s has a minimum age of 21.

==Social construction of adulthood==
In contrast to biological perspectives of aging and adulthood, social scientists conceptualize adulthood as socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Elder, Glen H. Jr. 1985. “Perspectives on the life course.” Pp. 23-49 in ''Life Course Dynamics: Trajectories and Transitions, 1968 – 1980'', ed. Glen H. Elder Jr. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Settersten, Richard A. 1999. ''Lives in Time and Place: The Problems and Promises of Developmental Science.'' Amityville, NY: Baywood Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; While aging is an established biological process, the attainment of adulthood is social in its criteria. In contrast to other perspectives that conceptualize aging and the attainment of adulthood as a largely universal development, regardless of context, nation, generation, gender, race, or social class, social scientists regard these aspects as paramount in cultural definitions of adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Ryff, Carol D. 1985. “The Subjective Experience of Life-Span Transitions.” In ''Gender and the life course'', by Alice S. Rossi, 97-113. New York: Adine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence of adulthood as a social construction is illustrated by the changing criteria of adulthood over time. Historically, adulthood in the U.S. has rested on completing one's education, moving away from the family of origin, and beginning one's career.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 1998. “Learning to Stand Alone: The Contemporary American Transition to Adulthood in Cultural and Historical Context.” ''Human Development'' 41:295-315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Daniel J. 1978. ''The Seasons of a Man’s Life.''  New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, Michael J. 2000. “Pathways to Adulthood in Changing Societies: Variability and Mechanisms in Life Course Perspective.” ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 26:667-692.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key historical criteria include entering a marriage and becoming a parent. These criteria are social and subjective; they are organized by gender, race, ethnicity, social class, among other key identity markers. As a result, particular populations feel adult earlier in the life course than do others.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 2001. “Conceptions of the Transition to Adulthood among Emerging Adults in American Ethnic Groups.” ''Journal of Adult Development'', 8:133-143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aronson, Pamela 2008"&gt;Aronson, Pamela. 2008. “The Markers and Meanings of Growing Up: Contemporary Young Women’s Transition from Adolescence to Adulthood.” ''Gender &amp; Society'' 22:56–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Anne. 2003. “Socioeconomic Status and Age Identity: The Role of Dimensions of Health in the Subjective Construction of Age Identity.” ''Journal of Gerontology'' 58: 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Anne. 2005. “Gendered Experiences in Midlife: Implications for Age Identity.” ''Journal of Aging Studies'' 19:163-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary experiences of and research on young adults today substitute more seemingly subjective criteria for adulthood which resonate more soundly with young adults' experiences of aging.&lt;ref name="Aronson, Pamela 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, Frank F. Jr., Rubén G. Rumbaut, and Richard A. Settersten Jr. 2005. “On the Frontier of Adulthood: Emerging Themes and New Directions.” In ''On the frontier of adulthood: Theory,'' ''Research, and Public Policy'', by Richard A. Settersten Jr., Frank F. Furstenburg Jr., and Rubén G. Rumbaut, 3-25. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria are marked by a growing "importance of individualistic criteria and the irrelevance of the demographic markers" of normative conceptions of adulthood."&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, Michael J., Erik J. Porfeli, Jeylan T. Mortimer, and Lance D. Erickson. 2005. “Subjective Age Identity and the Transition to Adulthood: When do Adolescents Become Adults?” In ''On the Frontier of Adulthood: Theory, Research, and Public Policy'', by Richard A. Settersten Jr., Frank F. Furstenburg Jr., and Rubén G. Rumbaut, 225-255. Chicago: University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:230&lt;/sup&gt; In particular, younger cohorts' attainment of adulthood centers on three criteria: gaining a sense of responsibility, independent decision-making, and financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 2004. ''Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from Late Teens through the Twenties''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Settersten, Richard A. 2011. “Becoming Adult: Meanings and Markers for Young Americans.” In ''Coming of Age in America: The Transition to Adulthood in the Twenty-First Century'', by Mary C. Waters, Patrick J. Carr, Maria J. Kefalas, and Jennifer Holdaway, 169-190. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
According to [[Jewish]] tradition, adulthood is reached at age 13 (the minimum age of the [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah]]) for Jewish boys and girls; they are expected to demonstrate preparation for adulthood by learning the [[Torah]] and other Jewish practices. The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] and [[Jewish scripture]] contain no age requirement for adulthood or [[marriage|marrying]], which includes engaging in sexual activity

The 1983 Code of Canon Law states, "A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age, and likewise a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age, cannot enter a valid marriage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3Y.HTM canon 1083, §1]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Disappearance of Childhood'' by [[Neil Postman]], the [[Christian Church]] of the [[Middle Ages]] considered the age of accountability, when a person could be tried and even [[execution|executed]] as an adult, to be age 7.

'''Aggressionism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] that the only real [[philosophy of war|cause of war]] is human aggressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexander Moseley |title=A Philosophy of War |publisher=Algora Publishing |page=78 |date=2002 |isbn=978-1-892941-94-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has dominated much [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]] about [[human nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Signe Howell|authorlink=Signe Howell |author2=Roy G. Willis |title=Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=1989 |page=188 |isbn=978-0-415-01825-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;Nonetheless, many [[Evolutionary biologist|evolutionary biologists]] discount aggressionism as it promotes [[human extinction]] through [[war]]. However, the concept of aggressionism cannot be described as its own word, as it branches off the [[root word]] "[[aggression]]." The definition being "the action of a state in violating by force the rights of another state, particularly its territorial rights; an unprovoked offensive, attack, invasion, or the like..." or a "hostile or destructive mental attitude or behavior" which leads to conflict and eventually, [[wikt:bloodshed|bloodshed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human Prehistory in Fiction |author=Charles De Paolo |publisher=McFarland |date=2003 |page=87 |isbn=978-0-7864-1417-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this particular [[concept]], [[aggression]] occurs in all [[species]] as a form of [[Parental care|protection of their own]] or of their [[Territory (animal)|territory]] in order to keep their young safe. However, though most species protect against their predators, some also protect from their own. For example, lions are very territorial and fight other grown, male lions to keep their status as the alpha. Similar to humans, if an invader attacks, human [[instinct]] leads them to defend oneself and fend them off. When necessary, for the sake of [[Survival of the fittest|survival]], most species become aggressive to get food to survive. Yet, aggressionism isn't the same as aggression. Aggressionism is the concept of aggression particularly made for humans, as it is more complex than simply wanting to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Georgiev|first=Alexander V.|last2=Klimczuk|first2=Amanda C. E.|last3=Traficonte|first3=Daniel M.|last4=Maestripieri|first4=Dario|date=2013-07-18|title=When Violence Pays: A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Aggressive Behavior in Animals and Humans| journal=Evolutionary Psychology : An International Journal of Evolutionary Approaches to Psychology and Behavior|volume=11|issue=3|pages=678–699 |pmc=3859192|pmid=23864299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressionism specifies [[human nature]] in its [[Hostility|hostile]] form when [[Ideology|ideologies]] of multiple humans do not coincide with each other. However, the form of hostility that humans convey isn't direct in terms of [[Street fighting|street fights]]. This form of aggression directs humans in a composed manner between the leaders of [[Nation|nations]] or [[Organization|organizations]] in which leads to war. In this [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]], the hostility is contained due to the persons having [[respect]] in each other. Rather than being savage like animals, humans use their [[intellect]] to defeat their opponent in war—therefore, placing [[pride]], [[greed]], and [[belief]] in their own [[skill]] to lead their nation to victory. Before a war starts, there is always disagreement between the leaders. Never is there a leader raging at the other. Calmly, they would always say that it is unfortunate that the two nations disagree and would go back to their respective countries to declare war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-14|title=Declaration of war|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Declaration_of_war&amp;oldid=836342914|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause of War ==
Although it has been directly stated, that aggressionism is a philosophy theory that humans are the cause of war, there are more direct reasons for conflicts to escalate to war. Aggressionism is a theory that describes complex behavior of human nature that involves strong beliefs in one's own ideology. It is a description of people who cannot see the views of others and would only see their own as the only right one in the world. Throughout history, there have been a number of people who were like this and had caused war.[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|Adolf Hitler|174x174px]]

=== Examples of Political Leaders Who Displayed Aggressionism ===
[[Adolf Hitler]] is a primary example of a person who displayed aggressionism. In his time of [[reign]], he installed a government that practiced [[fascism]] which is a form of [[statism]]. This type of government is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism. This type of nation is ruled by [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] power with overwhelming control over all the aspects of the country including the [[economy]], [[society]], and its beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-31|title=Fascism|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fascism&amp;oldid=833412262|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler had a strong belief that the [[Jews|Jewish]] were in fact, the cause of Germany's loss in [[World War I|WWI]] causing his ideology to circulate around a hate for the Jewish people. Therefore, his aggressionism had started to take form in war through the initial [[invasion of Poland]].

[[File:Joseph Stalin, 1912.jpg|thumb|Joseph Stalin|180x180px]]

[[Joseph Stalin]] is another example that also displayed aggressionism. However, Stalin's aggressionism instead was more subtle than Hitler's. Stalin believed that with his dictatorial power, he would be able to bring Russia in its time out of its [[Famines in Russia and the USSR|famine]] and spread his ideology of communism towards the rest of the world. During Stalin's reign, he transformed Russia to "an industrial and military superpower." He had created programs to boost the food supply and boost its economy, however this had killed millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/joseph-stalin|title=Joseph Stalin - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II|WWII]], the Soviet Union and the US had become superpowers and tension grew between these countries which started the [[Cold War]]. To gain advantage over the other, Stalin attempted to spread [[communism]] towards other states, countries, and nations. Thus, the subtle aggressionism. Unlike Hitler, he had helped spread his ideologies to other leaders, including China's [[Mao Zedong]].

== Source of Aggressionism ==
In both of the examples of aggressionism, there are basic natures of human beings that cause their ideologies to take form. With Hitler, he had displayed his overwhelming hate for the Jewish due to his nationalism for Germany. One of the more basic forms of emotion is hate, which was the source of his aggression towards the millions of Jewish who were killed during the Holocaust. The cause of war was due to his inhumane actions towards a specific group of people. Therefore, his unreasonable action for killing people, thinking that he has the right to do so, is one of the most lethal forms of aggression. For Stalin, he had created a country through is dictatorship with the ideology of communism. He had aggressed his beliefs upon his own people with his plans of creating a country that would be seen as a military superpower. He had caused many to die with the famine and plan to boost agriculture. However, the source for this action was due to the fact that he believed in his ideology of [[Marxism]]/[[Leninism]].

'''Anton Schweitzer''' (6 June 1735 in [[Coburg]] – 23 November 1787 in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]]) was a German composer of [[opera]]s, who was affiliated with [[Abel Seyler]]'s [[Seyler theatrical company|theatrical company]].

He was a child prodigy who obtained the patronage of the duke of [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]], who sent him to study with [[Jakob Friedrich Kleinknecht]] at the court of [[Bayreuth]] in 1758, and then sent him to Italy (1764–66), and made him [[Kapellmeister]]. With the dismissal of the court orchestra at [[Hildburghausen]], he was enabled to tour Europe with the [[Seyler theatrical company]] from 1769. His most notable work is the opera ''[[Alceste (Schweitzer)|Alceste]]'' (1773), with a German [[libretto]] by [[Christoph Martin Wieland]], among the early German-language operas.{{sfn|Hans Michael Schletterer|1891}}

'''Antonio Banfi''' (Vimercate, 30 September 1886 – Milano, 22 July 1957) was an Italian philosopher and [[Italian senate|senator]].

Although influenced by the [[Marburg]] [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantians]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], whom he knew personally, Banfi moved away from Idealism and instead focused on [[Marxism]], in particular, [[historical materialism]].

Banfi joined the [[Italian Communist Party]] in 1947. He was elected to the Italian senate in 1948 and again in 1953.

'''Assata Olugbala Shakur''' (born '''JoAnne Deborah Byron'''; July 16, 1947, is a former member of the [[Black Liberation Army]], who was convicted (under New Jersey's "aiding and abetting" statute) of the [[Murder#Degrees of murder in the United States|first-degree murder]] of State Trooper Werner Foerster during a shootout on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] in 1973. On November 2, 1979, she escaped from prison, and in 1984, she surfaced in [[Cuba]], where she was granted [[political asylum]].

Born in [[Flushing, Queens]], she grew up in New York City and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. After she ran away from home several times, her aunt, who would later act as one of her lawyers, took her in. She became involved in political activism at [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]] and [[City College of New York]]. After graduation, she began using the name Assata Shakur, and briefly joined the [[Black Panther Party]]. She then joined the [[Black Liberation Army]], a loosely-knit offshoot of the Black Panthers which led an armed struggle against the US government through tactics such as robbing banks and killing police officers and drug dealers. 

Between 1971 and 1973, she was charged with several crimes and was the subject of a multi-state [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]]. In May 1973, Shakur was arrested after being wounded in a shootout on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Also involved in the shootout were [[New Jersey State Police|New Jersey State Troopers]] Werner Foerster and James Harper and BLA members [[Sundiata Acoli]] and Zayd Malik Shakur. Harper was wounded; Zayd was killed; Foerster was killed by Acoli. Between 1973 and 1977, she was charged with [[murder]], [[attempted murder]], [[robbery|armed robbery]], [[bank robbery]], and [[kidnapping]] in relation to the shootout and six other incidents. She was acquitted on three of the charges and three were [[motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|dismissed]]. In 1977, she was convicted of the murder of Foerster (under New Jersey law the prosecution did not need to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Foerster or Zayd Shakur) and of seven other felonies related to the shootout, in a trial her supporters argue was unfair.
While serving a life sentence for murder she escaped from prison in 1979.

Shakur has lived in Cuba since 1984, despite US government efforts to have her returned. The FBI has added her to its [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists|list of most-wanted terrorists]] as Joanne Deborah Chesimard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/joanne-deborah-chesimard|title=JOANNE DEBORAH CHESIMARD|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Assata Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron, in [[Flushing, Queens]], [[New York City]], on July 16, 1947.&lt;ref name="fbibirth"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Robert Mueller|Mueller, Robert S. III]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/fugitives/dt/chesimard_jd.htm |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |title=Wanted by the FBI – Fugitive – Joanne Deborah Chesimard |accessdate=June 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611130142/http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/fugitives/dt/chesimard_jd.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |df= }} According to the FBI, Shakur has also used August 19, 1952, as a birthdate.&lt;/ref&gt; She lived for three years with her mother, school teacher Doris E. Johnson, and retired grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castellucci|first1=John|title=The big dance: the untold story of Kathy Boudin and the terrorist family that committed the Brink's robbery murders|date=1986|publisher=Dodd, Mead|isbn=9780396087137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEvZAAAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Shakur's parents divorced and she moved with her grandparents to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Shakur moved back to Queens with her mother and stepfather after elementary school, attending Parsons Junior High School. However, she still frequently visited her grandparents in the south. The family struggled financially and argued frequently; Shakur spent little time at home.&lt;ref&gt;Eyes of the Rainbow. Dir. Gloria Roland. Perf. Asset Shakur. 1997. May 4, 2013. Web. May 15, 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; She often ran away, staying with strangers and working for short periods of time, until she was taken in by her mother's sister Evelyn A. Williams, a civil rights worker, who lived in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="scheffler203"&gt;Scheffler, 2002, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that her aunt was the heroine of her childhood, as she was constantly introducing her to new things. She said that her aunt was "very sophisticated and knew all kinds of things. She was right up my alley because i [sic] was forever asking all kinds of questions. I wanted to know everything." Williams often took her to museums, theaters, and art galleries, and the conflicts that did rise between the two were typically due to Shakur's habit of lying.&lt;ref name="africana"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gates, Henry Louis, and Anthony Appiah |date=1999| title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|publisher= Basic Civitas Books|isbn= 0-465-00071-1|pages= 1697–1698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] as a child and attended the all-girls [[Cathedral High School (New York City)|Cathedral High School]],&lt;ref name="howell" /&gt; for six months before transferring to public high school, which she attended until she dropped out. Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a [[General Educational Development]] (GED) with her aunt's help.&lt;ref name="africana"/&gt; Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: "I didn’t know what a fool they had made out of me until I grew up and started to read real history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakur|first1=Assata|title=Assata: An Autobiography|date=1987|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=9781556520747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVVp9RLqlYwC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur attended [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]] (BMCC) and then the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) in the mid-1960s, where she was involved in many political activities, protests, and sit-ins.&lt;ref&gt;"Hands Off Assata Shakur: Angela Davis Calls for Radical Activism to Protect Activist Exiled in Cuba." Democracy Now! N.p., n.d. Web. 16 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She was arrested for the first time—with 100 other BMCC students—in 1967, on charges of trespassing. The students had chained and locked the entrance to a college building to protest low numbers of black faculty and the absence of a black studies program.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1967, she married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY. The married life ended within a year; they divorced in December 1970. Shakur's marriage receives one paragraph in her memoir, she wrote that it ended over their differing views of gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, 2000, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army==
After graduation from CCNY, Shakur briefly joined the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP).&lt;ref name="james"&gt;{{cite book| authors=James, Matthew Thomas &amp; James, Joy James (Ed.)|date=2005| title=The New Abolitionists: (Neo)slave Narratives And Contemporary Prison Writings|publisher= SUNY Press|isbn= 0-7914-6485-7|page= 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; She soon left the party, disliking the macho behavior of the men and believing that the BPP lacked knowledge and understanding of United States [[African diaspora|black history]].&lt;ref&gt;Shakur, 1987, p. 221-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur then joined the [[Black Liberation Army]] (BLA), an offshoot of the BPP whose members, inspired by the [[Vietcong]] and the [[Battle of Algiers (1956–57)|Battle of Algiers]], led a campaign of armed struggle against the U.S. government using tactics such as planting bombs, holding up banks and murdering drug dealers and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelman|first1=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-first Century Five-volume Set|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195167795|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&amp;pg=PA208|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_2013-05-03"&gt;{{cite news|author=Harris, Paul| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/03/fbi-wanted-first-woman-joanne-chesimard?INTCMP=SRCH |title=FBI makes Joanne Chesimard the first woman to appear on most-wanted list| work=The Guardian|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James, Joy |date=2003|title=Imprisoned Intellectuals: America's Political Prisoners Write on Life, Liberation, and Rebellion|publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield| isbn= 0-7425-2027-7|page= 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began using the name Assata Olugbala Shakur in 1971, rejecting Joanne Chesimard as a "slave name".&lt;ref name="africana"/&gt; Assata is a West African name, derived from the [[Arabic]] name [[Aisha]], said to mean "she who struggles", while Shakur means "thankful one" in Arabic. Olugbala means "savior" in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Van Deburg |author2=William L. | authorlink=William L. Van Deburg | date=1997| title= Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan| publisher= NYU Press| isbn= 0-8147-8789-4| page=269}} As early as 1973, Shakur referred to Joanne Chesimard as her "[[slave name]]".&lt;/ref&gt; She now identified as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: "It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really had nothing to do with me. I didn’t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. I felt like an African woman".&lt;ref&gt;Shakur, Assata. Assata - an autobiography. London: Zed, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations and manhunt==
On April 6, 1971, Shakur was shot in the stomach during a struggle with a guest at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania|Statler Hilton Hotel]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. According to police, Shakur knocked on the door of a guest's room, asked "Is there a party going on here?" then displayed a revolver and demanded money.&lt;ref name="NYT_1971-04-07"&gt;{{cite news |last=Waggoner|first= Walter H.|date= April 7, 1971 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/07/archives/woman-shot-in-struggle-with-her-alleged-victim.html |title=Woman Shot in Struggle With Her Alleged Victim|newspaper= ''The New York Times'' |page= 40|accessdate=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Shakur confirmed to a journalist that there was a drug connection to this incident but refused to elaborate.&lt;ref name="howell" /&gt;

She was booked on charges of attempted robbery, [[felony|felonious]] [[assault]], [[endangerment|reckless endangerment]], and possession of a deadly weapon, then released on [[bail]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (November 23, 1977), "Plea by Joanne Chesimard", p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur is alleged to have said that she was glad that she had been shot since, afterward, she was no longer afraid to be shot again.&lt;ref&gt;Seedman, Albert and Peter Hellman. (1975) ''Chief!''. Avon {{ISBN|0-380-00358-9}}. pp. 451–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an August 23, 1971, bank robbery in Queens, Shakur was sought for questioning. A photograph of a woman (who was later alleged to be Shakur) wearing thick-rimmed black glasses, with a high hairdo pulled tightly over her head, and pointing a gun, was widely displayed in banks. The [[New York Clearing House Association]] paid for full-page ads displaying material about Shakur.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, when asked in [[Cuba]] about police allegations that the BLA funded themselves through bank robberies and theft, Shakur responded, "There were expropriations, there were bank robberies."&lt;ref name="howell" /&gt;

On December 21, 1971, Shakur was named by the [[New York City Police Department]] as one of four suspects in a [[Grenade|hand grenade]] attack that destroyed a police car and slightly injured two patrolmen in [[Maspeth, Queens]]; a 13-state alarm was issued three days after the attack when a witness identified Shakur and Andrew Jackson from [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date= December 22, 1971 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/22/archives/2-suspects-named-in-grenade-attack.html |title=2 Suspects Named In Grenade Attack |page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pace, Eric (December 27, 1971). "Police See More Military Arms in Use". ''The New York Times'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (January 1, 1972). "A Suspect in Panther's Death Here Is Slain by F.B.I. in South", p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Michael T. (February 9, 1972), "9 in Black 'Army' Are Hunted in Police Assassinations". ''The New York Times'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officials in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] said that Shakur and Jackson had lived together in Atlanta for several months in the summer of 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Michael T. (January 30, 1973). "Police by Hundreds Comb 2 Boroughs for 6 Suspects in Ambush Shootings".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaufman, Michael T.]] (May 3, 1973), "Seized Woman Called Black Militants' 'Soul'". ''The New York Times'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur was one of those wanted for questioning for wounding a police officer attempting to serve a traffic summons in Brooklyn on January 26, 1972.&lt;ref name="w5"&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After an $89,000 Brooklyn bank robbery on March 1, 1972, a ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' headline asked: "Was that JoAnne?"; Shakur was also wanted for questioning after a September 1, 1972, Bronx bank robbery.&lt;ref name="w5"/&gt; Based on FBI photographs, [[Monsignor]] John Powis alleged that Shakur was involved in an armed robbery at his Our Lady of the Presentation Church in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]], on September 14, 1972.&lt;ref name="Daily News Article"&gt;Daly, Michael (December 13, 2006). "The Msgr. &amp; the Militant", ''New York Daily News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Shakur became the subject of a nationwide manhunt after the FBI alleged that she led a Black Liberation Army cell that had conducted a "series of cold-blooded murders of New York City police officers".&lt;ref name="churchill308"&gt;Churchill and Vander Wall, 2002, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI said these included the "execution style murders" of New York City Police Officers Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones on May 21, 1971, and NYPD officers Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie on January 28, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill and Vander Wall, 2002, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Seedman, Albert A.]] (1975). ''Chief!''. New York: Avon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur was alleged to have been directly involved with the Foster and Laurie murders, and involved tangentially with the Piagentini and Jones murders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert A. (May 3, 1973), "2 Die in Shootout; Militant Seized", ''Los Angeles Times'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Cuba, Shakur was asked about the BLA's alleged involvement in the killings of police officers; Shakur responded that "In reality, armed struggle historically has been used by people to liberate themselves... But the question lies in when do people use armed struggle... There were people [in the BLA] who absolutely took the position that it was just time to resist, and if black people didn't start to fight back against police brutality and didn't start to wage armed resistance, we would be annihilated."&lt;ref name="howell" /&gt;

Some sources identify Shakur as the ''de facto'' head of the BLA after the arrest of co-founder [[Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad|Dhoruba Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;Camisa, Harry (2003). ''Inside Out: Fifty Years Behind the Walls of New Jersey's Trenton State Prison''. Windsor Press and Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9726473-0-9}}, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Daley, Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Police, for example, described Shakur as "the final wanted fugitive, the soul of the gang, the mother hen who kept them together, kept them moving, kept them shooting".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, some police officers argued that her importance in the BLA had been exaggerated by the police, with one saying that they themselves had created a "myth" to "demonize" Shakur because she was "educated", "young and pretty".&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

As of February 17, 1972, when Shakur was identified as one of four BLA members on a short trip to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], she was wanted for questioning (along with Robert Vickers, Twyman Meyers, Samuel Cooper, and Paul Stewart) in relation to police killings, a Queens bank robbery, and the grenade attack.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Michael T.

''The New York Times'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur was announced as one of six suspects in the ambushing of four policemen—two in Jamaica, Queens, and two in [[Brooklyn]]—on January 28, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Perlmutter, Emanuel (January 29, 1973), "Extra Duty Tours For Police Set Up After 2D Ambush", ''The New York Times'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1973, an apparatus that would become the FBI's [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] (JTTF)&lt;ref&gt;According to Churchill and Vander Wall (2002): "What had emerged in the 1980s was a formal amalgamation of FBI COINTELPRO specialists and New York City red squad detectives known as the Joint Terrorist Task Force (JTTF), consolidating the more ''ad hoc'' models of such an apparatus which had materialized in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles during the late 1960s" (p. 309); "JTTF: The Joint Terrorist Task Force, created in the late 1970s as an interlock between the FBI and New York City red squads to engage in COINTELPRO-type activities" (p. xiii).&lt;/ref&gt; was issuing nearly daily briefings on Shakur's status and the allegations against her.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 3.&lt;br/&gt;"It was the spring of 1973 and for the last two years the nationwide dragnet for her capture had intensified each time a young African American identified as a member of the BLA was arrested or wounded or killed. The Joint Terrorist Task Force, made up of the FBI and local police agencies across the country, issued daily bulletins predicting her imminent apprehension each time another bank had been robbed or another cop had been killed. Whenever there was a lull in such occurrences, they leaked information, allegedly classified as 'confidential,' to the media, repeating past accusations and flashing her face across television screens and newspapers with heartbeat regularity, lest the public forget."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ck16"&gt;Cleaver and Katsiaficas, 2001, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cleaver and Katsiaficas, the FBI and local police "initiated a national search-and-destroy mission for suspected BLA members, collaborating in stakeouts that were the products of intensive political repression and counterintelligence campaigns like NEWKILL". They "attempted to tie Assata to every suspected action of the BLA involving a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver and Katsiaficas, 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The JTTF would later serve as the "coordinating body in the search for Assata and the renewed campaign to smash the BLA", after her escape from prison.&lt;ref name="ck16"/&gt; After her capture, however, Shakur was not charged with any of the crimes for which she was the subject of the manhunt.&lt;ref name="churchill308"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marable529"&gt;[[Manning Marable|Marable, Manning]], and [[Mullings, Leith]].

It is at this point, with the questioning of Acoli, that the accounts of the confrontation begin to differ (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|witnesses section]] below).&lt;ref name="sul3"/&gt; However, in the ensuing shootout, Trooper Foerster was shot twice in the head with his own gun and killed,&lt;ref name="wag2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sul3"/&gt; Zayd Shakur was killed, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.

According to a New Jersey Police spokesperson, Assata Shakur was on her way to a "new hideout in Philadelphia" and "heading ultimately for Washington" and a book in the vehicle contained a list of potential BLA targets.&lt;ref name="sullivan"/&gt; Assata Shakur testified that she was on her way to Baltimore for a job as a bar waitress.&lt;ref name="sul2"/&gt;

Assata Shakur, with gunshot wounds in both arms and a shoulder, was moved to [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital|Middlesex General Hospital]] under "heavy guard" and was reported to be in "serious condition"; Trooper Harper was wounded in the left shoulder, in "good" condition, and given a protective guard at the hospital.&lt;ref name="sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sullivan2"/&gt; Assata Shakur was interrogated and arraigned from her hospital bed,&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, 1994, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; and her medical care during this period is often alleged to have been "substandard".&lt;ref name="africana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 1998, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Angela Davis|Davis, Angela Yvonne]]. 2003.

==Criminal charges and dispositions==
Between 1973 and 1977, in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], Shakur was indicted ten times, resulting in seven different criminal trials. Shakur was charged with two [[bank robbery|bank robberies]], the [[kidnapping]] of a Brooklyn [[heroin]] dealer, the [[attempted murder]] of two Queens police officers stemming from a January 23, 1973, failed ambush, and eight other felonies related to the Turnpike shootout.&lt;ref name="churchill308"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;Nelson, Jim (February 29, 1988).

===Turnpike shootout change of venue===
On the charges related to the New Jersey Turnpike shootout, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a [[change of venue]] in 1973 from [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]] to [[Morris County, New Jersey]], saying "it was almost impossible to obtain a jury here comprising people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice."&lt;ref name="Hershberger"&gt;Hershberger, James (March 24, 2006). "Assata Shakur: Case of oppression in U.S". ''Daily Toreador''.&lt;/ref&gt; Polls of residents in Middlesex County, where Acoli had been convicted less than three years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (March 12, 1974). "News Summary and Index; The Major Events of the Day", p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 83% knew her identity and 70% said she was guilty.&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt;

===Bronx bank robbery mistrial===
In December 1973, Shakur was tried for a September 29, 1972, $3,700 robbery of the [[Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company]] in [[the Bronx]], along with co-defendant Kamau Sadiki (born Fred Hilton).&lt;ref name="p81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="awaited"/&gt; In light of the pending murder prosecution against Shakur in New Jersey state court, her lawyers requested that the trial be postponed for six months to permit further preparation. Judge [[Lee P. Gagliardi]] denied a postponement, and the Second Circuit denied Shakur's petition for [[mandamus]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesimard v. Gagliardi, 489 F.2d 271 (2d Cir. 1973) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt; In protest, the lawyers stayed mute, and Shakur and Sadiki conducted their own defense.&lt;ref name="p81"&gt;Perkins, 2000, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awaited"&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 14, 1973). "Chesimard Verdict Still Awaited Here", p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other BLA members were indicted by District Attorney Eugene Gold in connection with the series of holdups and shootings on the same day,&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' (August 23, 1973). "9 'Black Liberation' Suspects Indicted", p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; who—according to Gold—represented the "top echelon" of the BLA as determined by a year-long investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Vincent (August 24, 1973). "Black Liberation leaders indicted". ''Chicago Tribune'', p. A16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution's case rested largely on the testimony of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 30, 1973), "Chesimard Acquitted", p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank.&lt;ref name="prial"&gt;Prial, Frank J. (December 12, 1973). "Prosecution Rests Case on Chesimard Robbery Trial; Defendant Ejected", ''The New York Times'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; White and Rivers, although convicted, had not yet been sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony.&lt;ref name="prial"/&gt; White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [[.357 magnum]] pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial.&lt;ref name="prial"/&gt; Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied.&lt;ref name="p81"/&gt; The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with [[pleurisy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 7, 1973), "Miss Chesimard Ill; Trial Here Delayed", p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, the defendants were escorted to a "holding pen" outside the courtroom several times after shouting complaints and epithets at Judge Gagliardi.&lt;ref name="NYT_1973-12-06"&gt;Lichtenstein, Grace. 1973-12-06.

Retrieved on 2008-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Both defendants were repeatedly cited for [[contempt of court]] and eventually barred from the courtroom, where the trial continued in their absence.&lt;ref name="p81"/&gt; A contemporary ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial criticized Williams for failing to maintain courtroom "decorum," comparing her actions to William Kunstler's recent contempt conviction for his actions during the "[[Chicago Seven]]" trial.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 8, 1973). "Order in Court", p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadiki's lawyer, Robert Bloom, attempted to have the trial dismissed and then postponed due to new "revelations" regarding the credibility of White, a former co-defendant working for the prosecution.&lt;ref name="licht"&gt;Lichtenstein, Grace (December 11, 1973). "Judge and Defendants Clash Again as Chesimard Jury Is Chosen", ''The New York Times'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom had been assigned to defend Hilton over the summer, but White was not disclosed as a government witness until right before the trial.&lt;ref name="prial2"&gt;Prial, Frank J. (December 15, 1973). "Mistrial Declared in Chesimard Case as Jury Splits 11-1", ''The New York Times'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Gagliardi instructed both the prosecution and the defense not to bring up Shakur or Sadiki's connections to the BLA, saying they were "not relevant".&lt;ref name="licht"/&gt; Gagliardi denied requests by the jurors to pose questions to the witnesses—either directly or through him—and declined to provide the jury with information they requested about how long the defense had been given to prepare, saying it was "none of their concern".&lt;ref&gt;Prial, Frank J. (December 13, 1973), "Chesimard Trial Goes To The Jury", ''The New York Times'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This trial resulted in a [[hung jury]] and then a mistrial when the jury reported to Gagliardi that they were hopelessly deadlocked for the fourth time.&lt;ref name="prial2"/&gt;

===Bronx bank robbery retrial===
The retrial was delayed for one day to give the defendants more time to prepare.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 18, 1973). "2d Chesimard Trial Delayed", p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The new jury selection was marked by attempts by Williams to be relieved of her duties, owing to disagreements with Shakur as well as with Hilton's attorney.&lt;ref name="nyt12191773"&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 19, 1973). "Second Chesimard Jury Being Picked", p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Arnold Bauman denied the application, but directed another lawyer, Howard Jacobs, to defend Shakur while Williams remained the attorney of record.&lt;ref name="nyt12191773"/&gt; Shakur was ejected following an argument with Williams, and Hilton left with her as jury selection continued.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hartford Courant'', (December 19, 1973). "Court Ejects Defendant Again", p. 74B.&lt;/ref&gt; After the selection of twelve jurors (60 were excused), Williams was allowed to retire from the case, with Shakur officially representing herself, assisted by lawyer Florynce Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 20, 1973). "Jury Picked for New Chesimard Trial", p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair clippings to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from a surveillance camera as Shakur's.&lt;ref name="prial3"&gt;Prial, Frank J. (December 21, 1973). "Mrs. Chesimard Is Ousted Again as 2d Trial for Robbery Begins", ''The New York Times'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy objected to this identification on the grounds that the prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to [[Stipulated judgment|stipulate]] that Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs.&lt;ref name="prial3"/&gt; Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur in the photograph was wearing a jacket.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt; The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be [[Allah]] in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 22, 1973).

Shakur personally cross-examined the witnesses, getting White to admit that he had once been in love with her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 25, 1973).

Kuhlthau, 370 F. Supp. 473 (D.N.J. 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before jury selection was complete, it was discovered that Shakur was pregnant. Due to the possibility of [[miscarriage]], the prosecution successfully requested a mistrial for Shakur; Acoli's trial continued.&lt;ref name="preg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (February 2, 1974), "Chesimard Pregnancy Leads to Mistrial", p. 63, column 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hinds"&gt;Hinds, Lennox (October 26, 1998).

===Attempted murder dismissal===
Shakur and four others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973, on charges of attempting to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in an ambush in [[St. Albans, Queens]] on January 28, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (January 1, 1974). "Chesimard And Four Named In Shootings", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 1974, two new defendants (Jeannette Jefferson and Robert Hayes) were named in an indictment involving the same charges.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (March 6, 1974). "2 More Named in Attempt On Police Officers' Lives", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, while Shakur was pregnant,&lt;ref name="preg"&gt;Kamau Sadiki (born Fred W. X. Hilton), a co-defendant who shared a cell with Shakur during their trial for armed robbery in the Bronx (of which both were acquitted), is believed to be the father. See Kirsta, Alix (May 29, 1999), "A black and white case&amp;nbsp;– Investigation&amp;nbsp;– Joanne Chesimard", ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey Governor [[Brendan Byrne]] signed an [[extradition]] order to move Shakur to New York to face two counts of attempted murder, attempted assault, and possession of dangerous weapons related to the alleged ambush; however, Shakur declined to waive her right to an extradition hearing, and asked for a full hearing before Middlesex County Court Judge John E. Bachman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hartford Courant'' (May 1, 1974). "Woman Balks At Extradition", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur was extradited to New York City on May 6,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (May 7, 1974). "Joanne Chesimard Is Extradited", p. 96, column 5.&lt;/ref&gt; arraigned on May 11 (pleading innocent), and remanded to jail by Justice Albert S.

"Accused Police Slayer Arraigned in 2 Cases", p. 29D.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1974, New York State Supreme Court Justice Peter Farrell dismissed the attempted murder indictment because of insufficient evidence, declaring "The court can only note with disapproval that virtually a year has passed before counsel made an application for the most basic relief permitted by law, namely an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the grand jury."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (November 2, 1974), "Judge Quashes Indictment Against Joanne Chesimard", p. 36, column 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnapping trial===
Shakur was indicted on May 30, 1974, on the charge of having robbed a Brooklyn bar and kidnapping bartender James E. Freeman for ransom.&lt;ref name="2case"/&gt; Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were accused of entering the bar with pistols and shotguns, taking $50 from the register, kidnapping the bartender, leaving a note demanding a $20,000 ransom from the bar owner, and fleeing in a rented truck.&lt;ref name="baracquit"/&gt; Freeman was said to have later escaped unhurt.&lt;ref name="baracquit"/&gt; The text of Shakur's opening statement in the trial is reproduced in her autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Christol, 2001, p. 140. Her other texts in the book are a July 4, 1973 speech ("To My People"), which was broadcast on many radio stations, an exposition on the theory of "armed revolutionary struggle", and many poems.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were acquitted on December 19, 1975, after seven hours of jury deliberation, ending a three-month trial in front of Judge William Thompson.&lt;ref name="baracquit"&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 20, 1975).

===Queens bank robbery trial===
In July 1973, after being indicted by a grand jury, Shakur pleaded not guilty in Federal Court in Brooklyn to an indictment related to a $7,700 robbery of the [[Bankers Trust|Bankers Trust Company]] bank in Queens on August 31, 1971.&lt;ref name="qbank"&gt;''The New York Times'' (January 7, 1976).

&lt;!--The capitalization of the following quotation is correct--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have decided to act as co-counsel, and to make this opening statement, not because I have any illusions about my legal abilities, but, rather, because there are things that I must say to you. I have spent many days and nights behind bars thinking about this trial, this outrage. And in my own mind, only someone who has been so intimately a victim of this madness as I have can do justice to what I have to say.&lt;ref name="rod63"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One bank employee testified that Shakur was one of the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain.&lt;ref name="qacquit"/&gt; The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use [[photo manipulation]]; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible.&lt;ref name="p81"/&gt; In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record.&lt;ref name="Shakur, 1987, p. 161"&gt;Shakur, 1987, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage.&lt;ref name="qacquit"/&gt; The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;Taylor, Mark Lewis (January 17, 1999), "[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/17/nyregion/soapbox-flight-from-justice.html Soapbox; Flight From Justice]". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved on 2007-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur was acquitted after seven hours of jury deliberation on January 16, 1976,&lt;ref name="qacquit"&gt;''The New York Times'' (January 17, 1976), "[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30910F8395A1A7493C5A8178AD85F428785F9 Joanne Chesimard Is Acquitted In Robbery of a Bank in Queens]", p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and was immediately remanded back to New Jersey for the Turnpike trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' (January 17, 1976).

===Turnpike shootout retrial===
[[File:Map of New Jersey highlighting Middlesex County.svg|thumb|Shakur's murder trial for the Turnpike shootout took place in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], not far from the [[East Brunswick, New Jersey|East Brunswick]] site of the gunfight.]]

By the time she was retried in 1977, Acoli had already been convicted of shooting and murdering Foerster.&lt;ref name="johnston2"/&gt; The prosecution argued that Assata had fired the bullets that had wounded Harper, while the defense argued that the now deceased Zayd had fired them.&lt;ref name="sulliv" /&gt; Based on New Jersey law, if Shakur's presence at the scene could be considered as "aiding and abetting" the murder of Foerster, she could be convicted even if she had not fired the bullets which had killed him.&lt;ref name="guard" /&gt;

A total of 289&amp;nbsp;articles had been published in the local press relating to the various crimes with which Shakur had been accused.&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt; Shakur again attempted to [[Removal jurisdiction|remove]] the trial to federal court. The [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] denied the petition and also denied Shakur an injunction against the holding of trial proceedings on Fridays (the [[Sabbath#Islam|Muslim Sabbath]]).&lt;ref name="wag2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janson, Donald (February 19, 1977). "Mrs. Chesimard Bids U.S. Court Bar Trial Sessions on Her Sabbath". ''The New York Times'', p. 51, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (January 27, 1977). "Chesimard Plea Rejected", p. 76, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[en banc]] panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey v. Chesimard, 555 F.2d 63 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc).&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine-week trial was widely publicized, and was even reported on by the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS).&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="b159"/&gt; During the trial, hundreds of civil rights campaigners demonstrated outside of the Middlesex County courthouse each day.&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt;

Following the 13-minute opening statement by Edward J. Barone, the first assistant Middlesex County prosecutor (directing the case for the state), William Kunstler (the chief of Shakur's defense staff) moved immediately for a mistrial, calling the eight-count grand jury indictment "adversary proceeding solely and exclusively under the control of the prosecutor", whom Kunstler accused of "improper prejudicial remarks"; Judge Theodore Appleby, noting the frequent defense interruptions that had characterized the previous days' jury selection, denied the motion.&lt;ref name="wag"/&gt;

On February 23, Shakur's attorneys filed papers asking Judge Appleby to [[subpoena]] FBI Director [[Clarence M. Kelley|Clarence Kelley]], Senator [[Frank Church]] and other federal and New York law enforcement officials to testify about the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations.&lt;ref name="sul"&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F. (February 24, 1977), "Chesimard Attorney Acts to Call Kelley; Wants F.B.I. Director and Others to Testify on Program Aimed at Harassing Activists", ''The New York Times'', p. 76, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents.&lt;ref name="sul"/&gt; The motion (argued March 2)—which also asked the court to require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged [[COINTELPRO]] involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.&lt;ref name="sul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joy"/&gt;

Shakur herself was called as a witness on March 15, the first witness called by the defense; she denied shooting either Harper or Foerster, and also denied handling a weapon during the incident. She was questioned by her own attorney, Stuart Ball, for under 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, and then cross-examined by Barone for less than two hours (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|Witnesses section]] below).&lt;ref name="sul2"/&gt; Ball's questioning ended with the following exchange:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On that night of May 2[n]d, did you shoot, kill, execute or have anything to do with the death of Trooper Werner Foerster?

No.

Did you shoot or assault Trooper James Harper?

No.&lt;ref name="sul2"&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 16, 1977). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/16/archives/mrs-chesimard-on-stand-denies-having-weapon-in-turnpike-shooting.html Mrs. Chesimard, on Stand, Denies Having Weapon in Turnpike Shooting]", ''The New York Times'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Under cross-examination, Shakur was unable to explain how three magazines of ammunition and 16 live shells had gotten into her shoulder bag; she also admitted to knowing that Zayd Shakur carried a gun at times, and specifically to seeing a gun sticking out of Acoli's pocket while stopping for supper at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant shortly before the shooting.&lt;ref name="sul2"/&gt; Shakur admitted to carrying an identification card with the name "Justine Henderson" in her billfold the night of the shootout, but denied using any of the aliases on the long list that Barone proceeded to read.&lt;ref name="sul2"/&gt;

====Defense attorneys====
[[File:William Kunstler.jpg|thumb|Lawyer [[William Kunstler]] was the chief of Shakur's defense staff.]]

Shakur's defense attorneys were [[William Kunstler]] (the chief of Shakur's defense staff),&lt;ref name="wag"/&gt; Stuart Ball, Robert Bloom, [[Raymond A. Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Joseph. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/nyregion/12brown.html "Raymond A. Brown, Civil Rights Lawyer, Dies at 94"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 11, 2009.

Her attorneys, in particular Lennox Hinds, were often held in [[contempt of court]], which the [[National Conference of Black Lawyers]] cited as an example of [[systemic bias]] in the judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (May 9, 1977). "Black Legal Group Assails U.S. Courts; Lawyers at Conference Find Bias Still Exists Against Blacks Despite Constitutional Bans", p. 67, column 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Jersey Legal Ethics Committee also investigated complaints against Hinds for comparing Shakur's murder trial to "legalized lynching"&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (March 2, 1977), "Complaint on Lawyer". Section 2, p. 21, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; undertaken by a "[[kangaroo court]]".&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Matter of Hinds, 449 A.2d 483 (N.J. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinds' disciplinary proceeding reached the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Ass'n'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kunstler's autobiography, the sizable contingent of New Jersey State Troopers guarding the courthouse were under strict orders from their commander, Col. Clinton Pagano, to completely shun Shakur's defense attorneys.&lt;ref name="k276"/&gt;

Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby [[Rutgers University]] that in part discussed the upcoming trial,&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Waldron|Waldron, Martin]] (December 3, 1976), "Kunstler and the Courts in a Battle On Right to Discuss Pending Trial". ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 21, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (December 15, 1976), "Judge Approves Kunstler". Section 2, p. 53, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each visit with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles.&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt; Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office that resulted in the disappearance of trial documents,&lt;ref name="joy"/&gt; amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case.&lt;ref&gt;Christol, 2001, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Her lawyers also claimed that their offices were [[Covert listening device|bugged]].&lt;ref name="p81"/&gt;

====Witnesses====
Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses.&lt;ref name="williamsfacts"&gt;Williams, Evelyn A. (June 25, 2005). "[http://assatashakur.org/appeal_case_facts_2005.htm Statement of Facts in the New Jersey trial of Assata Shakur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214235315/http://www.assatashakur.org/appeal_case_facts_2005.htm |date=2006-12-14 }}". The Talking Drum Collective. Retrieved on 2008-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give a statement to the police.&lt;ref&gt;Schuppe, Jonathan (February 8, 2004), "In parole bid, Chesimard cohort denies killing trooper", ''The Star-Ledger''.&lt;/ref&gt; The driver traveling north on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.&lt;ref name="williamsfacts"/&gt;

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand. She said that the second shot hit her in the back as she turned to avoid it, and that she fell onto the road for the duration of the gunfight before crawling back into the backseat of the Pontiac—which Acoli drove {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} down the road and parked. She testified that she remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.&lt;ref name="sul3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="williamsfacts"/&gt;

Trooper Harper's official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehicle for Trooper Foerster—who had arrived on the scene—to examine his [[driver's license]].&lt;ref name="williamsfacts"/&gt; The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the [[vehicle registration|registration]], Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition magazine as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red [[Handbag|pocketbook]], pulled out a [[9 mm caliber|nine-millimeter weapon]] and fired at him.&lt;ref name="williamsfacts"/&gt; Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.&lt;ref name="williamsfacts"/&gt;

====Jury====
A total of 408 potential jurors were questioned during the ''[[voir dire]]'', which concluded on February 14.&lt;ref name="wag"&gt;Waggoner, Walter H. (February 16, 1977), "[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/16/archives/chesimard-murder-trial-opens-in-new-brunswick-execution-of-trooper.html Chesimard Murder Trial Opens in New Brunswick]". ''The New York Times'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the 15 jurors—ten women and five men—were white, and most were under thirty years old.&lt;ref name="wag"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (February 15, 1977), "Chesimard Jury Chosen", p. 67, column 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Five jurors had personal ties to State Troopers (one girlfriend, two nephews, and two friends).&lt;ref name="joy"&gt;James, Joy, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browder, 2006, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; A sixteenth female juror was removed before the trial formally opened, when it was determined that Sheriff Joseph DeMarino of Middlesex County, while a private detective several years earlier, had worked for a lawyer who represented the juror's husband.&lt;ref name="wag"/&gt; Judge Appleby repeatedly denied Kunstler's requests for DeMarino to be removed from his responsibilities for the duration of the trial "because he did not divulge his association with the juror".&lt;ref name="wag"/&gt;

One prospective juror was dismissed for reading ''Target Blue'',&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Robert. 1973. ''Target Blue: An Insider's View of the N.Y.P.D.''. Delacorte Press. {{ISBN|978-0-440-08489-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a book by Robert Daley, a former New York City Deputy Police Commander, which dealt in part with Shakur and had been left in the jury assembly room.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (January 25, 1974), "Chesimard Panelist Out For Reading Daley Book", p. 71, column 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the jury entered the courtroom, Judge Appleby ordered Shakur's lawyers to remove a copy of ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' by [[Alex Haley]] from a position on the defense counsel table easily visible to jurors.&lt;ref name="wag"/&gt; The ''Roots'' [[Roots (1977 miniseries)|TV miniseries]] adapted from the book and shown shortly before the trial was believed to have evoked feelings of "[[White guilt|guilt and sympathy]]" with many white viewers.&lt;ref name="wag"/&gt;

Shakur's attorneys sought a new trial on the grounds that one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's [[Jury sequestration|sequestration]] order.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (April 20, 1977). "Chesimard Retrial Asked". Section 2, p. 23, column 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler's claim that the juror had violated the order.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', May 10, 1977. "Law Group Urges Grand Jury Change", p. 71, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern later sued Kunstler for [[Slander and libel|defamation]];&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Alan (February 3, 1978), "Notes on People", ''The New York Times'', p. 16, column 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement.&lt;ref name="k277"/&gt; Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later learned from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them to convict Shakur.&lt;ref name="k277"&gt;Kunstler, 1994, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical evidence====
[[File:Illu pectoral girdles.png|thumb|Shakur's broken [[clavicle]] was a key element of her defense, and the implications of her injury for the differing accounts of the shootout were points of contention.]]

A key element of Shakur's defense was [[forensic biology|medical testimony]] meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A [[neurologist]] testified that the [[median nerve]] in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger.&lt;ref name="hinds"/&gt; Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper's testimony) "would be anatomically impossible".&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wag4"&gt;Waggoner, Walter H. (March 17, 1977). "Neurosurgeon's Testimony Backs Mrs. Chesimard", ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 20, column 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson based his testimony on an August 4, 1976, examination of Shakur and on [[X-ray]]s taken immediately after the shootout at Middlesex General Hospital.&lt;ref name="wag4"/&gt; Prosecutor Barone questioned whether Davidson was qualified to make such a judgment 39&amp;nbsp;months after the injury; Barone proceeded to suggest (while a female Sheriff's attendant acted out his suggestion) that Shakur was struck in the right arm and collar bone and "then spun around by the impact of the bullet so an immediate second shot entered the fleshy part of her upper left arm" to which Davidson replied "Impossible."&lt;ref name="wag4"/&gt;

Dr. David Spain, a [[pathologist]] from [[Brookdale Community College]], testified that her bullet scars as well as X-rays supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was "no conceivable way" the first bullet could have hit Shakur's [[clavicle]] if her arm was down.&lt;ref name=sulliv&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 18, 1977). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/18/archives/doctor-testifies-on-bullet-scars-in-chesimard-trial.html Doctor Testifies On Bullet Scars in Chesimard Trial]", ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 24, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Joy, and Sharpley-Whiting, T. Denean (2000), ''The Black Feminist Reader''. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-631-21007-5}}, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for any further expert defense testimony.&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt; Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in ''Inadmissible Evidence'', both claim that it was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of a [[conflict of interest]] when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, 2000, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other evidence====
According to [[Angela Davis]], [[neutron activation analysis]] that was administered after the shootout showed no [[gunpowder]] residue on Shakur's fingers and forensic analysis performed at the [[Trenton, New Jersey]], crime lab and the FBI crime labs in [[Washington, D.C.]] did not find her [[fingerprint]]s on any weapon at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakur|first1=Assata|title=Assata: An Autobiography|date=2016|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|isbn=9781783606818|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPBiDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200&amp;nbsp;yards (183&amp;nbsp;m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.&lt;ref name="kirsta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="howell"&gt;Howell, Ron (Oct. 11, 1987) "'On the Run With Assata Shakur' - ''Newsday''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conviction and sentencing====
On March 24, the jurors listened for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes to a rereading of testimony of the State Police chemist regarding the blood found at the scene, on the LeMans, and Shakur's clothing.&lt;ref name="sul3"/&gt; That night, the second night of jury deliberation, the jury asked Judge Appleby to repeat his instructions regarding the four assault charges 30&amp;nbsp;minutes before retiring for the night, which led to speculation that the jury had decided in Shakur's favor on the remaining charges, especially the two counts of murder.&lt;ref name="sul3"&gt;Sullivan, Joseph E. (March 25, 1977). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/25/archives/chesimard-jury-asks-clarification-of-assault-charges.html Chesimard Jury Asks Clarification of Assault Charges]", ''The New York Times'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Appleby reiterated that the jury must consider separately the four assault charges (atrocious assault and battery, assault on a police officer acting in the line of duty, [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and assault with intent to kill), each of which carried a total maximum penalty of 33&amp;nbsp;years in prison.&lt;ref name="sul3"/&gt; The other charges were: first-degree murder (of Foerster), second-degree murder (of Zayd Shakur), illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery (related to Foerster's service revolver).&lt;ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/&gt; The jury also asked Appleby to repeat the definitions of "[[intent (law)|intent]]" and "[[reasonable doubt]]".&lt;ref name="sul3"/&gt;

Shakur was convicted on all eight counts: two murder charges, and six assault charges.&lt;ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/&gt; The prosecution did not need to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerster or Zayd Shakur: being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law.&lt;ref name="kirsta"&gt;Kirsta, Alix (May 29, 1999), "A black and white case&amp;nbsp;– Investigation&amp;nbsp;– Joanne Chesimard". ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the verdict, Shakur said—in a "barely audible voice"—that she was "ashamed that I have even taken part in this trial" and that the jury was "racist" and had "convicted a woman with her hands up".&lt;ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/&gt; Judge Appleby told the court attendants to "remove the prisoner" and Shakur replied: "the prisoner will walk away on her own feet".&lt;ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/&gt; After Joseph W. Lewis, the jury foreman, read the verdict, Kunstler asked that the jury be removed before alleging that one juror had violated the sequestration order (see above).&lt;ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/&gt;

At the post-trial press conference, Kunstler blamed the verdict on racism, stating that "the white element was there to destroy her". When asked by a reporter why, if that were the case, it took the jury 24 hours to reach a verdict, Kunstler replied, "That was just a pretense." A few minutes later the prosecutor Barone disagreed with Kunstler's assessment saying the trial's outcome was decided "completely on the facts".&lt;ref name="NYT_1977-03-26"/&gt;

At Shakur's sentencing hearing on April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33&amp;nbsp;years in state prison (10 to 12 for the four counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory life sentence]]. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] had recently narrowed the application of the law.&lt;ref name="sentencing"&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F. (April 26, 1977). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/26/archives/assault-charges-add-26-years-to-mrs-chesimards-life-term.html Assault Charges Add 26 Years To Mrs. Chesimard's Life Term]", ''The New York Times'', p. 83, column 4. Retrieved on 2008-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30&amp;nbsp;days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for [[contempt of court]], concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom.&lt;ref name="sentencing"/&gt; To become eligible for [[parole]], Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25&amp;nbsp;years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.&lt;ref name="sentencing"/&gt;

===Nelson murder dismissal===
In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dismissed murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the death of Richard Nelson during a hold-up of a Brooklyn social club on December 28, 1972, ruling that the state had [[Speedy trial|delayed too long]] in bringing her to trial. Judge Starkey said, "People have constitutional rights, and you can't shuffle them around."&lt;ref name="seigel"&gt;Seigel, Max H. (October 26, 1977).

''The New York Times'', p. 25, column 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was delayed in being brought to trial as a result of an agreement between the governors of New York and New Jersey as to the priority of the various charges against Shakur.&lt;ref name="seigel"/&gt; Three other defendants were indicted in relation to the same holdup: Melvin Kearney, who died in 1976 from an eight-floor fall while trying to escape from the Brooklyn House of Detention, Twymon Myers, who was killed by police while a fugitive, and Andrew Jackson, the charges against whom were dismissed when two prosecution witnesses could not identify him in a lineup.&lt;ref name="seigel"/&gt;

===Attempted robbery dismissal===
On November 22, 1977, Shakur pleaded not guilty to an attempted armed robbery indictment stemming from the 1971 incident at the [[Statler Hilton Hotel]].&lt;ref name="tribrob"&gt;''Chicago Tribune'' (November 24, 1977). "Black lib army 'chief' denies 1971 robbery", p. C23.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur was accused of attempting to rob a Michigan man staying at the hotel of $250 of cash and personal property.&lt;ref name="tribrob"/&gt; The prosecutor was C. Richard Gibbons.&lt;ref name="tribrob"/&gt; The charges were dismissed without trial.&lt;ref&gt;Shakur, 1987, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
[[File:Rikers Island.jpg|thumb|Shakur was kept in solitary confinement on [[Rikers Island]] for 21&amp;nbsp;months.]]

After the Turnpike shootings, Shakur was briefly held at the [[Garden State Youth Correctional Facility]]&lt;ref&gt;Churchill and Vander Wal, 2002, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; in Yardville, [[Burlington County, New Jersey]] and later moved to [[Rikers Island|Rikers Island Correctional Institution for Women]] in New York City&lt;ref name="scheffler203"/&gt; where she was kept in [[solitary confinement]]&lt;ref name="muhammad"&gt;Muhammad, Nisa Islam (May 16, 2005), "[http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_1990.shtml Assata: The stakes are raised]".

==Escape==
In early 1979, "the Family", a group of BLA members, began to plan Shakur's escape from prison.

===Extradition attempts===
In 1997, Carl Williams, the superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, wrote a letter to [[Pope John Paul II]] asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's [[extradition]] during his talks with President [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Sun Times'' (December 28, 1997), "N.J. cops enlist pope; Seek help in getting fugitive out of Cuba", p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with [[NBC]] journalist [[Ralph Penza]].&lt;ref name="assataletter2"&gt;Shakur, Assata.

The [[United States Congress]] passed a non-binding resolution in September 1998, asking Cuba for the return of Shakur as well as 90 fugitives believed by Congress to be residing in Cuba; House Concurrent Resolution 254 passed 371–0 in the House and by [[unanimous consent]] in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HC00254:@@@R House Concurrent Resolution 254].

In an open letter to Castro, [[chair (official)|chair]] of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] Representative [[Maxine Waters]] of California later explained that many members of the Caucus (including herself) were against Shakur's extradition but had mistakenly voted for the bill, which was placed on the accelerated suspension calendar, generally reserved for non-controversial legislation.&lt;ref name="waters"&gt;Waters, Maxine (September 29, 1998).

Castro did not refer to Shakur by name, but did describe a woman placed on the U.S. government terrorist watch list on May 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the FBI announced it had added Shakur to its list of 'most wanted terrorists', the first time that a woman was so designated.

Andalusian]] [[polymath]]: his writings include works regarding [[#Astronomy|astronomy]], [[#Physics|physics]], and [[#Music|music]], as well as [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[botany]], and [[Arabic poetry|poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p. 266, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN|0-87220-871-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the author of the ''Kitab al-Nabat'' ("The Book of Plants"), a popular work on [[botany]], which defined the sex of plants.
His philosophic ideas had a clear effect on [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes) and [[Albertus Magnus]]. Most of his writings and book were not completed (or well-organized) because of his early death. He had a vast knowledge of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]. His main contribution to [[Islamic philosophy]] was his idea on [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which was never completed.

Avempace was, in his time, not only a prominent figure of philosophy but also of music and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Dunlop, "The Dīwān Attributed to Ibn Bājjah (Avempace)", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London'' Vol. 14, No. 3, Studies Presented to Vladimir Minorsky by His Colleagues and Friends (1952), pp. 463''&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]] (Arabic: collection of poetry) was rediscovered in 1951.

Though many of his works have not survived, his theories on [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]] and [[physics]] were preserved by [[Maimonides]] and [[Averroes]] respectively, which influenced later astronomers and physicists in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], including [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest A. Moody (April 1951). "Galileo and Avempace: The Dynamics of the Leaning Tower Experiment (I)", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''12''' (2), p. 163-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avempace wrote one of the first, if not the first, commentary on Aristotle in the western world. While his work on projectile motion was never translated from arabic to latin, his views became well known around the western world and western philosophers, astronomers, and scientists of all nature. His works had major impacts on medieval thought at the time, his work even came to influence Galileo and his work. The views that Avempace wrote that become prominent on projectile motion are found in the text known as "Text 71". &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco|first=Abel B.|date=2003-10|title=Avempace, Projectile Motion, and Impetus Theory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3654219|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=64|issue=4|pages=521|doi=10.2307/3654219|issn=0022-5037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ibn Bajja (crater)|Ibn Bajja]] crater on the Moon is named in his honor.

==Biography==
Avempace was born in [[Zaragoza]] in what is today [[Aragon]], [[Spain]], around 1085&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-bajja/#LifCir&lt;/ref&gt; and died in [[Fes, Morocco]], in 1138. He worked as [[vizir]] for Abu Bakr ibn Ibrahim Ibn Tîfilwît, the [[Almoravid]] governor of [[Zaragoza]]. Avempace also wrote poems (panegyrics and [[muwashshahat]]) for him. Avempace joined in poetic competitions with the poet [[al-Tutili]]. After the fall of Zaragoza, Avempace looked for shelter from Yahyà ibn Yûsuf Ibn Tashufin, another brother of the [[Almoravid]] Sultan [[Yusuf Ibn Tashufin]] (died 1143) in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Lagardère, 1989, pp. 80 and 174-178&lt;/ref&gt; He worked, for some twenty years, as the vizir of Yahyà ibn Yûsuf Ibn Tashufin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Under Ibn Tashfin, the Sultan of the Berber Moroccan Almoravid empire, Avempace was imprisoned twice, but the details of the imprisonment are not well understood. Despite being unwelcomed, Avempace remained with the Almoravid empire for the rest of his life until his death in 1138. There has been evidence presented that brings up the argument that the cause of Avempace's death was by poison from his peers. However, it is unclear if he really was and who would have done it. Among his many teachers was [[Abu Jafar ibn Harun of Trujillo]], a physician in [[Seville]], [[Al-Andalus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Ibn Bajjah, also known as Avempace, was an important Islamic philosopher, among his many other trades. Islamic philosophy, post-hellenic world, was mainly divided into two opposing branches of thoughts. The Eastern branch, which was led by [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]], known as Avicenna in latin, and the Western branch, which was led by Ibn Bajjah. Avempace's work in philosophy is seen as uneven and mostly incomplete, but what parts of his work that survive to this day demonstrates originality in his thought process. His main philosophical work is the unfinished ethics-politico treatise ''Governance of the Solitary.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Gracia|first=Jorge J. E.|title=Philosophy in the Middle Ages: An Introduction|date=2007-11-26|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470996669.ch1|work=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|pages=1–11|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780470996669|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his writings, Ibn Bajjah has been shown to taken a liking to Plato's contribution to philosophy. Ibn Bajjah, in particular, takes from Plato's idea of the necessary connection between man and city with a bit of a twist. [[Plato]]'s idea was to model the perfect city after the human soul. On the other hand, Avempace wanted to use the perfect city as a model for the human soul. Avempace imagines the perfect city as a place that is free of any beliefs or opinions that are in opposition of the truth and where true science reigns supreme. Any man or idea that contradicts these true beliefs are defined as "weeds." Weeds are only to be found in imperfect cities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2018/entries/ibn-bajja/|title=Ibn Bâjja [Avempace]|last=Montada|first=Josép Puig|date=2018|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11-14-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avempace also wrote on the health of a perfect man. He eluded to the idea that the perfect man does not just require physical health, but spiritual health too. Avempace goes into more detail about the soul, which he describes of having both an acquired intellect, as well as an active intellect. The active intellect has no basis coming from the physical world. Acquired intellect, however, is a result of experiences from the material world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For Avempace, the highest form of spiritual happiness comes from science. Science allows for the truth to be discovered. As a result, in order to be spiritually healthy and, therefore, happy, we must obtain knowledge and search for the truth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite all the ideas that have been presented by Avempace, a central theory was never actually developed. He attributed this to being a very busy man and having his hands in a variety of a fields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Astronomy==
In [[Islamic astronomy]], [[Maimonides]] wrote the following on the planetary model proposed by Avempace:

{{quote|"I have heard that Abu Bakr [Ibn Bajja] discovered a system in which no [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] occur, but [[deferent|eccentric]] spheres are not excluded by him. I have not heard it from his pupils; and even if it be correct that he discovered such a system, he has not gained much by it, for eccentricity is likewise contrary to the principles laid down by [[Aristotle]].... I have explained to you that these difficulties do not concern the astronomer, for he does not profess to tell us the existing properties of the spheres, but to suggest, whether correctly or not, a theory in which the motion of the [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is uniform and circular, and in agreement with observation."&lt;ref&gt;''Guide for the Perplexed'' 2:24, quoted by Bernard R. Goldstein (March 1972). "Theory and Observation in Medieval Astronomy", ''Isis'' '''63''' (1), p. 39-47 [40-41].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his commentary on Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', Avempace presented his own theory on the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]. Aristotle believed the Milky Way to be caused by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the [[atmosphere]], in the [[Sublunary sphere|region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions]]." On the other hand, Aristotle's Arabic commentator Ibn al-Bitriq considered "the Milky Way to be a phenomenon exclusively of the heavenly spheres, not of the upper part of the atmosphere" and that the "light of those stars makes a visible patch because they are so close." Avempace's view differed from both, as he considered "the Milky Way to be a phenomenon both of the spheres above the moon and of the [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar region]]." The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] describes his theory and observation on the Milky Way as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josep Puig Montada|title=Ibn Bajja|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-bajja|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The Milky Way is the light of many stars which almost touch one another. Their light forms a “continuous image” (''khayâl muttasil'') on the surface of the body which is like a “tent” (''takhawwum'') under the fierily element and over the air which it covers. Avempace defines the continuous image as the result of [[refraction]] (''in‛ikâs'') and supports its explanation with an [[observation]] of a [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of two planets, [[Jupiter]] and [[Mars]] which took place in 500/1106-7. He watched the conjunction and “saw them having an elongate figure” although their figure is circular."}}

Avempace also reported observing "two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun." In the 13th century, the [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha]] astronomer [[Qotb al-Din Shirazi]] identified this observation as the transit of Venus and Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of oriental astronomy: proceedings of the joint discussion-17 at the 23rd General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, organised by the Commission 41 (History of Astronomy), held in Kyoto, August 25–26, 1997|author=S. M. Razaullah Ansari|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=2002|isbn=1-4020-0657-8|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Avempace cannot have observed a Venus transit, as there were no Venus transits in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Six Millennium Catalog of Venus Transits|author=[[Fred Espenak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==

Averroes was another important philosopher, and while he was born shortly before Avempace's death, Averroes later in life would be in opposition to Avempace's theories the majority of the time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/464219275|title=Galileo and Avempace : the dynamics of the learning tower experiment, (I) and (II)|last=1903-1975.|first=Moody, Ernest A. (Ernest Addison),|date=1951|publisher=Journal of the History of Ideas, Inc|oclc=464219275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avempace starts with a good kinematic definition of motion and construes it as a force. According to Avempace regarding freely falling objects, what is moved the a heavy body falls, is the heavy body and what moves it downward is its 'gravity' or its 'form' or 'nature'. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Text 71 of [[Averroes]]' commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' contains a discussion on Avempace's theory of motion, as well as the following quotation from the seventh book of Avempace's lost work on physics:

{{quote|"And this resistance which is between the plenum and the body which is moved in it, is that between which, and the potency of the void, Aristotle made the proportion in his fourth book; and what is believed to be his opinion, is not so. For the proportion of water to air in density is not as the proportion of the motion of the stone in water to its motion in air; but the proportion of the cohesive power of water to that of air is as the proportion of the retardation occurring to the moved body by reason of the medium in which it is moved, namely water, to the retardation occurring to it when it is moved in air."&lt;ref name=Moody-I-185&gt;Ernest A. Moody (April 1951). "Galileo and Avempace: The Dynamics of the Leaning Tower Experiment (I)", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''12''' (2), p. 163-193 [185].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"For, if what some people have believed were true, then the natural motion would be violent; therefore, if there were no resistance present, how could there be any motion? For it would necessarily be instantaneous. What then shall be said concerning the circular motion? There is no resistance there, because there is no cleavage of a medium involved; the place of the circle is always the same, so that it does not leave one place and enter another; it is therefore necessary that the circular motion should be instantaneous. Yet we observe in it the greatest slowness, as in the case of the fixed stars, and also the greatest speed, as in the case of the diurnal rotation. And this is caused only by the difference in perfection between the mover and the moved. When therefore the mover is of greater perfection, that which is moved by it will be more rapid; and when the mover is of lesser perfection, it will be nearer (in perfection) to that which is moved, and the motion will be slower."&lt;ref name=Moody-I-185/&gt;}}

Averroes writes the following comments on Avempace's theory of motion:

{{quote|"Avempace, however, here raises a good question. For he says that it does not follow that the proportion of the motion of one and the same stone in water to its motion in air is as the proportion of the density of water to the density of air, except on the assumption that the motion of the stone takes time only because it is moved in a medium. And if this assumption were true, it would then be the case that no motion would require time except because of something resisting it for the medium seems to impede the thing moved. And if this were so, then the heavenly bodies, which encounter no resistant medium, would be moved instantaneously. And he says that the proportion of the rarity of water to the rarity of air is as the proportion of the retardation occurring to the moved body in water, to the retardation occurring to it in air."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest A. Moody (April 1951). "Galileo and Avempace: The Dynamics of the Leaning Tower Experiment (I)", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''12''' (2), p. 163-193 [184-185].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"And if this which he has said be conceded, then Aristotle's demonstration will be false; because, if the proportion of the rarity of one medium to the rarity of the other is as the proportion of accidental retardation of the movement in one of them to the retardation occurring to it in the other, and is not as the proportion of the motion itself, it will not follow that what is moved in a void would be moved in an instant; because in that case there would be subtracted from the motion only the retardation affecting it by reason of the medium, and its natural motion would remain. And every motion involves time; therefore what is moved in a void is necessarily moved in time and with a divisible motion; nothing impossible will follow. This, then, is Avempace's question."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest A. Moody (April 1951). "Galileo and Avempace: The Dynamics of the Leaning Tower Experiment (I)", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''12''' (2), p. 163-193 [185-186].&lt;/ref&gt;}}


What follows is also found in Text 71:&lt;blockquote&gt; “This resistance offered to the moving body by the medium does not occur in the way Aristotle has established in the fourth book when he discussed the void. The velocity of a body is not inversely proportional to the density of the medium, but it is the retardation the motion is subject to by virtue of the medium, which is proportional to the density. If what Aristotle said was true, natural motion in a supposed void would not meet any resistance and it would not take time but be instantaneous. Also, the motion of the heavenly spheres, which do not traverse a medium, would occur instantaneously. We see these motions occurring with different finite velocities: the motion of the fixed stars is very slow; the daily motion is very fast. These differences in velocity are due to the fact that the movers of the spheres differ in nobility and the more noble a mover, the faster is the motion of the sphere moved by it.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In relation to the example of the stone falling through the mediums air and water, Avempace also brings up an example of dust particles to explain his ideas on natural movements. Dust particles are suspended in the air and naturally fall slowly. Despite having enough power to go down, it is still insufficient to displace the air underneath it&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

From Text 71; Ernest A. Moody who is a notable philosopher, medievalist, and logician, offered four main reasons in favor of the view that Avempace was at least a major thinker within the paradigm of the "Theory of an 'impressed force' ". &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following points are cited from his argument:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. "For Avempace...V = P - M, so that when M = 0, V = P. This opposes Aristotle's (supposed use of) V = P / M." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. "Internal coherence with this "law of motion" requires, Moody believes, also a defense of the theory of an impressed force - as we find for exampled in Philopponus himself." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. "Avempace's appeal to an 'impressed force' was also reflected in the fact that 'if we use modern terms, it might be said that the force of gravity, for Avempace, is not determined essentially as a relation between the masses of different bodies, but is conceived as an absolute indwelling power of self-motion animating the body like a soul." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;4. "The theory of an 'impressed force' appears to have been upheld by Al-Bitrogi, who was influenced ins ideas by Avempace's disciple Ibn-Tofail."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite diverging from Aristotle's theory of motion, it appears that Avempace largely agrees with Aristotle's ideas on projectile motion. While there is no known account that lay's out Avempace's ideas over this topic, Avempace gives a short explanation in his commentary of Aristotelian Physics book 8. An interesting piece by Avempace on the theory of projectile motion comes from his example involving a magnet and iron filaments. Magnets present a problem with Aristotle's theory on projectile motion because nothing can be seen physically moving the iron. Avempace, however, believes that a magnet is more complicated than one might think. He presents the idea that the magnet actually moves the air which, in return, moves the iron.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The central theory of the mover and the moved can be seen not only in his work in physics, but also in his work in Philosophy.

Avempace was a critic of [[Ptolemy]] and he worked on creating a new theory of velocity to replace the one theorized by Aristotle. Two future philosophers supported the theories Avempace created, known as the Avempacean dynamics. These philosophers were [[Thomas Aquinas]], a catholic priest, and [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] went on and adopted Avempace's formula and talked about "that the velocity of a given object is the difference of the motive power of that object and the resistance of the medium of motion" in the Pisan dialogue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Music==
Recently, the web page ''Webislam'' of Spanish converts to Islam, reported that the score of the ''[[Nuba al-Istihlál]]'' of Avempace (11th century), arranged by [[Omar Metiou]] and [[Eduardo Paniagua]], are very similar to [[Marcha Real|Marcha Granadera]] (18th century) is now the official anthem of Spain. That makes it the world's oldest song (about a thousand years old) used for the official anthem of a country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webislam.com/?idt=7092 Redacción de Webislam, «El himno nacional, ¿de origen andalusí?», Número 189, 8 de octubre de 2002.

'''''Black-Body Theory and the Quantum Discontinuity, 1894-1912''''' (1978; second edition 1987) is a book by the philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], in which the author surveys the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. The second edition has a new afterword.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;

==Summary==
Kuhn surveys the development of quantum mechanics by [[Max Planck]] at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hacking"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hacking, Ian |author=Kuhn, Thomas S. |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 50th anniversary edition |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2012 |pages=vii, viii |isbn=0-226-45812-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Planck misread his own earlier work.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Alexander Bird]] describes Kuhn's book as "masterly", writing that it "differs from traditional [[history of science]] less in the kind of explanation offered and more in the vast erudition and scholarly attention to detail displayed."&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bird, Alexander |title=Thomas Kuhn |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |year=2000 |pages=1, 215, 281, 299 |isbn=0-691-05710-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Tim Maudlin]], ''Planck and the Black Body Discontinuity'' (sic) "is a mixed bag: some good [[historiography]] and some poor analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/philosophy-has-made-plenty-of-progress/ [[John Horgan|Horgan, J.]] (Nov 1, 2018).

'''Béla Hamvas''' (23 March 1897 &amp;ndash; 7 November 1968) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] writer, [[philosopher]], and social critic. He was the first thinker to introduce the [[Traditionalist School]] of [[René Guénon]] to Hungary.

==Biography==
Béla Hamvas was born on 23 March 1897 in [[Prešov|Eperjes]] ([[Prešov]]), in the [[Sáros County]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]). His father, József Hamvas was a [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]], teacher of German and Hungarian, journalist and writer. The family moved to [[Pozsony]] ([[Bratislava]]) in 1898, where Hamvas completed his basic studies in 1915. After graduation, like his classmates, he entered voluntary military service and was sent to the front in [[Ukraine]]. He was sent back to Budapest for hospital treatment due to severe traumatic shock, but just after recovery, he was drafted to the front line in western [[Italy]]. He never reached the battlefield, as his train was hit by a shell, wounding Hamvas, who was discharged.
 
In 1919 his father refused to take an oath of allegiance to [[Czechoslovakia]], whereupon his family was expelled from Bratislava. They moved to Budapest, where Hamvas attended [[Péter Pázmány University]]. After graduation he became a journalist at the newspapers ''Budapesti Hírlap'' and ''Szózat''. Hamvas considered this job shallow and humiliating, but he had to support his family (his father received a pension from 1924). Three years later he quit, as he had found a better job in the main library of Budapest. He was appointed as a senior librarian in 1927. By this time he was writing articles, reviews and essays for 25 different journals. He married Ilona Angyal in 1929, but divorced in 1936 to marry Katalin Kemény in 1937. She was his partner in founding the Sziget circle, a literary group which later gained prominent members like [[Antal Szerb]], [[Károly Kerényi]], László Németh, or [[Antal Molnár]].

Nearly 20 years of library work was ended by [[World War II]]. Hamvas was drafted for military service three times. He continued his literary work while on the front lines - translating [[Laozi]] and [[Heraclitus]] among others. His first essay collection was published in 1943.

The couple survived the siege of Budapest. Their apartment was hit by bombing, destroying his library and manuscripts. Despite the Soviet siege and repeated harassment by the authorities, 1945 to 1947 were his most fruitful years.

In 1948 he was placed on the b-list (banned from publishing) by the Soviet installed [[People's Republic of Hungary|socialist government]], and was forced into retirement from his library job. Although he had published more than 250 works before his ban, most of Hamvas's body of work was written anonymously later on. He got a licence to farm in the garden of his brother-in-law in [[Szentendre]], and tended plants there between 1948 and 1951, during which time he also completed ''Karnevál'', one of his major essays.

Between 1951 and 1964 he was employed as an unskilled worker in power plants in [[Tiszapalkonya]], [[Inota]] and [[Bokod, Hungary|Bokod]], under harsh conditions. Whenever he had spare time he translated from [[Sanskrit]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and wrote about the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]], [[Zen]], and [[Sufism]]. Between 1959 and 1966 he completed ''Patmosz'', his last major work.

Aged 67, he finally received a pension. Béla Hamvas died of a hemorrhagic stroke in 1968. He is buried in Szentendre.

In 1990 he posthumously received the [[Kossuth Prize]].

==Literature==

He was a great thinker and essayist who integrated Eastern and Western traditions as well as posing many serious questions about the modern age, together with the possibility of resolving them. According to one of his central thoughts: ''"The present eon, since 600 B.C. stands in the sign of personal salvation. Only since this time is there a notion of humanity, because there is only one single collective category of personality and this is humanity."''

Béla Hamvas found his form of expression in the essay, a genre at once literary and philosophical. His early essays were published in ''Magyar Hüperion'' (1936, ''Hungarian Hyperion''), marking the end of his first period of thinking, to be followed by ''Szellem és egzisztencia'' (1941, ''Spirit and Existence''), an essay discussing the philosophy of [[Karl Jaspers]], one of the main inspirations for Hamvas’ thinking. He published a selection of essays on literature, psychology, philosophy and cultural history in ''A láthatatlan történet'' (1943, ''The Invisible Story''). Analyzing the spiritual crisis of the age, Hamvas read himself into the metaphysical tradition, the collective spiritual knowledge of humanity conveyed by sacred books. His collection ''Scientia Sacra'' (the first six volumes, 1942–43) served to direct the attention of the age towards the philosophy of the Far East (The [[Upanishads]], [[Tao Te King]], The [[Tibetan Book of the Dead]] and others) and European [[mysticism]]. From 1945 Hamvas belonged to the spiritual renaissance for three years, during which time he edited the series Leaflets of the University Press, held lectures and published the metaphysical ''Anthologia humana: Ötezer év bölcsessége'' (1946, ''Human Anthology – The Wisdom of Five Millennia''), the fourth edition of which was banned and pulped by the socialist regime. His essays written together with his wife on the history of art ''Forradalom a művészetben: Absztrakció és szürrealizmus Magyarországon'' (1947, ''Revolution in Art: Abstraction and Surrealism in Hungary'') survey Hungarian art from [[Károly Ferenczy]], [[Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka]] and [[Lajos Gulácsy]] up to the activity of the “European School”. Hamvas saw in surrealism and abstract art the heritage of magic, the “tremendous presence of a higher existence”, and opposed “realistic” art. This concept of modern art was attacked by the [[Marxist]] ideologist, [[György Lukács]], and Hamvas was dismissed from the library and silenced for the rest of his life. His writings were published in [[samizdat]].

His essays are grounded in tradition, their sense of humour is granted by knowledge, and humour, in turn, grants their freedom. ''Unicornis, Titkos Jegyzőkönyv, Silentium'' (1948–51, ''Unicorn, Secret Protocol, Silence'') were published as late as 1987, but were written alongside Hamvas’s great novel, ''Karnevál'' (1948–51, ''Carnival'', published in 1985). This Magnum Opus, also called a “catalogue of fate”, a “human comedy”, spans continents and ages, Heaven and Hell. Hamvas’ three shorter novels, ''Szilveszter'' (1957, ''New Year’s Eve''), ''Bizonyos tekintetben'' (1961, ''From a Certain Aspect'') and ''Ugyanis'' (1966–67, ''Therefore'') were published together in 1991, followed by his collection of essays, ''Patmosz'' (1959–1966; ''Patmos'') in 1992, whose title alludes to [[John the Apostle]]’s exile to the island of [[Patmos]], and the second part of ''Scientia Sacra: az őskori emberiség szellemi hagyománya II. rész: A kereszténység'' (1960–64, ''Sacred Science – Spiritual Heritage of Mankind, part II. Christianity'') published in 1988.

==Quotes about Hamvas==
{{quote|In 1955 in Hungary there lived only one single person who could have not only conversed but actually exchanged views with [[Heraclitus]], [[Buddha]], [[Lao Tse]] and [[Shakespeare]], and that in each one's mother tongue. If these four prophets of the human spirit had gotten off the plane in Tiszapalkonya, and if they had addressed the first laborer they came across, and if this had happened to be Béla Hamvas himself, after talking for three nights straight - during the day Hamvas had to carry mortar, but perhaps his guests would have given him a hand - well then, what might they have thought: if in this country the unskilled laborers are like this man, what then might the scholars be like? But had they looked around the country, they would have understood everything.|[[Géza Szőcs]]}}

Lévi-Strauss argued that the "savage" mind had the same structures as the "civilized" mind and that human characteristics are the same everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} "[http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/ult1789u642.jhtm Claude Lévi-Strauss - Biografia]".

==Biography==

=== Early life, education, and career ===
Claude Lévi-Strauss was born to [[French Jewish]] parents who were living in [[Brussels]] at the time, where his father was working as a portrait painter.&lt;ref&gt;Conversation with [[Jean José Marchand]]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Paris]], living on a street of the upscale [[XVIe arrondissement|16th arrondissement]] named after the artist [[Claude Lorrain]], whose work he admired and later wrote about.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War I|First World War]], he lived with his maternal grandfather, who was the rabbi of the synagogue of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Clément raconte le grand ethnologue qui fête ses 99 ans," interview, ''Le Journal du Dimanche'', 25 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] and the [[Lycée Condorcet]].

At the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris, Lévi-Strauss studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]]. He did not pursue his study of law, but passed the [[agrégation]] in philosophy in 1931. In 1935, after a few years of secondary-school teaching, he took up a last-minute offer to be part of a French cultural mission to [[Brazil]] in which he would serve as a visiting professor of sociology at the [[University of São Paulo]] while his then wife, [[Dina Lévi-Strauss|Dina]], served as a visiting professor of ethnology.

The couple lived and did their anthropological work in Brazil from 1935 to 1939. During this time, while he was a visiting professor of sociology, Claude undertook his only [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] fieldwork. He accompanied Dina, a trained ethnographer in her own right, who was also a visiting professor at the University of São Paulo, where they conducted research forays into the [[Mato Grosso]] and the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. They first studied the [[Guaycuru]] and [[Bororó people|Bororó]] [[Indigenous people of Brazil|Indian tribes]], staying among them for a few days. In 1938, they returned for a second, more than half-year-long expedition to study the [[Nambikwara]] and [[Tupi people|Tupi]]-[[Kawahib]] societies. At this time, his wife suffered an eye infection that prevented her from completing the study, which he concluded. This experience cemented Lévi-Strauss's professional identity as an [[anthropologist]]. [[Edmund Leach]] suggests, from Lévi-Strauss's own accounts in ''Tristes Tropiques'', that he could not have spent more than a few weeks in any one place and was never able to converse easily with any of his native informants in their native language, which is uncharacteristic of anthropological research methods of participatory interaction with subjects to gain a full understanding of a culture.

In the 1980s, he suggested why he became [[vegetarian]] in pieces published in Italian daily newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]'' and other publications anthologized in the posthumous book ''Nous sommes tous des cannibales'' (2013): "A day will come when the thought that to feed themselves, men of the past raised and massacred living beings and complacently exposed their shredded flesh in displays shall no doubt inspire the same repulsion as that of the travellers of the 16th and 17th century facing cannibal meals of savage American primitives in America, Oceania or Africa."

Claude Lévi-Strauss was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"Personally, I've never been confronted with the question of God," says one such politely indifferent atheist, Dr. Claude Lévi-Strauss, professor of social anthropology at the Collège de France." Theology: Toward a Hidden God, Time.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expatriation===
Lévi-Strauss returned to France in 1939 to take part in the war effort, and was assigned as a liaison agent to the Maginot Line. After the French capitulation in 1940, he was employed at a ''[[lycée]]'' in [[Montpellier]], but then was dismissed under the [[Révolution nationale|Vichy racial laws]]. (Lévi-Strauss's family, originally from Alsace, was of Jewish ancestry.) By the same laws, he was denaturalized (stripped of French citizenship).{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Around that time,  his first wife and he separated. She stayed behind and worked in the [[French resistance]], while he managed to escape Vichy France by boat to [[Martinique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Jennings| first= Eric |date= June 2002| title= Last Exit from Vichy France: The Martinique Escape Route and the Ambiguities of Emigration| journal= The Journal of Modern History |volume= 74| number= 2 |pages= 289–324 | doi=10.1086/343409}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where he was finally able to continue traveling. In 1941, he was offered a position at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City and granted admission to the United States. A series of voyages brought him, via South America, to [[Puerto Rico]], where he was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] after German letters in his luggage aroused the suspicions of customs agents. Lévi-Strauss spent most of the war in New York City. Along with [[Jacques Maritain]], [[Henri Focillon]], and [[Roman Jakobson]], he was a founding member of the [[École Libre des Hautes Études]], a sort of university-in-exile for French academics.

The war years in New York were formative for Lévi-Strauss in several ways. His relationship with Jakobson helped shape his theoretical outlook (Jakobson and Lévi-Strauss are considered to be two of the central figures on which [[structuralism|structuralist]] thought is based).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Johnson| first=C. |year= 2003| title= Claude Levi-Strauss: The Formative Years| publisher= Cambridge University Press| pages=1, 92, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lévi-Strauss was also exposed to the American anthropology espoused by [[Franz Boas]], who taught at [[Columbia University]]. In 1942, while having dinner at the Faculty House at Columbia, Boas died of a heart attack in Lévi-Strauss's arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Totems and Teachers: Key Figures in the History of Anthropology| first= Sydel |last=Silverman |publisher= Rowman Altamira| year=2004| page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intimate association with Boas gave his early work a distinctive American inclination that helped facilitate its acceptance in the U.S. After a brief stint from 1946 to 1947 as a [[cultural attaché]] to the French embassy in [[Washington, DC]], Lévi-Strauss returned to Paris in 1948. At this time, he received his [[state doctorate]] from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] by submitting, in the French tradition, both a "major" and a "minor" [[doctoral thesis]]. These were ''The Family and Social Life of the [[Nambikwara]] Indians'' (''La vie familiale et sociale des indiens Nambikwara'') and ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (''Les structures élémentaires de la parenté'').&lt;ref name=Moore2004&gt;{{cite book| last= Moore| first= Jerry D. |year= 2004| title= Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists| publisher= Rowman Altamira }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|234}}

===Structural anthropology===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' was published the next year and quickly came to be regarded as one of the most important anthropological works on kinship. It was even reviewed favorably by [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who viewed it as an important statement of the position of women in non-Western cultures. A play on the title of [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim's]] famous ''Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', ''Elementary Structures'' re-examined how people organized their families by examining the logical structures that underlay relationships rather than their contents. While British anthropologists such as [[Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown]] argued that kinship was based on descent from a common ancestor, Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship was based on the alliance between two families that formed when women from one group married men from another.&lt;ref&gt;Boon and Schneider&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, Lévi-Strauss continued to publish and experienced considerable professional success. On his return to France, he became involved with the administration of the [[CNRS]] and the [[Musée de l'Homme]] before finally becoming professor (''directeur d'études'') of the fifth section of the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]], the 'Religious Sciences' section where [[Marcel Mauss]] was previously professor, the title of which chair he renamed "Comparative Religion of Non-Literate Peoples".

While Lévi-Strauss was well known in academic circles, in 1955 he became one of France's best known intellectuals by publishing ''Tristes Tropiques'' in Paris that year by Plon (and translated into English in 1973, published by Penguin). Essentially, this book was a memoir detailing his time as a French expatriate throughout the 1930s, and his travels. Lévi-Strauss combined exquisitely beautiful prose, dazzling philosophical meditation, and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis of the Amazonian peoples to produce a masterpiece. The organizers of the [[Prix Goncourt]], for instance, lamented that they were not able to award Lévi-Strauss the prize because ''Tristes Tropiques'' was nonfiction.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Lévi-Strauss was named to a chair in social anthropology at the [[Collège de France]] in 1959. At roughly the same time he published ''Structural Anthropology'', a collection of his essays which provided both examples and programmatic statements about structuralism. At the same time as he was laying the groundwork for an intellectual program, he began a series of institutions to establish anthropology as a discipline in France, including the Laboratory for Social Anthropology where new students could be trained, and a new journal, ''l'Homme'', for publishing the results of their research.

In 1962, Lévi-Strauss published what is for many people his most important work, ''La Pensée Sauvage'', translated into English as ''The Savage Mind''. The French title is an untranslatable pun because the word ''pensée'' means both "thought" and "[[pansy]]", while ''sauvage'' has a range of meanings different from English "savage". Lévi-Strauss supposedly suggested that the English title be ''Pansies for Thought'', borrowing from a speech by [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (ACT IV, Scene V). French editions of ''La Pensée Sauvage'' are often printed with an image of wild pansies on the cover.

''The Savage Mind'' discusses not just "primitive" thought, a category defined by previous anthropologists, but also forms of thought common to all human beings. The first half of the book lays out Lévi-Strauss's [[culture theory|theory of culture]] and mind, while the second half expands this account into a theory of history and social change. This latter part of the book engaged Lévi-Strauss in a heated debate with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] over the nature of human freedom. On the one hand, Sartre's [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophy committed him to a position that human beings fundamentally were free to act as they pleased. On the other hand, Sartre also was a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] who was committed to ideas such as that individuals were constrained by the ideologies imposed on them by the powerful. Lévi-Strauss presented his structuralist notion of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in opposition to Sartre. Echoes of this debate between structuralism and existentialism eventually inspired the work of younger authors such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]].

Now a worldwide celebrity, Lévi-Strauss spent the second half of the 1960s working on his master project, a four-volume study called ''[[Mythologiques]]''. In it, he followed a single myth from the tip of South America and all of its variations from group to group north through Central America and eventually into the [[Arctic Circle]], thus tracing the myth's cultural evolution from one end of the Western Hemisphere to the other. He accomplished this in a typically structuralist way, examining the underlying structure of relationships among the elements of the story rather than by focusing on the content of the story itself. While ''Pensée Sauvage'' was a statement of Lévi-Strauss's big-picture theory, ''Mythologiques'' was an extended, four-volume example of analysis. Richly detailed and extremely long, it is less widely read than the much shorter and more accessible ''Pensée Sauvage'', despite its position as Lévi-Strauss's masterwork.

Lévi-Strauss completed the final volume of ''Mythologiques'' in 1971. On 14 May 1973, he was elected to the Académie française, France's highest honour for a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=647 | title= Claude Lévi-Strauss| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331130154/http://www.academie-francaise.fr/immortels/base/academiciens/fiche.asp?param=647| archivedate= 31 March 2012 | publisher= [[Académie française]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a member of other notable academies worldwide, including the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. In 1956, he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00009261 |title=Claude Levi-Strauss (1908 - 2009) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Erasmus Prize]] in 1973, the [[Meister-Eckhart-Prize]] for philosophy in 2003, and several honorary doctorates from universities such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. He also was the recipient of the [[Légion d'honneur#Classes and insignia|Grand-croix de la Légion d'honneur]], was a [[Ordre national du Mérite|Commandeur de l'ordre national du Mérite]], and [[Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres]]. In 2005, he received the XVII Premi Internacional Catalunya ([[Generalitat of Catalonia]]). After his retirement, he continued to publish occasional meditations on art, music, philosophy, and poetry.

=== Later life and death ===
{{wikinews|French structuralist Claude Lévi-Strauss dies at age 100}}
In 2008, he became the first member of the Académie française to reach the age of 100 and one of the few living authors to have his works published in the [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]. On the death of [[Maurice Druon]] on 14 April 2009, he became the Dean of the ''Académie'', its longest-serving member.

He died on 30 October 2009, a few weeks before his 101st birthday.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; The death was announced four days later.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

[[President of France|French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] described him as "one of the greatest ethnologists of all time".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8340936.stm|title=Anthropologist Levi-Strauss dies|date=3 November 2009|accessdate=3 November 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Kouchner]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Minister]], said Lévi-Strauss "broke with an ethnocentric vision of history and humanity ... At a time when we are trying to give meaning to globalisation, to build a fairer and more humane world, I would like Claude Lévi-Strauss's universal echo to resonate more strongly".&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt; In a similar vein, a statement by Lévi-Strauss was broadcast on [[National Public Radio]] in the remembrance produced by ''[[All Things Considered]]'' on November 3, 2009: "There is today a frightful disappearance of living species, be they plants or animals. And it's clear that the density of human beings has become so great, if I can say so, that they have begun to poison themselves. And the world in which I am finishing my existence is no longer a world that I like." ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said in its obituary that Lévi-Strauss was "one of the dominating postwar influences in French intellectual life and the leading exponent of Structuralism in the social sciences".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/6496558/Claude-Levi-Strauss.html |title=Claude Lévi-Strauss |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=3 November 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent secretary of the Académie française [[Hélène Carrère d'Encausse]] said: "He was a thinker, a philosopher ...

==Theories==

===Summary===
Lévi-Strauss sought to apply the structural linguistics of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] to anthropology.&lt;ref name=Moore2009&gt;{{cite book| last= Moore| first= Jerry D. |year= 2009| title= Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists| chapter= Claude Levi-Strauss: Structuralism|publisher= Altamira |location= Walnut Creek, California| pages=231–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the family was traditionally considered the fundamental object of analysis, but was seen primarily as a self-contained{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} unit consisting of a husband, a wife, and their children. Nephews, cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents all were treated as secondary. Lévi-Strauss argued that, however, akin to Saussure's notion of [[Value (semiotics)#Saussure|linguistic value]], families acquire determinate identities only through relations with one another. Thus he inverted the classical view of anthropology, putting the secondary family members first and insisting on analyzing the relations between units instead of the units themselves.&lt;ref name= JWP&gt;{{cite web|title= Structural Linguistics and Anthropology| first= John W. |last= Phillips |website= National University of Singapore| url= http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/elljwp/anthropology.htm#Structural%20Anthropology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his own analysis of the formation of the identities that arise through marriages between tribes, Lévi-Strauss noted that the relation between the uncle and the nephew was to the relation between brother and sister, as the relation between father and son is to that between husband and wife, that is, A is to B as C is to D. Therefore, if we know A, B, and C, we can predict D, just as if we know A and D, we can predict B and C. The goal of Lévi-Strauss's [[structural anthropology]], then, was to simplify the masses of empirical data into generalized, comprehensible relations between units, which allow for predictive laws to be identified, such as A is to B as C is to D.&lt;ref name= JWP /&gt;

Similarly, Lévi-Strauss identified myths as a type of speech through which a language could be discovered. His work is a [[structuralist theory of mythology]] which attempted to explain how seemingly fantastical and arbitrary tales could be so similar across cultures. Because he believed there was not one "authentic" version of a myth, rather that they were all manifestations of the same language, he sought to find the fundamental units of myth, namely, the [[mytheme]]. Lévi-Strauss broke each of the versions of a myth down into a series of sentences, consisting of a relation between a function and a subject. Sentences with the same function were given the same number and bundled together. These are mythemes.&lt;ref name = mythology&gt;{{citation| url= http://people.ucsc.edu/~ktellez/levi-strauss.pdf |title= The Structural Study of Myth | first= Claude | last= Lévi-Strauss | publisher= republished online at UCSC.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Lévi-Strauss believed he had discovered when he examined the relations between mythemes was that a myth consists of juxtaposed [[binary opposition]]s. [[Oedipus]], for example, consists of the overrating of blood relations and the underrating of blood relations, the [[indigenous peoples|autochthon]]ous origin of humans and the denial of their autochthonous origin. Influenced by [[Hegel]], Lévi-Strauss believed that the human mind thinks fundamentally in these binary oppositions and their unification (the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]] triad), and that these are what make meaning possible. Furthermore, he considered the job of myth to be a sleight of hand, an association of an irreconcilable binary opposition with a reconcilable binary opposition, creating the illusion, or belief, that the former had been resolved.&lt;ref name= mythology /&gt;

===Anthropological theories===
{{Original research section|date=May 2013}}
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Lévi-Strauss's theory is set forth in ''Structural Anthropology'' (1958). Briefly, he considers [[culture]] a system of symbolic communication, to be investigated with methods that others have used more narrowly in the discussion of novels, political speeches, sports, and movies.

His reasoning makes best sense when contrasted against the background of an earlier generation's social theory. He wrote about this relationship for decades.

A preference for "functionalist" explanations dominated the social sciences from the turn of the twentieth century through the 1950s, which is to say that anthropologists and sociologists tried to state the purpose of a social act or institution. The existence of a thing was explained, if it fulfilled a function. The only strong alternative to that kind of analysis was historical explanation, accounting for the existence of a social fact by stating how it came to be.

The idea of social function developed in two different ways, however. The English anthropologist [[Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown]], who had read and admired the work of the French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], argued that the goal of anthropological research was to find the collective function, such as what a religious creed or a set of rules about marriage did for the social order as a whole. Behind this approach was an old idea, the view that civilization developed through a series of phases from the primitive to the modern, everywhere in the same manner. All of the activities in a given kind of society would partake of the same character; some sort of internal logic would cause one level of culture to evolve into the next. On this view, a society can easily be thought of as an organism, the parts functioning together as do the parts of a body.

In contrast, the more influential functionalism of [[Bronisław Malinowski]] described the satisfaction of individual needs, what a person derived by participating in a custom.

In the United States, where the shape of anthropology was set by the German-educated [[Franz Boas]], the preference was for historical accounts. This approach had obvious problems, which Lévi-Strauss praises Boas for facing squarely.

Historical information seldom is available for non-literate cultures. The anthropologist fills in with comparisons to other cultures and is forced to rely on theories that have no evidential basis, the old notion of universal stages of development or the claim that cultural resemblances are based on some unrecognized past contact between groups. Boas came to believe that no overall pattern in social development could be proven; for him, there was no single history, only histories.

There are three broad choices involved in the divergence of these schools&amp;ndash;each had to decide what kind of evidence to use; whether to emphasize the particulars of a single culture or look for patterns underlying all societies; and what the source of any underlying patterns might be, the definition of a common humanity.

Social scientists in all traditions relied on cross-cultural studies. It always was necessary to supplement information about a society with information about others. So some idea of a common human nature was implicit in each approach.

The critical distinction, then, remained: does a social fact exist because it is functional for the social order, or because it is functional for the person? Do uniformities across cultures occur because of organizational needs that must be met everywhere, or because of the uniform needs of human personality?

For Lévi-Strauss, the choice was for the demands of the social order. He had no difficulty bringing out the inconsistencies and triviality of individualistic accounts. Malinowski said, for example, that magic beliefs come into being when people need to feel a sense of control over events when the outcome was uncertain. In the [[Trobriand Islands]], he found the proof of this claim in the rites surrounding abortions and weaving skirts. But in the same tribes, there is no magic attached to making clay pots even though it is no more certain a business than weaving. So, the explanation is not consistent. Furthermore, these explanations tend to be used in an ad hoc, superficial way&amp;ndash;one postulates a trait of personality when needed.

But the accepted way of discussing organizational function didn't work either. Different societies might have institutions that were similar in many obvious ways and yet, served different functions. Many tribal cultures divide the tribe into two groups and have elaborate rules about how the two groups may interact. But exactly what they may do&amp;ndash;trade, intermarry&amp;ndash;is different in different tribes; for that matter, so are the criteria for distinguishing the groups.

Nor will it do to say that dividing-in-two is a universal need of organizations, because there are a lot of tribes that thrive without it.

For Lévi-Strauss, the methods of [[linguistics]] became a model for all his earlier examinations of society. His analogies usually are from [[phonology]] (though also later from music, mathematics, [[chaos theory]], [[cybernetics]], and so on).

"A really scientific analysis must be real, simplifying, and explanatory," he writes.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{citation|title= Structural Anthropology| first= Claude | last= Lévi-Strauss |year= 1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemic analysis reveals features that are real, in the sense that users of the language can recognize and respond to them. At the same time, a phoneme is an abstraction from language&amp;ndash;not a sound, but a category of sound defined by the way it is distinguished from other categories through rules unique to the language. The entire sound-structure of a language may be generated from a relatively small number of rules.

In the study of the kinship systems that first concerned him, this ideal of explanation allowed a comprehensive organization of data that partly had been ordered by other researchers. The overall goal was to find out why family relations differed among various South American cultures. The father might have great authority over the son in one group, for example, with the relationship rigidly restricted by [[taboos]]. In another group, the mother's brother would have that kind of relationship with the son, while the father's relationship was relaxed and playful.

A number of partial patterns had been noted. Relations between the mother and father, for example, had some sort of reciprocity with those of father and son&amp;ndash;if the mother had a dominant social status and was formal with the father, for example, then the father usually had close relations with the son. But these smaller patterns joined together in inconsistent ways.

One possible way of finding a master order was to rate all the positions in a kinship system along several dimensions. For example, the father was older than the son, the father produced the son, the father had the same sex as the son, and so on; the matrilineal uncle was older and of the same sex, but did not produce the son, and so on. An exhaustive collection of such observations might cause an overall pattern to emerge.

But for Lévi-Strauss, this kind of work was considered "analytical in appearance only." It results in a chart that is far more difficult to understand than the original data and is based on arbitrary abstractions (empirically, fathers are older than sons, but it is only the researcher who declares that this feature explains their relations). Furthermore, it doesn't explain anything. The explanation it offers is [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]]&amp;ndash;if age is crucial, then age explains a relationship. And it does not offer the possibility of inferring the origins of the structure.

A proper solution to the puzzle is to find a basic unit of [[kinship]] which can explain all the variations. It is a cluster of four roles&amp;ndash;brother, sister, father, son. These are the roles that must be involved in any society that has an [[incest taboo]] requiring a man to obtain a wife from some man outside his own hereditary line.{{clarify|reason=Why must these specific roles be involved?|date=February 2013}} A brother may give away his sister, for example, whose son might reciprocate in the next generation by allowing his own sister to marry exogamously. The underlying demand is a continued circulation of women to keep various clans peacefully related.

Right or wrong, this solution displays the qualities of structural thinking. Even though Lévi-Strauss frequently speaks of treating culture as the product of the axioms and corollaries that underlie it, or the phonemic differences that constitute it, he is concerned with the objective data of field research. He notes that it is logically possible for a different atom of kinship structure to exist&amp;ndash;sister, sister's brother, brother's wife, daughter&amp;ndash;but there are no real-world examples of relationships that can be derived from that grouping. The trouble with this view has been shown by the Australian anthropologist Augustus Elkin, who insisted on the point that in a four class marriage system, the preferred marriage was with a classificatory mother' s brother's daughter and never with the true one. Lévi-Strauss's atom of kinship structure deals only with consanguineal kin. There is a big difference between the two situations, in that the kinship structure involving the classificatory kin relations allows for the building of a system which can bring together thousands of people. Lévi-Strauss's atom of kinship stops working once the true MoBrDa is missing.{{clarify|reason=the text in the vicinity of this tag needs clarification including removal or definition of jargon.|date=February 2013}} Lévi-Strauss also developed the concept of the [[house society]] to describe those societies where the domestic unit is more central for social organization than the descent group or lineage.

The purpose of structuralist explanation is to organize real data in the simplest effective way. All science, he says, is either structuralist or reductionist. In confronting such matters as the incest taboo, one is facing an objective limit of what the human mind has accepted so far. One could hypothesize some biological imperative underlying it, but so far as social order is concerned, the taboo has the effect of an irreducible fact. The social scientist can only work with the structures of human thought that arise from it.

And structural explanations can be tested and refuted. A mere analytic scheme that wishes causal relations into existence is not structuralist in this sense.

Lévi-Strauss's later works are more controversial, in part because they impinge on the subject matter of other scholars. He believed that modern life and all history was founded on the same categories and transformations that he had discovered in the Brazilian back country&amp;ndash;''[[The Raw and the Cooked]], [[From Honey to Ashes]], The Naked Man'' (to borrow some titles from the ''Mythologiques''). For instance he compares anthropology to musical [[serialism]] and defends his "philosophical" approach. He also pointed out that the modern view of primitive cultures was simplistic in denying them a history. The categories of myth did not persist among them because nothing had happened&amp;ndash;it was easy to find the evidence of defeat, [[Migration (human)|migration]], exile, repeated displacements of all the kinds known to recorded history. Instead, the mythic categories had encompassed these changes.

He argued for a view of human life as existing in two timelines simultaneously, the eventful one of history and the long cycles in which one set of fundamental mythic patterns dominates and then perhaps another. In this respect, his work resembles that of [[Fernand Braudel]], the [[historian]] of the Mediterranean and 'la longue durée,' the cultural outlook and forms of social organization that persisted for centuries around that sea. He is right in that history is difficult to build up in non literate society, nevertheless, Jean Guiart's anthropological and José Garanger's archeological work in central Vanuatu, bringing to the fore the skeletons of former chiefs described in local myths, who had thus been living persons, shows that there can be some means of ascertaining the history of some groups which otherwise would be deemed a-historical. Another issue is the experience that the same person can tell one a myth highly charged in symbols, and some years later a sort of chronological history claiming to be the chronic of a descent line (from examples in the Loyalty islands and New Zealand), the two texts having in common that they each deal in topographical detail with the land-tenure claims of the said descent line (see Douglas Oliver on the Siwai in Bougainville). Lévi-Strauss would agree to these aspects be explained inside his seminar, but would never touch them on his own. The anthropological data content of the myths was not his problem. He was only interested with the formal aspects of each story, considered by him as the result of the workings of the collective unconscious of each group, which idea was taken from the linguists, but cannot be proved in any way although he was adamant about its existence and would never accept any discussion on this point.

===The structuralist approach to myth===
{{main|Structuralist theory of mythology}}
Lévi-Strauss sees a basic paradox in the study of [[mythology|myth]]. On one hand, mythical stories are fantastic and unpredictable: the content of myth seems completely arbitrary. On the other hand, the myths of different cultures are surprisingly similar:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the one hand it would seem that in the course of a myth anything is likely to happen. ... But on the other hand, this apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity between myths collected in widely different regions. Therefore the problem: If the content of myth is contingent [i.e., arbitrary], how are we to explain the fact that myths throughout the world are so similar?&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lévi-Strauss proposed that [[universal law]]s must govern mythical thought and resolve this seeming paradox, producing similar myths in different cultures. Each myth may seem unique, but he proposed it is just one particular instance of a universal law of human thought. In studying myth, Lévi-Strauss tries "to reduce apparently arbitrary data to some kind of order, and to attain a level at which a kind of necessity becomes apparent, underlying the illusions of liberty".&lt;ref name = "fembce"&gt;''The Raw and the Cooked'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie suggests that for Levi-Strauss, 'operations embedded within animal myths provide opportunities to resolve collective problems of classification and hierarchy, marking lines between the inside and the outside, the Law and its exceptions, those who belong and those who do not'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human | year=2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lévi-Strauss, "mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution".&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;{{rp|224}} In other words, myths consist of:
# elements that oppose or contradict each other and
#other elements that "mediate", or resolve, those oppositions.

For example, Lévi-Strauss thinks the [[trickster]] of many [[Indigenous people of North America|Native American]] mythologies acts as a "mediator". Lévi-Strauss's argument hinges on two facts about the Native American trickster:
# the trickster has a contradictory and unpredictable personality;
# the trickster is almost always a [[raven]] or a [[Coyote (mythology)|coyote]].
Lévi-Strauss argues that the raven and coyote "mediate" the opposition between life and death. The relationship between agriculture and hunting is analogous to the opposition between [[life]] and [[death]]: agriculture is solely concerned with producing life (at least up until harvest time); hunting is concerned with producing death. Furthermore, the relationship between herbivores and beasts of prey is analogous to the relationship between agriculture and hunting: like agriculture, herbivores are concerned with plants; like hunting, beasts of prey are concerned with catching meat. Lévi-Strauss points out that the raven and coyote eat carrion and are therefore halfway between herbivores and beasts of prey: like beasts of prey, they eat meat; like herbivores, they don't catch their food. Thus, he argues, "we have a mediating structure of the following type":&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;{{rp|224}}
[[File:Levi-strauss1.jpg|center]]
By uniting herbivore traits with traits of beasts of prey, the raven and coyote somewhat reconcile herbivores and beasts of prey: in other words, they mediate the opposition between herbivores and beasts of prey. As we have seen, this opposition ultimately is analogous to the opposition between life and death. Therefore, the raven and coyote ultimately mediate the opposition between life and death. This, Lévi-Strauss believes, explains why the coyote and raven have a contradictory personality when they appear as the mythical trickster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trickster is a mediator. Since his mediating function occupies a position halfway between two polar terms, he must retain something of that duality—namely an ambiguous and equivocal character.&lt;ref name=SA /&gt;{{rp|226}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because the raven and coyote reconcile profoundly opposed concepts (i.e., life and death), their own mythical personalities must reflect this duality or contradiction: in other words, they must have a contradictory, "tricky" personality.

This theory about the structure of myth helps support Lévi-Strauss's more basic theory about human thought. According to this more basic theory, universal laws govern ''all'' areas of human thought:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it were possible to prove in this instance, too, that the apparent arbitrariness of the mind, its supposedly spontaneous flow of inspiration, and its seemingly uncontrolled inventiveness [are ruled by] laws operating at a deeper level ... if the human mind appears determined even in the realm of mythology, ''[[a fortiori]]'' it must also be determined in all its spheres of activity.&lt;ref name = "fembce"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Out of all the products of culture, myths seem the most fantastic and unpredictable. Therefore, Lévi-Strauss claims, if even mythical thought obeys universal laws, then ''all'' human thought must obey universal laws.

====''The Savage Mind'': bricoleur and engineer====
Lévi-Strauss developed the comparison of the Bricoleur and Engineer in ''[[The Savage Mind]]''. "Bricoleur" has its origin in the old French verb ''bricoler'', which originally referred to extraneous movements in ball games, billiards, hunting, shooting and riding, but which today means do-it-yourself building or repairing things with the tools and materials on hand, puttering or tinkering as it were. In comparison to the true craftsman, whom Lévi-Strauss calls the Engineer, the Bricoleur is adept at many tasks and at putting preexisting things together in new ways, adapting his project to a finite stock of materials and tools. The Engineer deals with projects in their entirety, conceiving and procuring all the necessary materials and tools to suit his project. The Bricoleur approximates "the savage mind" and the Engineer approximates the scientific mind. Lévi-Strauss says that the universe of the Bricoleur is closed, and he often is forced to make do with whatever is at hand, whereas the universe of the Engineer is open in that he is able to create new tools and materials. But both live within a restrictive reality, and so the Engineer is forced to consider the preexisting set of theoretical and practical knowledge, of technical means, in a similar way to the Bricoleur.

====Criticism====
Lévi-Strauss's theory on the origin of the Trickster has been criticized on a number of points by anthropologists. [[Stanley Diamond]] notes that while the secular civilized often consider the concepts of life and death to be polar, primitive cultures often see them "as aspects of a single condition, the condition of existence."&lt;ref name= Diamond&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Stanley Diamond| last= Diamond |first= Stanley |title= In Search of the Primitive| location= New Brunswick| publisher= Transaction Books| year=1974 |isbn= 0-87855-045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308}} Diamond remarks that Lévi-Strauss did not reach such a conclusion by inductive reasoning, but simply by working backwards from the evidence to the "''a priori'' mediated concepts"&lt;ref name= Diamond /&gt;{{rp|310}} of "life" and "death", which he reached by assumption of a necessary progression from "life" to "agriculture" to "herbivorous animals", and from "death" to "warfare" to "beasts of prey". For that matter, the coyote is well known to hunt in addition to scavenging and the raven also has been known to act as a bird of prey, in contrast to Lévi-Strauss's conception. Nor does that conception explain why a scavenger such as a bear would never appear as the Trickster. Diamond further remarks that "the Trickster names 'raven' and 'coyote' which Lévi-Strauss explains can be arrived at with greater economy on the basis of, let us say, the cleverness of the animals involved, their ubiquity, elusiveness, capacity to make mischief, their undomesticated reflection of certain human traits."&lt;ref name= Diamond /&gt;{{rp|311}} Finally, Lévi-Strauss's analysis does not appear to be capable of explaining why representations of the Trickster in other areas of the world make use of such animals as the spider and mantis.

Edmund Leach wrote that "The outstanding characteristic of his writing, whether in French or English, is that it is difficult to understand; his sociological theories combine baffling complexity with overwhelming erudition. Some readers even suspect that they are being treated to a confidence trick".&lt;ref name=Leach1974&gt;{{citation |year=1974 |last= Leach| first= Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Leach |title=Claude Levi-Strauss |page=3 |edition=Revised |place=New York |publisher=Viking Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Stanislav Andreski]] criticized Lévi-Strauss's work generally, arguing that his scholarship was often sloppy and moreover that much of his mystique and reputation stemmed from his "threatening people with mathematics," a reference to Lévi-Strauss's use of quasi-algebraic equations to explain his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Andreski, Stanislav (1972). ''The Social Sciences as Sorcery'', Deutsch, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Camille Paglia]] dismissed Lévi-Strauss as overrated, commenting that "When as a Yale graduate student I ransacked that great temple, Sterling Library, in search of paradigms for reintegrating literary criticism with history, I found literally nothing in Lévi-Strauss that I felt had scholarly solidity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= 10 November 2009 |title= Pelosi’s victory for women| website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on post-colonial approaches to anthropology, Timothy Laurie has suggested that "Lévi-Strauss speaks from the vantage point of a State intent on securing knowledge for the purposes of, as he himself would often claim, salvaging local cultures... but the salvation workers also ascribe to themselves legitimacy and authority in the process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Epistemology as Politics and the Double-Bind of Border Thinking: Lévi-Strauss, Deleuze and Guattari, Mignolo | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Portal: Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 1–20 | year= 2012 | url= https://www.academia.edu/2137504 | doi=10.5130/portal.v9i2.1826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crossing the Threshold of Hope''''' was written in 1994 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. It was published originally in Italian by [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore]] and in English by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.  It is distributed by [[Random House, Inc.]], New York City.  By 1998, the book had sold several million copies and was published in forty languages. Over one million copies were sold in Italy alone.&lt;ref name="Arnoldo Mondadori Editore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Arnoldo-Mondadori-Editore-SpA-Company-History.html.|title=History of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A. |website=Fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The contents presented in ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'' were originally intended to be broadcast as a live television interview with [[Vittorio Messori]], an Italian journalist and writer.  The interview was to celebrate fifteen years of his [[papacy]].  When John Paul II had to cancel the interview at the last minute, he still wanted to answer Messori’s questions and told him: “You have asked me questions, therefore you have a right to responses. ... I am working on them. I will let you have them. Then do with them what you think is appropriate”.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossing'' p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of April 1994, Messori received a package from the [[Holy See|Vatican]]: The pope had answered every question. John Paul II expressed his confidence in Messori by permitting him to do whatever he saw fit with the contents of the folder. He only wrote “Crossing the Threshold of Hope” on the inside front cover of the folder as a suggestion for a possible title.&lt;ref&gt;p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Messori began compiling the questions, he saw that additional questions as follow-up would be helpful. Additional questions were composed and sent. When the follow-up questions returned from the Vatican, Messori found that the pope had again answered every question.

==Contents==
The text of the book is presented exactly as written by John Paul II. Points that the pope underlined in his original [[manuscript]] are italicized in the published text. Paragraph breaks remain consistent with John Paul II’s writing.&lt;ref&gt;p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Messori doesn’t ask private questions, but the questions he does ask allow the reader to see the personal life of the pope. For example, the very first question in ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'' asks whether the pope ever doubts his relationship with [[God]], especially given the importance of his role in the Catholic Church. The pope’s answer grounds itself in Scripture: “Be not afraid!” (Luke 1:30). These words echoed through John Paul II’s papacy, and they continue to echo in this writing.

Messori continues to ask questions throughout the book that people throughout the world have wondered: “How do you pray?” “Does God really exist?” “Is there really hope in the young?” “Does eternal life exist?”  “What does it mean to be saved?”  The pope does not answer questions that only pertain to [[Catholicism]]. Messori asks questions about [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions in general. John Paul II’s answers to these questions reflect his great love for all people and his knowledge of these religions: he speaks several times of individuals he has met who belong to these religions, sometimes calling them by name. He also says vehemently that “the Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions”.&lt;ref&gt;p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes the Second Vatican Council as mentioning a "common soteriological root present in all religions"&lt;ref&gt;p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; though he seems to contradict that&lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbu, former head of the Nyingma lineage of TIbetan Buddhism writes "there is nothing more rejecting than referring to Buddhism as having a “negative soteriology” (p. 85), as the Pope says. Nothing more negative could be said."  Thinley Norbu. Welcoming Flowers From Across the Cleansed Threshold of Hope: An Answer to the Pope's Criticism of Buddhism (Kindle Locations 915-916). Jewel Pub House.&lt;/ref&gt; by stating that "the Buddhist tradition and the methods deriving from it have an almost exclusively negative soteriology."&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing "doctrines of salvation in Buddhism and Christianity are opposed."&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt; This has been judged by Buddhists as a misunderstanding of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbu, former head of the Nyingma lineage of TIbetan Buddhism writes "it is a mistake for the Pope to say that Buddhism is a “negative soteriology” (p. 85) based on detachment from evil, since Buddhism is based on how to create and attain the positive energy of the inconceivable purity of the unending union of space and appearance, which is the infallibility of Buddhahood." Thinley Norbu. Welcoming Flowers From Across the Cleansed Threshold of Hope: An Answer to the Pope's Criticism of Buddhism (Kindle Locations 338-340). Jewel Pub House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Messori’s questions in the latter portion of the book refer to various tenets of the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] faith, including whether the Catholic Church really has the fullness of truth, and whether or not [[heaven]] exists. Many people ask these questions, and the pope’s answers to these questions can be found here.

Some readers may find Messori frustrating at times, as his writing can be gushing and formal.  He says things like, “Pardon me, Your Holiness, but my role (which gives me great honor but also a certain responsibility) is also that of a respectful “provocateur” with regard to questions...”.&lt;ref&gt;p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics of the book include: “The Pope: A Scandal and a Mystery,” “How does the Pope Pray?” “Does God Really Exist?” “Proof: Is it Still Valid?” “If God Exists, Why is He Hiding?” “Is Jesus the Son of God?” “Why Is There So Much Evil in the World?” “What Does To Save Mean?” “Why So Many Religions?” “Buddha?” “Muhammad?” “Judaism?” “What Is the New Evangelization?” “Is There Really Hope in the Young?” “Was God at Work in the Fall of Communism?” “Is Only Rome Right?” “In Search of Lost Unity,” “A Qualitative Renewal,” “The Reaction of the World,” “Does Eternal Life Exist?” “Human Rights,” “The Mother of God,” and “Be Not Afraid.”

The pope answers questions directly, and he also provides a context and history as background. He reflects on [[Descartes]]’ [[philosophy]] of “I think, therefore I am,” while referencing [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Husserl]], [[Heidegger]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]] when defining the history of European thought.

Although the pope writes to a world-wide audience, he also speaks specifically of the Catholic faith, including references not only to the Sacred Scriptures, but also many saints: [[Augustine|Augustine’s]] ''City of God'', [[John of the Cross]] and his ''[[Ascent of Mount Carmel]]'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] and the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', and many more.

==Praise==
Reception of this work of John Paul II range from “With the humility and generosity of spirit for which he is well known, John Paul speaks forthrightly to all people”&lt;ref name="Aquinas And More"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aquinasandmore.com/catholic-books/Crossing-The-Threshold-Of-Hope/sku/19226 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718095312/http://www.aquinasandmore.com/catholic-books/Crossing-The-Threshold-Of-Hope/sku/19226 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to “the Pope emerges as the master of the flat statement, the bland certainty.

==Criticism==
The Pope's negative portrayal of Buddhism received widespread criticism within the various branches of Buddhism across the world.

In response to receiving several letters from Poland, from individuals and from a publishing house, asking him to comment on it, [[Thinley Norbu|Thinley Norbu Rinpoche]] (one of the key teachers in the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism) wrote the book ''Welcoming Flowers from across the Cleansed Threshold of Hope: An Answer to the Pope's Criticism of Buddhism'' to address the "serious, gratuitous misrepresentations of Buddhist doctrine which seemed to be based on misunderstandings" contained within ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbu. Welcoming Flowers From Across the Cleansed Threshold of Hope: An Answer to the Pope's Criticism of Buddhism (Kindle Locations 34-35). Jewel Pub House.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shambhala.com/welcoming-flowers.html|title=Welcoming Flowers from across the Cleansed Threshold of Hope|website=Shambhala.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the book in Sri Lanka on the eve of the Pope's January visit to this country stirred up waves of indignation in the Buddhist community that spread as far as the Vatican. The Buddhist prelates announced that they would not attend an inter-religious meeting requested by the Pope unless he formally retracted his unfavorable remarks about Buddhism. Although on arrival the Pope tried to appease the feelings of Buddhist leaders by declaring his esteem for their religion, even quoting the Dhammapada, he fell short of proffering a full apology, and this did not satisfy the Sangha elders.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_30.html|title=Toward a Threshold of Understanding|website=Accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' cited criticism from Sri Lanka Buddhists, saying:
:In his book, the Pope uses language that Buddhists here say they found offensive, notably its reference to nirvana as a state of "indifference with regard to the world" and its assertion that the Buddhist doctrine of salvation through nirvana is "almost exclusively negative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/world/pope-in-sri-lanka-seeks-to-soothe-buddhist-critics.html|title=Pope, in Sri Lanka, Seeks To Soothe Buddhist Critics|first=Alan|last=Cowell|date=20 January 1995|accessdate=20 January 2018|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikkhu Bodhi|Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi]], a highly regarded scholar of Theravada Buddhism and past president of the [[Buddhist Publication Society]] published an essay "intended as a short corrective to the Pope's demeaning characterization of Buddhism" entitled ''Toward a Threshold of Understanding''.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight" /&gt;

The English satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' attacked the book; "A few pages reveal however, that this is no interview at all, being constructed instead on the age-old Catholic model of the Catechism, in which the grovelling postulant is not only given all the answers to memorise but has all the questions dictated to him too."&lt;ref&gt;Holy Smokescreen. ''[[Private Eye]]'', no. 858, p. 25. 8 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citations==
''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'' has been cited by many, including [[Scott Hahn]] (''Lord, Have Mercy: The Healing Power of Confession''), Eugene Mario DeRobertis (''Phenomenological Psychology: A Text for Beginners''), Harold C Raley (''A Watch Over Mortality: The Philosophical Story of Julian Marias''), R Baschetti (''Evolutionary, Biological Origins of Mortality: Implications for Research with Human Embryonic Stem Cells''), Anthony Scioli (''Hope in the Age of Anxiety''), John Berkman (''[https://www.academia.edu/3256484/The_Consumption_of_Animals_and_the_Catholic_Tradition_2004_ The Consumption of Animals and the Catholic Tradition]''), and [[Christopher Jamison]] (''Finding Sanctuary: Monastic Steps for Everyday Life'') and more.

{{Western Buddhism}}
In [[Zen|Zen-Buddhism]], '''Dharma transmission''' is a custom in which a person is established as a "successor in an unbroken [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of teachers and disciples, a spiritual 'bloodline' (''[[kechimyaku]]'') theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."&lt;ref name="Haskel, 2"&gt;Haskel, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The dharma lineage reflects the importance of family-structures in ancient China, and forms a symbolic and [[ritual]] recreation of this system for the monastical "family".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}

In [[Rinzai school|Rinzai-Zen]], ''inka shōmei'' is ideally "the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} but practically it is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt; to eighty&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhadharma"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm |title=Buddhadharma, Dharma Dictionary, ''Roshi'' |access-date=2012-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204133920/http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm |archive-date=2012-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan.

In [[Sōtō|Sōtō-Zen]], dharma transmission (shiho) provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy|santō kyōshi]]''){{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}} further training is required to become an [[oshō]].&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Chinese Chán|Bodhidharma}}

The notion and practice of Dharma Transmission developed early in the history of Chán, as a means to gain credibility{{sfn|McRae|2003}} and to foster institutional ties among the members of the Chán-community.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008}} Charts of dharma-lineages were developed, which represented the continuity of the Buddhist dharma. Originally these lineages only included the Chinese Patriarchs, but they were later extended to twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs and seven Buddhas.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}

===Chán lineage===
{{See also|Zen lineage charts}}

The Chán-tradition developed from the established tradition of "Canonical Buddhism",{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} which "remained normative for all later Chinese Buddhism".{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} It was established by the end of the sixth century, as a result of the Chinese developing understanding of Buddhism in the previous centuries.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177-184}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|Lai}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation; missing year;|date=August 2014}}

One of the inventions of this Canonical Buddhism were transmission lists, a literary device to establish a lineage. Both [[Tiantai|T'ien Tai]] and Chán took over this literary device, to lend authority to those developing traditions, and guarantee its authenticity:{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|McRae|p=2-9}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing year|date=August 2014}}
{{quote|Chan texts present the school as Buddhism itself, or as ''the'' central teaching of Buddhism, which has been transmitted from the seven Buddhas of the past to the twenty-eight patriarchs, and all the generations of Chinese and Japanese Chan and Zen masters that follow.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4}}}}

The concept of dharma transmission took shape during the Tang period, when establishing the right teachings became important, to safeguard the authority of specific schools.{{sfn|Ford|2006|pp=22-25}} The emerging Zen-tradition developed the ''Transmission of the Lamp''-genre, in which lineages from Shakyamuni Buddha up to their own times were described.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

Another literary device for establishing those traditions was given by the ''Kao-seng-chuan'' (Biographies of Eminent Monks), compiled around 530.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} The Chán-tradition developed its own corpus in this genre, with works such as ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952) and the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (published 1004). McRae considers Dumoulin's ''A History of Zen'' to be a modern example of this genre, disguised as scientific history.{{sfn|McRae|2005}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}

===Chinese Patriarchs===
The Chán-lineages picture the Indian monk Bodhidharma as the patriarch who brought Chán to China. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century.

By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chán in China was developed.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} In the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student [[Shenhui]], the traditional form of this lineage had been established:{{sfn|McRae|2003}}
# [[Bodhidharma]] ({{lang|zh|達摩}}) ca. 440 – ca. 528
# [[Huike]] ({{lang|zh|慧可}}) 487–593
# [[Sengcan]] ({{lang|zh|僧燦}}) ?–606
# [[Daoxin]] ({{lang|zh|道信}}) 580–651
# [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] ({{lang|zh|弘忍}}) 601–674
# [[Huineng]] ({{lang|zh|慧能}}) 638–713

====Shenhui and Huineng====
[[File:Huineng-tearing-sutras.svg|thumb|left|100px|Huineng tearing sutras]]
According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, [[Huineng]] (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chán history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor. The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]], the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to [[Nanhua Temple]] in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples.

Modern scholarship, however, has questioned this [[Zen#Zen narratives|narrative]]. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by [[Shenhui]], a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} In 745 Shen-hui was invited to take up residence in the Ho-tse temple in Lo-yang. In 753 he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was [[Guifeng Zongmi]]{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=9}} According to Tsung-mi, Shen-hui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when "an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the shen-lung temple".{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=279}}

Doctrinally the Southern School is associated with the teaching that [[Subitism|enlightenment is sudden]], while the [[Northern School]] is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and "sudden enlightenment" became a standard doctrine of Chan.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

===Indian Patriarchs===
In later writings this lineage was extended to include twenty-eight Indian patriarchs. In the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') of [[Yongjia Xuanjue]] (永嘉玄覺, 665–713), one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng|Huìnéng]], it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from Mahākāśyapa, a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni Buddha]], and the first patriarch of Chán Buddhism. {{sfn|Chang|1967}}

====Twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs====
[[Keizan|Keizan's]] ''Transmission of the Light'' gives twenty-eight patriarchs up to and including Bodhidharma in this transmission:{{sfn|Keizan|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For narratives in English of most patriarchs see Houn Jiyu (Peggy Teresa Nancy Kennett), 1999, ''Zen is Eternal Life'' (''Selling Water by the River''), Mount Shasta, California: Shasta Abbey Press.}}

{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}

====Mahākāśyapa====
According to the traditional Chán accounts, the first Dharma transmission occurred as described in the [[Flower Sermon]]. The Buddha held up a golden [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower before an assembly of "gods and men". None who were in attendance showed any sign of understanding except his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]], who offered only a smile. The Buddha then said, 
{{quote|I have the right Dharma Eye Treasury, the wondrous mind of nirvana, the reality beyond appearance. The Dharma-door of mind to mind transmission has been entrusted to Kāśyapa.&lt;ref name="epstein"&gt;Epstein, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein comments, "Thus Mahākāśyapa received the transmission of Dharma and became the first Buddhist patriarch."&lt;ref name="epstein"/&gt;}}

==Function of Dharma Transmission==
Though dharma transmission implies the acknowledgement of insight into the teachings of Buddhism as understood by the Zen tradition, especially [[kensho|seeing into one's true nature]], dharma transmission is also a means to establish a person into the Zen tradition:{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=23}}
{{quote|The procedure establishes the disciple as a transmitting teacher in their own right and successor in an unbroken [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of teachers and disciples, a spiritual 'bloodline' (''[[kechimyaku]]'') theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."&lt;ref name="Haskel, 2"/&gt;}}

The dharma lineage reflects the importance of family-structures in ancient China, and forms a symbolic and ritual recreation of this system for the monastical "family".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}

===Esoteric and exoteric transmission===
According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which "the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face".{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission of a flame from one candle to another candle,{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} or the transmission from one vein to another.{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=58}} In exoteric transmission the requirement is  "direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror."{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

This polarity is recognizable in the emphasis that the Zen-tradition puts on maintaining the correct Dharma transmission, while simultaneously stressing seeing into one's nature:
{{quote|The matter of learning from a teacher is most essential. People of old who arrived at the source of [[Kensho|seeing nature]], passed through many barriers clearly and completely without a dot of doubt, and traveled freely through the world opening big mouths in discussion, only came to know the transcendental message of Zen after they finally ran into Zen masters of great vision. Then they sincerely sought certainty and wound up with the duty of the teacher's succession, bearing the debt of Dharma, never to forget it for a moment. This is called dharma succession. Since ancient times the designated succession of the ancestral teachers has always been like this.{{sfn|Torei|2010|p=88}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The modern framing of Zen as the ''experience'' of 'ultimate truth' or reality{{sfn|Sharf|2005}} may influence the institutional shape western Zen is going to take, where individual freedom is highly appraised. See also Bodiford 2008, pp 277-279}}}}

Nevertheless, while the Zen tradition has always stressed the importance of formal Dharma transmission, there are well known examples of [[Mushi dokugo]], such as [[Nōnin]], [[Jinul]] and [[Suzuki Shōsan]] who attained awakening on their own, though all of them were familiair with the Zen-teachings.

===Family structure===
According to Bodiford, "Zen is the predominant form of Buddhism because of dharma transmission":{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
{{quote|[I]t has ancestors whom it honors. It honors those ancestors by transmitting their legacy to proper descendants, from generation to generation, who will maintain and carry on their family traditions [...] [I]n Zen this process of transmitting a family legacy is given structural form through the ritual of dharma transmission.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}}}

Bodiford distinguishes seven dimensions which are discernible in both family relationships and in dharma lineages:
# Ancestral dimension: "Ancestors (''so'') constitute a fundamental source of power".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}} Performing rituals in honour of the ancestors keeps them in high regard "among the living".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
# Biological dimension: the dharma lineage creates (spiritual) offspring, just as the family creates new life.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=264-265}}
# Linguistic dimension: dharma heirs receive new names, which reflect their tie to the dharma 'family'.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=265}}
# Ritual dimension: rituals confirm the family relationships. One's teacher is honored in rituals, as are deceased teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=265-266}}
# Legal dimension: teachers have the obligation to discipline their students, just as students have the obligation to obey their teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=266}}
# Institutional and financial dimension: dharma heirs have an obligation to support their home temple, both financially and ritually.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=266-267}}
# Temporal dimension: long-term relationships foster the previous dimensions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=267}}

The family-model is easier recognized when East Asian languages are being used, because the same terminology is used to describe both earthly and spiritual family relations.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=267-268}}

Dharma transmission is both concrete and abstract:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}
{{quote|Every link in the genealogy of dharma transmission occurs in documented historical circumstances: a specific place and time, identifiable individuals, and specific words and actions. At the same time, though, Zen texts also assert that true transmission consists of no transmission. In other words, it occurs only mind-to-mind.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}}}

This feature gives dharma transmission a great flexibility:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}
{{quote|[W]hen the historical evidence is in one's favor, one can demonstrate the validity of dharma transmission by citing any number of the aforementioned seven dimensions. When the historical evidence is less favorable, then one can shift the argument to the religious realm by arguing that the only facts that really matter are the depths and quality of one's Buddha realization.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}}}

==Contemporary use in the Zen-traditions==
Within the various Zen traditions dharma transmission got various meanings. A difference is made in most schools between 
{{quote|...acknowledgement of awakening itself [which] remained separate from monastic leadership.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}}}}

===Chinese Chán===
Traditional Chinese Chán still exists in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, though it is less known in the west than Japanese Zen.

In the Chinese Buddhist tradition, there are 3 systems of transmission:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.182828165075325.43405.100000444276511&amp;type=3 Ven Huei Guang Facebook photo album with dharma transmission explanation]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tonsure system: a person becomes tonsured as a novice monastic under the Master's school. He/she is given a Dharma name 法號 at the time of tonsure based on the Master's lineage. This name is also called "the outer name 外號" because it is used by all people to address you. This name is used for life. At the same time, the Master will give the novice sramanera (or sramanerika) ten precepts.
# Ordination system: a novice will become fully ordained as a Bhikṣu monk/ Bhikṣuni nun with the Triple Platform Ordination (Observing the Śrāmanera, Bhikṣu and Bodhisattva precepts). This ordination must be presided by 10 monks with at least 10 years of seniority with a pure practice in upholding the monastic precepts. In this ceremony, the 10 Masters represent the Triple Gem accepting the novice into the Sangha. At this time, another Dharma name 法名 is given. This name is also called "precept name 戒名 or inner name 內號" because it is used only by one's Master. This name represents your precept lineage transmission.
# Dharma transmission system:{{sfn|Sharf|2005}}{{sfn|Adamek|2006}} This system upholds the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye through the generations of transmission. This is the Mind to Mind seal of the Dharma that is beyond the scriptures. At this time, another Dharma name 法名 is given. This is also called "the inner name 內號" and use only by one's Master. This name represents your Dharma lineage transmission. After receiving this name, one will use this name instead of the name received during precept ordination to write one's Dharma name (Inner Name)(Outer Name).

It is customary to refer to one's own tonsure Master as "Gracious Master", precept Master as "Root Master" and Dharma transmission Master as "Venerable Master". In [[Chinese Buddhism]], these 3 systems are separate and are not performed by the same Masters. Moreover, due to the strong emphasis on the Dharma, when a person receives the Dharma transmission, he/she is recognized as that Ch'an Master's Dharma son/daughter. Of course lay Buddhists may also receive this Dharma transmission, but there are very few incidences. Most of the monk/nun who received the transmission has already been tonsured and ordained by other Masters.

===Rinzai===
{{main article|Rinzai school}}

All Rinzai lineages pass through [[Hakuin Ekaku]], the 18th century revivalist, who considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin (Shoju Ronin, Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721), though Hakuin never received formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin,{{sfn|Mohr|2003|p=311-312}} nor from any other teacher.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/02/teaching-credentials-in-zen.html James Ford (2009), ''Teaching Credentials in Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of ''Dai-ichiza'', "First Monk":{{sfn|Waddell|2010|p=xxix}}
{{quote|It was the minimum rank required by government regulation for those installed as temple priests and seems to have been little more than a matter of paying a fee and registering Hakuin as the incumbent of Shōin-ji.{{sfn|Waddell|2010|p=xxix}}}}

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833),{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=392}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=90}} both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though "he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=391}}

Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by [[Nanpo Jomyo]], who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insight and succession====
In the [[Rinzai school]], a difference is made between acknowledgement of insight and succession in the organisation:
{{quote|From the Rinzai perspective, true realization (jisshō) and succession to a master (shijō) are two different stages in the course of practice, the latter implying a comprehensive integration of awakening in the activities of everyday life.{{sfn|Mohr|1994|p=359}}}}

According to Mohr, 
{{quote|In the Rinzai school the issue of Dharma transmission is essentially subjective, that is, left to the discretion of the master, and the ambiguity of terms such as "successor in the Dharma" (hassu 法嗣) has persisted down to the present. According to the context or the circumstances, it can signify either spiritual recognition or inheritance of a temple lineage.{{sfn|Mohr|1994|p=358}}}}

The most common form of transmission in Rinzai Zen is the acknowledgement that one has stayed in the monastery for a certain amount of time, and may later become a temple priest.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}}

====Further practice====
After finishing the koan-study, further practice is necessary:
{{quote|[I]t would take 10 years to solve all the kôans [...] in the sôdô. After the student has solved all koans, he can leave the sôdô and live on his own, but he is still not considered a roshi. For this he has to complete another ten years of training, called "go-go-no-shugyô" in Japanese. Literally, this means "practice after satori/enlightenment", but [[Keido Fukushima|Fukushima]] preferred the translation "special practice". Fukushima would explain that the student builds up a "religious personality" during this decade. I would say it is a kind of period that functions to test if the student is actually able to live in regular society and apply his koan understanding to daily life, after he has lived in an environment that can be quite surreal and detached from the lives of the rest of humanity. Usually, the student lives in a small parish temple during this decade, not in a formal training monastery.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201201.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Sōtō-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Inka shōmei====
The common transmission does not include ''inka shōmei''. Ideally ''inka shōmei'' is "the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} but practically it is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} Training halls are temples which are authorised for further training after being qualified as a temple priest.

There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt; to eighty&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhadharma" /&gt; of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan:
{{quote|In Rinzai Zen, it is relatively easy to say who is a roshi and who is not. Anyone who is authorized by another roshi (i.e. his teacher) is a roshi. This authorization (officially the "inka-shômei" document) is documented on a piece of paper, that is why it is also called colloquially "ichi-mai", that is "one sheet (of paper)". The transmission is totally vertical from teacher to student, no peer control is involved. That means that the Rinzai sect has no means to control who is made a roshi and who is not. In spite of that, the number of Rinzai roshis is relatively low, maybe around 50 or so.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt;}}

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of ''roshi'' is equivalent to ''Zen master'' and ''shike'':&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;
{{quote|'Roshi' is the title compatible with the most formal title ‘Shike’ who got officially authorized as a Dharma successor by authentic master.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;[http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ Boeddhistisch Dagblad, 17 april 2013, ''Rients Ritskes op beschuldiging: ‘Raksu formeel uitgereikt als bewijs van competent zenleiderschap’''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420011852/http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ |date=April 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on Sokun Tsushimoto, see [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090802x1.html The Japan Times online: Caring for body and soul. Interview with Sokun Tsushimoto]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A qualified [[Zen master]] bestows inka only upon "those select few"{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} who have successfully completed the entire Rinzai koan curriculum,{{sfn|Seager|1999|p=107}}&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, 277&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} and "are eligible to serve as ''sōdō'' roshi,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple:
{{quote|[D]isciples today are expected to spend a dozen or more years with a master to complete a full course of training in koan commentary. Only when a master is satisfied that a disciple can comment appropriately on a wide range of old cases will he recognize the latter as a dharma heir and give him formal "proof of transmission" (J. ''[[inka shomei]]''). Thus, in reality, a lot more than ''satori'' is required for one to be recognized as a master (J. ''shike'', ''roshi'') in the Rinzai school of Zen at present. The accepted proof of ''satori'' is a set of literary and rhetorical skills that takes many years to acquire.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=42}}}}

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto,
{{quote|Authorization as a Roshi should be done in the most formal and explicit way. In Rinzai tradition a master gives a calligraphy of Inka-certificate to disciple as a proof of authorization. Needless to say authorization must be backed up by the fact that the disciple spent many years in zen training under the master earnestly and continuously.&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;}}

{{Nihongo|'''Inka Shōmei'''|印可証明|}} (''[[Korean language|Korean]]:'' '''Inga''') literally means "the legitimate seal of clearly furnished proof":{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} 
{{quote|The ideogram for ''inka'' has two parts: ''in'' is on one side, ''ka'' is on the other. The root meaning resides in the character for ''in'' (''yin'' in Chinese). The right half of this ''in'' consists of an ancient character shaped like our modern ''P''. In ancient times the character represented an actual object. It stood for the image of just the right half ('''P''') of the emperor's official seal ('''IP'''), ''after'' the Emperor had broken in half the whole seal."&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;Austin, 266-267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right-hand portion of the seal was given to an individual who would then work by authority of the emperor, while the emperor himself would retain the left-hand portion. In ancient times inka usually came in the form of an actual document, but this practice is no longer commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Hori, 674&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sōtō===
In Sōtō, dharma transmission is the acknowledgement of the ties between teacher and student. It has been subject to changes over the history of the Sōtō-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991}}

Though [[Dōgen]] emphasized the importance of the purity of the teachings, and highly valued lineage and dharma transmission, the Sōtō-school has its origins in various lineages and dharma transmissions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=270-271}} Dogen received dharma transmission from his Chinese teacher [[Rujing]], with whom he studied two years, but in medieval Sōtō he was also considered to be a dharma heir of Myōzen, a Rinzai-teacher, with whom he studied eight years.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=426}} And [[Tettsū Gikai]], the dharma-grandson of Dogen, was also lineage-holder of [[Nōnin]], the founder of the Dharuma-shu, also a Rinzai-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|pp=426-427}} Gikai passed this linegae over to [[Keizan]], who thereby was also lineage-holder in at least two lineages.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=427}}

To make the history of Sōtō even more complicated, the [[Caodong]]-lineage that Dogen inherited through Rujing was passed on previously from the Caodong-master [[Dayang Jingxuan]] to [[Touzi Yiqing]] via the Rinzai-master Fushan Fayuan. Fushan Fayuan had once studied under Dayang Jingxuan. When Jingxuan died Fayuan had received Jingxuan's "portrait, robe, and a verse that expressed his teaching",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} promising "to pass them on to a suitable successor". Fayuan chose his student Touzi Yiqing to inherit this lineage,{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} a fact that was acknowledged in Keizan's Denkoroku, but "[i]n the standard versions of Dogen's writings, however, all direct references to Yiqing's indirect succession have been eliminated".{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}}

====Criteria====
Manzan Dokahu (1636–1714), a Sōtō reformer,
{{quote|[P]ropagated the view that Dharma transmission was dependent on personal initiation between a Master and disciple rather than on the disciple's enlightenment. He maintained this view in the face of strong opposition, citing as authority the towering figure of Japanese Zen, Dogen [...] This became and continues to this day to be the official Sōtō Zen view. {{sfn|Lachs|1999}}}}

According to Manzan, even an unenlightened student could receive dharma transmission:
{{quote|Manzan argued that as long as master and disciple fulfill the condition of a personal relationship, then Dharma transmission 'with either an enlightened or an unenlightened disciple are both equivalent in [maintaining] the true tradition'.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=444}}}}

In Sōtō-zen, since Manzan Dokahu, two criteria are applied for dharma transmission:
# ''Isshi inshō'' – "Exclusive authentication from no more than one teacher".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}} This criterion "prohibits clerics inheriting more than one lineage"{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}}
# ''Menju shihō'' – "Face-to-face bestowal of succession".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}} This criterion "prohibits conferral by proxy, conferral at a distance to strangers, or posthumous conferral".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The origins of Sōtō-zen, or Dogen-shu, are in contradiction to this criterium. Gikai, the third abbot of Ehei-ji, was also lineage-holder of [[Nōnin]]. According to the ''Denkoroku'', Dogen himself had also received dharma transmission from Myōzen.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=270-271}}{{sfn|Faure|2000}}}}

====Status====
In contrast to the status that dharma transmission has begotten in the west, in Sōtō it has a relatively low status:
{{quote|[D]harma transmission provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy|santō kyōshi]]''). Thus, in present day Sōtō Zen, dharma transmission constitutes a preliminary step, after which one's real development begins [...] Today, the key authority conferred by dharma transmission is that it qualifies a priest to manage an ordinary (''jun hōchi'') local temple. These temples are not ascetic training but of ceremonial services on behalf of lay patrons.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}}}}

To supervise the training of monks, further qualifications are necessary:
{{quote|The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e. ''sanzen dōjō shike'' status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a [[Zen master]]. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years' experience as an assistant supervisor at a specially designated training hall (''tokubetsu sōdō''), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}}}}

The duties which come with this full qualification were not always appreciated. In the medieval organisation of the Sōtō-shu, when rotation of abbotship was the norm. Dharma transmission at a branch temple obliged one to serve at least one term as abbot at the main temple. Abbotship gave severe duties, and financial burdens, for which reason many tried to avoid the responsibility of abbotship:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=273}}
{{quote|Tsūgen, Baisan and Jochū each demanded that future generations excommunicate any Zen teacher who failed to fulfill his obligation to serve as abbot of a head temple. Baisan decreed that the obedient Zen successors should seize defiant ones and then burn the offender's succession's certificate (''shisho'') before his eyes. Note the remarkable inversion that has occurred here. Instead of dharma transmission being a qualification for becoming an abbot, successful service as abbot has become a requirement for being allowed to retain one's dharma transmission.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=273}}}}

====Spiritual realization====
The Sōtō-shu also confers inka shōmyō (or ''inshō'') "[granting] the seal of approval to a realization of enlightenment",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}} upon students. This is an 
{{quote|... idealized religious aspect of the Dharma transmission process. Zen master and disciple may evoke this mystical paradigm through ritual ceremony in the master's room (''shi-tsunai''), but other, more mundane institutional concerns can govern the actual selection and promotion of Dharma 'heirs'.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}}}}

Dharma transmission is part of the maintenance of the Sōtō-institutions. Authority and temple-property are handed down, often from father to son.{{sfn|Tetsuo|2003}} It is not a guarantee for spiritual attainment:
{{quote|dharma transmission is no guarantee for anything. It only shows that the person who gave the transmission – and only that one person – was convinced that the student was qualified as a teacher. Could he have been wrong? Yes, he could have been wrong. Therefore, if you want to make sure that a teacher is actually a good teacher, you should not only ask if he or she has dharma transmission or not. The question is: Where does this dharma transmission come from? What lineage does it represent? And even more important: What practice did accompany it? What kind of student was the teacher before he or she became a teacher? What is his or her practice now?&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201005.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 2: Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Shiho====
[Please note that this section provides only one reference from a single individual. Help Wikipedia by including more sources.]

Dharma transmission is also called ''shiho''.{{sfn|Seager|1999|p=107}} In the [[Sōtō]] school a student receives Dharma transmission during a ''denbō'' ceremony, which is the last ceremony of their [[shiho]] ceremony: 
{{quote|The usual practice...is for a Sōtō monk to be given Dharma transmission by the priest who ordained him (in most cases his own father), after he returns from his minimum period of monastery training. Because Dharma transmission is a prerequisite to becoming the head priest of a Sōtō branch temple, virtually all Sōtō priests meet this ritual requirement at a relatively early stage in their careers."&lt;ref name="kraft"&gt;Kraft, 20; 173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shiho is...
{{quote|...the recognition of the transmission that took place long before the ceremony itself. In fact, it has nothing to do at all with the paper, with philosophy or with mystical experience. The 24 hours of the daily life shared by teacher and student are the content of the transmission, and nothing else [...] In Antaiji, when you receive shiho after, say, eight or nine years, you will have sat for 15.000 hours of zazen with your teacher. Not only that, you also shared many thousands of meals with him, worked together in the fields for thousands of hours, spread manure, cut grass and wood together, side by side, you sweat together in the summer and froze together in the winter. You cooked for him and filled the bath tub for him, you know how he likes the temperature both of his soup and the bathing water. You also shared many drinks, probably. In each of these activities, the dharma is transmitted. None should be left out.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web/&gt;}}

Shiho is done "one-to-one in the abbot's quarters (hojo)".&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt; Three handwritten documents certify the dharma transmission;
{{quote|a) Shisho (the scripture of transmission, the names of the ancestors arranged in a circle – the dharma has passed on from to Shakyamuni to yourself, and now you give it back to Shakyamuni. There is a small piece of papaer, probably originally written by Sawaki Roshi, with some comments. This paper is also copied by the student when doing dharma transmission at Antaiji.)
b) Daiji (the great matter, a cryptic symbolization of the content of the teaching. Again, there is a small extra sheet of paper that explains about the meaning of the symbols.)
c) Kechimyaku (the blood lineage, looks quite similar to the blood line transmission that you already wrote at the time of ordination) 
d) Actually, in the lineage of Sawaki Roshi (and maybe other lineages as well) a student is told to write a fourth document on an extra sheet of paper, which is called Hisho (the secret document, which is encoded, but the code for decyphering is on the same paper, so once you hold it in your hands it is not so "secret" anymore.)&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;}}

The procedure has to take place only once in one's life, and binds the student to the teacher forever:
{{quote|Dharma transmission can happen once, and only once, or never at all. Multiple dharma transmission is nonsense. If you receive dharma transmission from one teacher, from then on that is your one and only teacher, your real teacher (jap. hon-shi). The multiple lineage holders that you hear of in the West are bullshit. Therefore it is important that both sides, but especially the student, make sure that this is the right time for them to make this important step.&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;}}

If a students does not have the feeling he wants to be tied to this teacher for the rest of his life, he may refuse to take dharma transmission from this particular teacher.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt; Since the time of Manzan Dokahu (1636–1714), multiple dharma transmissions are impossible in Sōtō Zen.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}

====Further study====
According to [[Muho Noelke]], dharma transmission marks the beginning of the real learning:
{{quote|Dharma transmission is not the last and final step in a student's practice. Quite the opposite, one might call it the real first step on the way of practice. The way has just begun, but now the student has decided which exact way he wants to follow to the end. But all the real hardships still lay ahead of him. To use the example of boy-meets-girl again: At this point of time they have decided that they are made for each other, so to speak, they want to get married and have kids. Hopefully, that does not mean that the romance is over. It just means that both are prepared for the real struggle to begin.&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This is reflected by the [[Five Ranks|Five ranks of enlightenment]]. The same notion can be found within the Rinzai-tradition. See [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|Three mysterious Gates]], and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]]}}}}

After Dharma transmission one has become a member of the "blood line" of Zen, but is not yet qualified as an [[Oshō]]. After the [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|ten-e]] and [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|zuise]] ceremonies, one is qualified as an oshō. There-after one has to practice for some time, at least six months, in an ''sôdô-ango'', an officially recognized Sōtō-shu training centre.&lt;ref name=Antaiji5 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 5: Sessa-takuma - ango as life in a rock grinder'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After that one can start to work in a temple. The newly acquired status is confirmed in the ''kyoshi-honin'' ceremony. There-after follows the first practice-period in one's own temple, with the aid of a ''susho'' (head monk). This is followed by the ''Jushoku-himei'' ceremony, which confirms one's status as ''dai-oshō''.&lt;ref name=Antaiji5 group=web /&gt;

===Sanbo Kyodan===
The [[Sanbo Kyodan]] mixes Sōtō and Rinzai-elements.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}} Students in this school follow the [[Kōan#Sanbo Kyodan|Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum]], in which great emphasis is placed on [[kensho]], the initial insight into one's true nature.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=430-431}} Having attained kensho is publicly acknowledged in a ''jahai''-ceremony.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=430}} After working through the Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum, which may take as short as five years,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} the student receives a calligraphy testifying that het or she "has finished the great matter".{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} This is publicly acknowledged in the ''hasansai''-ceremony, giving the status of ''hasan''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}}

The Sanbo Kyodan has two levels of teaching authority, namely ''junshike'' ("associate zen master"), and ''shōshike'' ("authentic zen master").{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} Junshikes can give dokusan, authorize kensho, and supervise part of the koan-study. Shoshikes can supervise the advanced koan-study, and perform religious ceremonies, such as the precept-ceremony and wedding ceremonies.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

The process toward gaining these titles has seen some variations within the Sanbo Kyodan. ''Hasansai'' may be preparatory to the ''junshike''-title, but may also be the promotion to this title. And promotion to ''shoshike'' may be preparatory to dharma transmission, but may also be equivalent to it.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

In dharma transmission, the student receives the ''sanmotsu'', akin to the Sōtō shiho ceremony.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} This is coupled with the Rinzai notion on ''inka''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} In Rinzai, only students who have completed the complete Rinzai koan curriculum and "are eligible to serve as ''sōdō'' roshi,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple, receive inka. In the Sanbo Kyodan, ''inka'' is derived from Harada's Rinzai master Dokutan Sōsan.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

===White Plum Asanga===
[[File:Shiho ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Michel Genko Dubois (left) and [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]] performing "mind to mind" in Dubois's [[shiho]] ceremony.]]

In the [[White Plum Asanga]], Dharma transmission comes first, and qualifies one as a [[sensei]].{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=102}} This may be followed by inka, the final acknowledgemment:{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=102}}{{sfn|Seager|1999}}&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|… once you have transmission then your teacher is sort of watching to see how you’re doing as a teacher – on how you are conducting yourself and, after a period of time, if the teacher has confidence in your understanding and ability to teach (that you are conducting yourself with integrity and clarity) then, at some point, the person will get the final seal of approval – which is what inka is. There is nothing particularly mysterious about it.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://sweepingzen.com/inka SweepingZen, ''Inka shomi'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Korean Soen===
In Korean Soen, Inka (In'ga) typically refers to the private acknowledgement of dharma transmission from a teacher to their student. "Transmission" is used to refer to the public ceremonial version of the same acknowledgement.

Both are considered equal in authority and "realization". A monk with either In'ga or the public "transmission" is qualified to hold the post of Soen Sa, or "Zen Master" for a temple, and give transmission to their own students (either, In'ga or public "transmission"). The majority of Zen Masters in Korea have only received, and only give In'ga, with the formal transmission ceremony being far more rare.&lt;ref&gt;Buswell&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western [[Kwan Um School of Zen]] created by the Korean Zen Master [[Seung Sahn]], "Inka" is granted to an individual who has completed their koan training and is granted the title [[Ji Do Poep Sa Nim]]. Dharma transmission in the Kwan Um School of Zen comes after inka, denoting the individual is now a [[Soen Sa Nim]].&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 93; 220&lt;/ref&gt; Seung Sahn himself is quoted saying in reference to the administration of his Western organization, 
{{quote|Inka and transmission are different. Our 'Ji Do Poep Sa Nim' title is like the Japanese title 'sensei.' In Korea, we call it 'Chong Yong Sun'—your practice is okay, teaching other people is possible. This title has almost disappeared in Korea, although it still exists in China. In Korea we now have the title 'Ip Sung Sunim.'—'head monk.'" This innovation applies only to Seung Sahn's Western organization, and is not normative for Korean Soen/Zen practice either historically, or currently.&lt;ref&gt;Seung Sahn&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Vietnamese Thien===
[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] has created a ritual known as "Lamp Transmission", making a teacher a Dharmacharya—an individual with "limited teaching authority."&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; According to author [[James Ishmael Ford]], 
{{quote|Regarding the issue of Dharma transmission, Thich Nhat Hanh has said no single student will succeed him. Instead his community of practice will itself be his successor. He is quoted as saying [[Maitreya]], the Buddha of future birth, may be a community of practice rather than an individual. What this actually means will only become apparent over the next decades.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==
In the western understanding, dharma transmission stands solely for recognition of authentic insight, whereas in the Japanese monastery system dharma transmission is a formal notification that someone is fully qualified to take a leading role in this system.{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} In the USA and Europe dharma transmission is linked to the unofficial title [[Rōshi|roshi]], older teacher. In the Western understanding roshis are "part of a tradition that imputes to them quasi-divine qualities",{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} someone who "is defined by simplicity, innocence, and lack of self-interest or desire".{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} Nevertheless, the authorisation of teachers through dharma transmission does not mean that teachers are infallible,{{sfn|Ford}} as is clear from the repeated appearance of scandals:{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}
{{quote|In this complicated world of living Zen, we can meet teachers guiding communities of practice with compassion and grace. But we also find Zen teachers having inappropriate sexual relationships, abusing the power dynamics of their relationships and otherwise acting in ways contrary to the mythic status of their positions as teachers. In recent years there have been a number of books and essays exposing the ills of Zen institutions east and west as well as the foibles of individual Zen teachers. Here in the west there are few lineages that have passed unscathed by scandals, mostly of a sexual nature. And in the east, particularly in the Japanese institutions, we’ve learned how masters and whole schools were at various times co-opted by the state, most notoriously in the years leading up to and including the Second World War.{{sfn|Ford}}}}

According to Lachs,{{who|date=August 2017}} those scandals have also been possible because of the status given to roshis by dharma transmission, and "a desire for the master’s aura, recognition, and approval":{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}
{{quote|The students expect the real teacher to be an ideal teacher and look forward to having such an ideal teacher lead and instruct them. The student who enters the practice having read a myth will expect to find the myth and will think they have found the myth. Unfortunately, they have found the myth without recognizing it for what it is. What they really have found, all too often, is another story of ordinary, flawed human behavior.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}}}

Born in the Austro-Hungarian empire (currently Ukraine) to a German family of Jewish descent, during the 1940s his family avoided deportation to [[Transnistria]] while living in [[Czernowitz]] during his youth thanks to the protection of [[Traian Popovici]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caiv.org/medios/zajor2012_9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 Heymann began studies in Philosophy and Literature at the [[University of Bucharest]], then to the [[University of Vienna]] and in 1947 to the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he completed his doctoral degree under [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. In 1953 he emigrated to Uruguay teaching at the "Instituto de Profesores Artigas" and at the University of the Republic until [[Juan María Bordaberry]] came into power. He was forced to leave the country after confronting local authorities regarding autonomy for the University. He then moved to Venezuela in 1974, teaching first at the [[Universidad Simon Bolivar]] and at the [[Central University of Venezuela]] until his retirement in 2006, although he kept his position as active professor for the rest of his life. His research focused on Kant and in classical German philosophy. His testimony as a [[Holocaust]] survivor was compiled in the book "Exilio a La Vida: Sobrevivientes Judíos De La Shoá".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Roberto|title=El Holocausto se vuelve una lección de vida y optimismo|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2011/04/06/el-holocausto-se-vuelve-una-leccion-de-vida-y-optimismo|website=eluniversal.com|publisher=EL Universal|accessdate=11 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015193627/http://www.eluniversal.com/2011/04/06/el-holocausto-se-vuelve-una-leccion-de-vida-y-optimismo|archivedate=15 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Zəylik village in Dashkasan Rayon (1980s).jpg|thumb|Town of Pib in [[Gardman]] (Northern [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Artsakh]], historical Armenia), birthplace of Hovhannes Imastaser (c. 1047–1129).]]
Hovhannes Imastaser was born around 1047 in the district of [[Gardman]] (village of Pib) of historical [[Armenia]]’s eastern province of [[Utik]], which today is located in Azerbaijan, north of [[Nagorno Karabakh]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Gabrielian. History of Armenian Philosophy (in Armenian). Vol 1, Yerevan, 1976, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agop Jack Hacikyan, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, Nourhan Ouzounian. The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the sixth to the eighteenth century. Wayne State University Press. 2002, pp. 350–362&lt;/ref&gt;
The most extensive historical account of Hovhannes Imastaser’s life and work is in the 12-13th century Armenian historian [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]]’s “History of Armenia.” &lt;ref&gt;Kirakos Gandzaketsi. History of Armenia. Moscow. Nauka. 1976&lt;/ref&gt; There also exists a 13th-century anonymous biography of Hovhannes Imastaser, which is attributed sometimes to [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]]. 

Hovhannes received his education in theology and science in [[Haghpat Monastery|Haghbat]] and [[Sanahin Monastery|Sanahin]], two important monastic centers of Armenian medieval scholarship. Upon the completion of his studies, Hovhannes moved to medieval Armenia’s capital city of [[Ani]], where he taught [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[music]], [[cosmography]] and [[grammar]]. In [[Ani]], Hovhannes received the ecclesiastical rank of ''sarkavag'' ([[deacon]]), and eventually rose to become a [[vardapet]] (archimandrite, Doctor of Theology) of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. But it was the title ''sarkavag'', however, that became attached to his name.&lt;ref&gt;Agop Jack Hacikyan, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, Nourhan Ouzounian. The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the sixth to the eighteenth century. Wayne State University Press. 2002, pp. 350–362&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hovhannes Imastaser was recognized as a master of Armenian literature, his works acquired wider publicity only in the 19th century when they were published by Abbot [[Ghevont Alishan]], a member of the [[Mechitarists|Mekhitarist Congregation]] in [[Venice]] that is associated with [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholics]]. Imastaser’s innovative approach to literature, for which he is often referred to as a key representative of Armenian literary renaissance, is fully demonstrated in his poem ''Ban Imastutian'' (Discourse on Wisdom). In the poem, written as a dialogue between the author and a blackbird, the bird symbolizes nature, which, per author, is the main inspiration behind art. In Imastaser’s time, artistic inspiration was usually attributed to divine reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Agop Jack Hacikyan, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, Nourhan Ouzounian. The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the sixth to the eighteenth century. Wayne State University Press. 2002, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

As a hymnologist, Imastaser wrote several important [[Armenian chant|sharakans]] (hymns): ''Tagh Harutean'' (Ode to the Resurrection), ''Paitsaratsan Aisor'' (Brightened on This Day), ''Anskizbn Bann Astvatz'' (God, The Infinite Word), ''Anchareli Bann Astavatz'' (God, The Inexpressible Word). The latter two are acrostic compositions, each encompassing within their ten stanzas thirty six letters of the [[Armenian Alphabet]]. In them, Imastaser glorifies heroes and martyrs who sacrificed their lives defending Armenian homeland and their Christian faith. Imastaser also introduced another patriotic theme to Armenian literature and music: emigration. In his hymns Imastaser prays to God so that Armenians who left their country could find strength to return home.&lt;ref&gt;Agop Jack Hacikyan, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, Nourhan Ouzounian. The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the sixth to the eighteenth century. Wayne State University Press. 2002, pp. 350–362&lt;/ref&gt;

Hovhannes Imastaser also contributed to the standardization of the Armenian prayer book and [[Psalter]]. 

Hovhannes Imastaser’s work in mathematics is represented by the volume ''Haghaks Ankiunavor Tvots'' (Concerning Polygonal Numbers). This work indicates a profound knowledge of all important ancient and medieval mathematicians, including [[Pythagoras]], [[Euclid]] and [[Aristotle]]. Hovhannes Imastaser translated into Armenian the works of the following classical scholars: [[Philo of Alexandria]], [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and, as mentioned, [[Aristotle]] and [[Euclid]].&lt;ref&gt;Чалоян В. К. История армянской философии, Ер., 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1084, Hovhannes Imastaser became involved in the project of developing so-called Minor Armenian Calendar, which included all 365 days plus one additional day. Eventually, his work on calendars led to the invention of a perpetual or eternal calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Kirakos Gandzaketsi. History of Armenia. Moscow. Nauka. 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important citations of Hovhannes Imastaser reflects his understanding of the role of the empirical method in science. 150 years before Roger Bacon, Hovhannes Imastaser famously noted: “''Without experimentation, no opinion can be considered probable and acceptable; only experiment produces confirmation and certainty''.”

'''Hugin''' [{{IPA|ǀˈhʊɡɪnǀ}}] is a cross-platform [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Panoramic photography|panorama]] photo [[Image stitching|stitching]] and [[high dynamic range imaging|HDR]] merging program developed by Pablo d'Angelo and others. It is a [[GUI]] front-end for Helmut Dersch's [[Panorama Tools]] and Andrew Mihal's ''Enblend'' and ''Enfuse''. Stitching is accomplished by using several overlapping photos taken from the same location, and using control points to align and transform the photos so that they can be blended together to form a larger image. Hugin allows for the easy (optionally automatic) creation of control points between two images, optimization of the image transforms along with a preview window so the user can see whether the panorama is acceptable. Once the preview is correct, the panorama can be fully stitched, transformed and saved in a standard image format.

==Features==
Hugin and the associated tools can be used to
* combine overlapping images for panoramic photography
* correct complete panorama images, e.g. those that are "wavy" due to a badly [[Spirit level|levelled]] [[Panoramic photography#Panoramic cameras and methods|panoramic camera]]
* stitch large mosaics of images and photos, e.g. of long walls or large [[microscopy]] samples
* find control points and optimize parameters with the help of software assistants/wizards
* output several [[Map projection|projection]] types, such as [[equirectangular projection|equirectangular]] (used by many full spherical viewers), [[mercator projection|mercator]], [[cylindrical projection|cylindrical]], [[stereographic projection|stereographic]], and [[sinusoidal projection|sinusoidal]]
* perform advanced photometric corrections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hugin.sourceforge.net/tech/|title=Hugin Research Corner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and HDR stitching

With the release of 2010.4.0, which includes a built-in control point generator, the developers consider Hugin to be feature-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugin-2010.4.0 release notes|url=http://hugin.sourceforge.net/releases/2010.4.0/en.shtml|publisher=SourceForge.net|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hypnosis|applications}}
'''Hypnotherapy''' is a type of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] in which the mind is used to help with a variety of problems, such as breaking [[bad habit]]s or coping with stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/clinical-support-staff/complementary-and-alternative-medicine-cam |title=Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) |publisher=[[National Health service]] |accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used for a wide variety of applications, and studies into its efficacy are often of poor quality&lt;ref name=Cochrane2007/&gt; which makes it difficult to determine efficacy. Several recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the literature on various conditions have concluded that the efficacy of hypnotherapy is "not verified",&lt;ref name=flammer/&gt; that there is no evidence&lt;ref name=Cochrane2005/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cochrane2012b/&gt; or insufficient evidence&lt;ref name=Pelissolo/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cochrane2012/&gt; for efficacy.

== Definition ==
The United States' ''Federal Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' describes the job of the hypnotherapist:
''"Induces hypnotic state in client to increase motivation or alter behavior patterns: Consults with client to determine nature of problem. Prepares client to enter hypnotic state by explaining how hypnosis works and what client will experience. Tests subject to determine degree of physical and emotional suggestibility. Induces hypnotic state in client, using individualized methods and techniques of hypnosis based on interpretation of test results and analysis of client's problem. May train client in self-hypnosis conditioning.
GOE: 10.02.02 STRENGTH: S GED: R4 M3 L4 SVP: 7 DLU: 77"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oalj.dol.gov/PUBLIC/DOT/REFERENCES/DOT01C.HTM |title=Dictionary of Occupational Titles: Hypnotherapist (079.157-010) |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]], Office of Administrative Law Judges  |accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional hypnotherapy===
The form of hypnotherapy practiced by most Victorian hypnotists, including [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] and [[Hippolyte Bernheim]], mainly employed [[Hypnosis#Post-hypnotic suggestion|direct suggestion]] of symptom removal, with some use of therapeutic [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]] and occasionally [[aversion therapy|aversion]] to alcohol, drugs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tom Kraft |author2=David Kraft |title=Covert sensitization revisited: six case studies |journal=Contemporary Hypnosis |date=2005 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=202-209 |doi=10.1002/ch.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ericksonian hypnotherapy===
In the 1950s, [[Milton H. Erickson]] developed a radically different approach to hypnotism, which has subsequently become known as "Ericksonian hypnotherapy" or "Neo-Ericksonian hypnotherapy."  Erickson made use of an informal conversational approach with many clients and complex language patterns, and therapeutic strategies.  This divergence from tradition led some of his colleagues, including [[André Muller Weitzenhoffer|Andre Weitzenhoffer]], to dispute whether Erickson was right to label his approach "hypnosis" at all.&lt;ref name="Weitzenhoffer 2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=André Muller Weitzenhoffer |year=2000 |title=The practice of hypnotism |edition=2 |oclc=606253084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), a method somewhat similar in some regards to some versions of hypnotherapy, claimed that they had modelled the work of Erickson extensively and assimilated it into their approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Grinder |author2=Richard Bandler |year=1976 |title=Patterns of the hypnotic techniques of Milton H. Erickson |volume=1 |isbn=1-55552-052-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregg E. Gorton |year=2005 |title=Milton Hyland Erickson |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=7 |page=1255 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weitzenhoffer disputed whether NLP bears any genuine resemblance to Erickson's work.&lt;ref name="Weitzenhoffer 2000"/&gt;

===Solution focused hypnotherapy===
In the 2000s, hypnotherapists began to combine aspects of [[solution-focused brief therapy]] (SFBT) with Ericksonian hypnotherapy to produce therapy that was goal focused (what the client wanted to achieve) rather than the more traditional problem focused approach (spending time discussing the issues that brought the client to seek help).

===Cognitive/behavioral hypnotherapy===
Cognitive behavioural hypnotherapy (CBH) is an integrated psychological therapy employing clinical hypnosis and [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT).&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=The Practice of Cognitive-Behavioural Hypnotherapy: A Manual for Evidence-Based Clinical Hypnosis| year=2012| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1855755307 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=um6_7kEszusC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of CBT in conjunction with hypnotherapy may result in greater treatment effectiveness. A meta-analysis of eight different researches revealed "a 70% greater improvement" for patients undergoing an integrated treatment to those using CBT only.&lt;ref name="Kirsch"&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Hypnosis as an adjunct to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy: A meta analysis |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |last1=Kirsch |first1=I. |last2= Montgomery |first2=G. |last3=Sapperstein |first3=G. |volume=63 |pages=214–220 |url=http://www.ericksoninstitute.it/en/65/newsletter/panic-attacks-and-phobias-healing-with-hypnosis/ |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.63.2.214 |pmid=7751482 |issue=2 |date=April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Theodore X. Barber]] and his colleagues published a review of the research which argued, following the earlier social psychology of [[Theodore R. Sarbin]], that hypnotism was better understood not as a "special state" but as the result of normal psychological variables, such as active imagination, expectation, appropriate attitudes, and motivation.&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Barber |first1=Theodore X. |last2=Spanos |first2=Nicholas P. |last3=Chaves |first3=John F. |year=1974 |title=Hypnotism, imagination, and human potentialities |publisher=Pergamon Press |oclc=912492464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barber introduced the term "cognitive-behavioral" to describe the nonstate theory of hypnotism, and discussed its application to behavior therapy.

The growing application of cognitive and behavioral psychological theories and concepts to the explanation of hypnosis paved the way for a closer integration of hypnotherapy with various cognitive and behavioral therapies.&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Moulds|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Guthrie|first3=Rachel M.|last4=Nixon|first4=Reginald D.

Many cognitive and behavioral therapies were themselves originally influenced by older hypnotherapy techniques,&lt;ref name="Weitsenhoffer"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weitsenhoffer |first= A. |title= Behavior therapeutic techniques and hypnotherapeutic methods |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |year=1972 |volume=15 |issue= 2 |pages=71–82 |doi=10.1080/00029157.1972.10402222|pmid= 4679810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., the [[systematic desensitisation]] of [[Joseph Wolpe]], the cardinal technique of early behavior therapy, was originally called "hypnotic desensitisation"&lt;ref name="Wolpe"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolpe |first=Joseph |year=1958 |title= Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition |isbn=978-0804705097 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derived from the ''Medical Hypnosis'' (1948) of [[Lewis Wolberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Medical hypnosis |volume=2 |last=Wolberg |first=Lewis Robert |year=1948 |publisher=Grune &amp; Stratton |oclc=881360526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curative hypnotherapy===
David Lesser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lesser|first1=David|title=Hypnotherapy Explained|date=1985|publisher=Curative Hypnotherapy Examination Committee|location=Birmingham|isbn=0951087517|pages=160|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (1928 - 2001) was the originator of what we today understand by the term Curative Hypnotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Mary|title=What If It Really Is?|date=2010|publisher=Grosvenor House Publishing Ltd|location=Guildford|isbn=9781907211454|pages=174|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was he who first saw the possibility of finding the causes of people’s symptoms by using a combination of hypnosis, IMR and a method of specific questioning that he began to explore.  
Rather than try to override the subconscious information as Janet had done, he realised the necessity- and developed the process- to correct the wrong information.  Lesser’s understanding of the logicality and simplicity of the subconscious led to the creation of the methodical treatment used today and it is his innovative work and understanding that underpins the therapy and is why the term ‘Lesserian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lesser|first1=David|title=Book of Hypnosis|date=1989|publisher=CHEC|isbn=0951087525|pages=143|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;’ was coined and trademarked.
As the understanding of the workings of the subconscious continues to evolve, the application of the therapy continues to change.  The three most influential changes have been in Specific Questioning (1992) to gain more accurate subconscious information; a subconscious cause/effect mapping system (SRBC)(1996) to streamline the process of curative hypnotherapy treatment;  and the ‘LBR Criteria’ (2003) to be able to differentiate more easily between causal and trigger events and helping to target more accurately the erroneous data which requires reinterpretation.

Hypnotherapy expert, Dr Peter Marshall, former Principal of the London School of Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy Ltd. and author of A Handbook of Hypnotherapy, devised the Trance Theory of Mental Illness, which provides that people suffering from depression, or certain other kinds of neurosis, are already living in a trance and so the hypnotherapist  does not need to induce them, but rather to make them understand this and help lead them out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, P.

==Uses==
Clinicians choose hypnotherapy to address a wide range of circumstances; however, according to Yeates (2016), people choose to have hypnotherapy for many other reasons:
::"Ignoring specific issues such as performance anxiety, road rage, weight, smoking, drinking, unsafe sex, etc., those seeking hypnotherapy today do so because of ill-defined, vague feelings that:
:::(a) their health is far from optimal;
:::(b) their worry about past/present/future events is excessive and debilitating;
:::(c) they are not comfortable with who they are;
:::(d) they’re not performing up to the level of their true potential; and/or
:::(e) their lives are lacking some significant (but unidentified) thing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:47777/bin55efd6f6-374a-478d-8f8d-cf96f616d62f?view=true Yeates, Lindsay B.

Literature shows that a wide variety of hypnotic interventions have been investigated for the treatment [[bulimia nervosa]], with inconclusive effect.&lt;ref name=pmid22655335&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00029157.2012.658122|pmid=22655335|title=Cognitive hypnotherapy with bulimia |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis |volume=54|issue=4|pages=353–64|year=2012|last1=Barabasz|first1=Marianne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies have shown that groups suffering from bulimia nervosa, undergoing hypnotherapy, were more exceptional to no treatment, placebos, or other alternative treatments.&lt;ref name=pmid22655335/&gt;

==Efficacy==

A 2003 meta-analysis on the efficacy of hypnotherapy concluded that "the efficacy of hypnosis is not verified for a considerable part of the spectrum of psychotherapeutic practice.&lt;ref name=flammer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flammer|author2=Bongartz|title=On the efficacy of hypnosis: a meta-analytic study.|journal=Contemporary Hypnosis|year=2003|pages=179–197|url=http://www.hypnose-kikh.de/content/Metaanalyse-Flammer-2004.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222004606/http://www.hypnose-kikh.de/content/Metaanalyse-Flammer-2004.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration found no evidence that hypnotherapy was more successful than other treatments or no treatment in achieving cessation of smoking for at least six months.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2005&gt;Abbot NC, Stead LF, White AR, Barnes J.

In 2007, a meta-analysis from the Cochrane Collaboration found that the therapeutic effect of hypnotherapy was "superior to that of a waiting list control or usual medical management, for abdominal pain and composite primary IBS symptoms, in the short term in patients who fail standard medical therapy", with no harmful side-effects. However the authors noted that the quality of data available was inadequate to draw any firm conclusions.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2007&gt;Webb AN, Kukuruzovic R, Catto-Smith AG, Sawyer SM.

==Occupational accreditation==

=== United States ===

The department of health in the state of Washington regulates hypnotherapists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/Hypnotherapist.aspx Hypnotherapist] Washington Department of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====UK National Occupational Standards====
In 2002, the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] developed [[National Occupational Standards]] for hypnotherapy&lt;ref&gt;National Occupational Standards for hypnotherapy http://www.rebhp.org/articles/Hypnotherapy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; linked to [[National Vocational Qualification]]s based on the then [[National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom|National Qualifications Framework]] under the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]]. [http://ncfe.org.uk/ NCFE], a national awarding body, issues level four national vocational qualification diploma in hypnotherapy. Currently AIM Awards offers a Level 3 Certificate in Hypnotherapy and Counselling Skills at level 3 of the [[Regulated Qualifications Framework]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Detail/Index/31621?category=qualifications&amp;query=hypnotherapy|title=Register of Regulated Qualifications|publisher=[[Ofqual]]|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK Confederation of Hypnotherapy Organisations (UKCHO)====
The regulation of the hypnotherapy profession in the UK is at present the main focus of [http://www.ukcho.co.uk UKCHO], a non-profit umbrella body for hypnotherapy organisations. Founded in 1998 to provide a non-political arena to discuss and implement changes to the profession of hypnotherapy, UKCHO currently represents 9 of the UK's professional hypnotherapy organisations and has developed standards of training for hypnotherapists, along with codes of conduct and practice that all UKCHO registered hypnotherapists are governed by. As a step towards the regulation of the profession, UKCHO's website now includes a National Public Register of Hypnotherapists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Harry Cannon - harry.cannon@ntlworld.com |url=http://ukcho.co.uk/register-search.asp |title=UKCHO Register search page - The UK Confederation of Hypnotherapy Organisations |publisher=Ukcho.co.uk |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have been registered by UKCHO's Member Organisations and are therefore subject to UKCHO's professional standards. Further steps to full regulation of the hypnotherapy profession will be taken in consultation with the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health.

=== Australia ===

Professional hypnotherapy and use of the occupational titles ''hypnotherapist'' or ''clinical hypnotherapist'' are not government-regulated in Australia.

In 1996, as a result of a three-year research project led by Lindsay B. Yeates, the [[Australian Hypnotherapists Association]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahahypnotherapy.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 1949), the oldest hypnotism-oriented professional organization in Australia, instituted a peer-group accreditation system for full-time Australian professional hypnotherapists, the first of its kind in the world, which "accredit[ed] specific individuals on the basis of their actual demonstrated knowledge and clinical performance; instead of approving particular 'courses' or approving particular 'teaching institutions'" (Yeates, 1996, p.iv; 1999, p.xiv).&lt;ref&gt;The accreditation criteria and the structure of the accreditation system were based on those described in Yeates, Lindsay B., ''A Set of Competency and Proficiency Standards for Australian Professional Clinical Hypnotherapists: A Descriptive Guide to the Australian Hypnotherapists' Association Accreditation System'', Australian Hypnotherapists' Association, (Sydney), 1996. {{ISBN|0-646-27250-0}} [http://www.ahahypnotherapy.org.au/downloads/AHA%20C%20&amp;%20P%20Standards%20(1996).pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912071000/http://www.ahahypnotherapy.org.au/downloads/AHA%20C%20%26%20P%20Standards%20%281996%29.pdf |date=2009-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was further revised in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;The revised criteria, etc. are described in [http://ahahypnotherapy.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1999-AHA-Competency-Proficiency-Standards-Book.pdf Yeates, Lindsay B., ''A Set of Competency and Proficiency Standards for Australian Professional Clinical Hypnotherapists: A Descriptive Guide to the Australian Hypnotherapists' Association Accreditation System (Second, Revised Edition)'', Australian Hypnotherapists' Association, (Sydney), 1999.] {{ISBN|0-9577694-0-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian hypnotism/hypnotherapy organizations (including the Australian Hypnotherapists Association) are seeking government regulation similar to other mental health professions. However, the various tiers of Australian government have shown consistently over the last two decades that they are opposed to government legislation and in favour of self-regulation by industry groups.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see '''Media Release 89/70''': issued on 12/4/1989, by [[Peter Collins (New South Wales politician)|Peter Collins]] — who was, at the time, the NSW State Government Minister for Health — which announced that the N.S.W. Government had made "a decision not to proceed with plans to place controls on Hypnosis and to ban Stage Hypnosis". Also, see [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TVBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1775%2C7735272 Dewsbury, R., "Reversal by Govt over hypnotists", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', (Thursday, 13 April 1989), p.8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ichikukai Dōjō''''' (一九会道場) is a place for training in ''Misogi-no-kokyu-ho'' (a [[Shinto]] purification through breathing practice) and [[Zen meditation]]. The Misogi practiced at the Ichikukai traces its roots to Inoue Masagane.&lt;ref&gt;P. 58-88, Practical Pursuits: Religion, Politics, and Personal Cultivation in Nineteenth-Century Japan, Janine Anderson Sawada&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dojo]] was founded in 1922 by members of the [[Tokyo University]] Rowing Team along with Ogura Tetsuju, the last disciple of swordsman and calligrapher [[Yamaoka Tesshu]]. The Ichikukai is perhaps best known for its severity  and for the martial artists (esp. [[aikido]]) who have trained there [http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=269]. The purpose of training at the Ichikukai is explained by the following, an excerpt from a treatise written by the founding members of the dojo in 1922: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Toward the Building of a New Dojo

Our practice of misogi shugyo is the desperate, ravenous, fierce and relentless seeking of truth and purity. In order to bring forth and strengthen that core most essential to humanity, we break our bones in training. This training is a way to devote body and soul to that quest.

Today’s world is a mess of mixed-up ideas, and young people feel lost. While misogi shugyo does not necessarily solve the problem completely, we believe it does offer a way out of the confusion. Materialistic and emotional concerns have become convoluted and strange, leaving a world populated by masks and empty husks. Many people still huddle behind those masks; alone, afraid, and without hope.

Misogi shugyo is about exploding this dualistic life, and distilling from it the true, genuine and natural state. There is nothing for us now but to strip ourselves naked to the bone, jump in boldly with both feet, and see with our bare eyes what lies at the ground of our being.&lt;ref&gt;http://members2.jcom.home.ne.jp/ichikukai/eayumi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Training at the Ichikukai continues to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7472">An '''implied license''' is an unwritten [[license]] which permits a party (the licensee) to do something that would normally require the express permission of another party (the licensor). Implied licenses may arise by [[operation of law]] from actions by the licensor which lead the licensee to believe that it has the necessary permission.

Implied licenses often arise where the licensee has purchased a physical embodiment of some [[intellectual property]] belonging to the licensor, or has paid for its creation, but has not obtained permission to use the intellectual property.

==Examples==
* A person who purchases a record album does not explicitly purchase a right to ''perform'' that album by playing it on a record player, but this right is implied.&lt;ref&gt;"An incident to the purchase of any article, whether patented or unpatented, is the right to use and sell it...." [[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]], 316 U.S. 241, 249 (1942); see also Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964) ("[I]t is fundamental that sale of a patented article by the patentee or under his authority carries with it an 'implied license to use.'") (quoting Adams v. Burke, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453, 456 (1873)).&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person or entity that purchases computer software in a suite. Software that is individually purchased, or not included in the suite is protected by a single license &amp; and not part of a implied license.
* A person who posts a lengthy comment to an [[internet forum]] may claim copyright to that post. However, if posters in that forum commonly copy the entire text to which they are responding into a later post, the original poster will be deemed to have given an implied license for his text to be copied into the later post.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* In a non-IP context, a person who holds a party on their house gives all of the invited guests an implied license to enter their property, and to enter those parts of the property that would usually be made available to guests, such as the bathrooms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* In patent law, where an employee invents something while on company time, the employer receives an implied license to use the invention, even if no [[contract]] exists to assign rights to the employer. This is sometimes referred to as [[shop right]].&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178 (1933); Lariscey v. United States, 949 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In copyright law, the work for hire provision would grant the employer copyright to the work, provided the invention is within the employee's job description.&lt;ref&gt;Section 101, Copyright Act of 1976 (USC 17 §101)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, the Ninth US Circuit held that a non-exclusive license to use copyrighted material can be granted by implied license, but not an exclusive license. Further, if the creator has received consideration for the work, the non-exclusive grant is irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon]], 542 F.3d 748 (9th Cir. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where a [[copyright]]ed work has been commissioned, the law in the United Kingdom is that the creator retains rights in the commissioned work. Unauthorised use of the work would therefore infringe the creator's copyright. Nevertheless, the commissioner may have an implied license to use the commissioned work, although only for the particular purpose under which the commission was originally agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Blair v Osborn and Tomkins [1971] 2 WLR 503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bainbridge, Intellectual Property, 1999 (4th ed.), pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt;
* A U.S. court has   ruled in Jan 19th 2006 that [[Web cache|Web caching]] does not constitute a copyright violation, because of ''fair use'' and an ''implied license''. Was the "Field vs Google, US District Court, District of Nevada, CV-S-04-0413-RCJ-LRL". In that context ''implied license'' refers to a [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]]: if the copyright holder does not use any no-archive tags and robot exclusion standards to prevent caching.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication: from surrounding circumstances or by operation of law?==

In the United States, implied licenses are usually considered to be of two kinds: either they reflect the intention of the parties, which is inferred from a fact-specific inquiry into the surrounding circumstances, or else they are constructive agreements, in which case the intention of the parties is likely to be immaterial. In reality, there is a continuum between these kinds of implied license and it may be difficult to determine whether the license or contract in question is one which the law implies, irrespective of any protests by the unwilling licensor, or instead one inferred from the whole pattern of factual circumstances including the evidence of intent.

In England, there is more of a tendency to regard all implied licenses as matters of fact and intent, while what would be a license implied by law in the US is treated under some other branch of substantive law such as the [[doctrine of non-derogation from grants]].&lt;ref&gt;An illustrative case is [[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]], [1986] A.C. 577, [1986] All E.R. 850 (H.L.). The opinion by [[Sydney Templeman, Baron Templeman|Lord Templeman]] in that case pointed out that an implied license might be negatived by express language, under principles of freedom of contract, but that was not so when non-derogation instead is involved: “The right cannot be withheld by the manufacturer of the car by contract with the first purchaser and cannot be withheld from any subsequent owner.” That is, the nature of property makes the right inherent and not a matter of freedom of contract. It is thus seen that the effect is comparable to the US license that is implied by operation of law.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both countries, the [[exhaustion doctrine]] has the effect of creating an implied license to use a product sold under the "authority" of the patentee. It is controversial whether and to what extent contractual expedients can successfully limit the scope of such implied licenses.

==Express license==
The opposite of an implied license is an ''express license'', which, for some forms of intellectual property, must be in writing. Oral exclusive licenses were permitted, however, under US copyright law before 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90, 108 (2d Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Oral nonexclusive copyright licenses remain valid under US law.&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent v. City Colleges of Chicago, 485 F.3d 919, 922 (7th Cir. 2007); Bateman v. Mnemonics, Inc., 79 F.3d 1532, 1538 n.12 (11th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Patent licenses may be oral.&lt;ref&gt;Waymark Corp. v. Porta Systems Corp., 334 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Enzo APA &amp; Son v. Geapag A.G., 134 F.3d 1090, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Licenses under the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act]] must be in writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap9.html#903  Section 903(b)] of the Act, 17 U.S.C. § 903(b), provides: "The owner of the exclusive rights in a mask work may transfer all of those rights, or license all or less than all of those rights, by any written instrument signed by such owner or a duly authorized agent of the owner."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Baptiste Dubos''' ({{IPA-fr|dybo|lang}}; 14 December 1670 – 23 March 1742), also referred to as '''l'[[Abbé]] Du Bos''', was a French author.
[[Image:du bos.jpg|right|L'Abbé Dubos]]

==Life==
Dubos was born in [[Beauvais]]. After studying theology, he gave it up in favour of public law and politics. He was employed by M. de Torcy, minister of foreign affairs, and by the regent and Cardinal Dubois in several secret missions, in which he acquitted himself with great success. He was rewarded with a pension and other advantages. Having obtained these, he retired from political life and devoted himself to history and literature. He gained such distinction as an author that in 1720 he was elected a member of the [[Académie française]], of which, in 1723, he was appointed perpetual secretary in succession to [[André Dacier]]. He died in Paris, repeating the remark, "Death is a law, not a punishment."

==Works==

Dubos' first work was ''L'Histoire des quatre Gordiens prouvée et illustrée par des médailles'' (Paris, 1695), which, in spite of its ingenuity, did not succeed in convincing most people. At the beginning of the war of 1701 he was charged with different negotiations (both in the [[Netherlands]] and England). In an attempt to persuade those countries to adopt a policy of peace, he published a work entitled ''Les Intéréts de l'Angleterre mal entendus dans la guerre présente'' (Amsterdam, 1703). This work contained indiscreet disclosures and predictions that were not fulfilled. The enemy took advantage of the work, and a wag took occasion to remark that the title ought to be read thus: ''Les Intérêts de l'Angleterre mal entendus par l'abbé Dubos''. It is remarkable as containing a distinct prophecy of the revolt of the American colonies from Great Britain.

Dubos' next work was ''L'Histoire de la Ligue de Cambray'' (Paris, 1709, 1728 and 1785, 2 vols.), a full, clear and interesting history, commended by [[Voltaire]]. In 1734 he published his ''Histoire critique de l'établissement de la monarchie française dans les Gaules'' (3 vols. 4to)--a work the object of which was to prove that the Franks had entered Gaul, not as conquerors, but at the request of the nation, which, according to him, had called them in to govern it. This system, though unfolded with a degree of skill and ability that, at first, procured many zealous partisans, was attacked by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] at the end of the thirtieth book of the ''Esprit des lois''.

Dubos' ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'', published for the first time in 1719 (2 vols, but often reprinted in three volumes), constitute one of the works in which the theory of the arts is explained with the utmost sagacity and discrimination. Like his history of the [[League of Cambray]], it was highly praised by [[Voltaire]]. The work was rendered more remarkable by the fact that its author had no practical acquaintance with any one of the arts whose principles he discussed. Besides the works above enumerated, a manifesto of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria]], against the [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Leopold]] (relative to the succession in Spain) has been attributed to Dubos from the excellence of the style.

==Excerpts==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[O]ne of the greatest wants of man is to have his mind incessantly occupied. The heaviness which quickly attends the inactivity of the mind, is a situation so very disagreeable to man, that he frequently chooses to expose himself to the most painful excesses, rather than be troubled with it." ''Critical Reflections'', I. I&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''José Guilherme Merquior''' (April 22, 1941 &amp;ndash; January 7, 1991) was a Brazilian diplomat, academic, writer, literary critic and philosopher.

==Biography==
He was a prolific writer, and member of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras]] (the Brazilian Academy of Letters). He had a doctorate in sociology from the [[London School of Economics]], which was directed by [[Ernest Gellner]]. Merquior also studied under [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] (whose ideas Merquior would largely repudiate in ''From Prague to Paris''), and took guidance from the likes of [[Raymond Aron]], [[Harry Levin]], and [[Arnaldo Momigliano]]. He published books written directly in French, English, Italian, and his native Portuguese.

Merquior divided his published works in two segments. In one the bulk was criticism ''per se''; in the other the emphasis was the [[history of ideas]], or more specific investigations like the highly esteemed study of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Max Weber]]. Two of his books, ''[[Foucault (Merquior book)|Foucault]]'' (1985), an often scathing critique of [[Michel Foucault]] for the [[Fontana Modern Masters]] series, and ''[[Western Marxism (book)|Western Marxism]]'' (1986), were described as "minor classics" by scholar Gregory R. Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Gregory R. "[http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/17/rp_17_11.pdf Without Sense or Reference]", review of Merquior's ''From Prague to Paris: A Critique of Structuralist and Post-Structuralist Thought.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Merquior was a major supporter of the [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] government and wrote many of Collor's public speeches. He died of cancer in January 1991, before Collor's downfall in 1992.

'''Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz''' (12 December 1890 – 12 April 1963) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] and [[logician]], a prominent figure in the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]]. He originated many novel ideas in [[semantics]]. Among these was [[categorial grammar]], a highly flexible framework for the analysis of natural language syntax and (indirectly) semantics that remains a major influence on work in [[formal linguistics]]. Ajdukiewicz's fields of research were [[model theory]] and the [[philosophy of science]].

==Biography==
Ajdukiewicz was born in 1890 in Tarnopol in [[Galicia_(Eastern_Europe)|Galicia]], which at that time, due to [[Partitions of Poland]], was annexed by [[Austria-Hungary]] ([[Austrian_Partition|The Austrian Partition]]). His father was a senior civil servant. Ajdukiewicz studied at the [[University of Lwów]], and lectured there, as well as in Warsaw and in Poznań. He received his PhD degree with the thesis on [[Kant]]'s philosophy of space. He was Rector of the University of Poznań from 1948 to 1952. He was one of the founders of the journal [[Studia Logica]] in its current incarnation, editing it from 1953 to his death.

==Work==
In his early epistemological system, which he called Radical Conventionalism, Ajdukiewicz analyzed any [[language]] as a set of expressions or sentences, with inferential ''rules of meaning'' that specify the relation of one expression to another, or to external data. There are three kinds of rules: Axiomatic, Deductive, and Empirical. Following the rules, one can map all knowable sentences of a language. However, some languages' vocabularies can produce ''disconnected'' sentences, which are only partly mapped by the ''meaning rules''. Therefore, when one uses a language, even scientific one, a ''conceptual apparatus'', an untranslatable set of meanings, is needed too, and with it a choice of the problems to be settled. For this reason the theory is a form of [[Conventionalism]], and it is radical because even simple experiential reports are exposed to these language-wide considerations. Ajdukiewicz discarded this theory as the 1930s progressed.

'''Kim Stanley Robinson''' (born March 23, 1952) is an American writer of [[science fiction]]. He has published nineteen novels and numerous short stories but is best known for his [[Mars trilogy|''Mars'' trilogy]]. His work has been translated into 24 languages. Many of his novels and stories have ecological, cultural, and political themes running through them and feature scientists as heroes. Robinson has won numerous awards, including the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]], the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] and the [[World Fantasy Award]]. Robinson's work has been labeled by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' as "the gold-standard of realistic, and highly literary, science-fiction writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In 300 Years, Kim Stanley Robinson's Science Fiction May Not Be Fiction|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/04/in-300-years-kim-stanley-robinsons-science-fiction-may-not-be-fiction/274392/|accessdate = 2015-09-08|first = Scott|last = Beauchamp|date = April 1, 2013|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Robinson is "generally acknowledged as one of the greatest living science-fiction writers."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Kreider|first1 = Tim|title = Our Greatest Political Novelist?|url = http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/our-greatest-political-novelist|accessdate = September 6, 2015|work= The New Yorker|date = December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Robinson was born in [[Waukegan, Illinois]]. He moved to [[Southern California]] as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Adams|first1 = John Joseph|title = Sci-Fi Scribes on Ray Bradbury: 'Storyteller, Showman and Alchemist'|url = https://www.wired.com/2012/06/ray-bradbury-writer-memories/|website = Wired|accessdate = September 4, 2015|date = June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, he earned a B.A. in literature from the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="uctv.tv"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Potts|first1 = Stephen|title = UCSD Guestbook: Kim Stanley Robinson|url = http://www.uctv.tv/shows/UCSD-Guestbook-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-5001|website = UCTV|publisher = University of California Television|accessdate = September 5, 2015|date = July 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he earned an M.A. in English from [[Boston University]].

==Career==
In 1978 Robinson moved to [[Davis, California]] to take a break from his graduate studies at UC San Diego. During this time he worked as a bookseller for Orpheus Books. He also taught freshman composition and other courses at [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref name="The Davis Enterprise"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hudsen |first1=Jeff |title=Davis a perfect fit for a sci-fi novelist |url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2004/10/18/news/074new1.txt |archive-url=https://archive.is/20041122040616/http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2004/10/18/news/074new1.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 22, 2004 |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |publisher=The Davis Enterprise |date=October 18, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 Robinson earned a Ph.D. in English from the UC San Diego.&lt;ref name="uctv.tv"/&gt; His initial Ph.D. advisor was literary critic and [[Marxism|Marxist]] scholar, [[Fredric Jameson]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; who told Robinson to read works by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Jameson described Dick to Robinson as "the greatest living American writer."&lt;ref name="uctv.tv"/&gt; Robinson's doctoral thesis, ''The Novels of [[Philip K. Dick]]'', was published in 1984 and a hardcover version was published by UMI Research Press. In the 1980s Robinson also spent time with a [[National Science Foundation]] team at a research base in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/09/mars-pd/569668/ |quote=In the 1980s, he told me, a team from the National Science Foundation was sent to a research base in Antarctica with a single handgun for the entire crew. |title=How Will Police Solve Murders on Mars? |first=Geoff |last=Manaugh |date=September 14, 2018 |publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''Time Magazine'' named Robinson a "Hero of the Environment" for his optimistic focus on the future.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Morton|first1 = Oliver|title = Heroes of the Environment 2008|url = http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1841778_1841779_1841803,00.html|accessdate = September 6, 2015|publisher = Time Magazine|date = September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Robinson was an instructor at the [[Clarion Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Doctorow|first1 = Cory|title = Clarion science fiction/fantasy workshop instructors announced|url = http://boingboing.net/2008/12/08/clarion-science-fict.html|website = Boingboing|publisher = Boinboing|accessdate = September 6, 2015|date = December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was the guest of honor at the 68th [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], held in [[Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Howell|first1 = John|title = 68th World Science Fiction Convention Australia 2010: Kim Stanley Robinson Guest|url = http://sciencefictionworld.com/books/science-fiction-books/363-68th-world-science-fiction-convention-australia-2010-kim-stanley-robinson-guest.html|website = SFW|publisher = SFW|accessdate = September 6, 2015|date = May 18, 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151009233205/http://sciencefictionworld.com/books/science-fiction-books/363-68th-world-science-fiction-convention-australia-2010-kim-stanley-robinson-guest.html|archivedate = October 9, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Robinson presented at the second annual Rethinking Capitalism conference, held at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Pittman|first1 = Jennifer|title = Rethinking Capitalism conference at UCSC to examine the cost of sustaining a fragile system|url = http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/general-news/20110402/rethinking-capitalism-conference-at-ucsc-to-examine-the-cost-of-sustaining-a-fragile-system|accessdate = September 6, 2015|publisher = Santa Cruz Sentinel News|date = April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other points made, his talk addressed the cyclical nature of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://rethinkingcapitalism.ucsc.edu/conferences/2011-conference|title = Bruce Initiative on Rethinking Capitalism  &amp;#124;  2011 Conference|accessdate = April 26, 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110826024426/http://rethinkingcapitalism.ucsc.edu/conferences/2011-conference|archivedate = August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was appointed Muir Environmental Fellow in 2011 by the John Muir College, University of California San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iannuzzi|first1=Giulia|title=Science, Engagement, Estrangement:Remarks on Kim Stanley Robinson’s Californian Ecotopia|url=http://www.openstarts.units.it/dspace/bitstream/10077/11636/1/AISNA_Iannuzzi.pdf|website=EUT|publisher=EUT – Edizioni Università di Trieste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==

===Nature and culture===
[[Sheldon Brown (artist)|Sheldon Brown]] described Robinson's novels as ways to explore how nature and culture continuously reformulate one another; ''[[Three Californias Trilogy]]'' as California in the future; Washington DC undergoing the impact of climate change in the ''Science in the Capitol'' series; or Mars as a stand-in for Earth in the ''Mars'' trilogy to think about re-engineering on a global scale, both social and natural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Brown|first1 = Sheldon|title = The Literary Imagination with Jonathan Lethem and Kim Stanley Robinson|url = http://www.uctv.tv/shows/The-Literary-Imagination-with-Jonathan-Lethem-and-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-24943|website = UCTV|publisher = University of California Television|accessdate = September 5, 2015|location = 5:00|date = July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological sustainability===
Virtually all of Robinson's novels have an ecological component; sustainability is one of his primary themes (a strong contender for the primary theme would be the nature of a plausible utopia.) The ''Orange County'' trilogy is about the way in which the technological intersects with the natural, highlighting the importance of keeping the two in balance. In the ''Mars'' trilogy, one of the principal divisions among the population of Mars is based on dissenting views on [[terraforming]]. Colonists debate whether or not the barren Martian landscape has a similar ecological or spiritual value when compared with a living ecosphere like earth's. ''[[Forty Signs of Rain]]'' has an entirely ecological thrust, taking [[global warming]] for its principal subject.

===Economic and social justice===
[[File:Kim stanley robinson-bookfair.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Author speaking at the Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair.|Kim Stanley Robinson speaking at the [[Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair]] on the social themes of his work.]]
Robinson's work often explores alternatives to modern [[capitalism]]. In the ''Mars'' trilogy, it is argued that capitalism is an outgrowth of [[feudalism]], which could be replaced in the future by a more [[Economic democracy|democratic economic system]]. [[Worker cooperative|Worker ownership]] and [[cooperative]]s figure prominently in ''Green Mars'' and ''Blue Mars'' as replacements for traditional corporations. The ''Orange County'' trilogy explores similar arrangements; ''Pacific Edge'' includes the idea of attacking the legal framework behind corporate domination to promote social [[egalitarianism]]. Tim Kreider writes in the ''New Yorker'' that Robinson may be our greatest political novelist and describes how Robinson uses the ''Mars'' trilogy as a template for a credible utopia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Robinson's work often portrays characters struggling to preserve and enhance the world around them in an environment characterized by [[individualism]] and [[entrepreneurialism]], often facing the political and economic [[authoritarianism]] of corporate power acting in this environment. Robinson has been described as anti-capitalist, and his work often portrays a form of [[frontier]] capitalism that promotes egalitarian ideals that closely resemble [[Socialism|socialist]] systems, but faced with a capitalism that is maintained by entrenched hegemonic corporations. In particular, his Martian Constitution draws upon [[social democracy|social democratic]] ideals explicitly emphasizing a community-participation element in political and economic life.&lt;ref&gt;''Some Worknotes and Commentary on the Constitution by Charlotte Dorsa-Brevia,'' in ''The Martians'' pp. 233–239&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's works often portray the worlds of tomorrow in a manner similar to the mythologized [[American frontier|American Western frontier]], showing a sentimental affection for the freedom and wildness of the frontier. This aesthetic includes a preoccupation with competing models of political and economic organization.

The environmental, economic, and social themes in Robinson's [[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]] stand in marked contrast to the [[libertarian science fiction|right-libertarian science fiction]] prevalent in much of the genre ([[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Poul Anderson]], [[Larry Niven]], and [[Jerry Pournelle]] being prominent examples), and his work has been called the most successful attempt to reach a mass audience with a [[left wing]] and anti-capitalist utopian vision since [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s 1974 novel, ''[[The Dispossessed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raintaxi.com/utopic-fiction-and-the-mars-novels-of-kim-stanley-robinson/ |title=Utopic Fiction and the Mars Novels of Kim Stanley Robinson |website=Raintaxi|last=Smith |first= Jeremy |year=2001 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists as heroes===
Robinson's work often features scientists as heroes. They are portrayed in a mundane way compared to most work featuring scientists: rather than being adventurers or action heroes, Robinson's scientists become critically important because of research discoveries, networking and collaboration with other scientists, political lobbying, or becoming public figures. Robinson captures the joy of scientists as they work at something they care about.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Mars Trilogy|''Mars'' trilogy]] and ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'' rely heavily on the idea that scientists must take responsibility for ensuring public understanding and responsible use of their discoveries. Robinson's scientists often emerge as the best people to direct public policy on important environmental and technological questions, of which politicians are often ignorant.

===Climate change and global warming===
In 2017, in the novel ''New York 2140'' Robinson explored the themes of climate change and global warming, setting the novel in the year 2140 when the New York City he imagines is beset by a 50-foot sea level rise that half-submerges the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/utopia-in-the-time-of-trump//|work=Los Angeles Review of Books (LARB)|title=Utopia in the Time of Trump|last=Canavan|first= Gerry|year=2017 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1982, Robinson married Lisa Howland Nowell, an [[environmental chemist]]. They have two sons. Robinson has lived in Washington, D.C., California, and during some of the 1980s, in [[Switzerland]]. At times, Robinson was a stay-at-home dad.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Bioneers|title=Kim Stanley Robinson – Rethinking Our Relationship to the Biosphere {{!}} Bioneers|date=2015-11-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=489I0gZlepM|accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He now lives in [[Davis, California]] in a [[cohousing]] community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Robinson has described himself as an avid backpacker with the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] serving as his home range and a big influence on how he sees the world.&lt;ref name="The Davis Enterprise" /&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Shyama Charan Lahiri''' ({{lang-bn|শ্যামাচরণ লাহিড়ী}}) (30 September 1828 &amp;ndash; 26 September 1895), best known as '''Lahiri Mahasaya''', was an Indian [[yoga|yogi]], [[guru]] and a disciple of [[Mahavatar Babaji]]. He was also popularly known as ''Yogiraj'' and ''Kashi Baba''. He revived the yogic science of [[Kriya Yoga]] when he learned it from [[Mahavatar Babaji]] in 1861. Lahiri Mahasaya was also the [[guru]] of [[Yukteswar Giri]]. ''Mahasaya'' is a [[Sanskrit]], spiritual title translated as 'large-minded'.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa (1997).

Self-Realization Fellowship (Founded by Yogananda) http://www.yogananda-srf.org/. {{ISBN|0-87612-086-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was unusual among Indian holy people in that he was a [[Grihastha|householder]] &amp;mdash; marrying, raising a family, and working as an accountant for the Military Engineering Department of the British Indian government. Lahiri lived with his family in [[Varanasi]] rather than in a temple or monastery. He achieved a substantial reputation among 19th century [[Hindu]] religionists.

He became known in the West through [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], a disciple of Yukteswar Giri, and through Yogananda's ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''. Yogananda wrote that Lahiri was chosen by Mahavatar Babaji to reintroduce the lost practice of Kriya Yoga to the world. Lahiri's disciples included both of Yogananda's parents as well as Yogananda's own guru. Lahiri Mahasaya prophesied that the infant Yogananda would become a [[yoga|yogi]], and "As a spiritual engine, he will carry many souls to God's kingdom.'"&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;
[[Trailanga Swami]], the famous saint of India, had praised Lahiri Mahasaya in the following words, “Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect Self-realization which I have sought by renouncing everything – even my loincloth!”&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 31: An Interview with the Sacred Mother, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==

===Early life===
Lahiri was born into a Brahmin family in the Ghurni village (presently a neighbourhood of [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]] town) in [[Nadia district]] of Bengal Province. He was the youngest son of Muktakashi, wife of Gaur Mohan Lahiri. His mother died when he was a child &amp;mdash; there is very little known about her, except that she was a devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. At the age of three or four, he was often seen sitting in meditation, with his body buried in the sand up to his neck. When Lahiri was five, the family's ancestral home was lost in a flood, so the family moved to [[Varanasi]], where he would spend most of his life.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

As a child, he studied Urdu and Hindi, gradually moving on to Bengali, Sanskrit, Persian, French and English at the Government Sanskrit College, along with study of the Vedas. Reciting the Vedas, bathing in the Ganges, and worship were part of his daily routine.&lt;ref name=satyananda/&gt;

In 1846, he was married to Srimati Kashi Moni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography%20of%20a%20Yogi/Chapter%2031|title =An Interview with the Sacred Mother (Kashi Moni Lahiri) |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, Tincouri and Ducouri, and three daughters, Harimoti, Harikamini and Harimohini. His two sons were considered saints. His wife became his disciple and was affectionately called by Guru Ma. His work as an accountant in the Military Engineering Department of the English government took him all over India. After the death of his father, he took on the role of supporting the entire family in Varanasi.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

===Teacher of Kriya Yoga===
[[File:Sriyukteswar.jpg|140px|right|thumb|Yukteswar Giri&lt;br&gt;disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya]]
In 1861, Lahiri was transferred to [[Ranikhet]], in the foothills of the Himalayas. One day, while walking in the hills, he heard a voice calling to him. After climbing further, he met his Guru [[Mahavatar Babaji]], who initiated him into the techniques of [[Kriya Yoga]]. Babaji told Lahiri that the rest of his life was to be given to spreading the Kriya message.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

Soon after, Lahiri Mahasaya returned to Varanasi, where he began initiating sincere seekers into the path of Kriya Yoga. Over time, more and more people flocked to receive the teachings of Kriya from Lahiri. He organized many study groups and gave regular discourses on the Bhagavad Gita at his "Gita Assemblies." He freely gave Kriya initiation to those of every faith, including Hindus, Muslims, and Christians, at a time when caste bigotry was very strong. He encouraged his students to adhere to the tenets of their own faith, adding the Kriya techniques to what they already were practicing.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;

He continued his dual role of accountant and supporter to his family, and a teacher of Kriya Yoga, until 1886, when he was able to retire on a pension. More and more visitors came to see him at this time. He seldom left his sitting room, available to all who sought his ''[[Darśana|darshan]]''. He often exhibited the breathless state of [[Higher consciousness|superconscious]] ''[[samādhi]]''.

Over the years he gave initiation to gardeners, postmen, kings, maharajas, sannyasis, householders, people considered to be lower caste, Christians, and Muslims.&lt;ref name=satyananda/&gt; At that time, it was unusual for a strict Brahmin to associate so closely with people from all castes.

Some of his notable disciples included [[Panchanan Bhattacharya]], [[Yukteswar Giri]], Pranabananda, [[Keshavananda Brahmachari]], Bhupendranath Sanyal and the parents of Paramahansa Yogananda. Others who received initiation into Kriya Yoga from Lahiri included Bhaskarananda Saraswati of Benares, Balananda Brahmachari of Deogarh, Maharaja Iswari Narayan Sinha Bahadur of Benares and his son.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=purana/&gt;

Biographer and Yogacharya Dr. Ashoke Kumar Chatterjee, in his book "Purana Purusha" depicts that Lahiri initiated [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]] into Kriya Yoga, based on a passage in Lahiri's 26 secret diary.&lt;ref&gt;Lahiri's diary referred to a "Saidasbaba" who he initiated into Kriya Yoga. The author of the biography says that "during Lahiri Mahasaya's lifetime, Saidasbaba of Shirdi's name finds mention, and not any other Saibaba." Chatterjee, Ashoke Kumar, ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri''. Yogiraj Publications, 2004. {{ISBN|81-87563-01-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave permission to one disciple, Panchanan Bhattacharya, to start an institution in [[Kolkata]] to spread the teachings of Kriya Yoga. The Arya Mission Institution published commentaries by Lahiri on the Bhagavad Gita, along with other spiritual books, including a Bengali translation of the Gita. Lahiri himself had printed thousands of small books with excerpted passages from the Gita, in Bengali and Hindi, and distributed them for free, an unusual idea at that time.&lt;ref name=satyananda/&gt;

In 1895 he began gathering his disciples, letting some of them know that he would soon be leaving the body. Moments before his passing, he said simply, "I am going home. Be comforted; I shall rise again." He then turned his body around three times, faced north, and consciously left his body, entering ''[[mahasamadhi]]''. Lahiri Mahasaya died on 26 September 1895, four days before turning 67.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; He was cremated according to Hindu Brahmin rites at [[Manikarnika Ghat]] in Varanasi.

==Teachings==

===Kriya Yoga===
The central spiritual practice which he taught to his disciples was [[Kriya Yoga]], a series of inner [[pranayama]] practices that quickly hasten the spiritual growth of the practitioner. He taught this technique to all sincere seekers, regardless of their religious background. In response to many types of problems that disciples would bring him, his advice would be the same &amp;mdash; to practice more Kriya Yoga.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;
Regarding Kriya Yoga, he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Always remember that you belong to no one, and no one belongs to you. Reflect that some day you will suddenly have to leave everything in this world–so make the acquaintanceship of God now. Prepare yourself for the coming astral journey of death by daily riding in the balloon of God-perception. Through delusion you are perceiving yourself as a bundle of flesh and bones, which at best is a nest of troubles. Meditate unceasingly, that you may quickly behold yourself as the Infinite Essence, free from every form of misery. Cease being a prisoner of the body; using the secret key of Kriya, learn to escape into Spirit.&lt;ref name=yogananda&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa, ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-56589-212-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He taught that Kriya practice would give the yogi direct experience of truth, unlike mere theoretical discussion of the scriptures, and to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Solve all your problems through meditation. Exchange unprofitable religious speculations for actual God-contact. Clear your mind of dogmatic theological debris; let in the fresh, healing waters of direct perception. Attune yourself to the active inner Guidance; the Divine Voice has the answer to every dilemma of life. Though man’s ingenuity for getting himself into trouble appears to be endless, the Infinite Succor is no less resourceful.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Guru-disciple relationship===
Lahiri often spoke of the [[Guru-shishya tradition|Guru-disciple relationship]] in the context of [[Kriya Yoga]]. He always gave the Kriya technique as an initiation,&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; and taught that the technique was only properly learned as part of the Guru-disciple relationship.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=purana/&gt; Frequently he referred to the realization that comes through practicing Kriya as taught by the Guru, and the grace that comes through the 'transmission' of the Guru.&lt;ref name=gita&gt;[http://www.yoganiketan.net Mahasaya, Yogiraj Sri Sri Shyamacharan Lahiri, ''Srimad Bhagavad Gita: Sacred Essential and Spiritual Commentary''. Yoga Niketan] 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught that the grace of the Guru comes automatically if his instructions are followed.&lt;ref name=purana/&gt; He suggested contacting the Guru during meditation, counseling that it wasn't always necessary to see his physical form.&lt;ref name=purana/&gt;

Regarding the necessity of the help of a Guru to deep yoga practice, he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is absolutely necessary for all devotees to totally surrender to their Guru. The more one can surrender to the Guru, the more he can ascertain the subtlest of the subtle techniques of yoga from his Guru. Without surrender, nothing can be derived from the Guru.&lt;ref name=purana/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relationship Lahiri Mahasaya had with his own disciples was very individual. He even varied the way he taught the Kriya Yoga practice to each disciple, depending on their individual spiritual needs.&lt;ref name=garland&gt;[http://www.yoganiketan.net Mahasaya, Yogiraj Sri Sri Shyamacharan Lahiri, ''Garland of Letters: Correspondence Between Yogiraj Sri Sri Shyamacharan Lahiri Mahasaya and His Disciples''. Yoga Niketan], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other teachings===
Lahiri taught that if one is earning an honest living and practicing honesty, then there was no need to alter one's external life in any significant way in order to become aware of God's presence. If a student neglected his worldly duties, he would correct him.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; It was extremely rare for him to advise ''sannyas'', or complete worldly renunciation by becoming a swami. Instead, he advised marriage for most of his disciples along with [[Kriya Yoga]] practice.&lt;ref name=purana&gt;Chatterjee, Ashoke Kumar, ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri''. Yogiraj Publications, 2004. {{ISBN|81-87563-01-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He generally eschewed organized religion, but he allowed at least one advanced disciple, [[Panchanan Bhattacharya]], to open the "Arya Mission Institution" in [[Kolkata]] to spread Kriya teachings.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt;&lt;ref name=satyananda/&gt; Other disciples of Lahiri also started organizations to spread the Kriya Yoga message, including [[Yukteswar Giri]] with his ''Satsanga Sabha.''&lt;ref name=satyananda&gt;[[Satyananda Giri]], ''Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasay'', from ''A Collection of Biographies of 4 Kriya Yoga Gurus'', iUniverse Inc. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-595-38675-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, he preferred Kriya to spread naturally.&lt;ref name=purana/&gt;

Lahiri frequently taught the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. His regular Gita assemblies, called ''Gita Sabha'', attracted many disciples.&lt;ref name=satyananda/&gt; He asked several of his close disciples to write interpretations of the Gita by tuning in to his own realization.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; Lahiri taught that the [[Battle of Kurukshetra]] was really an inner psychological battle, and that the different characters in the battle were actually psychological traits within the struggling yogi.&lt;ref name=yogananda/&gt; This understanding would later become the foundation of Paramahansa Yogananda's commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita "[[Bhagavad Gita (Yogananda)|''God Talks with Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita'']]".&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa: ''God Talks with Arjuna, The Bhagavad Gita, Royal Science of God-Realization,'' Self-Realization Fellowship 2001, {{ISBN|0-87612-031-1}} (paperback) {{ISBN|0-87612-030-3}} (hardcover) Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught that the epic story of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' showed the soul's descent into matter, and its challenges in retracing its way back to spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa: ''God Talks with Arjuna, The Bhagavad Gita, Royal Science of God-Realization,'' Self-Realization Fellowship 2001, {{ISBN|0-87612-031-1}} (paperback) {{ISBN|0-87612-030-3}} (hardcover).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Law Society of Ontario''' ('''LSO'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Barreau de l'Ontario'') is the [[law society]] responsible for the self-regulation of [[lawyers]] and [[paralegals]] in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]]. Founded in 1797 as '''The Law Society of Upper Canada''' ('''LSUC'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Barreau du Haut-Canada''), the society adopted its current name after a majority vote by its governing body in November 2017.&lt;ref name="gazette name change"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lawsocietygazette.ca/news/convocation-votes-to-change-name/|title=Convocation votes to change name to "Law Society of Ontario"|date=November 2, 2017|work=The Gazette|publisher=The Law Society of Upper Canada|access-date=November 3, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was formalized on May 8, 2018 by amendment to provincial legislation.&lt;ref name="name change now official" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Receipt for application to the Law Society of Upper Canada issued to John A. Macdonald, February 5, 1836.jpg|thumb|left|Receipt dated February 5, 1836 for application to the Law Society of Upper Canada issued to [[John A. Macdonald]], the future first Prime Minister of Canada]]  
The Law Society was created in 1797 to regulate the legal profession in the [[British North America|British colony]] of [[Upper Canada]] and is the oldest self-governing body in North America.&lt;ref name=post&gt;http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/it-doesnt-have-the-dignity-law-society-of-upper-canada-considers-changing-anachronistic-name&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ufKMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT389&amp;dq=The+Law+Society+of+Upper+Canada+1797&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipocCThZrQAhXFQyYKHXNWAysQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Law%20Society%20of%20Upper%20Canada%201797&amp;f=false|title=The Law Society of Upper Canada and Ontario's Lawyers, 1797-1997|last=Moore|first=Christopher|date=2015-02-01|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442655942|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first home was at Wilson's Hotel at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake), then from 1799 to 1832 at various temporary locations at York (Toronto) until [[Osgoode Hall]] was built.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsuc.on.ca/with.aspx?id=1052&lt;/ref&gt; The Law Society has continued to retain its original name, even though Upper Canada ceased to exist as a political entity in 1841. The Society governed the legal profession in the coterminous [[Canada West]] from 1841 to 1867, and in [[Ontario]] since [[Canadian confederation|confederation]] in 1867.

The Law Society of Upper Canada's creation by an act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] came some 20 years before the earliest such self-governing association in any other Canadian province or territory. Its creation was an innovation in the English-speaking world, and it became the model for [[law societies]] across [[Canada]] and the United States. It is one of the oldest law societies in the English-speaking world.

In 1994, the Law Society affirmed its role by adopting this Role Statement: "The Law Society of Upper Canada exists to govern the legal profession in the public interest by ensuring that the people of Ontario are served by lawyers who meet high standards of learning, competence and professional conduct, and upholding the independence, integrity and honour of the legal profession, for the purpose of advancing the cause of justice and the rule of law." 

The Law Society faced calls to change the name [[Upper Canada]]. Benchers have voted to drop the name and replace it with a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brean|first1=Joseph|title=Law Society to drop ‘Upper Canada’ from its name after report calls it elitist and offensive|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/law-society-to-drop-upper-canada|accessdate=November 6, 2017|work=National Post|date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star name change"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallant|first1=Jacques|title=Law Society of Upper Canada votes to scrap half its name|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/09/28/law-society-of-upper-canada-votes-to-scrap-half-its-name.html|accessdate=November 6, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=September 28, 2017|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 2017, the Society's governing body (Convocation) chose "Law Society of Ontario" as the new name.&lt;ref name="gazette name change" /&gt; The name change was made official following amendments to the ''Law Society Act'' as part of the 2018 provincial budget implementation bill.&lt;ref name="name change now official"&gt;{{cite news |title=Amendments to legislation make Law Society of Ontario name change official |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amendments-to-legislation-make-law-society-of-ontario-name-change-official-682107761.html |accessdate=June 18, 2018 |work=CNW Cision |date=May 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Governing Legislation"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90l08#BK5/|title=Law Society Act, RSO 1990, c L.8, s2(1)|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available sanctions range from admonitions to [[disbarment]]. It is based in [[Toronto]], at [[Osgoode Hall]].

Effective May 1, 2007, as a result of amendments to Ontario's ''Law Society Act'', the Law Society regulates more than 8,000 [[paralegal]] licensees in Ontario.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Paralegals are licensed to provide limited legal services, such as providing representation before provincial tribunals.

=== Tribunal decisions ===
The [https://lawsocietytribunal.ca/ Law Society Tribunal] is an independent adjudicative tribunal within the Law Society of Ontario that processes, hears and decides regulatory cases about Ontario lawyers and paralegals.&lt;ref&gt;https://lawsocietytribunal.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally created on March 12, 2014 to improve the Law Society’s hearing process. The Tribunal’s core values are fairness, quality, transparency and timeliness. It decides a variety of kinds of cases, including alleged misconduct by lawyers and paralegals, whether applicants to be lawyers and paralegals have the required good character to be granted a licence, and alleged incapacity due to health reasons.
 
Tribunal adjudicators, who include benchers and other lawyer, paralegal and lay appointees, are tasked with coming to decisions that are fair, just and in the public interest. [https://lawsocietytribunal.ca/Pages/Orders.aspx Orders], [https://lawsocietytribunal.ca/Pages/Mainpage.aspx#133 upcoming hearings], and [https://www.canlii.org/en/ reasons for decisions] are all publicly available.
 
David A. Wright is the current Chair of the Law Society Tribunal. Vice-Chairs are Raj Anand (Hearing Division) and Christopher D. Bredt (Appeal Division).

== Treasurer ==
{{See also|List of Treasurers of the Law Society of Upper Canada}}

The Law Society is headed by a [[Treasurer]]. He or she is selected by the benchers, who comprise "Convocation" – in effect, the Society's [[board of directors]], as the Society is an Ontario Corporation without share capital. All lawyer-benchers are elected by the Society's members, and eight lay benchers are appointed by the provincial government. The current Treasurer is [[Malcolm M. Mercer]] (elected on June 28, 2018),&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/malcolm-m-mercer-elected-treasurer-of-the-law-society-of-ontario-686832331.html |title= Malcolm M.

Section 12(2) of the ''Law Society Act'', R.S.O. 1990, provides that the [[Attorney General of Ontario]] is a bencher of Convocation, while section 13(1) provides that the Attorney General is the "Guardian of the Public Interest" and, as such, may require the production of any document or thing possessed by the regulator. The regulator falls under the supervision of the Ministry of the Attorney General, according to the ministry's web site.

As of 2018, the Law Society has more than 600 staff. It is frequently named one of [[Greater Toronto's Top Employers]] by Mediacorp Canada Inc., most recently in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-law-society-of-upper-canada|title=Reasons for Selection, 2018 Greater Toronto's Top Employers Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was recognized from a young age as being developed in both the theory ([[Abhidharma]]) and practice of Buddhism and so was revered as being scholarly.&lt;ref name="insight"&gt;{{cite web|last=Braun|first=Erik|title=
The Many Lives of Insight: The Abhidhamma and transformations in Theravada meditation|url=http://bulletin.hds.harvard.edu/articles/winterspring2016/many-lives-insight|publisher=[[Harvard Divinity School]]|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many books on [[Dhamma]] in Burmese and these were accessible even to a serious lay person, hence he was responsible for spreading Dhamma to all levels of society and reviving the traditional practice of [[vipassana]] [[meditation]], making it more available for renunciates and lay people alike.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt;

==Biography==
Sayadaw began his studies at age 20 in [[Mandalay]] at Thanjaun.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; While there he was considered to be a bright and ambitious young monk&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; but his work was scholarly; there is no evidence that Sayadaw engaged in a serious meditation practice during his years in Mandalay.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; Leaving Mandalay after a great fire in 1883 caused the loss of his home and his written work to that time, Sayadaw returned to the village of his youth.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt;

Soon, Sayadaw founded a forest monastery in the "Ledi forest" and began practicing and teaching intensive meditation.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; It was from this monastery that he would take his name, Ledi Sayadaw, meaning "respected teacher of the Ledi forest."&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; In 1885, Ledi Sayadaw wrote the ''Nwa-myitta-sa'' ({{my|နွားမေတ္တာစာ}}), a poetic prose letter that argued that Burmese Buddhists should not kill cattle and eat beef, since Burmese farmers depended on them as beasts of burden to maintain their livelihoods, that the marketing of beef for human consumption threatened the extinction of buffalo and cattle and that the practice and was ecologically unsound.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Charney|first=Michael|title=A history of natural resources in Asia: the wealth of nature|editor=Greg Bankoff, P. Boomgaard|publisher=MacMillan|year=2007|pages=236–40|chapter=Demographic Growth, Agricultural Expansion and Livestock in the Lower Chindwin in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|isbn=978-1-4039-7736-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently led successful beef boycotts during the colonial era, despite the presence of beef eating among locals and influenced a generation of Burmese nationalists in adopting this stance.&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt;

In 1900, Sayadaw gave up control of the monastery and pursued more focused meditation in the mountain caves near the banks of the [[Chindwin River]].&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt;

At other times he traveled throughout Burma.&lt;ref name="lionsroar"/&gt; Because of his knowledge of ''pariyatti'' (theory), he was able to write many books on Dhamma in both Pali and Burmese languages such as, ''Paramattha-dipani'' (''Manual of Ultimate Truth''), ''Nirutta-dipani'', a book on Pali grammar and ''The Manuals of Dhamma''. At the same time he kept alive the pure tradition of ''patipatti'' (practice) by teaching the technique of Vipassana to a few people.

==Legacy==
Ledi Sayadaw was one of the foremost Burmese Buddhist figures of his age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahasi Sayadaw|author2= Steve Armstrong (editor)|title=Manual of Insight|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|page=xvii|year=2016|ISBN=978-1614292777}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in reviving the traditional practice of Vipassana, making it more available for renunciates and lay people alike.&lt;ref name="insight"/&gt; Many of his works are still available, including in English through the [[Buddhist Publication Society]].

Among Ledi's disciples, Theik-cha-daung Sayadaw(1871-1931) and Mohnyin Sayadaw(1872-1964) are well-known.&lt;ref name="insight"/&gt; Theik-cha-daung Sayadaw taught an illiterate farmer and layman [http://www.vridhamma.org/Teachers-1 Saya Thet Gyi], who would go on to receive training from Ledi himself.&lt;ref name="insight"/&gt; Thetgyi's lineage continues to the present, the most prominent being [[U Wunnathiri]] and [[U Ba Khin]] and his disciples, others include [[SN Goenka]].&lt;ref name="insight"/&gt;

In the 1970s, Mosher, then Chief of the newly formed Center for Schizophrenia Research, wrote a grant to obtain funding for a novel idea for treating people diagnosed with schizophrenia; an intensive psychosocial milieu-based  residential treatment known as the [[Soteria (psychiatric treatment)|Soteria]] Project. The results of the study were remarkable and showed that people with schizophrenia did in fact recover from the illness without the use of neuroleptics in a supportive home-like environment.&lt;ref name=Bola&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bola, John |author2=Mosher, Loren |title=Treatment of acute psychosis without neuroleptics: Two year outcomes from the Soteria Project|journal=[[The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]|date=April 2003|volume=191|issue=4|pages=219–229|url=http://psychrights.org/research/digest/effective/bolamosher03.pdf|pmid=12695732|doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000061148.84257.f9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressively vocal in his opposition to the prevailing psychiatric practices of the time and the increasing reliance on pharmaceuticals for treatment, Mosher managed to anger and isolate himself from many of his colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health, and was finally dismissed from his position in 1980.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt; Disillusioned with the field, he wrote a very public letter of resignation from the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in 1998, stating that "After nearly three decades as a member it is with a mixture of pleasure and disappointment that I submit this letter of resignation from the American Psychiatric Association. The major reason for this action is my belief that I am actually resigning from the American Psychopharmacological Association.

== Biography ==
Loren Mosher was born on September 3, 1933, in [[Monterey, California]], to the married couple of a teacher and boat builder.&lt;ref name="Redler"/&gt; He earned his [[undergraduate degree]] from [[Stanford University]] and his [[medical degree]] from [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref name="Aderhold"/&gt; starting work at NIMH in 1964.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt; He undertook research training at the [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London from 1966 to 1967 and developed an interest in alternative treatments for schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Lenzer"/&gt;

Before conceiving Soteria, Mosher supervised a ward in a psychiatric hospital at [[Yale University]] as its assistant professor, prescribed neuroleptics and was not “against” them. But by 1968, the year Mosher received the position of director of the Center for Schizophrenia Studies at the NIMH, he got convinced that benefits of neuroleptics were overhyped.&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert, Whitaker|title=Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill|location=Philadelphia|year=2002|pages=220–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDqxay6-51oC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=9780465020140|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house, known as [[Soteria (psychiatric treatment)|Soteria]], was opened in an area of [[San Jose, California]], in April 1971.&lt;ref name="Bentall"/&gt;{{rp|22}} Mosher believed that the violent and controlling atmosphere of psychiatric hospitals and the over-use of drugs hindered recovery. Despite its success (it achieved superior results than the standard medical treatment with drugs&lt;ref name=Calton2008&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Calton, Tim |author2=Ferriter, Michael |author3=Huband, Nick |author4=Spandler, Helen |title=A systematic review of the Soteria paradigm for the treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia|journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]]|volume=34|issue=1|pages=181–192|date=January 2008|pmid=17573357|pmc=2632384|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm047|url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/181.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the Soteria Project closed in 1983 when, according to Loren Mosher and [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]] further funding was denied because of the politics of psychiatry that was increasingly controlled by the influence of pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref name=video&gt;[http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/401 Video] of [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]] and Loren Mosher discussing the evidence for the Soteria model.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosher is said to have had a far more nuanced view of the use of [[drugs]] than has been generally thought, and did not reject drugs altogether but insisted they be used as a last resort and in far lower doses than usual in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lenzer"/&gt;

After dismissal from NIMH, he taught psychiatry at the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] and became the head of the public mental health system in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt; In Maryland, he started a crisis house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], McAuliffe House, based on Soteria principles.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt;

During the Ritalin phenomenon of the 1990s, he was often featured as a dissenting view in scores of articles. He was the founder and first editor in chief of ''[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]]''.&lt;ref name="Lenzer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woods, Angela|title=Rethinking "patient testimony" in the medical humanities: The case of ''Schizophrenia Bulletin''{{'}}s first person accounts|journal=Journal of Literature and Science|date=Winter 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=38–54|doi=10.12929/jls.06.1.03|issn=1754-646X|pmid=24563663|pmc=3928561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosher edited or co-authored some books, including ''Community Mental Health: A Practical Guide'', and published more than 100 reviews and articles.&lt;ref name="Redler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Google Scholar Citations"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DrY7ObYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en List of works on Google Scholar Citations]&lt;/ref&gt; He held professorships and ran mental health programmes on both the US coasts.&lt;ref name="Redler"/&gt; Mosher also headed his own consulting company, Soteria Associates, providing research, forensic and mental health consultation&lt;ref name="Redler"/&gt; and cooperated for years with numerous advocacy groups, including the psychiatric survivor group [[MindFreedom International]].&lt;ref name="Lenzer"/&gt; He wrote a preface to [[Peter Lehmann (author)|Peter Lehmann]]'s book ''Coming off Psychiatric Drugs'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jensen, Karl |author2=Lehmann, Peter |title=Coming off psychiatric drugs: Successful withdrawal from neuroleptics, antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine and tranquilizers|date=2004|location=Berlin|isbn=978-0-9545428-0-1|pages=15–17|publisher=Peter Lehmann Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he left Washington for San Diego.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt; He worked as a clinical professor of psychiatry for the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California]] at San Diego medical school.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt;

He was married to, and later divorced, Irene Carleton Mosher.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt;

At the time of his death, he was in Berlin for experimental cancer treatment.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt;

Among survivors are his wife, Judy Schreiber, three children from the first marriage, a granddaughter, and two brothers.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt;

'''Martin Buber''' ({{lang-he-n|מרטין בובר}}; {{lang-de|Martin Buber}}; {{lang-yi|מארטין בובער}}; February 8, 1878 –
June 13, 1965) was an Austrian-born Israeli [[Jewish people|Jewish]] [[philosopher]] best known for his [[philosophy of dialogue]], a form of [[existentialism]] centered on the distinction between the [[I and Thou|I–Thou]] relationship and the I–It relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.roberthsarkissian.com/iof/BUBER.HTM | title = Island of freedom | contribution = Buber}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Vienna]], Buber came from a family of observant Jews, but broke with Jewish custom to pursue secular studies in [[philosophy]]. In 1902, he became the editor of the weekly ''[[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'', the central organ of the [[Zionist]] movement, although he later withdrew from organizational work in Zionism. In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, ''[[I and Thou|Ich und Du]]'' (later translated into English as ''I and Thou''), and in 1925, he began translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into the [[German language]].

He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] ten times, and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1421|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Martin ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name: ''מָרְדֳּכַי,'' ''Mordechai'') Buber was born in [[Vienna]] to an Orthodox Jewish family. Buber was a direct descendant of the 16th-century rabbi [[Meir ben Isaac Katzenellenbogen|Meir Katzenellenbogen]], known as the Maharam of [[Padua]]. [[Karl Marx]] is another notable relative.&lt;ref name="unbroken" /&gt;After the divorce of his parents when he was three years old, he was raised by his grandfather in [[Lviv|Lvov]].&lt;ref name="unbroken"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rosenstein | first = Neil | title = The Unbroken Chain: Biographical Sketches and Genealogy of Illustrious Jewish Families from the 15th–20th Century | volume = 1, 2 | edition = revised | publisher = CIS | place = New York | year = 1990 | ISBN = 0-9610578-4-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, [[Solomon Buber]], was a scholar of [[Midrash]] and [[Rabbinic Literature]]. At home, Buber spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and German. In 1892, Buber returned to his father's house in Lemberg, today's [[Lviv]], Ukraine.

Despite Buber's connection to the [[Davidic line]] as a descendant of Katzenellenbogen, a personal religious crisis led him to break with Jewish [[Halakha|religious customs]]. He began reading [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name="Wood1969"&gt;{{cite book| first =Robert E | last = Wood|title=Martin Buber's Ontology: An Analysis of I and Thou |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJSCasqZ7iQC|date=1 December 1969|publisher= Northwestern University Press|isbn = 978-0-8101-0650-5 | page =5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two, in particular, inspired him to pursue studies in philosophy. In 1896, Buber went to study in Vienna (philosophy, [[art history]], German studies, [[philology]]).

In 1898, he joined the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, participating in congresses and organizational work. In 1899, while studying in [[Zürich]], Buber met his future wife, Paula Winkler, a "brilliant Catholic writer from a Bavarian peasant family"&lt;ref&gt;The Pity of It All: A History of Jews in Germany 1743-1933. P. 238. (2002) {{ISBN|0-8050-5964-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.tameri.com/csw/exist/buber.shtml |title=The Existential Primer |publisher=Tameri |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buber, initially, supported and celebrated the Great War as a 'world historical mission' for Germany along with Jewish intellectuals to civilize the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos. (2002). The Pity of It All: A History of Jews in Germany, 1743-1933. New York: Metropolitan Books. Henry Holt and Company.  pp. 318-319. {{ISBN|0-8050-5964-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], but resigned from his professorship in protest immediately after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933. He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews from public education. In 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in [[Jerusalem]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], receiving a professorship at [[Hebrew University]] and lecturing in [[anthropology]] and introductory [[sociology]].

Buber's wife Paula died in 1958, and he died at his home in the [[Talbiya]] neighborhood of Jerusalem on June 13, 1965. They had two children: a son, Rafael Buber, and a daughter, Eva Strauss-Steinitz.&lt;ref name="unbroken" /&gt;

== Major themes ==
Buber's evocative, sometimes poetic, writing style marked the major themes in his work: the retelling of [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] and Chinese tales, [[bible|Biblical]] commentary, and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] dialogue. A [[Cultural Zionism|cultural Zionist]], Buber was active in the Jewish and educational communities of Germany and [[Israel]].{{Sfn | Buber | 1996 | p = 92}} He was also a staunch supporter of a [[binational solution]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and, after the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel, of a regional federation of Israel and Arab states. His influence extends across the humanities, particularly in the fields of [[social psychology]], [[social philosophy]], and [[existentialism|religious existentialism]].{{Sfn | Buber | 1996 | p = 34}}

Buber's attitude toward [[Zionism]] was tied to his desire to promote a vision of "Hebrew humanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Schaeder| first= Grete| title= The Hebrew humanism of Martin Buber|year=1973|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location= Detroit|isbn= 0-8143-1483-X| page =11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Laurence J. Silberstein, the terminology of "Hebrew humanism" was coined to "distinguish [Buber's] form of [[nationalism]] from that of the official Zionist movement" and to point to how "Israel's problem was but a distinct form of the universal human problem. Accordingly, the task of Israel as a distinct nation was inexorably linked to the task of humanity in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Silberstein|first= Laurence J | title= Martin Buber's Social and Religious Thought: Alienation and the quest for meaning | year = 1989 | publisher =New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-7886-0|page = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zionist views ==
Approaching Zionism from his own personal viewpoint, Buber disagreed with [[Theodor Herzl]] about the political and cultural direction of Zionism. Herzl envisioned the goal of Zionism in a nation-state, but did not consider [[Jewish culture]] or religion necessary. In contrast, Buber believed the potential of Zionism was for social and spiritual enrichment. For example, Buber argued that following the formation of the Israeli state, there would need to be reforms to Judaism: "We need someone who would do for Judaism what [[Pope John XXIII]] has done for the Catholic Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hodes| first = Aubrey| title = Martin Buber: An Intimate Portrait | page = 174 |year= 1971|isbn= 0-670-45904-6|url= http://openlibrary.org/works/OL7021935W/Martin_Buber_an_intimate_portrait}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl and Buber would continue, in mutual respect and disagreement, to work towards their respective goals for the rest of their lives.

In 1902, Buber became the editor of the weekly ''Die Welt'', the central organ of the Zionist movement. However, a year later he became involved with the Jewish [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] movement. Buber admired how the Hasidic communities actualized their religion in daily life and culture. In stark contrast to the busy Zionist organizations, which were always mulling political concerns, the Hasidim were focused on the values which Buber had long advocated for Zionism to adopt. In 1904, he withdrew from much of his Zionist organizational work, and devoted himself to study and writing. In that year, he published his thesis, ''Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems'', on [[Jakob Böhme]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa|Nikolaus Cusanus]].&lt;ref name="Stewart2011"&gt;{{cite book| first =Jon | last = Stewart|title = Kierkegaard and Existentialism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFQWBkpEbwsC|date= 1 May 2011|publisher= Ashgate |isbn = 978-1-4094-2641-7 | page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s, Martin Buber started advocating a [[Binational solution|binational]] Jewish-Arab state, stating that the Jewish people should proclaim "its desire to live in peace and brotherhood with the Arab people, and to develop the common homeland into a republic in which both peoples will have the possibility of free development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/bios/buber.html |title=Jewish Zionist Education |publisher=Jafi |place=[[Israel|IL]] |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222163127/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/BIOS/buber.html |archivedate=December 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buber rejected the idea of Zionism as just another national movement, and wanted instead to see the creation of an exemplary society; a society which would not, he said, be characterized by Jewish domination of the Arabs. It was necessary for the Zionist movement to reach a consensus with the Arabs even at the cost of the Jews remaining a minority in the country. In 1925, he was involved in the creation of the organization [[Brit Shalom (political organization)|Brit Shalom]] (Covenant of Peace), which advocated the creation of a binational state, and throughout the rest of his life, he hoped and believed that Jews and Arabs one day would live in peace in a joint nation. In 1942, he co‑founded the [[Ihud]] party, which advocated a bi-nationalist program. Nevertheless, he was connected with decades of friendship to Zionists and philosophers such as [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Max Brod]], [[Hugo Bergman]], and [[Felix Weltsch]], who were close friends of his from old European times in [[Prague]], [[Berlin]], and Vienna to the Jerusalem of the 1940s through the 1960s.

After the establishment of [[Israel]] in 1948, Buber advocated Israel's participation in a federation of "Near East" states wider than just Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = We Need The Arabs, They Need Us! |last = Buber | first = Martin | title = A Land of Two Peoples | editor-first = Paul | editor-last = Mendes-Flohr | editor-link = Paul Mendes-Flohr |publisher = [[University of Chicago]] |origyear = 1954 |year = 2005 |isbn = 0-226-07802-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin Buber.jpg|thumb|Buber in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] in Jerusalem, prior to 1948]]

From 1906 until 1914, Buber published editions of Hasidic, mystical, and mythic texts from Jewish and world sources. In 1916, he moved from Berlin to [[Heppenheim]].

During [[World War I]], he helped establish the [[Jewish National Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Buber.html|title=Martin Buber|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the condition of [[Eastern Europe]]an Jews. During that period he became the editor of ''[[Der Jude (magazine)|Der Jude]]'' (German for "The Jew"), a Jewish monthly (until 1924). In 1921, Buber began his close relationship with [[Franz Rosenzweig]]. In 1922, he and Rosenzweig co-operated in Rosenzweig's [[House of Jewish Learning]], known in Germany as ''[[Lehrhaus]]''.&lt;ref name = "Zank2006"&gt;{{cite book | first =Michael | last = Zank|title=New perspectives on Martin Buber|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HRjAUsonXGwC|date= 31 August 2006|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-148998-3|page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, ''[[I and Thou|Ich und Du]]'' (later translated into English as ''I and Thou''). Though he edited the work later in his life, he refused to make substantial changes. In 1925, he began, in conjunction with Franz Rosenzweig, translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into German. He himself called this translation ''Verdeutschung'' ("Germanification"), since it does not always use literary German language, but instead attempts to find new dynamic (often newly invented) equivalent phrasing to respect the multivalent Hebrew original. Between 1926 and 1930, Buber co-edited the quarterly ''Die Kreatur'' ("The Creature").&lt;ref name = "BuberBiemann2002"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Martin | last1 = Buber| first2= Asher D | last2 = Biemann|title= The Martin Buber reader: essential writings | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BTzPiYZUIPwC|year= 2002|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn= 978-0-312-29290-4|page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]]. He resigned in protest from his professorship immediately after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933. On October 4, 1933, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities forbade him to lecture. In 1935, he was expelled from the ''Reichsschrifttumskammer'' (the National Socialist authors' association). He then founded the [[Central Office for Jewish Adult Education]], which became an increasingly important body, as the German government forbade Jews to attend public education.&lt;ref name="BuberMendes-Flohr2005"&gt;{{cite book| first = Martin | last = Buber| editor-first =Paul R | editor-last = Mendes-Flohr|title=A land of two peoples: Martin Buber on Jews and Arabs|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IE5B_0AjQjkC|date= 15 February 2005|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0-226-07802-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi administration increasingly obstructed this body.

Finally, in 1938, Buber left Germany, and settled in [[Jerusalem]], then capital of [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]]. He received a professorship at [[Hebrew University]], there lecturing in [[anthropology]] and introductory [[sociology]]. The lectures he gave during the first semester were published in the book ''The problem of man'' (''Das Problem des Menschen'');&lt;ref name = "Schaeder1991"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Schaeder | editor-first = Grete | contribution = Martin Buber: A Biographical Sketch | first = Martin | last = Buber | year = 1991 | title = The letters of Martin Buber: a life of dialogue | isbn= 978-0-8156-0420-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tGi6968aQSoC&amp;pg=PA52 | page = 52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Martin | last = Buber | editor-first = Asher D | editor-last = Biemann | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BTzPiYZUIPwC&amp;pg=PA12 | title = The Martin Buber reader: essential writings | page = 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in these lectures he discusses how the question "What is Man?" became the central one in [[philosophical anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schaeder | first = Grete | year = 1973 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A7e4AAAAIAAJ | title = The Hebrew humanism of Martin Buber | page = 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in the discussion of the Jews' problems in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and of the Arab question – working out of his Biblical, philosophic, and Hasidic work.

He became a member of the group ''[[Ihud]]'', which aimed at a [[Binational solution|bi-national]] state for [[Arab]]s and Jews in Palestine. Such a binational confederation was viewed by Buber as a more proper fulfillment of Zionism than a solely Jewish state. In 1946, he published his work ''[[Paths in Utopia]]'',&lt;ref name = "Paths"&gt;{{cite book| first =Martín | last = Buber|title=Paths in Utopia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MXGSnCcRaUwC|date=September 1996|publisher= Syracuse University Press|isbn= 978-0-8156-0421-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he detailed his [[communitarian]] [[socialist]] views and his theory of the "dialogical community" founded upon interpersonal "dialogical relationships".

After [[World War II]], Buber began lecture tours in Europe and the United States. In 1952, he argued with [[Jung]] over the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schneider | first = Herbert W | contribution = The historical significance of Buber's philosophy | title = The philosophy of Martin Buber | page = 471 | quote = ...the retort he actually made, namely, that a scientist should not make judgments beyond his science. Such an insistence on hard and fast boundaries among sciences is not in the spirit of Buber's empiricism}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{Jewish philosophy}}
Buber is famous for his thesis of dialogical existence, as he described in the book ''I and Thou''. However, his work dealt with a range of issues including religious consciousness, modernity, the concept of evil, ethics, education, and Biblical hermeneutics.&lt;ref name = "Friedman1996"&gt;{{cite book | first = Maurice S | last = Friedman | title =Martin Buber and the human sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFoU5LdDu6cC|date=July 1996|publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 978-0-7914-2876-4 |page= 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buber rejected the label of "philosopher" or "theologian", claiming he was not interested in ideas, only personal experience, and could not discuss God, but only relationships to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Pamela|title=Buber|year=1988|publisher=Peter Hablan |location=London|isbn=1-870015-08-8|page = vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Buber's social philosophy on points of [[prefigurative politics|prefiguration]] aligns with that of anarchism, though Buber explicitly disavowed the affiliation in his lifetime and justified the existence of a state under limited conditions.&lt;ref name="Brody2018"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brody|first=Samuel Hayim|chapter=The True Front: Buber and Landauer on Anarchism and Revolution|title=Martin Buber's Theopolitics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Db5QDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT37|year=2018|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-03537-0|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silberstein1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Silberstein|first=Laurence J.|title=Martin Buber's Social and Religious Thought: Alienation and the Quest for Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhsUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281|year=1990|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-7910-1|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dialogue and existence ===
In ''I and Thou'', Buber introduced his thesis on human existence. Inspired by [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'s ''Single One'', Buber worked upon the premise of existence as encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Buber | first = Martin|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=6fPU5xfv4SMC&amp;pg=PA228 | title = Between Man and Man| publisher = Routledge | origyear = 1947 | year = 2002|pages=250–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of ''Ich-Du'' and ''Ich-Es'' to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and [[being]] through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langton|first1=Daniel|title=The Apostle Paul in the Jewish Imagination|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=67–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in ''I and Thou'', a person is at all times engaged with the world in one of these modes.

The generic motif Buber employs to describe the dual modes of being is one of dialogue (''Ich-Du'') and monologue (''Ich-Es'').&lt;ref name = "KramerGawlick2003"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Kenneth | last1 = Kramer| first2= Mechthild | last2 = Gawlick| title= Martin Buber's I and thou: practicing living dialogue | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VgvSa1_l0BEC |date=November 2003|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn= 978-0-8091-4158-6| page = 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of communication, particularly language-oriented communication, is used both in describing dialogue/monologue through metaphors and expressing the interpersonal nature of human existence.

==== ''Ich-Du'' ====
''Ich‑Du'' ("I‑Thou" or "I‑You") is a relationship that stresses the mutual, holistic existence of two beings. It is a concrete encounter, because these beings meet one another in their authentic existence, without any qualification or objectification of one another. Even imagination and ideas do not play a role in this relation. In an I–Thou encounter, infinity and universality are made actual (rather than being merely concepts).&lt;ref name = "KramerGawlick2003" /&gt; Buber stressed that an ''Ich‑Du'' relationship lacks any composition (e. g., structure) and communicates no content (e. g., information). Despite the fact that ''Ich‑Du'' cannot be proven to happen as an event (e. g., it cannot be measured), Buber stressed that it is real and perceivable. A variety of examples are used to illustrate ''Ich‑Du'' relationships in daily life—two lovers, an observer and a cat, the author and a tree, and two strangers on a train. Common English words used to describe the ''Ich‑Du'' relationship include encounter, meeting, dialogue, mutuality, and exchange.

One key ''Ich‑Du'' relationship Buber identified was that which can exist between a human being and God. Buber argued that this is the only way in which it is possible to interact with God, and that an ''Ich‑Du'' relationship with anything or anyone connects in some way with the eternal relation to God.

To create this I–Thou relationship with God, a person has to be open to the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.

==== ''Ich-Es'' ====
The ''Ich-Es'' ("I‑It") relationship is nearly the opposite of ''Ich‑Du''.&lt;ref name="KramerGawlick2003"/&gt; Whereas in ''Ich‑Du'' the two beings encounter one another, in an ''Ich‑Es'' relationship the beings do not actually meet. Instead, the "I" confronts and qualifies an idea, or conceptualization, of the being in its presence and treats that being as an object. All such objects are considered merely mental representations, created and sustained by the individual mind. This is based partly on Kant's theory of [[phenomenon]], in that these objects reside in the cognitive agent’s mind, existing only as thoughts. Therefore, the ''Ich‑Es'' relationship is in fact a relationship with oneself; it is not a dialogue, but a monologue.

In the ''Ich-Es'' relationship, an individual treats other things, people, etc., as objects to be used and experienced. Essentially, this form of objectivity relates to the world in terms of the self – how an object can serve the individual’s interest.

Buber argued that human life consists of an oscillation between ''Ich‑Du'' and ''Ich‑Es'', and that in fact ''Ich‑Du'' experiences are rather few and far between. In diagnosing the various perceived ills of [[modernity]] (e. g., isolation, dehumanization, etc.), Buber believed that the expansion of a purely analytic, material view of existence was at heart an advocation of ''Ich‑Es'' relations - even between human beings. Buber argued that this paradigm devalued not only existents, but the meaning of all existence.

==== Note on translation ====
''Ich und Du'' has been translated from the original German into many other languages. However, because Buber's use of German was highly idiomatic and often unconventional, there has naturally been debate on how best to convey the complex messages in his text. One critical debate in the English-speaking world has centered on the correct translation of the key word pairs ''Ich-Du'' and ''Ich-Es''. In the German, the word "Du" is used, while in the English two different translations are used: "Thou" (used in Ronald Smith's version) and "You" (used by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]). The key problem is how to translate the very personal, even intimate German "Du", which has no direct equivalent in Modern English. Smith argued that "Thou" invokes the theological and reverential implications which Buber intended (e. g., Buber describes God as the eternal "Du"). Kaufmann asserted that this wording was archaic and impersonal, offering "You" because (like the German ''Du'') it has colloquial usage in intimate conversation.

Despite this debate, Buber’s book is widely known in the English-speaking world as ''I and Thou'', perhaps because Smith's translation appeared years before Kaufmann's. However, both translations are widely available.

== Hasidism and mysticism ==
Buber was a scholar, interpreter, and translator of Hasidic lore. He viewed Hasidism as a source of cultural renewal for Judaism, frequently citing examples from the Hasidic tradition that emphasized community, interpersonal life, and meaning in common activities (e. g., a worker's relation to his tools). The Hasidic ideal, according to Buber, emphasized a life lived in the unconditional presence of God, where there was no distinct separation between daily habits and religious experience. This was a major influence on Buber's philosophy of anthropology, which considered the basis of human existence as dialogical.

In 1906, Buber published ''Die Geschichten des Rabbi Nachman'', a collection of the tales of the [[Rabbi]] [[Nachman of Breslov]], a renowned Hasidic ''[[rebbe]]'', as interpreted and retold in a [[Neo‐Hasidism|Neo-Hasidic]] fashion by Buber. Two years later, Buber published ''Die Legende des Baalschem'' (stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]), the founder of Hasidism.&lt;ref name="Zank2006" /&gt;

Buber's interpretation of the Hasidic tradition, however, has been criticized by [[Chaim Potok]] for its romanticization. In the introduction to Buber's ''[[Tales of the Hasidim]]'', Potok claims that Buber overlooked Hasidism's "charlatanism, obscurantism, internecine quarrels, its heavy freight of folk superstition and pietistic excesses, its [[tzadik]] worship, its vulgarized and attenuated reading of Lurianic Kabbalah". Even more severe is the criticism that Buber de-emphasized the importance of the Jewish Law in Hasidism.

Located near [[Pucallpa]], the Mayantuyacu sanctuary covers 180 [[hectares]] of Amazon rainforest.&lt;ref name="Cyril_NatGeo_2013"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.fr/6514-partir-en-amerique-du-sud-en-quete-des-guerisseurs-amerindiens/ |title=Partir en Amérique du Sud en quête des guérisseurs amérindiens |date=October 2013 |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |author=Cyril Abad |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Asháninka language]], Mayantuyacu means "the water and the air".&lt;ref name="Jay_2015"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jay Griffiths |title=Savage Grace: A Journey in Wildness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9U3_BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11 |year=2015 |publisher=Counterpoint |isbn=978-1-61902-511-0 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the local guides, "Mayantu" refers to the spirit of the jungle, and "Yacu" refers to the spirit of the water.&lt;ref name="Andres_2016"&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrés Ruzo |title=The Boiling River: Adventure and Discovery in the Amazon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJuMCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2016 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-5011-1947-7 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The retreat was established by Juan Flores Salazar, an [[Asháninka people|Ashaninka]] traditional healer ([[vegetalismo]]). He was born into a family of traditional healers; he states that he established Mayantuyacu to practice [[herbalism|plant therapy]] and pass on the traditional knowledge to future generations. His healing techniques involve use of [[tobacco]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], natural fragrances and [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref name="Cyril_NatGeo_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Tindall |title=The Shamanic Odyssey: Homer, Tolkien, and the Visionary Experience |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1pnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 |date=16 November 2012 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |isbn=978-1-59477-501-7 |pages=30–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayantuyacu has many natural [[hot spring]]s.&lt;ref name="Jay_2015"/&gt; The area also has the [[Shanay-Timpishka]] hot stream, which has been described as "'''The Boiling River'''" by geoscientist [[Andrés Ruzo]] in a book of the same name.&lt;ref name="Andres_2016"/&gt;

'''Michael Davis''' (born 6 February 1943) is an American philosopher specializing in professional ethics. He is Professor of Philosophy at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], and Senior Fellow at its [[Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions]].

Davis is the author of several books, including ''Accountability in the Professions'' (1995), ''Profession, Code, and Ethics'' (2002), and ''Engineering Ethics'' (2005).

==Background==
Davis received his PhD in 1972 from the [[University of Michigan]] for a dissertation entitled "Representation and Consent: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Political Obligation." Before moving to the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1986, he taught at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[Illinois State University]], and [[Case Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://humansciences.iit.edu/faculty/michael-davis "Michael Davis"] and [http://humansciences.iit.edu/sites/humanscience/files/field_uploads/faculty/Davis_VITA%20October%202014.pdf Curriculum Vitae], IIT Lewis College of Human Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research interests==
Davis's work in [[engineering ethics]] has won him four large grants from the [[National Science Foundation]] and an entry in ''[[Who's Who in Science and Engineering]]''. His papers on [[whistleblowing]] and [[conflict of interest]] are often reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Michael Davis, "Whistleblowing," in Hugh LaFollette (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Practical Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sybd1C5zWkoC&amp;pg=PA539 p. 539ff].&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of eight books and almost 200 articles and chapters, and editor (or co-editor) of five other books.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Davis should not be confused with the philosopher Michael Davis who has taught at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] since 1977, and whose work primarily concerns Aristotle, Plato and Greek Tragedy.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naïve dialecticism''' is a collection of East Asian public beliefs characterized by the acceptance of contradiction and the expectation of change in everyday life.&lt;ref name=Nisbett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nisbett|first1=Richard E.|title=The geography of thought: How Asians and Westerners think differently-- and why|date=2004|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0743255356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spencer-Rogers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer-Rodgers|first1=J.|last2=Williams|first2=M. J.|last3=Peng|first3=K.|title=Cultural Differences in Expectations of Change and Tolerance for Contradiction: A Decade of Empirical Research|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date= 2010|volume=14|issue=3|pages=296–312|doi=10.1177/1088868310362982|pmid=20435801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[cultural psychology]], naïve dialecticism explains some of the cultural differences observed between those who hold dialectical beliefs and those who hold more Westernized beliefs. Individuals who hold dialectical beliefs are primarily members of [[Confucian]] influenced cultures, such as in Japan, China, and Korea. Certain researchers have shown that specific aspects of naïve dialecticism have broad implications on cognition, emotion, and behavior. As well, it is sometimes regarded as being more contextual, flexible, holistic, and dialectical as compared with Western thinking and reasoning.&lt;ref name=Peng&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peng|first1=K.|last2=Spencer-Rogers|first2=J.|last3=Nian|first3=Z.|editor1-last=Kim|editor1-first=U.|editor2-last=Yang|editor2-first=K.|editor3-last=Hwang|editor3-first=K.|title=Indigenous and cultural psychology : Understanding people in context|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0387286617|pages=247–262|chapter=Naïve dialecticism and the Tao of Chinese thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialecticism is a perceptual framework that applies to all situations and guides all actions, which is called a domain-general thinking style.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; Naïve dialecticism is an expansion on this research; it is a whole collection of domain-specific beliefs, meaning that there is a tendency to understand a situation in terms of these beliefs but there is variation depending on the context and individual differences &lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt;

Naïve dialecticism contains certain concepts that distinguish it from Western thinking and beliefs, specifically they have different beliefs about change and contradiction. Dialectic thinking involves treating the world as consisting of co-existing extremes or opposites (e.g. hot/cold or light/dark). As a result, they are more likely to expect change from the status quo.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; Dialectic thinkers also believe that the truth is always somewhere in the middle ([[doctrine of the mean]]), which differs from Western beliefs that contradictions must be reconciled because only a single truth is thought to exist &lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt;

Naive dialecticism provides a framework for analysis that is halfway between a macro-level and a micro-level approach.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; On a macro-level, individualism and collectivism define the social differences between cultures, which influences the specific common beliefs about how the world operates. Naïve dialecticism shares this macro-level framework while also looking at individual and situation-specific differences between people (micro-approach).

==Principles of naïve dialecticism==

The three principles of naïve dialecticism are change, contradiction, and holism, and they operate together. If the world is in constant flux, as explained by the principle of change, then there must be acceptance of contradiction because one phenomenon will inevitably become something else.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; The fact that understanding phenomena relies on acceptance of contradiction within and between phenomena suggests that the only way to understand it is to look at it holistically&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt;

===Change===

People who are high in naïve dialecticism tend to view the world as constantly changing, especially alternating between two opposites.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; For example, day transforms into night, life becomes death, etc. Basic Taoist teachings suggest that knowledge and existence are in constant flux, and categorization is ineffective as nothing is ever fixed.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; The concept of change is situation-specific, and so those who are dialectic thinkers believe that their behaviors change depending on the context and individual differences. However, the concept of change is global in that it applies to feelings, events, objects, natural processes and any other phenomena observed in the universe. This can be contrasted to naïve [[aristotelianism]], which follows the [[law of identity]]: If something is true than it is true, regardless of context&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;

===Contradiction===

Contradiction assumes that objects, events and states of being have coexisting opposing parts.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; By splitting or differentiating something to better understand its component parts, one is simply emphasizing the interaction between the contradicting parts.

The [[doctrine of the mean]] is the belief that the truth is always in the middle, between extreme viewpoints. This belief is consistent with naïve dialecticism and is based off the values of balance and harmony.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; This contrasts Western beliefs that more often align with the [[law of non-contradiction]], which maintains that a statement cannot be both true and false, and the [[law of the excluded middle]], which suggests that a statement is either true or false.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; Westerners tend to pick a side, even to the point of changing their beliefs about the pros that the losing side offers. Changing one’s beliefs such that they will be consistent with one’s choice is called [[cognitive dissonance]]&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt;

===Holism===

Holism is the belief that everything is interconnected and relational, and understanding something requires that you understand its relationships and context.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; A primary part of holism is that personal growth requires physical and spiritual growth, and is not independent of the environment within which the growth occurs.&lt;ref name=Kirkland&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkland|first1=Russell|title=Taoism the enduring tradition|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415263221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this tradition there is no dichotomy of “self” and “other” &lt;ref name=Kirkland/&gt;

Naïve dialecticism research has arisen primarily out of the holistic/ analytic tradition of cultural research, which compares cultures on the basis of cognitive styles.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; These cognitive styles are general ways of interpretation that are adopted, and often similar within a culture. Holism is a characteristic that is generally applied to East Asian cultures, while Western cultures are more often characterized by analytic thinking.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; This means that Westerners tend to deconstruct something into parts to understand it, while East Asians tend to look at the entire phenomena as a whole and attempt to understand the relationships that bind each facet to every other and to the phenomena as a whole.

==Historical Roots:Three Systems of Thought==

[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumbnail|right|Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism are One]]
In East Asian countries, lay beliefs predominantly derive from Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt; Taoism guides cognitive beliefs about the physical world, Confucianism guides state decisions and Buddhism guides development of the mind and spirit&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt;

===Taoism===
{{see also| Taoism}}
 
Naïve dialecticism is a lay rendition of Taoism.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; Taoism is not a religion, but rather a system of beliefs regarding thinking and reasoning or, generally, for understanding how the world works.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; Unlike the traditions of Confucianism or Buddhism, Taoism did not begin from a community following the teachings of a leader, and therefore there is no original [[orthodoxy]] or [[orthopraxy]] that provide a standard for the Taoist tradition.&lt;ref name=Kirkland/&gt; Taoism teachings suggest that most people do not live a fulfilling life, as they do not strive for self-cultivation to enhance their experiential awareness.&lt;ref name=Kirkland/&gt; Tao roughly translated means “the way,” although there are many definitions and none accurately capture the meaning of Tao&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt;
[[File:LaoGod.jpg|thumbnail|x1000px|left|Laozi-author of Tao ''Te Ching'']]
'''Basic Concepts of Taoism'''
* ''Non-duality'': the concept that matter and spirit are one. You must have one to know the other.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; Non-duality is consistent with the [[principle of contradiction]], a fundamental concept in naïve dialecticism.
* ''Two-poles'': the basic concept of opposites coexisting and complimenting one another is evident in the Yin/Yang symbol. Yin, the negative, passive, feminine side, must interact with yang, the positive, active, masculine side.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt;  Without one the other cannot exist.
* ''Perpetual change'': this concept suggests that the universe is in a perpetual cycle, consistent with the principle of change in naïve dialecticism.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt;
* ''Three Treasures'': Ching (essence), [[Qi|chi]] (vitality) and [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]] (spirit) are the fundamental components of energy and exist at every level of the universe. This is consistent with the concept of holism in naïve dialecticism.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt;
* ''Five Elements'': According to the Taoist tradition there are five basic elements making up the universe: metal, wood, fire, water and earth.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt; Understanding how each contributes and influences one another is essential to the belief of Holism&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt;
* ''Non-action'' ([[Wu wei]]): this concept refers to flexibility and spontaneity of one’s actions.&lt;ref name=Peng/&gt;

===Confucianism ===
{{see also| Confucianism}}

The Confucian tradition is agnostic; it focuses on living a moral life for the sake of itself, without discussing what comes before or after.&lt;ref name=Lau&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lau|first1=D.C.|editor1-last=Ruggiero|editor1-first=A.|title=Confucianism|date=2006|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=9780737725674|pages=72–88|chapter=Ideal Moral Types}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Confucius’ teachings stem from the ''Analects'', a series of correspondences between Confucius and his students.&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=I.|editor1-last=Ruggiero|editor1-first=A.|title=Confucianism|date=2006|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=9780737725674|pages=60–71|chapter=The Analects of Confucius}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally informed citizens of their social roles within interpersonal relationships and how they should act morally and politically.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guang|first1=Xing|title=Buddhist Impact on Chinese Culture|journal=Asian Philosophy|date=2013|volume=23|issue=4|pages=305–322|doi=10.1080/09552367.2013.831606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; For example, a young man was expected to pursue education and economic welfare for the betterment of his family, which relates to the importance of [[filial piety]].&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt; This emphasis on family relations and interdependence reflects the principle of holism.

Originally from India, the tradition of Buddhism was introduced to Chinese culture during the [[Han dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt; Since it was a later player in Chinese culture, Buddhism was unique from the indigenous traditions of Taoism and Confucianism in that the Chinese interpreted the Buddhist tradition to integrate it into these pre-existing cultural systems.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt; The successful union of Buddhism into Chinese culture reflects the integrative and holistic nature of both.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt; Buddhist ideas filled in many of the blanks that Taoism and Confucianism did not address, for example: Buddhism introduced the ideas of [[karma]] and rebirth.&lt;ref name=Guang/&gt; Buddhism brought a strong position on death, and [[filial piety]] was softened by Buddhist ideas of equality between all people.

==Cultural products==

[[File:Yin and Yang.svg|thumbnail|right|x200px|Yin and Yang]]
The principles of naïve dialecticism are apparent in cultural products. For example, in the yin/yang symbol, there is perpetual motion from black to white indicating that the world is in constant flux. The black and white dots represent contradiction; Not only can opposites co-exist, they could not exist without one another.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt; The values of balance and harmony are represented by the symmetry of the symbol, and the cognitive style of holism by the outer circle representing context&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt;

The Yin/Yang symbol is present in many well known pieces of art, as well as other symbols of Taoism and naive dialectic beliefs. The famous woodblock print “The Great Wave off Kanagawa” by Japanese artist Hokusai depicts a large wave that a writer describes as a “yin yang of empty space beneath the mountain… The violent Yang of nature is overcome by the yin of the confidence of these experienced fishermen” (Andreas Ramos). This follows the principle of contradiction, which states that events and states of being have coexisting opposing parts.
[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|left|Great Wave off Kanagawa]]

The following story demonstrates contradiction and change, and the idea that what starts off as a blessing may actually end up a curse and vice versa. This way of thinking is consistent with naïve dialecticism, and as a cultural product from ancient times it gives a glimpse into the roots of traditional East Asian thought.

There is an ancient Chinese story, still known to most East Asians today, about an old farmer whose only horse ran away. Knowing that the horse was the mainstay of his livelihood, his neighbors came to commiserate with him. ‘Who knows what’s bad or good?’ said the old man, refusing their sympathy. And indeed a few days later his horse returned, bringing with it a wild horse. The old man’s friends came to congratulate him. Rejecting their congratulations, the old man said, ‘Who knows what’s bad or good?’ And, as it happened, a few days later when the old man’s son was attempting to ride the wild horse, he was thrown from it and his leg was broken. The friends came over to express their sadness about the son’s misfortune. . ‘Who knows what’s bad or good?’ said the old man. A few weeks passed and the army came to the village to conscript all the able-bodied men to fight a war against the neighboring province, but the old man’s son was not fit to serve and was spared.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt;

==Alternative comparisons==

===Individualism vs collectivism===

	The first dimension created to measure cultural differences was individualism-collectivism, which was built with the intention of avoiding one-sided comparisons of “us” vs “them”.&lt;ref name=Iyengar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iyengar|first1=S.S.|last2=Lepper|first2=M. R.|last3=Ross|first3=L.|editor1-last=Prentice|editor1-first=D. A.|editor2-last=Miller|editor2-first=D. T.|title=Cultural divides: Understanding and overcoming group conflict|date=1999|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|location=New York|pages=273–301|chapter=Independence from whom? Interdependence with whom? Cultural perspectives on ingroups versus outgroups}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of categorizing people has been used for years to explain the differences seen between people in Western vs. Eastern countries, for example what the common beliefs and goals of a culture are. From this perspective, Westerners have made claims that “the Japanese lacked individuality,” and such claims have been made back by saying that people from Western countries are “self-centered” or “self-serving”.&lt;ref name=Voronov&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voronov|first1=M.|last2=Singer|first2=J. A.|title=The myth of individualism-collectivism: A critical review|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|date=2002|volume=142|issue=4|pages=461–480|pmid=12153123|doi=10.1080/00224540209603912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has shown that this viewpoint does not adequately explain cross-cultural differences and is unsupported by empirical research. Researchers have now shown that this common view of an individual-collective difference between cultures has relied too heavily on casual observations to be accurate. Likewise that converse observations, as well as some historical events, have proven that this viewpoint is outdated and, overall, unsupported.&lt;ref name=Takano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Takano|first1=Y.|last2=Osaka|first2=E.|title=An unsupported common view: Comparing Japan and the US on individualism/collectivism|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=1999|volume=2|pages=311–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the concept of naïve dialecticism is an alternative to the outdated use of individualism-collectivism to explain cultural differences between Western and Eastern countries. Differences seen in the goals and beliefs of East-Asian cultures may be due to the values that they hold as a result of naive dialecticism. For instance, the principle of holism dictates that personal growth is dependent on the environment within which the growth occurs, and that the “self” and the “other” are one. Perhaps this belief is what we once called collectivism, but holism is much more central and universal than the pure concept of collectivism.

===Interdependence vs. independence===

The interdependence/independence viewpoint for making cultural comparisons is focused on the way people view themselves in relation to others and the world around them.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; Interdependent cultures tend to define who they are by their in-group relations, whereas independent cultures tend to separate their identities from one another or from the wider groups they may associate with.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; Generally, Westerners hold autonomy at high value, and maintaining individual integrity is essential for one’s self-conception. The distinction between self and group is much more blurred in collectivist cultures. In accordance with social expectations, similarity to the social group and adoption of their organizational scheme and values is characteristic of interpersonal cultures. Modesty of one’s achievements is preferred in collectivists because they are motivated to bolster the group, not their own esteem as seen in individualists.

This can have an interesting interplay with naïve dialecticism. For example, although East Asians are generally more interpersonal, and thus may be expected to favor their in-group, they are also dialectical and understand things as balanced in contradiction. East Asians actually have a more negative view of their own in-groups compared to European Americans, simply because they consider both positive and negative aspects rather than emphasizing the positives only.&lt;ref name= Spencer-Rogers /&gt; This is a good example of how flexible naïve dialecticism can be when competing with other cultural tendencies.

In [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Jnana Yoga]] '''Nididhyasana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: निदिध्यासन) is profound and repeated meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=nididhyAsana&amp;link=m}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[mahavakyas]], great Upanishadic statements such as "That art Thou", to realize the identity of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. It is the fourth step in the training of a [[Guru-shishya tradition|sisya]] (disciple), consisting of preparatory practives, listening to the teachings as contained in the [[sruti]], [[Manana (reflection)|reflection]] on the teachings, and nididhyasana.

==Four stages of practice==
Nididhyasana is the final step in the correct understanding of the meaning of the [[Mahavakyas]]. Classical [[Advaita Vedanta]] emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain [[moksha]]. It consists of four stages:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama /&gt;

** '''''{{IAST|Mumukṣutva}}''''' (मुमुक्षुत्वम्) — The firm conviction that the nature of the world is misery and the intense longing for ''moksha'' (''release from the cycle of births and deaths'').
* '''Sravana''', listening to the teachings of the sages on the [[Upanishads]] and Advaita Vedanta, and studying the Vedantic texts, such as the [[Brahma Sutras]]. In this stage the student learns about the reality of [[Brahman]] and the identity of atman;
* '''Manana''', the stage of [[Manana (reflection)|reflection on the teachings]];
* '''Nididhyāsana''', the stage of meditation on the truth "that art Thou".&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama /&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100234232 Oxford Index, ''nididhyāsana'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Nididhyasana is a rational and cognitive process, which differs from [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] (meditation). It is necessary for gaining ''Brahmajnana'':{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=108}}
{{quote|आत्मा ब्रह्मेति वाक्यार्थे निःशेषेण विचारिते &lt;br&gt;By a thorough analysis of "Atman is Brahman" the direct knowledge "I am Brahman" is achieved ([[Panchadasi]] VII.58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=256|url= https://www.amazon.in/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nididhyasana done independently of ''[[Listening|sravana]]'' does not lead to the realization of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanisads, Vol.3|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|pages=314–317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

===Advaita Vedanta===
[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (II.iv.5) defines Nididhyasana as the meditation for the sake of direct vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of the Vedanta: A Critical account of the Advaita Tradition|author=Swami Satchidanandendra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMkbWhjE2M4C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Yajnavalkya]] tells his wife –

:आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेयि, 
:आत्मनो व अरे दर्शनेन श्रवणेन मत्या विज्ञानेनेदं सर्वं विदितम् ||

:"The Self, my dear [[Maitreyi]], should be realized – should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon; 
:by the realization of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known." -  ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] St.II.iv.5)

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains Nididhyasana as meditation with determination. Sankara states:-

:श्रुतेः शतगुणं विद्यान्मननं मननादपि |
:निदिध्यासं लक्षगुणम् अनन्तं निर्विकल्पकम् ||

:"Reflection (manana) is hundred times superior to listening (sravana); 
:meditation (nididhyasana) is hundred times superior to reflection; nirvikalpaka samadhi is infinitely superior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=365|quote=Verse 365|url= https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sri-Samkaras-Vivekacudamni-S-Bhagavatpada/dp/8172764200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Suresvara]], Nididhyasana is the culmination of the practice of ''[[Listening|sravana]]'' and ''[[manan]]a'', which is an indirect intuition of [[Brahman]] and does not mean meditation but knowledge ([[vijñāna|vijnana]]) i.e. understanding the meaning of the [[Śruti|Sruti]] on the basis of ''vacya-vacaka'' relation underlying the [[Mahāvākyas|mahavakya]]. Suresvara states:-

:शास्त्रचार्यानुभवनैर्हेतुभिश्च समर्थितः|
:ईदृगैकात्म्यसंबोधो निदिध्यासनमुच्यते ||

:"Nididhyasana is so called when, instruction about the uniqueness of the Atman is justified 
:by (proper) reasons viz. the Sruti, (the instructions of) teachers and (one’s own) experience (of the same)."

Nididhyasana consists in acquisition of ''vakyarthajnana'' and this verse explains the purport of ''sunisnata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s vartika on Madhu Brahmana (Brhadaranyaka-Upanishad)|author=Suresvaracarya|publisher=Motilal Banarsi Dass|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9wiepM1y2EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati]], ''sravana'', ''manana'' and ''nidihyasana'' are a chain of causes contributory to the knowledge of the oneness of Brahman. The Vivarna school considers ''sravana'' as the principal cause but Suresvara treats ''sravana'' and ''manana'' to be co-existent, these two culminate into ''nididhyasana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s Vartika on Yajnavalkya’s Maitreyi Dialogue|author=Shoun Hino|publisher=Motilal Banarsi Dass|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvcrBnKaIgEC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dvaita Vedanta===
According to [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] the knowledge acquired by study ('sravana') and stabilized by reflection ('manana') is made the basis of steady contemplation ('nididhyasana'); these are the three stages of inquiry that take the form of ''Dhyana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Sri Madhvacarya|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=408|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8XVE0_TiLMC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;dq=nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9erVUvv1D6S27QbIuYCYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] has defined Nididhyasana as "the process by which intellectual conscience is transformed into a vital one there is stillness, a calm in which the soul lays itself open to the Divine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seeker’s Path|author=Sohan Singh|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5lMmeNKn68C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9erVUvv1D6S27QbIuYCYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Vedanta===
According to Michael James, who gives an Advaita Vedanta interpretation of Ramana Maharshi, Ramana's [[self-enquiry]] is the same as Nididhyasana and ''atma-vichara''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.in/2008/06/self-enquiry-underlying-philosophy-can.html Michael James, ''Self-enquiry: the underlying philosophy can be clearly understood only by putting it into practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17566">In [[metaphysics]], '''realism''' about a given object is the view that this object exists in [[reality]] independently of our [[Concept|conceptual scheme]]. In philosophical terms, these objects are [[ontology|ontologically]] independent of someone's [[conceptual scheme]], [[Idealism|perceptions]], [[language|linguistic practices]], [[belief]]s, etc. 

Realism can be applied to many philosophically interesting objects and phenomena: [[The problem of other minds|other minds]], the [[past]] or the [[future]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[mathematics|mathematical entities]] (such as [[natural numbers]]), [[morality|moral categories]], the [[physical world]], and [[thought]]. 

Realism can also be a view about the nature of reality in general, where it claims that the world exists independent of the mind, as opposed to non-realist views (like some forms of [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] and [[solipsism]], which deny the existence of a mind-independent world). Philosophers who profess realism often claim that [[truth]] consists in a [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] between cognitive representations and reality.&lt;ref&gt;The statement ''[[veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus]]'' ("truth is the adequation of thought and thing") was defended by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Realists tend to believe that whatever we believe now is only an approximation of reality but that the accuracy and fullness of understanding can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, realism is contrasted with [[idealism]]. Today it is more usually contrasted with [[anti-realism]], for example in the [[philosophy of science]].

The oldest use of the term "realism" appears in [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] interpretations and adaptations of [[ancient Greek philosophy]].

==Varieties==
===Metaphysical realism&lt;!--'Metaphysical realism' redirects here--&gt;===
{{also|Metaphysical anti-realism|Mathematical Platonism}}
'''Metaphysical realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; maintains that "whatever exists does so, and has the properties and relations it does, independently of deriving its existence or nature from being thought of or experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Laird Addis, Greg Jesson, Erwin Tegtmeier (eds.), ''Ontology and Analysis: Essays and Recollections about Gustav Bergmann'', Walter de Gruyter, 2007, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naive or direct realism===
{{also|Indirect realism}}
[[Naive realism]], also known as direct realism, is a [[philosophy of mind]] rooted in a [[common sense]] [[theory]] of [[perception]] that claims that the [[senses]] provide us with direct [[awareness]] of the external world. In contrast, some forms of [[idealism]] assert that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas and some forms of [[skepticism]] say we cannot trust our senses. The naive realist view is that [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s have properties, such as texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually [[Perception|perceived]] absolutely correctly. We perceive them as they ''really'' are.

===Scientific realism===
[[Scientific realism]] is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be.  Within [[philosophy of science]], it is often framed as an answer to the question "how is the success of science to be explained?" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of [[unobservable|unobservable entities]] apparently talked about by scientific [[theory|theories]]. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make reliable claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same [[Ontology|ontological]] status) as observables. [[Analytic philosopher]]s generally have a commitment to scientific realism, in the sense of regarding the scientific method as a reliable guide to the nature of reality. The main alternative to scientific realism is [[instrumentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/ Scientific Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism in physics===
[[Realism in physics]] (especially [[quantum mechanics]]) is the claim that the world is in some sense mind-independent: that even if the results of a possible measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer (contrary to the "[[consciousness causes collapse]]" [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]). That interpretation of quantum mechanics, on the other hand, states that the [[wave function]] is already the full description of reality. The different possible realities described by the wave function are equally true. The observer collapses the wave function into their own reality. One's reality can be mind-dependent under this interpretation of quantum mechanics.

===Moral realism===
[[Moral realism]] is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world.

===Aesthetic realism&lt;!--'Aesthetic realism (metaphysics)' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Aesthetic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (not to be confused with the [[Aesthetic Realism]] of [[Eli Siegel]], the philosophy that sees reality as the making one of opposites) may mean the claim that there are mind-independent aesthetic facts,&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vp2c0LOPjB8C&amp;vq= ''The Metaphysics of Beauty''], Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]|author=Gavin McIntosh|title=Review: The Metaphysics of Beauty|year=2004|volume=113|issue=449|pages=221–226|doi=10.1093/mind/113.449.221}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in general discussions about art [[Realism (arts)|"realism"]] is a complex term that may have a number of different meanings.

==History of metaphysical realism&lt;!--'History of metaphysical realism' redirects here--&gt;==
{{also|History of metaphysical naturalism}}
===Ancient Greek philosophy===
{{Main article|Platonic realism}}
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', a fresco by [[Raphael]]. In Plato's metaphysics, ever unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], or Ideas, exist apart from particular things, and are related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]]. Aristotle's philosophy of reality also aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle finds the universal, which he calls [[Essences|essence]], in the commonalities of [[particular]] things.]]
In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], [[Problem of universals#Realism|realist doctrines]] about [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]] were proposed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=B&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/realism-philosophy Realism – philosophy – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonic realism]] is realism regarding the existence of universals or [[abstract object]]s. As universals were considered by Plato to be [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]], this stance is confusingly also called [[Platonic idealism]]. This should not be confused with [[Philosophical idealism|Idealism]], as presented by philosophers such as [[George Berkeley]]: as Platonic [[abstraction]]s are not spatial, temporal, or mental, they are not compatible with the latter Idealism's emphasis on mental existence. Plato's Forms include numbers and geometrical figures, making them a theory of [[mathematical realism]]; they also include the [[Form of the Good]], making them in addition a theory of [[ethical realism]].

[[Aristotelian realism]] is the view that the existence of universals is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

===Medieval philosophy&lt;!--'Medieval realism' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Medieval realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; developed out of debates over the [[problem of universals]].&lt;ref&gt;John Marenbon, ''Medieval Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Universals are terms or properties that can be applied to many things, such as "red", "beauty", "five", or "dog". Realism (also known as [[exaggerated realism]]) in this context, contrasted with [[conceptualism]] and [[nominalism]], holds that such universals really exist, independently and somehow prior to the world. [[Moderate realism]] holds that they exist, but only insofar as they are instantiated in specific things; they do not exist ''separately'' from the specific thing. Conceptualism holds that they exist, but only in the mind, while nominalism holds that universals do not "exist" at all but are no more than words (''[[flatus vocis]]'') that describe specific objects.

Proponents of moderate realism included [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Duns Scotus]] (cf. [[Scotist realism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism – ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern philosophy===
In [[early modern philosophy]], [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]] was a school of [[philosophy]] that sought to defend naive realism against philosophical paradox and [[scepticism]], arguing that matters of [[common sense]] are within the reach of common understanding and that common-sense beliefs even govern the lives and thoughts of those who hold non-commonsensical beliefs. It originated in the ideas of the most prominent members of the Scottish School of Common Sense, [[Thomas Reid]], [[Adam Ferguson]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], during the 18th century [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Scotland and America.

The roots of Scottish Common Sense Realism can be found in responses to such philosophers as [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]]. The approach was a response to the "ideal system" that began with Descartes' concept of the limitations of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] and led Locke and Hume to a skepticism that called religion and the evidence of the senses equally into question. The common sense realists found skepticism to be absurd and so contrary to common experience that it had to be rejected. They taught that ordinary experiences provide intuitively certain assurance of the existence of the self, of real objects that could be seen and felt and of certain "first principles" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. Its basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo and Woudenberg, eds. ''The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid'' (2004) p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

:If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them—these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.

===Late modern philosophy&lt;!--'Austrian realism' redirects here--&gt;===
{{also|Objective idealism|Transcendental realism (Schelling)|Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)}}
In [[late modern philosophy]], a notable school of thought advocating metaphysical realism was '''Austrian realism'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; Its members included [[Franz Brentano]],&lt;ref name=GT/&gt; [[Alexius Meinong]],&lt;ref name=GT/&gt; [[Vittorio Benussi]],&lt;ref name=GT/&gt; [[Ernst Mally]],&lt;ref&gt;Liliana Albertazzi, Dale Jacquette, ''The School of Alexius Meinong'', Routledge, 2017, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; and early [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref name=GT&gt;''Gestalt Theory: Official Journal of the Society for Gestalt Theory and Its Applications (GTA)'', '''22''', Steinkopff, 2000, p. 94: "Attention has varied between Continental Phenomenology (late Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) and Austrian Realism (Brentano, Meinong, Benussi, early Husserl)".&lt;/ref&gt; These thinkers stressed the objectivity of truth and its independence of the nature of those who judge it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Textor, ''The Austrian Contribution to Analytic Philosophy'', Routledge, 2006, pp. 170–1:&lt;br&gt;"[Husserl argues in the ''Logical Investigations'' that the rightness of a judgement or proposition] shows itself in our experience of self-evidence (''Evidenz''), which term Husserl takes from Brentano, but makes criterial not of truth per se but of our most secure awareness that things are as we take them to be, when the object of judgement, the [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]], is given most fully or adequately. ... In his struggle to overcome relativism, especially psychologism, Husserl stressed the objectivity of truth and its independence of the nature of those who judge it ... A proposition is true not because of some fact about a thinker but because of an objectively existing abstract proposition's relation to something that is not a proposition, namely a state of affairs."&lt;/ref&gt; (See also ''[[Graz School]]''.)

[[Dialectical materialism]], a [[philosophy of nature]] based on the writings of late modern philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], is interpreted to be a form of ontological realism.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Creaven, ''Marxism and Realism: A Materialistic Application of Realism in the Social Sciences'', Routledge, 2012, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Michael Resnik]], [[Gottlob Frege]]'s work after 1891 can be interpreted as a contribution to realism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Resnik]], "II. Frege as Idealist and then Realist," ''Inquiry'' 22 (1–4):350–357 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">'''Pleonexia''', sometimes called '''pleonexy''', originating from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:πλεονεξία|πλεονεξία]], is a philosophical concept which roughly corresponds to [[greed (emotion)|greed]], covetousness, or avarice, and is strictly defined as "the insatiable desire to have what rightfully belongs to others", suggesting what Ritenbaugh describes as "ruthless self-seeking and an arrogant assumption that others and things exist for one's own benefit".&lt;ref name=Ritenbaugh&gt;{{cite web|title=Forerunner|work=The Tenth Commandment|author=John W. Ritenbaugh|url=http://cgg.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Library.sr/CT/PERSONAL/k/301/The-Tenth-Commandment.htm|date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical Greek concepts of pleonexia ==
Classical Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] related pleonexia to justice.  

[[Thrasymachus]], in Book I of ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', presents pleonexia as a natural state, upon which justice is an unnatural restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=SparkNotes: The Republic|title=Important terms: pleonexia|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/characters.html|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], who insisted in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' that all specifically unjust actions are motivated by pleonexia, Kraut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Kraut|title=Aristotle: Political Philosophy|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-878200-4|nopp=true|page=xiv, 520}}, cited by {{cite web|author=David Keyt|work=[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]|date=2003-02-07|title=Review|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/2003-02-07.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses pleonexia and equates it to epichairekakia, the Greek version of [[schadenfreude]], stating that inherent in pleonexia is the appeal of acting unjustly at the expense of others.  Young,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles Young|year=1989|title=Aristotle on Justice|journal=The Southern Journal of Philosophy|volume=27 (Supp.)|pages=233&amp;ndash;249}}, also cited by Keyt&lt;/ref&gt; however argues that the simple involvement of unfairness in the desire for gaining ever more is what defines pleonexia, rather than that the desire itself be for gaining ever more in a manner that is specifically unfair.

[[Thomas Hobbes]] includes it as a concept of natural law in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;If in this case, at the making of Peace, men require for themselves, that which they would not have to be granted to others, they do contrary to the precedent law, that commandeth the acknowledgement of naturall equalitie, and therefore also against the law of Nature. The observers of this law, are those we call Modest, and the breakers Arrogant Men. The Greeks call the violation of this law ''πλεονεξία''; that is, a desire of more than their share.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas: ''Leviathan'': Chapter XV. Of Other Lawes of Nature&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Christian concepts of pleonexia ==
Pleonexia, being mentioned in the [[New Testament]] in  [[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]] 3 verses 1&amp;ndash;11 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 12 verses 13&amp;ndash;21, has been the subject of commentary by Christian theologians.

William Barclay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Barclay|title=The Daily study Bible series, Rev. ed.|location=Philadelphia|publisher=The Westminster Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes pleonexia as an "accursed love of having", which "will pursue its own interests with complete disregard for the rights of others, and even for the considerations of common humanity".  He labels it an aggressive vice that operates in three spheres of life. In the material sphere involves "grasping at money and goods, regardless of honour and honesty".  In the ethical sphere it is "the ambition which tramples on others to gain something which is not properly meant for it".  In the moral sphere, it is "the unbridled lust which takes its pleasure where it has no right to take".

Christian belief equates pleonexia with [[idolatry]], because it replaces God with self-interest and material interest in things.&lt;ref name=Ritenbaugh /&gt;

== Life ==

Between 1894 and 1902, Friedlaender studied medicine, philosophy, German literature, archaeology, and art history in Munich, Berlin, and Jena. He wrote his dissertation on Schopenhauer and Kant. He approached the contemporary problems of his day through the lens of Kantian philosophy, in the footsteps of his teacher, the neo-Kantian Ernst Marcus. His most philosophical work, ''Die schoepferische Indifferenz'' (1918),  Friedlaender built upon Kant's ideas to move beyond the classical dualism of subject and object in a purified, absolute self. 

In 1906, Friedlaender moved to Berlin and began to publish literary writing under the pseudonym Mynona. He wrote several novels and countless poems and [[Grotesque body|grotesques]] which were widely published in Expressionist periodicals such as ''Der Sturm'' and Die ''Aktion''. He was part of the Berlin expressionist circle of [[Herwarth Walden]], [[Else Lasker-Schueler]], and [[Samuel Lublinski]] and an attraction at their public readings.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Chad W.

In 1933, he fled to Paris to escape the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany. In Paris, he wrote about confronting the will to annihilation of the Nazis by answering torture with laughter.

He died in poverty after being refused assistance to emigrate to the United States during [[World War II]].

== Work ==
Almost none of Friedlander's work has been translated into English. In 2014, an English translation of ''The Creator'' was published by Wakefield Press alongside a translation of “A Wearisome Wedding Night: A Grotesque.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dirda|first1=Michael|title=Book review: ‘The Creator’ by Mynona, author of ‘Kant for Kids’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-the-creator-by-mynona-author-of-kant-for-kids/2015/01/21/f4c181d0-9db9-11e4-bcfb-059ec7a93ddc_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sydney Shoemaker''' (born  29 September 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/abstract/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-878|title=Shoemaker, Sydney Sharpless - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-878|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American philosopher. He is the Emeritus Susan Linn Sage Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Cornell University]] and is well-known for his contributions to [[philosophy of mind]] and [[metaphysics]]. 

==Education and career==

Shoemaker graduated with a BA from [[Reed College]] and earned his PhD from [[Cornell University]] under the supervision of [[Norman Malcolm]]. 

In 1971, he delivered the [[John Locke Lectures]] at Oxford University. 

==Philosophical work==

Shoemaker has worked primarily in the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[metaphysics]], and published many classic papers in both of these areas (as well as their overlap). In "Functionalism and Qualia" (1975), for example, he argues that [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] about mental states can account for the qualitative character (or 'raw feel') of mental states. In "Self-Reference and Self-Awareness" (1968), he argues that the phenomenon of absolute 'Immunity to Error Through Misidentification' is what distinguishes self-attributions of mental states (such as "I see a canary") from self-attributions of physical states (such as "I weigh 200 pounds"). In metaphysics, he has defended the view that laws are metaphysically necessary, a position that follows from his view of properties as clusters of conditional causal powers. He has also applied his view of properties to the [[problem of mental causation]]. He also has distinguished contributions to the literature on self-knowledge and [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]], where he defended a [[John Lock|Lockean]] psychological continuity theory in his influential paper "Persons and their Pasts". In his recent work on the content of perception, he has argued for a distinctive version of internalist [[representationalism]].

[[File:Yin and Yang.svg|thumb|The Yin-Yang symbol applied to T'ai Chi ch'uan, the ''tai chi tu'' or ''taijitu'']]
'T'ai chi ch'uan' is often translated ''supreme ultimate pugilism'' or ''boundless fist''.  This refers to the ancient [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]].  However, in terms of philosophy ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|t'ai chi]]'' has a wider meaning.  The concept of ''t'ai chi'' or the ''Supreme Ultimate'' is used in various Chinese philosophical schools, usually to represent the contrast in opposing categories, or the interplay of those categories usually termed [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']].  These abstract terms represent the relationships used to describe perceived opposites in the phenomenal world: full and empty, movement and stillness, soft and hard, light and dark, hot and cold, et cetera. This scheme has had a lasting influence in traditional [[Chinese culture]], shaping theory in schools as diverse as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Chan Buddhism]], as well as [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[feng shui]]. T'ai chi ch'uan, a relatively recent development compared to the aforementioned schools&lt;ref name="Lao1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eberhard|first=Wolfram|title=A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols: Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London|date=1986|isbn=0-415-00228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; was even named by some of its earliest known exponents after the ''t'ai chi'' concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woolidge|first=Doug|title=T’AI CHI The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan Vol. 21 No. 3|publisher=Wayfarer Publications|date=June 1997|issn=0730-1049}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as late as the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Wile1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wile|first=Douglas|title=Taijiquan and Taoism from Religion to Martial Art and Martial Art to Religion - Journal of Asian Martial Arts Vol. 16 No. 4|publisher= Via Media Publishing |date=2007|issn=1057-8358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Forty Chapter" t'ai chi classic text supplied by [[Yang Pan-hou]] to [[Wu Ch'uan-yu]] in the late nineteenth century, there are the following references to the philosophy of t'ai chi ch'uan as applied to  a practitioner's lifestyle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;14. An Explanation of the Spiritual and Martial in Tai Chi&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The spiritual is the essence, the martial is the application. Spiritual development in the realm of martial arts is applied through the ching (metabolic energy), ch'i (breath energy) and shen (spiritual energy) - the practise of physical culture. When the martial is matched with the spiritual and it is experienced in the body and mind, this then is the practise of martial arts. With the spiritual and martial we must speak of "firing time," for their development unfolds according to the proper sequence. This is the root of physical culture. Therefore, the practise of the martial arts in a spiritual way is soft-style exercise, the sinew power of ching, ch'i and shen. When the martial arts are practical in an exclusively martial way, this is hard style, or simply brute force. The spiritual without martial training is essence without application; the martial without spiritual accompaniment is application without essence. A lone pole cannot stand, a single palm cannot clap. This is not only true of physical culture and martial arts, but all things are subject to this principle. The spiritual is internal principle; the martial is external skill. External skill without internal principle is simply physical ferocity. This is a far cry from the original nature of the art, and by bullying an opponent one eventually invites disaster. To understand the internal principles without the external skill is simply an armchair art. Without knowing the applications, one will be lost in an actual confrontation. When it comes to applying this art, one cannot afford to ignore the significance of the two words: spiritual and martial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;19. An Explanation of the Three Levels of the Spiritual and Martial in Tai Chi&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Without self-cultivation, there would be no means of realising the Tao. Nevertheless, the methods of practise can be divided into three levels. The term level means attainment. The highest level is the great attainment; the lowest level is the lesser attainment; the middle level is the attainment of sincerity. Although the methods are divided into three levels of practise, the attainment is one. The spiritual is cultivated internally and the martial externally; physical culture is internal and martial arts external. Those whose practise is successful both internally and externally reach the highest level of attainment. Those who master the martial arts through the spiritual aspect of physical culture, and those who master the spiritual aspect of physical culture through the martial arts attain the middle level. However, those who know only physical culture but not the martial arts, or those who know only the martial arts without physical culture represent the lowest levels of attainment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;20. An Explanation of the Martial Aspect of T’ai Chi&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a martial art, T’ai Chi is externally a soft exercise, but internally hard, even as it seeks softness. If we are externally soft, after a long time we will naturally develop internal hardness. It’s not that we consciously cultivate hardness, for in reality our mind is on softness. What is difficult is to remain internally reserved, to possess hardness without expressing it, always externally meeting the opponent with softness. Meeting hardness with softness causes the opponent’s hardness to be transformed and disappear into nothingness. How can we acquire this skill? When we have mastered sticking, adhering, connecting and following, we will naturally progress from conscious movement to interpreting energy and finally spiritual illumination and the realm of absolute transcendence. If our skill has not reached absolute transcendence, how could we manifest the miracle of four ounces moving a thousand pounds? It is simply a matter of “understanding sticky movement” to the point of perfecting the subtlety of seeing and hearing.&lt;ref name="Wile1995"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; 24 An Explanation of the Spiritual and Martial in Tai Chi &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; If the essence of material substances lies in their phenomenological reality, then the presence of the ontological status of abstract objects shall become clear in the final culmination of the energy that is derived from oneness and the Real. How can man learn this truth? By truly seeking that which is the shadow of philosophy and the charge of all living substances, that of the nature of the divine. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10124">'''The Bear and the Gardener''' is a [[fable]] of eastern origin that warns against making foolish friendships. There are several variant versions, both literary and oral, across the world and its folk elements are classed as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]]-Uther type 1586. The La Fontaine version has been taken as demonstrating various philosophical lessons.

==The Fable==
The story was introduced to western readers in [[La Fontaine's Fables]] (VIII.10).&lt;ref&gt;An English translation is [http://oaks.nvg.org/fonta8.html#sebeargard here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''L'Ours et l'amateur des jardins'' is sometimes translated as "The bear and the amateur gardener", the true meaning is 'the garden lover'. It relates how a solitary gardener encounters a lonely bear and they decide to become companions. One of the bear's duties is to keep the flies off his friend when he takes a nap. Unable to drive off a persistent fly, the bear seizes a paving stone to crush it and kills the gardener as well.

Several lines occurring in the poem are taken as its morals. Midway there is the statement 'In my opinion it's a golden rule/Better be lonely than be with a fool', which the rest of the story bears out. The summing up at the end carries the commentary given by eastern authors that it is better to have a wise enemy than a foolish friend. The fable has given to the [[French language]] the idiom ''le pavé de l'ours'' (the bear's paving stone) and, following the Russian fabulist [[Ivan Krylov]]'s version, to [[Russian language|Russian]] ''medvezhya usluga'' (a bear's service) — both used for any ill-considered action with an unfortunate result. La Fontaine is considered to have been illustrating the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] precept that there should be measure in everything, including the making of friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.site-magister.com/prepas/fables2.htm La Fontaines:Fables]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[practical philosophy]], the story also illustrates the important distinction that the bear fails to realise between the immediate good, in this case keeping the flies off a friend, and the ultimate good of safeguarding his welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceshumaines.com/le-raisonnement-de-l-ours-et-autres-essais-de-philosophie-pratique_fr_21783.html Sciences Humaines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story gained currency in England from the 18th century on through translations or imitations of La Fontaine. One of its earliest appearances was in [[Robert Dodsley]]'s ''Select fables of Esop and other fabulists'' (1764), where it is given the title "The Hermit and the Bear" and a milder ending. In this version a hermit has done the bear a good turn; later still this was identified with taking a thorn from its paw, drawing on the story of [[Androcles]] and the Lion. Serving the hermit afterwards out of gratitude, the bear strikes him in the face when driving off a fly, and the two then part.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dodsley+Aesop%27s+Fables&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kAaFvimu7M&amp;sig=_a_4aLxscJxtJeR6Ydn4zfczHBY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s-KFTeTROZSAhAfj9-i-BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hermit%20and&amp;f=false Fable 23, p.92]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was this version that was taken up in early 19th century rhyming editions for children. Among them are Mary Anne Davis' ''Fables in Verse: by Aesop, La Fontaine, and others'', first published about 1818,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21189/21189-h/21189-h.htm#gardener See p.282 in this pirated edition]&lt;/ref&gt; and Jefferys Taylor's ''Aesop in Rhyme'' (1820).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/aesopinrhymewith00tayliala#page/10/mode/2up Pages 11-12]&lt;/ref&gt; Krylov also used the title "The Hermit and the Bear" in his imitation of La Fontaine's fable (1809), but retained the usual fatal ending.&lt;ref&gt;''Kriloff's Fables'', a verse translation by C. Fillingham Coxwell, London 1920, [https://archive.org/stream/kriloffsfables00kryl#page/102/mode/2up pp.103-6]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the century the origin of the story was forgotten in England and it was taken as one of [[Aesop's Fables]].

==Variants==
[[File:Rumi Bear and Sufi.jpg|thumb|A 1663 Indian miniature of the story from Rumi’s ‘’Mas̱navī’’. (Walters Art Museum)]]
La Fontaine found his fable in a translation of the [[Bidpai]] stories, in which the characters are indeed a bear and a gardener. A variant appeared in [[Rumi]]'s 13th century poem, the [[Masnavi]], which tells the story of a kind man who rescued a bear from a serpent. The animal then devoted itself to its saviour's service and killed him in the manner related.&lt;ref&gt;Book 2, Story 8, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/masnavi/msn02.htm Whinfield's translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story ultimately derives from India, where there are two older versions with different characters. The one from the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' involves the pet monkey of a king who strikes at the gnat with a sword and causes his master's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rain.org/global-garden/folklore-gardening-stories-dec-2001.html Rain.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Masaka [[Jataka]]'' from the Buddhist scriptures it is a carpenter's foolish son who strikes at a fly on his father's head with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/jatakatales00fran#page/44/mode/2up ''Jataka Tales'', ed. H.T.Francis and E.J.Thomas, Cambridge University Press, 1916, pp.44-5]&lt;/ref&gt; In the former the moral is given as 'Do not choose a fool as a friend', while in the latter it is that 'an enemy with sense is better than a friend without it', which is the sentiment on which La Fontaine closes his fable.

There are yet more variants in the oral tradition. One Pakistani source concerns "The Seven Wise Men of Buneyr", who share at least one exploit with the [[Wise Men of Gotham]]; imported into it is the episode of causing injury by trying to drive off flies, in this case from an old woman whom one of them knocks over with the stone he throws in doing so. In Europe the story is of a fool who breaks a magistrate's nose with a cudgel in taking vengeance on a fly. In Italy this is told of [[Giufà]], in Austria of Foolish Hans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1586.html A.L.Ashliman]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar episode also occurs at the start of [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]]'s tale of Fortunio in ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola|Facetious Nights]]'' (13.4), written about 1550. That particular collection contains the first instance of several other European folk tales, besides this one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/nightsofstraparo02stra#page/270/mode/2up Vol.2, London, 1884, p.270ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings and prints==
Because of the fable's existence in Eastern sources, it has been a particularly popular subject in [[Persian miniature|Muslim miniatures]] from the East. Most often they depict the bear with the stone raised in its paws, as in the manuscript copy of the ''Masnavi'' dating from 1663 in the [[Walters Art Museum]] (see above), and another illustration from Persia dating from a little later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spongobongo.com/Islamic_Art/Persian_Painting/Persian_Bears_Fable_of_the_Friendly_Bear.htm J.H.Terry Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; A watercolour in Lucknow style, painted by Sital Das round about 1780 and now in the [[British Library]], shows the bear contemplating the gardener after it has killed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/indiaofficeselect/OIOCEnqFull.asp?ItemID=993&amp;RecNo=6&amp;intPDSearchNo=5734904 India Office]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another Indian miniature of the fable was among those commissioned from the Punjabi artist Imam Bakhsh Lahori in 1837 by a French enthusiast of fables. Now in the [[:fr:Musée Jean de la Fontaine|Musée Jean de la Fontaine]], it shows the bear in an ornamental garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-jean-de-la-fontaine.fr/pages/c_mur2detail.php?photo=68-29-1-5.jpg View at the Museum site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Western artists have illustrated La Fontaine's fable of "The Bear and the Gardener", including those like [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] and [[Gustave Doré]] who were responsible for entire editions of La Fontaine's work. On the other hand, Jean-Charles Cazin's 1892 oil painting of ''L'ours et l'amateur des jardins'' dispenses with the bear altogether. It is a pure landscape showing a southern farm with the ancient gardener slumbering in the foreground. An etching of this was made by Edmond-Jules Pennequin in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.idburyprints.com/index.php?page=artist_print_view.php&amp;pid=6115&amp;keyword=&amp;artist=&amp;medium=&amp;subject=&amp;sign=&amp;price=&amp;page1=1 View at the Idbury Prints site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005003838/https://www.idburyprints.com/index.php?page=artist_print_view.php&amp;pid=6115&amp;keyword=&amp;artist=&amp;medium=&amp;subject=&amp;sign=&amp;price=&amp;page1=1 |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other series that include the fable are the innovative water colours that [[Gustave Moreau]] painted in 1886&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0003/m504101_94ce1535_p.jpg French government site]&lt;/ref&gt; and the coloured etchings by [[Marc Chagall]] (1951) of which ''L'ours et l'amateur des jardins'' is number 83.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franklinbowlesgallery.com/SF/Artists/Chagall/pages/Etchings/fables/CHAG0945P.htm An illustration is available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225115837/http://www.franklinbowlesgallery.com/SF/Artists/Chagall/pages/Etchings/fables/CHAG0945P.htm |date=2011-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally Yves Alix (1890–1969) produced a lithograph of the fable for a de luxe edition of ''20 Fables'' (1966) incorporating the work of as many modernist artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/6349033 Live Auctioneers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Democratic Paradox''''' is a collection of essays by the Belgian [[political theory|political theorist]] [[Chantal Mouffe]], published in 2000 by [[Verso Books]]. The essays offer further discussion of the concept of [[radical democracy]] that Mouffe explored in ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'', co-authored by [[Ernesto Laclau]]. In this collection, Mouffe deals with the specific conflicts between the [[post-Marxist]] democratic theory that she and Laclau theorized in ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy'' and the competing democratic theories proposed by [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[John Rawls]]. Verso's UK blog characterizes ''The Democratic Paradox'' as Mouffe's most accessible review of her perspectives on radical democracy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://versouk.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/radical-thinkers-question-10-chantal-mouffe-%E2%80%98the-democratic-paradox%E2%80%99/ Radical Thinkers Question 10: CHANTAL MOUFFE 'The Democratic Paradox']'' Verso UK blog, July 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The eponymous paradox of democracy that this collection of essays deals with is the internal conflict within modern democracy that is created by the union of two separate strands of political thought: the tradition of [[classical liberalism]] and the tradition of [[Democracy|democratic theory]], forming the institution of [[liberal democracy]]. {{Quotation|We are dealing with a new political form of society whose specificity comes from the articulation between two different traditions. On one side we have the liberal tradition constituted by the rule of law, the defence of human rights and the respect of individual liberty; on the other the democratic tradition whose main ideas are those of equality, identity between governing and governed and popular sovereignty. There is no necessary relation between those two distinct traditions but only a contingent historical articulation....Let's not forget that, while we tend today to take the link between liberalism and democracy for granted, their union, far from being a smooth process, was the result of bitter struggles.| Mouffe, ''The Democratic Paradox'', pp. 2-3&lt;ref&gt;Mouffe, C. (2000). ''The Democratic Paradox''. New York, NY: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mouffe sees Radical Democracy as a means for continuing to sustain the balance between the values of liberalism and democracy. This balance is accomplished through the [[agonism|agonistic]] practice of valuing and sustaining dissent in the democratic process as a more important goal than [[consensus]]. This point is where ''Radical Democratic'' theory diverges from both Habermas and Rawls, as it contradicts Habermas's quest for [[communicative rationality|rational consensus]] and Rawls's project for [[political liberalism]]. Mouffe describes the importance of the radical democratic alternative in a 2009 interview, saying that "The aim of a pluralist democracy is to provide the institutions that will allow them to take an agonistic form, in which opponents will treat each other not as enemies to be destroyed, but as adversaries who will fight for the victory of their position while recognising the right of their opponents to fight for theirs. An agonistic democracy requires the availability of a choice between real alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/11/agonistic-democracy-bnp-post The Books Interview: Chantal Mouffe]''. Nina Power, ''The New Statesman'', November 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terse RDF Triple Language''' ('''Turtle''') is a [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] and [[file format]] for expressing data in the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) data model. Turtle syntax is similar to that of [[SPARQL]], an [[RDF query language]].

RDF represents information using [[semantic triple]]s, which comprise a subject, predicate, and object. Each item in the triple is expressed as a Web [[URI]]. Turtle provides a way to group three URIs to make a triple, and provides ways to abbreviate such information, for example by factoring out common portions of URIs. For example:

  &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;http://example.org/person/Mark_Twain&gt;
    &amp;lt;http://example.org/relation/author&gt;
    &amp;lt;http://example.org/books/Huckleberry_Finn&gt; .&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==History==
Turtle was defined by Dave Beckett as a subset of [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and [[Dan Connolly (computer scientist)|Dan Connolly]]'s [[Notation3]] (N3) language, and a superset of the minimal [[N-Triples]] format. Unlike full N3, which has an expressive power that goes much beyond RDF, Turtle can only serialize valid RDF graphs. Turtle is an alternative to [[RDF/XML]], the originally unique syntax and standard for writing RDF. As opposed to RDF/XML, Turtle does not rely on [[XML]] and is generally recognized as being more readable and easier to edit manually than its XML counterpart.

[[SPARQL]], the query language for RDF, uses a syntax similar to Turtle for expressing query patterns.

In 2011, a working group of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) started working on an updated version of RDF, with the intention of publishing it along with a standardised version of Turtle. This Turtle specification was published as a W3C recommendation on 25 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/ |title=RDF 1.1 Turtle -  Terse RDF Triple LanguageTurtle  |date=25 February 2014 |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant proportion of RDF toolkits include Turtle parsing and serializing capability. Some examples of such toolkits are [[Redland RDF Application Framework|Redland]], [[Sesame (framework)|Sesame]], [[Jena (framework)|Jena]] and [[RDFLib]].

==Example==
The following example defines 3 prefixes ("rdf", "dc", and "ex"), and uses them in expressing a statement about the editorship of the RDF/XML document:
&lt;source lang="turtle"&gt;
 @prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
 @prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .
 @prefix ex: &lt;http://example.org/stuff/1.0/&gt; .
 
 &lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar&gt;
   dc:title "RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)" ;
   ex:editor [
     ex:fullname "Dave Beckett";
     ex:homePage &lt;http://purl.org/net/dajobe/&gt;
   ] . 
&lt;/source&gt;
(Turtle examples are also valid [[Notation3]]).

The example encodes an RDF graph made of four triples, which express these facts:

*The W3C technical report on RDF syntax and grammar has the title ''RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)''.
*That report's editor is a certain individual, who in turn
**Has full name ''Dave Beckett''.
**Has a home page at a certain place.

Here are the triples made explicit in [[N-Triples]] notation:
&lt;source lang="turtle"&gt;
 &lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title&gt; "RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)" .
 &lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar&gt; &lt;http://example.org/stuff/1.0/editor&gt; _:bnode .
 _:bnode &lt;http://example.org/stuff/1.0/fullname&gt; "Dave Beckett" .
 _:bnode &lt;http://example.org/stuff/1.0/homePage&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/net/dajobe/&gt; .
&lt;/source&gt;
The [[MIME type]] of Turtle is &lt;code&gt;text/turtle&lt;/code&gt;. The character encoding of Turtle content is always [[UTF-8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/turtle |title=MIME Media Types: text/turtle |date=28 March 2011 |publisher=[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Named graphs==
[[TriG (syntax)|TriG]] RDF syntax extends Turtle with support for [[named graph]]s.

'''USS ''Maine'' (ACR-1)''' was an American naval ship that sank in [[Havana Harbor]]  during the [[Cuban War of Independence|Cuban revolt against Spain]], an event that became a major political issue in the [[United States]].

Commissioned in 1895, this was the first [[United States Navy]] ship to be named after the state of [[Maine]].{{efn|name=commissioning}}{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=35}} Originally classified as an [[armored cruiser]], she was built in response to the [[Brazilian battleship Riachuelo|''Riachuelo'']] and the increase of naval forces in Latin America. ''Maine'' and her near-sister ship {{USS|Texas|1892|2}} reflected the latest European naval developments, with the layout of her main armament resembling that of the British [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|2}} and comparable Italian ships. Her two [[gun turret]]s were staggered [[En echelon (turret arrangement)|''en échelon'']], rather than on the centerline, with the fore gun [[sponson]]ed out on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side of the ship and the aft gun on the port side,&lt;ref name="hazegray"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/battleships/us_pd.htm#maine | title=World Battleships List: US Predreadnought Battleships | publisher=Hazegray.org | date=6 October 2001 | accessdate=10 November 2015 | author=Toppan, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; with cutaways in the superstructure to allow both to fire ahead, astern or across her deck. She dispensed with full masts thanks to the increased reliability of [[steam engine]]s by the time of her construction.

Despite these advances, ''Maine'' was out of date by the time she entered service, due to her protracted construction period and changes in the role of ships of her type, naval tactics and technology. It took nine years to complete, and nearly three years for the armor plating alone.&lt;ref name="hazegray" /&gt; The general use of steel in warship construction precluded the use of ramming without danger to the attacking vessel. The potential for blast damage from firing end on or cross-deck discouraged ''en échelon'' gun placement. The changing role of the armored cruiser from a small, heavily armored substitute for the battleship to a fast, lightly armored commerce raider also hastened her obsolescence. Despite these disadvantages, ''Maine'' was seen as an advance in American warship design.

''Maine'' is best known for her loss in [[Havana Harbor]] on the evening of 15 February 1898. Sent to protect U.S. interests during the [[Cuban War of Independence|Cuban revolt against Spain]], she exploded suddenly, without warning, and sank quickly, killing nearly three quarters of her crew. The cause and responsibility for her sinking remained unclear after a board of inquiry investigated. Nevertheless, popular opinion in the U.S., fanned by inflammatory articles printed in the "[[Yellow journalism|yellow press]]" by [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]], blamed Spain. The phrase, "Remember the ''Maine!'' To hell with Spain!", became a rallying cry for action, which came with the [[Spanish–American War]] later that year. While the sinking of ''Maine'' was not a direct cause for action, it served as a catalyst, accelerating the approach to a diplomatic impasse between the U.S. and Spain.

The cause of ''Maine''{{'}}s sinking remains a subject of speculation. In 1898, an investigation of the explosion was carried out by a naval board appointed under the McKinley Administration. The consensus of the board was that ''Maine'' was destroyed by an external explosion from a mine. However, the validity of this investigation has been challenged. [[George W. Melville]], a chief engineer in the Navy, proposed that a more likely cause for the sinking was from a magazine explosion within the vessel. The Navy's leading ordnance expert, Philip R. Alger, took this theory further by suggesting that the magazines were ignited by a spontaneous fire in a coal bunker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Destruction of the Maine (1898) |url = https://www.loc.gov/law/help/usconlaw/pdf/Maine.1898.pdf|date=August 4, 2009|work=The Law Library of Congress |publisher = www.loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coal used in ''Maine'' was bituminous coal, which is known for releasing [[firedamp]], a gas that is prone to spontaneous explosions. There is stronger evidence that the explosion of ''Maine'' was caused by an internal coal fire which ignited the magazines. This was a likely  cause of the explosion, rather than the initial hypothesis of a mine. The ship lay at the bottom of the harbor until 1911. A [[cofferdam]] was then built around the wreck.&lt;ref name="CoE" /&gt; The hull was patched up until the ship was afloat, then towed to sea and sunk. The ''Maine'' now lies on the sea-bed {{convert|3,600|feet|metres}} below the surface.

== Background ==
[[File:Riachuelo 1885.jpg|thumb|The Brazilian battleship ''Riachuelo'', which prompted the building of ''Maine'']]
The delivery of the {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Riachuelo}} in 1883 and the acquisition of other modern armored warships from Europe by Brazil, Argentina and [[Chile]] shortly afterwards, alarmed the United States government, as the [[Brazilian Navy]] was now the most powerful in the Americas.{{sfn|Miller|p=158}} The chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, [[Hilary A. Herbert]], stated to Congress: "if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by ''Riachuelo'' it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port."{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=21}} These developments helped bring to a head a series of discussions that had been taking place at the Naval Advisory Board since 1881. The board knew at that time that the U.S. Navy could not challenge any major European fleet; at best, it could wear down an opponent's merchant fleet and hope to make some progress through general attrition there. Moreover, projecting naval force abroad through the use of battleships ran counter to the government policy of [[isolationism]]. While some on the board supported a strict policy of commerce raiding, others argued it would be ineffective against the potential threat of enemy battleships stationed near the American coast. The two sides remained essentially deadlocked until ''Riachuelo'' manifested.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|pp=17, 20}}

The board, now confronted with the concrete possibility of hostile warships operating off the American coast, began planning for ships to protect it in 1884. The ships had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow [[draft (hull)|draft]] to enable them to use all the major American ports and bases. The maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was similarly fixed, and the board concluded that at a length of about {{convert|300|ft|m}}, the maximum displacement would be about 7,000 tons. A year later the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] (C &amp; R) presented two designs to Secretary of the Navy [[William Collins Whitney]], one for a 7,500-ton battleship and one for a 5,000-ton [[armored cruiser]]. Whitney decided instead to ask Congress for two 6,000-ton warships, and they were authorized in August 1886. A design contest was held, asking [[naval architect]]s to submit designs for the two ships: armored cruiser ''Maine'' and battleship {{USS|Texas|1892|2}}. It was specified that ''Maine'' had to have a speed of {{convert|17|kn|lk=in}}, a [[ram bow]], and a double bottom, and be able to carry two [[torpedo boat]]s. Her armament was specified as: four {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns, six {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns, various light weapons, and four torpedo tubes. It was specifically stated that the main guns "must afford heavy bow and stern fire."{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=24}} Armor thickness and many details were also defined. Specifications for ''Texas'' were similar, but demanded a main battery of two {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns and slightly thicker armor.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|pp=20–21}}

The winning design for ''Maine'' was from [[Theodore D. Wilson]], who served as chief constructor for C &amp; R and was a member on the Naval Advisory Board in 1881. He had designed a number of other warships for the navy.&lt;ref&gt;"Theodore Delevan Wilson," ''Encyclopedia Americana''.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning design for ''Texas'' was from a British designer, William John, who was working for the [[Barrow Shipbuilding Company]] at that time. Both designs resembled the Brazilian battleship ''Riachuelo'', having the main gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and [[En echelon (turret arrangement)|echeloned]].{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|p=21}} The winning design for ''Maine'', though conservative and inferior to other contenders, may have received special consideration due to a requirement that one of the two new ships be American–designed.{{sfn|Cowan &amp; Sumrall|p=19}}

Congress authorized construction of ''Maine'' on 3 August 1886, and her keel was laid down on 17 October 1888, at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]. She was the largest vessel built in a U.S. Navy yard up to that time.&lt;ref name="navy_report_1890" /&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:USS Maine ACR-1 in Havana harbor before explosion 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Stern view of ''Maine'']]
''Maine''{{'}}s building time of nine years was unusually protracted, due to the limits of U.S. industry at the time. (The delivery of her armored plating took three years and a fire in the drafting room of the building yard, where ''Maine''{{'}}s working set of [[blueprint]]s were stored, caused further delay.) In the nine years between her being laid down and her completion, naval tactics and technology changed radically and left ''Maine''{{'}}s actual role in the navy ill-defined. At the time she was laid down, armored cruisers such as ''Maine'' were intended to serve as small battleships on overseas service and were built with heavy belt armor. Great Britain, France and Russia had constructed such ships to serve this purpose and sold others of this type, including ''Riachuelo'', to second-rate navies. Within a decade, this role had changed to commerce raiding, for which fast, long-range vessels, with only limited armor protection, were needed. The advent of lightweight armor, such as [[Harvey armor|Harvey steel]], made this transformation possible.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|pp=17, 20–21, 23}}

As a result of these changing priorities, ''Maine'' was caught between two separate positions and could not perform either one adequately. She lacked both the armor and firepower to serve as a ship-of-the-line against enemy battleships and the speed to serve as a cruiser. Nevertheless, she was expected to fulfill more than one tactical function.{{sfn|Love|p=357}} In addition, because of the potential of a warship sustaining blast damage to herself from cross-deck and end-on fire, ''Maine''{{'}}s main-gun arrangement was obsolete by the time she entered service.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|p=21}}

=== General characteristics ===
''Maine'' was {{convert|324|ft|4|in|m|1}} long [[Length overall|overall]], with a beam of {{convert|57|ft|m|1}}, a maximum draft of {{convert|22|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a displacement of {{convert|6682|LT|t|1}}.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=32}} She was divided into 214 watertight compartments.{{sfn|Morley}} A centerline longitudinal watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] separated the engines and a [[double bottom]] covered the hull only from the foremast to the aft end of the armored citadel, a distance of {{convert|196|ft|m|1}}. She had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|3.45|ft|m|1}} as designed and was fitted with a ram bow.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|pp=28, 33}}

[[File:Plan of the first battleship Maine.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of ''Maine'' showing its echeloned turret placement|Deck plan of ''Maine'']]
''Maine''{{'}}s hull was long and narrow, more like a cruiser than that of ''Texas'', which was wide-beamed. Normally, this would have made ''Maine'' the faster ship of the two. However, ''Maine''{{'}}s weight distribution was ill-balanced, which slowed her considerably. Her main turrets, awkwardly situated on a cut-away gundeck, were nearly awash in bad weather. Because they were mounted toward the ends of the ship, away from its center of gravity, ''Maine'' was also prone to greater motion in heavy seas. While she and ''Texas'' were both considered seaworthy, the latter's high hull and guns mounted on her main deck made her the drier ship.{{sfn|Cowan &amp; Sumrall|p=134}}

The two main gun turrets were [[sponson]]ed out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow both to fire fore and aft. The practice of ''en echelon'' mounting had begun with Italian battleships designed in the 1870s by [[Benedetto Brin]] and followed by the British Navy with {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|6}}, which was laid down in 1874 but not commissioned until October 1881.{{sfn|Parkinson|p=125, 127}} This gun arrangement met the design demand for heavy end-on fire in a ship-to-ship encounter, tactics which involved [[ramming]] the enemy vessel.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|p=21}} The wisdom of this tactic was purely theoretical at the time it was implemented. A drawback of an ''en echelon'' layout limited the ability for a ship to fire [[broadside]], a key factor when employed in a [[line of battle]]. To allow for at least partial broadside fire, ''Maine''{{'}}s [[superstructure]] was separated into three structures. This technically allowed both turrets to fire across the ship's deck (cross-deck fire), between the sections. However, this ability was still significantly limited as the superstructure restricted each turret's arc of fire.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=24}}

This plan and profile view show ''Maine'' with eight six-pounder guns (one is not seen on the port part of the bridge but that is due to the bridge being cut away in the drawing). Another early published plan shows the same. In both cases the photographs show a single extreme bow mounted six-pounder.  However, careful examination of ''Maine'' photographs confirm that she did not carry that gun. ''Maine''{{'}}s armament set up in the bow was not identical to the stern which had a single six-pounder mounted at extreme aft of the vessel.  ''Maine'' carried two six-pounders forward, two on the bridge and three on the stern section, all one level above the abbreviated gun deck that permitted the ten-inch guns to fire across the deck.  The six-pounders located in the bow were positioned more forward than the pair mounted aft which necessitated the far aft single six-pounder.

=== Propulsion ===
[[File:USS Wisconsin (BB-9) engines cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|Vertical triple expansion engine of {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-9|2}}, similar in general layout to that of ''Maine'']]
''Maine'' was the first U.S. capital ship to have its power plant given as high a priority as its fighting strength.{{sfn|Putnam|p=266}} Her machinery, built by the N. F. Palmer Jr. &amp; Company's Quintard Iron Works of New York,{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=26}} was the first designed for a major ship under the direct supervision of Arctic explorer and soon-to-be [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]], [[George W. Melville|George Wallace Melville]].{{sfn|Putnam|pp=266, 271}} She had two inverted [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], mounted in watertight compartments and separated by a fore-to-aft bulkhead, with a total designed output of {{convert|9293|ihp|kW}}. Cylinder diameters were {{convert|35.5|in|mm}} (high-pressure), {{convert|57|in|mm}} (intermediate-pressure) and {{convert|88|in|mm}} (low-pressure). Stroke for all three pistons was {{convert|36|in|mm}}.{{sfn|Morley}}

Melville mounted ''Maine''{{'}}s engines with the cylinders in vertical mode, a departure from conventional practice. Previous ships had had their engines mounted in horizontal mode, so that they would be completely protected below the waterline. Melville believed a ship's engines needed ample room to operate and that any exposed parts could be protected by an armored deck. He therefore opted for the greater efficiency, lower maintenance costs and higher speeds offered by the vertical mode.{{sfn|Putnam|p=271}}&lt;ref name="Brandt 1920 p72"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brandt | first = Walther Immanuel | year = 1920 | title = Steel and the new Navy, 1882–1895 | page = 72 | publisher = University of Wisconsin | url = https://books.google.com/?id=MPtJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 | accessdate =17 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the engines were constructed with the high-pressure cylinder aft and the low-pressure cylinder forward. This was done, according to the ship's chief engineer, A. W. Morley, so the low-pressure cylinder could be disconnected when the ship was under low power. This allowed the high and intermediate-power cylinders to be run together as a [[compound steam engine|compound engine]] for economical running.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}

[[File:Scotch marine boiler (Brockhaus).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scotch two-furnace marine boiler]]
Eight single-ended [[Scotch marine boiler]]s provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of {{convert|135|psi|kPa kg/cm2|lk=on}} at a temperature {{convert|364|°F|°C}}. On trials, she reached a speed of {{convert|16.45|kn}}, failing to meet her contract speed of {{convert|17|kn}}. She carried a maximum load of {{convert|896|LT|kg|lk=on}} of coal{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|pp=32–33}} in 20 bunkers, 10 on each side, which extended below the protective deck. Wing bunkers at each end of each fire room extended inboard to the front of the boilers.{{sfn|Morley}} This was actually a very low capacity for a ship of ''Maine''{{'}}s rating, which limited her time at sea and her ability to run at [[flank speed]], when coal consumption increased dramatically. ''Maine''{{'}}s overhanging main turrets also prevented coaling at sea, except in the calmest of waters; otherwise, the potential for damage to a [[collier (ship)|collier]], herself or both vessels was extremely great.

''Maine'' also carried two small [[dynamo]]s to power her searchlights and provide interior lighting.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=28}}

''Maine'' was designed initially with a three-mast [[barque]] rig for auxiliary propulsion, in case of engine failure and to aid long-range cruising.{{sfn|Paine|p=100}} This arrangement was limited to "two-thirds" of full sail power, determined by the ship's tonnage and immersed cross-section.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|p=20}} The mizzen [[mast (sailing)|mast]] was removed in 1892, after the ship had been launched, but before her completion.{{sfn|Paine|p=100}} ''Maine'' was completed with a two-mast military rig and the ship never spread any canvas.&lt;ref name="cityofart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofart.net/bship/maine.html |title=Battleship USS Maine (1895–1898) |publisher=Cityofart.net |date=11 September 1905 |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armament ===

==== Main guns ====
''Maine''{{'}}s main armament consisted of four [[10"/30 caliber gun|{{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on|0}}/30]] [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mark II guns, which had a maximum elevation of 15° and could depress to −3°. Ninety rounds per gun were carried. The ten-inch guns fired a {{convert|510|lb|kg|0}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s}} to a range of {{convert|20000|yd|m}} at maximum elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_10-30_mk1.htm | title = United States of America 10"/31 (25.4&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 1 Mod 0 and Mod 1 10"/35 (25.4&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 1 Mod 2 10"/30 (25.4&amp;nbsp;cm) Mark 2 | date = 19 September 2008 | publisher = NavWeaps.com | accessdate =9 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These guns were mounted in twin hydraulically powered Mark 3 turrets, the fore turret sponsoned to starboard and the aft turret sponsoned to port.{{sfn|Miller|p=158}}

[[File:Battleship Maine litho.gif|thumb|left|300px|''Battleship Maine'' by Frederick Nelson Atwood. Note the fore 10-inch turret]]
The 10" guns were initially to be mounted in open [[barbette]]s  (the C &amp; R proposal [[blueprint]] shows them as such). During ''Maine''{{'}}s extended construction, the development of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns, which could fire high-explosive shells, became a serious threat and the navy redesigned ''Maine'' with enclosed turrets. Because of the corresponding weight increase, the turrets were mounted one deck lower than planned originally.&lt;ref name="cityofart" /&gt;{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|p=22}} Even with this modification, the main guns were high enough to fire unobstructed for 180° on one side and 64° on the other side.{{sfn|Morley}} They could also be loaded at any angle of train; initially the main guns of ''Texas'', by comparison, with external rammers, could be loaded only when trained on the centerline or directly abeam, a common feature in battleships built before 1890.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|p=21}} However, by 1897, ''Texas''{{'}} turrets had been modified with internal rammers to permit much faster reloading.

The ''en echelon'' arrangement proved problematic. Because ''Maine''{{'}}s turrets were not counterbalanced, she heeled over if both were pointed in the same direction, which reduced the range of the guns. Also, cross-deck firing damaged her deck and superstructure significantly due to the vacuum from passing shells.&lt;ref name="morrison17" /&gt; Because of this, and the potential for undue hull stress if the main guns were fired end-on, the ''en echelon'' arrangement was not used in U.S. Navy designs after ''Maine'' and ''Texas''.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|p=21}}&lt;ref name="morrison17" /&gt;

==== Secondary and light guns ====
[[File:U.S.S. Newark, 6-inch gun LOC 4a14470v.jpg|thumb|Six-inch gun on {{USS|Newark|C-1|2}}. USS ''Maine'' mounted six of these.]]
The six [[6"/30 caliber gun|{{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}}/30]] caliber Mark 3 guns were mounted in [[casemate]]s in the hull, two each at the bow and stern and the last two amidships.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=26}} Data is lacking, but they could probably depress to −7° and elevate to +12°. They fired shells that weighed {{convert|105|lb|kg}} with a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|1950|ft/s|m/s}}. They had a maximum range of {{convert|9000|yd|m}} at full elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_6-30_mk1.htm | title = United States of America 6"/30, 6"/35 and 6"/40 (15.2&amp;nbsp;cm) Marks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 | date = 25 December 2008 | publisher = NavWeaps.com | accessdate =9 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-[[torpedo boat]] armament consisted of seven {{convert|57|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Driggs-Schroeder]] six-pounder guns mounted on the superstructure deck.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=26}} They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|6|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|1765|ft/s|m/s}} at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a maximum range of {{convert|8700|yd|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_6pounder_m1.htm | title = United States of America 6-pdr (2.72&amp;nbsp;kg) &lt;nowiki&gt;[2.244" (57 mm)]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Marks 1 through 13 | date = 6 April 2008 | publisher = NavWeaps.com | accessdate =22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lighter armament comprised four each {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss]] and Driggs-Schroeder one-pounder guns. Four of these were mounted on the superstructure deck, two were mounted in small casemates at the extreme stern and one was mounted in each [[top (sailing ship)|fighting top]].{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=26}} They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|1.1|lb|kg}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s}} at a rate of 30 rounds per minute to a range about {{convert|3500|yd|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm | title = United States of America 1-pdr (0.45&amp;nbsp;kg) &lt;nowiki&gt;[1.46" (37 mm)]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Marks 1 through 15 | date = 15 August 2008 | publisher = NavWeaps.com | accessdate =22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maine after torpedo-tube.jpg|thumb|Aft torpedo tubes of ''Maine'']]
''Maine'' had four {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]]. In addition, she was designed to carry two {{convert|14.8|LT|t}} steam-powered torpedo boats, each with a single {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on|0}} torpedo tube and a one-pounder gun. Only one was built, but it had a top speed of only a little over {{convert|12|kn}} so it was transferred to the [[Naval Torpedo Station]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], as a training craft.{{efn|name=torpedos}}{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|pp=28, 30}}

=== Armor ===
The main waterline [[belt armor|belt]], made of nickel steel, had a maximum thickness of {{convert|12|in|mm|0}} and tapered to {{convert|7|in|mm|0}} at its lower edge. It was {{convert|180|ft|m|1}} long and covered the machinery spaces and the 10-inch [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. It was {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} high, of which {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} was above the design waterline. It angled inwards for {{convert|17|ft|m|1}} at each end, thinning to {{convert|8|in|mm|0}}, to provide protection against [[raking fire]]. A 6-inch transverse bulkhead closed off the forward end of the [[armored citadel]]. The forward portion of the {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} protective deck ran from the bulkhead all the way to the bow and served to stiffen the ram. The deck sloped downwards to the sides, but its thickness increased to {{convert|3|in|mm}}. The rear portion of the protective deck sloped downwards towards the stern, going below the waterline, to protect the propeller shafts and steering gear. The sides of the circular [[gun turret|turrets]] were 8 inches thick. The barbettes were 12 inches thick, with their lower portions reduced to 10 inches. The [[conning tower]] had 10-inch walls. The ship's [[voicepipe]]s and electrical leads were protected by an armored tube {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|pp=26–28}}

Two flaws emerged in ''Maine''{{'}}s protection, both due to technological developments between her laying-down and her completion. The first was a lack of adequate topside armor to counter the effects of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns and high-explosive shells. This was a flaw she shared with ''Texas''.&lt;ref name="morrison17"&gt;Morrison, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The second was the use of nickel-steel armor. Introduced in 1889, nickel steel was the first modern steel [[alloy]] armor and, with a [[figure of merit]] of 0.67, was an improvement over the 0.6 rating of [[carbon steel#Mild and low carbon steel|mild steel]] used until then. Harvey steel and [[Krupp armour|Krupp armors]], both of which appeared in 1893, had merit figures of between 0.9 and 1.2, giving them roughly twice the tensile strength of nickel steel. Although all three armors shared the same density (about 40 pounds per square foot for a one-inch-thick plate), six inches of Krupp or Harvey steel gave the same protection as 10&amp;nbsp;inches of nickel. The weight thus saved could be applied either to additional hull structure and machinery or to achieving higher speed. The navy would incorporate Harvey armor in the {{sclass-|Indiana|battleship}}s, designed after ''Maine'', but commissioned at roughly the same time.{{sfn|Friedman, ''Battleships''|pp=13, 27}}{{sfn|Friedman, ''Cruisers''||p=16}}

== Launching and delay ==
[[File:USS Maine launching 1890.jpg|thumb|Launching of ''Maine'' in 1890]]

''Maine'' was launched on 18 November 1889, sponsored by Alice Tracey Wilmerding, the granddaughter of Navy Secretary [[Benjamin F. Tracy]]. Not long afterwards, a reporter wrote for ''Marine Engineer and Naval Architect'' magazine, "it cannot be denied that the navy of the United States is making rapid strides towards taking a credible position among the navies of the world, and the launch of the new armoured battleship ''Maine'' from the Brooklyn Navy Yard ... has added a most powerful unit to the United States fleet of turret ships."&lt;ref name="marine375" /&gt; In his 1890 annual report to congress, the Secretary of the Navy wrote, "the ''Maine'' ... stands in a class by herself" and expected the ship to be [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] by July 1892.&lt;ref name="navy_report_1890" /&gt;

A three-year delay ensued, while the shipyard waited for nickel steel plates for ''Maine''{{'}}s armor. [[Bethlehem Steel Company]] had promised the navy 300 tons per month by December 1889 and had ordered heavy [[casting]]s and [[forging press]]es from the British firm of [[Armstrong Whitworth]] in 1886 to fulfil its contract. This equipment did not arrive until 1889, pushing back Bethlehem's timetable. In response, Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy secured a second contractor, the newly expanded [[Homestead Steel Works|Homestead mill]] of Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Company. In November 1890, Tracy and [[Andrew Carnegie]] signed a contract for Homestead to supply 6000 tons of nickel steel.{{sfnm|Krause||1p=285|Misa||2p=102}} However, Homestead was, what author Paul Krause calls, "the last union stronghold in the steel mills of the Pittsburgh district." The mill had already weathered one strike in 1882 and a lockout in 1889 in an effort to break the union there. Less than two years later, came the [[Homestead Strike]] of 1892, one of the largest, most serious disputes in [[Labor history of the United States|U.S. labor history]].{{sfn|Krause|p=209–10}}

A photo of the christening shows Mrs. Wilmerding striking the bow near the plimsoll line depth of 13 which lead to many comments (much later of course) that the ship was "unlucky" from the launching.

== Operations ==
[[File:Maine crew.gif|thumb|Crew of USS ''Maine'']]
''Maine'' was commissioned on 17 September 1895, under the command of Captain [[Arent S. Crowninshield]].{{sfn|DANFS Maine (ACR-1)}} On 5 November 1895, ''Maine'' steamed to [[Sandy Hook Bay]], [[New Jersey]]. She anchored there two days, then proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, for fitting out and test firing of her torpedoes. After a trip, later that month, to [[Portland, Maine]], she reported to the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] for operations, training manoeuvres and fleet exercises. ''Maine'' spent her active career with the North Atlantic Squadron, operating from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] along the [[East Coast of the United States]] and the [[Caribbean]]. On 10 April 1897, Captain [[Charles Dwight Sigsbee]] relieved Captain Crowninshield as commander of ''Maine''.{{sfn|Pater|p=91}}

== Crew ==
The ship's crew consisted of 355: 26 officers, 290 sailors, and 39 marines. Of these, there were 261 fatalities:
* Two officers and 251 sailors and marines either killed by the explosion or drowned
* Seven others were rescued but soon died of their injuries
* One officer later died of "cerebral affection" (shock)

Of the 94 survivors, 16 were uninjured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = US Surgeon General | year = 1896 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J9QEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA173 | title = Annual report of the Surgeon General of the US Navy 1898 | page = 173 | work = Bureau of Medicine and Surgery | publisher = US Navy Department | accessdate =2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1898, ''Maine'' was sent from [[Key West, Florida]], to [[Havana]], Cuba, to protect U.S. interests during the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. Three weeks later, at 21:40, on 15 February, an explosion on board ''Maine'' occurred in the Havana Harbor (coordinates: 23°08′07″N 82°20′38″W).{{sfn|United States Army Corps of Engineers|p=Plate 1}} Later investigations revealed that more than {{convert|5|LT|t}} of powder charges for the vessel's six- and ten-inch guns had detonated, obliterating the forward third of the ship.{{sfn|Crawford|Hayes|Sessions|1998}} The remaining wreckage rapidly settled to the bottom of the harbor. Most of ''Maine''{{'}}s crew were sleeping or resting in the enlisted quarters, in the forward part of the ship, when the explosion occurred. In total, 260&lt;ref name="history.navy.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/disasters-and-phenomena/destruction-of-uss-maine.html|title=The Destruction of USS Maine|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}&lt;/ref&gt; men lost their lives as a result of the explosion or shortly thereafter, and six&lt;ref name="history.navy.mil"/&gt; more died later from injuries. Captain Sigsbee and most of the officers survived, because their quarters were in the aft portion of the ship. Altogether there were 89 survivors, 18 of whom were officers.{{sfn|NHHC Survivors of USS Maine}} On 21 March, the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry, in Key West, declared that a naval mine caused the explosion.&lt;ref name="offsampson" /&gt;

The ''[[New York Journal]]'' and ''[[New York World]]'', owned respectively by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, gave ''Maine'' intense press coverage, but employed tactics that would later be labeled "[[yellow journalism]]." Both papers exaggerated and distorted any information they could obtain, sometimes even fabricating news when none that fit their agenda was available. For a week following the sinking, the ''Journal'' devoted a daily average of eight and a half pages of news, editorials and pictures to the event. Its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to Havana, including [[Frederic Remington]],{{sfn|Musicant|pp=143–44}} and Hearst announced a reward of $50,000 "for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 American sailors to their deaths."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wisan|pp=390–1}}. As quoted in {{harvnb|Musicant|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''World,'' while overall not as lurid or shrill in tone as the ''Journal,'' nevertheless indulged in similar theatrics, insisting continually that ''Maine'' had been bombed or mined. Privately, Pulitzer believed that "nobody outside a lunatic asylum" really believed that Spain sanctioned ''Maine''{{'}}s destruction. Nevertheless, this did not stop the ''World'' from insisting that the only "atonement" Spain could offer the U.S. for the loss of ship and life, was the granting of complete Cuban independence. Nor did it stop the paper from accusing Spain of "treachery, willingness, or laxness" for failing to ensure the safety of Havana Harbor.{{sfn|Musicant|p=144}} The American public, already agitated over reported Spanish atrocities in Cuba, was driven to increased hysteria.{{sfn|Musicant|p=152}}

''Maine''{{'}}s destruction did not result in an immediate declaration of war with Spain. However, the event created an atmosphere that virtually precluded a peaceful solution.{{sfn|Musicant|pp=151–2}} The Spanish–American War began in April 1898, two months after the sinking. Advocates of the war used the rallying cry, "Remember the ''Maine!'' To hell with Spain!"&lt;ref name="The Spanish–American War 1898" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times 21 April 1898" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain | url = https://books.google.com/?id=5VhnQgAACAAJ | first = Robert B. | last = Edgerton | publisher = Edwin Mellen Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-7734-6266-3 | accessdate =15 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/record/tris/01001349.html | title = Remember the "MAINE" | publisher = U.S. Department of Transportation: National Transportation Library | accessdate =11 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode focused national attention on the crisis in Cuba, but was not cited by the [[William McKinley]] administration as a ''[[casus belli]]'', though it was cited by some already inclined to go to war with Spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in Cuba.{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|p=30}}&lt;ref name="spanamwar" /&gt;

=== Investigations ===
In addition to the inquiry commissioned by the Spanish government to naval officers Del Peral and De Salas, two Naval Courts of Inquiry were ordered: The Sampson Board in 1898 and the Vreeland board in 1911. In 1976, Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] commissioned a private investigation into the explosion, and the [[National Geographic Society]] did an investigation in 1999, using computer simulations. All investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship, but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded.&lt;ref name="spanamwar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lawlibrary" /&gt;

==== 1898 Del Peral and De Salas inquiry ====
The Spanish inquiry, conducted by Del Peral and De Salas, collected evidence from officers of naval artillery, who had examined the remains of ''Maine''. Del Peral and De Salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker, located adjacent to the munition stores in ''Maine'', as the likely cause of the explosion. However, the possibility of other combustibles causing the explosion such as paint or drier products was not discounted. Additional observations included that:
* Had a mine been the cause of the explosion, a column of water would have been observed.
* The wind and the waters were calm on that date and hence a mine could not have been detonated by contact, but only by using electricity, but no cables had been found.
* No dead fish were found in the harbor, as would be expected following an explosion in the water.
* Munition stores do not usually explode when a ship is sunk by a mine.
The conclusions of the report were not reported at that time by the American press.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], ''Memoria del 98'' (1997 edition), chapter 7 ("La explosión del ''Maine''"), p. 104 {{es icon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1898 Sampson Board's Court of Inquiry ====
[[File:Sampsonboard.jpg|thumb|1898 Sampson Board]]

In order to find the cause of the explosion, a naval inquiry was ordered by the United States shortly after the incident, headed by Captain [[William T. Sampson]]. [[Ramón Blanco y Erenas]], Spanish governor of Cuba, had proposed instead a joint Spanish-American investigation of the sinking.{{sfn|O'Toole|p=128}} Captain Sigsbee had written that "many Spanish officers, including representatives of General Blanco, now with us to express sympathy."{{sfn|O'Toole|p=11}} In a cable, the Spanish minister of colonies, [[Segismundo Moret]], had advised Blanco "to gather every fact you can, to prove the ''Maine'' catastrophe cannot be attributed to us."{{sfn|O'Toole|p=125}}

According to Dana Wegner, who worked with U.S. Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] on his 1974 investigation of the sinking, the Secretary of the Navy had the option of selecting a board of inquiry personally. Instead, he fell back on protocol and assigned the commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic Squadron to do so. The commander produced a list of junior line officers for the board. The fact that the officer proposed to be court president was junior to the captain of ''Maine'', Wegner writes, "would indicate either ignorance of navy regulations or that, in the beginning, the board did not intend to examine the possibility that the ship was lost by accident and the negligence of her captain."{{cite quote|date=December 2012}} Eventually, navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board; Captain Sampson being senior to Captain Sigsbee.{{sfn|Wegner|pp=11–12}}

The board arrived on 21 February and took testimony from survivors, witnesses and divers (who were sent down to investigate the wreck). The Sampson Board produced its findings in two parts: the proceedings, which consisted mainly of testimonies, and the findings, which were the facts, as determined by the court. Between the proceedings and the findings, there was, what Wegner calls, "a broad gap", where the court "left no record of the reasoning that carried it from the often–inconsistent witnesses to [its] conclusion." Another inconsistency, according to Wegner, was that of only one technical witness, Commander George Converse, from the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. Captain Sampson read Commander Converse a hypothetical situation of a coal bunker fire igniting the reserve six-inch ammunition, with a resulting explosion sinking the ship. He then asked Commander Converse about the feasibility of such a scenario. Commander Converse "simply stated, without elaboration, that he could not realize such an event happening".{{sfn|Wegner|p=12}}

The board concluded that ''Maine'' had been blown up by a mine, which, in turn, caused the explosion of her forward magazines. They reached this conclusion, based on the fact that the majority of witnesses stated that they had heard two explosions and that that part of the keel was bent inwards.&lt;ref name="spanamwar" /&gt; The official report from the board, which was presented to the [[Navy Department]] in Washington, D.C. on 21 March, specifically stated the following:

{{quote | At frame 18 the vertical keel is broken in two and the flat keel is bent at an angle similar to the angle formed by the outside bottom plating. [...] In the opinion of the court, this effect could have been produced only by the explosion of a mine situated under the bottom of the ship at about frame 18, and somewhat on the port side of the ship." (part of the court's 5th finding)

"In the opinion of the court, the ''Maine'' was destroyed by the explosion of a submarine mine, which caused the partial explosion of two or more of her forward magazines." (the court's 7th finding) and

"The court has been unable to obtain evidence fixing the responsibility for the destruction of the ''Maine'' upon any person or persons." (the court's 8th finding).&lt;ref name="offsampson" /&gt; }}

==== 1911 Vreeland Board's Court of Inquiry ====
In 1910, the decision was made to do a second Court of Inquiry. The reasons for this were the recovery of the bodies of the victims, so they could be buried in the United States and also a desire for a more thorough investigation. The fact that the Cuban government wanted the wreck removed from Havana Harbor might also have played a role: it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898, while simultaneously obliging the Cubans. Wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the pending risk of war, which had been the case in 1898, lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously. Moreover, since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers, they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been.{{sfn|Wegner|p=13}}

Beginning in December 1910, a [[cofferdam]] was built around the wreck and water was pumped out, exposing the wreck by late 1911. Between 20 November and 2 December 1911, a court of inquiry headed by Rear Admiral [[Charles E. Vreeland]] inspected the wreck. They concluded that an external explosion had triggered the explosion of the magazines. However, this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the Sampson Board. The Vreeland Board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines, not by the external explosion.&lt;ref name="spanamwar" /&gt; After the investigation, the newly located dead were buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] and the hollow, intact portion of the hull of ''Maine'' was refloated and ceremoniously scuttled at sea on 16 March 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navsource.org/archives/01/maine.htm Maine (2nd Class Battleship)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226151809/http://www.navsource.org/archives/01/maine.htm |date=26 December 2009 }}, ''NavSource'' Online: Battleship Photo Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1974 Rickover investigation ====
Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] became intrigued with the disaster and began a private investigation, in 1974. Using information from the two official inquiries, newspapers, personal papers and information on the construction and ammunition of ''Maine'', it was concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine. Instead, spontaneous combustion of coal in the bunker, next to magazine, was speculated to be the most likely cause. Rickover published a book about this investigation, ''How the Battleship ''Maine'' Was Destroyed'', in 1976.{{sfn|NHHC The Destruction of USS Maine}}

In the 2001 book ''Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. Navy and the Spanish–American War'', Wegner revisits the Rickover investigation and offers additional details. According to Wegner, Rickover inquired with naval historians, at the Energy Research and Development Agency, about ''Maine'', after reading an article in the ''[[Washington Star|Washington Star-News]]'' in which its author, John M. Taylor, claimed the U.S. Navy "made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy." The historians, then working with the admiral on a study of the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program, said they knew no details of ''Maine''{{'}}s sinking. When Rickover asked whether they could investigate the matter, the historians, now intrigued, agreed. Knowing of Rickover's "insistence on thoroughness," Wegner says, all relevant documents were obtained and studied. These included the ship's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of ''Maine'', in 1912, by the chief engineer for the project, William Furgueson. These reports included numerous photos, annotated by Furgueson with [[Frame (nautical)|frame]] and [[strake]] numbers on corresponding parts of the wreckage. Two experts on naval demolitions and ship explosions were brought in. Since the photos showed "no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside," they believed the explosion originated inside the ship.{{sfn|Wegner|pp=8–10}}

Wegner suggests that a combination of naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of ''Maine''{{'}}s building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless [[anthracite|anthracite coal]]. With an increase in the number of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to [[bituminous coal]], which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of [[firedamp]], a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly [[methane]]). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was [[iron sulfide]], also known as [[pyrite]], that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves [[oxidation]]. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently [[exothermic]] that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with [[spontaneous combustion]] in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word [[pyr (disambiguation)|pyr]], which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of [[flintlock]] guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a [[wheellock]]. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the [[Combustion|ignition]] capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before ''Maine''{{'}}s explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 [[heat transfer]] study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.{{sfn|Wegner|p=11}}

==== 1998 ''National Geographic'' investigation ====
In 1998, ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine commissioned an analysis by Advanced Marine Enterprises (AME). This investigation, done to commemorate the centennial of the sinking of USS ''Maine'', was based on computer modeling, a technique unavailable for previous investigations. The results reached were inconclusive. ''National Geographic'' reported that "a fire in the coal bunker could have generated sufficient heat to touch off an explosion in the adjacent magazine [but] on the other hand, computer analysis also shows that even a small, handmade mine could have penetrated the ship's hull and set off explosions within."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Thomas B.|title=Remember ''The Maine''?|journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=February 1998|volume=193|issue=2|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AME investigation, however, did note that "the size and location of the soil depression beneath the ''Maine'' 'is more readily explained by a mine explosion than by magazine explosions alone'".&lt;ref name="lawlibrary" /&gt; The team noted that this was not "definitive in proving that a mine was the cause of the sinking" although it did "strengthen the case".&lt;ref name="lawlibrary" /&gt;

Some experts, including Admiral Rickover's team and several analysts at AME, do not agree with the conclusion.&lt;ref name="lawlibrary" /&gt; Wegner claims that technical opinion among the ''Geographic'' team was divided between its younger members, who focused on computer modeling results, and its older ones, who weighed their inspection of photos of the wreck with their own experience. He adds that the data AME used for its findings were flawed concerning ''Maine''{{'}}s design and ammunition storage. Wegner was also critical of the fact that participants in the Rickover study were not consulted until AME's analysis was essentially complete, far too late to confirm the veracity of data being used or engage in any other meaningful cooperation.{{sfn|Wegner|pp=14–15}}

==== 2002 Discovery Channel ''Unsolved History'' investigation ====
In 2002, the [[Discovery Channel]] produced an episode of the ''Unsolved History'' documentaries titled "Death of the U.S.S. ''Maine''" that used photographic evidence, naval experts, and archival information to determine the cause of the explosion. Its conclusion was that a coal bunker fire caused the explosion, and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the coal bunker to the powder bunker.

=== False flag conspiracy theories ===
It has been suggested by some that the sinking was a [[false flag]] operation conducted by the U.S. This is the official view in Cuba. Cuban officials argue that the U.S. may have deliberately sunk the ship to create a pretext for military action against Spain. The wording on the [[Monument to the Victims of the USS Maine (Havana)|''Maine'' monument in Havana]] describes ''Maine''{{'}}s sailors as "victims sacrificed to the imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of Cuba",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9802/15/remember.the.maine/ Remembering the Maine], ''CNN'', 15 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; which alludes to the theory that U.S. agents deliberately blew up their own ship.&lt;ref&gt;Conner Gorry and David Stanley, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=AQkS5MU0q-4C&amp;pg=PA82 Cuba travel guide]", {{ISBN|978-1-74059-120-1}}, 3rd edition, 2004, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliades Acosta]], a prominent Cuban historian, head of the [[Cuban Communist Party]]'s Committee on Culture and former director of the Jose Marti National Library in Havana, offered the standard Cuban interpretation of the sinking of the Maine (that the United States itself probably did it) in an interview to ''The New York Times''. But Acosta adds that "Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, and that should be recognized. But others wanted to annex Cuba, and that should be criticized. If relations with the United States improve, all these things can be re-examined more fairly".&lt;ref name="New York Times 14 February 1998" /&gt; This claim has also been made in Russia. Mikhail Khazin, a Russian economist who once ran the cultural section at [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]], speaking in a 2008 Pravda interview of the need in troubled times to change the psychology of society, to unite it, said that "the Americans blew up their own battleship ''Maine''."&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Khazin, "[http://www.business-gazeta.ru/article/4429/3/ In 3 years, most of our oligarchs will go bankrupt]", an interview with ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', 29 October 2008 {{ru icon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Northwoods]] was a series of proposals prepared by Pentagon officials for the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in 1962, setting out a number of proposed [[false flag operation]]s that could be blamed on the Cuban Communists in order to rally support against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Raising and final sinking ==
[[File:USS Maine (ACR 1), raising her wreck in Havana Harbor, Cuba, 1910 (21272250174).jpg|300px|right|thumb|Raising the ''Maine'' on December 20, 1910]]
For several years, ''Maine'' was left where she sank in Havana Harbor, although it was evident she would have to be removed sometime. ''Maine'' took up valuable space and the buildup of [[silt]] around her hull threatened to create a [[shoal]]. In addition, various patriotic groups wanted mementos of the ship. On 9 May 1910, Congress authorized funds for the removal of ''Maine'', the proper interment in Arlington National Cemetery of the estimated 70 bodies still inside, and the removal and transport of the main mast to Arlington. Congress did not demand a new investigation into the sinking at that time.{{sfn|Rickover|p=79}}

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] built a [[cofferdam]] around ''Maine'' and pumped water out from inside it.&lt;ref name="CoE"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://cdm16021.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16021coll4/id/156 |title=Working in the dry: Cofferdams, in-river construction, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers |last=O'Bannon |first=Patrick |date=2009 |publisher =U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District |pages=70–71 |oclc=503092530 |access-date = April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 30 June 1911, ''Maine''{{'}}s main deck was exposed. The ship forward of frame 41 was entirely destroyed; a twisted mass of steel out of line with the rest of the hull, all that was left of the bow, bore no resemblance to a ship. The rest of the wreck was badly corroded. Army engineers dismantled the damaged superstructure and decks, which were then dumped at sea. About halfway between bow and stern, they built a concrete and wooden bulkhead to seal the after-section, then cut away what was left of the forward portion. Holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section, through which jets of water were pumped, to break the mud seal holding the ship, then plugged, with flood cocks, which would later be used for sinking the ship.{{sfn|Rickover|pp=82, 84}}

On 13 February 1912, the engineers let water back into the interior of the cofferdam. Three days later, the interior of the cofferdam was full and ''Maine'' floated. Two days after that, ''Maine'' was towed out by the tug {{USS|Osceola|AT-47|2}}. The bodies of its crew were then removed to the armored cruiser {{USS|North Carolina|ACR-12|2}} for repatriation. On 16 March, ''Maine'' was towed four miles from the Cuban coast by ''Osceola'', escorted by ''North Carolina'' and the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|2}}. Its sea cocks were opened and it sank in {{convert|600|fathom|ft m}} of water to the salutes of ''Birmingham'' and ''North Carolina''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = Francis J. | year = 1998 | title = Honoring the Heroes: The Raising of the Wreck of the U.S. Battleship Maine | journal = Warship International | publisher = International Naval Record Organization | location = Toldeo, OH | volume = XXXV | issue = 4 | pages = 386–405 | issn = 0043-0374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rickover|pp=84, 86}} During the salvage, remains of 66 more were found, of whom only one (an engineering officer) was identified and returned to his home town; the rest were reburied at Arlington Cemetery making a total of 229 buried there.&lt;ref name="arlingtoncemetery.org" /&gt;

== Rediscovery ==
In 2000, the wreck of ''Maine'' was rediscovered by Advanced Digital Communications, a [[Toronto]]-based expedition company, in about 3,770 feet (1,150 m) of water roughly 3 miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Havana Harbor. The company had been working with Cuban scientists and oceanographers from the [[University of South Florida]] College of Marine Science, on testing underwater exploration technology. The ship had been discovered east of where it was believed it had been scuttled; according to the researchers, during the sinking ceremony and the time it took the wreck to founder, currents pushed the ''Maine'' east until it came to rest at its present location. Before the team identified the site as ''Maine'', they referred to the location as the "square" due to its unique shape, and at first they did not believe it was the ship, due to its unexpected location. The site was explored with an ROV. According to Dr. Frank Muller-Karger, the hull was not oxidized and the crew could "see all of its structural parts".&lt;ref name=miamipaper/&gt; The expedition was able to identify the ship due to the doors and hatches on the wreck, as well as the anchor chain, the shape of the propellers, and the holes where the bow was cut off. Due to the 1912 raising of the ship, the wreck was completely missing its bow; this tell-tale feature was instrumental in identifying the ship. The team also located a boiler nearby, and a debris field of coal.&lt;ref name="miamipaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brecher|first=Elinor|title=Scientists Stumble Upon Sunken Maine|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:MIHB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB72F61AF8CECEE&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0F8479522BD09CA1|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=10 December 2000|archiveurl=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/ussmaine/stumble-maine.htm|archivedate=10 December 2000}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorials ==

=== Arlington, Annapolis, Havana ===
In February 1898, the recovered bodies of sailors who died on ''Maine'' were interred in the [[Colon Cemetery, Havana]]. Some injured sailors were sent to hospitals in Havana and Key West, Florida. Those who died in hospitals were buried in Key West. In December 1899, the bodies in Havana were disinterred and brought back to the United States for burial at Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Patrick | last = McSherry | url = http://www.spanamwar.com/mainefuneral.html | title = The First Funeral of the Crew of the Battleship MAINE | publisher = SpanAmWar.com | accessdate =28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] dedicated the [[USS Maine Mast Memorial|USS ''Maine'' Mast Memorial]] to those who died. The memorial includes the ship's main mast. Roughly 165 were buried at Arlington, although the remains of one sailor were exhumed for his home town, Indianapolis, Indiana. Of the rest, only 62 were known.&lt;ref name="arlingtoncemetery.org" /&gt; Nine bodies were never recovered and 19 crewmen, several unidentified, are buried in [[Key West Cemetery]]  under a statue of a U.S. Sailor holding an oar.{{efn|name=remains}}

In 1926, the Cuban government erected a memorial to the victims of ''Maine'' on the [[Malecon, Havana|Malecon]], near the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba|Hotel Nacional]], to commemorate United States assistance in acquiring Cuban independence from Spain.  The monument features two of ''Maine'''s four 10-inch guns.   In 1961, the memorial was damaged by crowds, following the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], and the eagle on top was broken and removed.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; The Communist government then added its own inscription blaming "imperialist voracity in its eagerness to seize the island of Cuba" for ''Maine''{{'}}s sinking.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Rough Guide to Cuba'' {{ISBN|978-1-84353-811-0}} p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was cleaned and restored in 2013. However, the eagle's head was retained by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, and the body by the city's museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/havana-restores-monument-victims-uss-maine-091350756.html|title=Havana restores monument to victims of USS Maine|date=16 February 2013|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wreck of the Birkenhead.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|Soldiers stand fast on the deck of {{HMS|Birkenhead|1845|6}} while women and children head off in a lifeboat, as depicted in [[Charles Napier Hemy|Thomas Hemy's]] painting "The Wreck of the ''Birkenhead''" ({{Circa|1892}}).]]

"'''Women and children first'''" (or to a lesser extent, the '''Birkenhead Drill''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collected Verse of Rudyard Kipling|author=Rudyard Kipling|year=2005|isbn=1-4179-0750-9|publisher=Kessinger|url=https://books.google.com/?id=76QI2lskupEC|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heinlein|1978|p=169}} is a code of conduct dating from 1852, whereby the lives of women and children were to be saved first in a life-threatening situation, typically abandoning ship, when survival resources such as [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s were limited.

While the phrase first appeared in the 1860 novel ''Harrington: A Story of True Love'', by William Douglas O'Connor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Women and Children First  | work =  | publisher = The Phrase Finder  | date =  | url = http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/women-and-children-first.html  | doi =  | accessdate = 2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id= sgU3wxdI08cC|text=women and children first|page=187}} O’Connor (1860), pp. 187-188]&lt;/ref&gt; the first documented application of "women and children first" was in May 1840 when, after a lightning-strike, fire broke out aboard the American packet ''Poland'' en route from New York to Le Havre. According to a passenger, J.H. Buckingham of Boston:

"... the captain said that he had little doubt that the ship was on fire, and that we must endeavor to get at it. On a suggestion that we might be obliged to take to the boats, it was immediately remarked by one of our French passengers, and responded to by others - 'Let us take care of the women and children first.'" &lt;ref&gt;Howland, Southworth Allen:Steamboat Disasters and Railroad Accidents in the United States (2nd edition) Worcester,1840: p.306&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to a precautionary evacuation of women, children and a few male passengers into the longboat while the other male passengers and crew remained aboard to fight the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times''(London) 27 June 1840, p.6; reprinting a report dated 29 May 1840, first appearing in the ''Boston Courier''.&lt;/ref&gt; As Buckingham was a journalist his vivid account of the incident was published first in the ''Boston Courier'', picked up by other papers including ''The Times'' (London) and also reprinted in a book published in the same year&lt;ref&gt;Howland, Southworth Allen:Steamboat Disasters and Railroad Accidents in the United States (2nd edition) Worcester,1840: p.306&lt;/ref&gt;, thus gaining wide currency.

A more noted instance occurred during the 1852 evacuation of the [[Royal Navy]] troopship {{HMS|Birkenhead|1845|6}}.&lt;ref name="Birkenhead"/&gt; It is, however, most famously associated with the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912.

As a code of conduct, "women and children first" has no basis in [[maritime law]]. According to disaster evacuation expert Ed Galea, in modern-day evacuations people will usually "help the most vulnerable to leave the scene first, likely to be the injured, elderly and young children."{{sfn|Castella|2012}}

In the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s [[Sea Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]] program, "Women and children first" is considered "the motto of the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2014/01/27/amid-one-oath-one-law-changes-the-sea-scout-promise-is-here-to-stay/|title=Amid 'One Oath, One Law' changes, the Sea Scout promise is here to stay - Bryan on Scouting|date=2014-01-27|work=Bryan on Scouting|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:WilliamDouglasOConnor byRitz and Hastings.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Novelist William Douglas O'Connor]]

A well known appearance of the phrase "women and children first" occurred in the 1860 novel ''Harrington: A Story of True Love'', during the recounting of the death of Captain Harrington, the father of the [[eponymous]] character John Harrington.{{cn|date=May 2016}} Captain Harrington’s fictional death illustrates not only the concept of "women and children first" but also that of [[The captain goes down with the ship|"the captain goes down with his ship"]].

{{bquote|"Back from the boats," [Captain Harrington] shouts, catchin' up the hand-spike. "The first man that touches a boat I'll brain. Women and children first, men."...
"Timbs," says he, "give my love to my wife and boy, if I never see 'em again. God bless ye, men."...

[Captain Eldad] paused, wiping away with his sleeve the salt tears which the simple epic of a brave man's death brought to his eyes.
"That was the story, and them was the last words Timbs brought home to your mother ... An' that's the way he died. Women and children saved. That's a comfort...But he died...

"It was a manly way to leave the world," [John Harrington] said. "Life is sweet to me with the memory of such a father."

During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, ships typically did not carry enough lifeboats to save all the passengers and crew in the event of disaster. In 1870, answering a question at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] about the sinking of the [[paddle steamer]] [[PS Normandy|''Normandy'']], [[George Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Baron Eversley|George Shaw-Lefevre]] said that,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vs8MAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA323 The Parliamentary debates (Authorized edition), Volume 200, 21 March 1870, pp. 323–324] H. M. Stationery Office, 1870&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the opinion of the [[Board of Trade]], it will not be possible to compel the passenger steamers running between England and France to have boats sufficient for the very numerous passengers they often carry. They would encumber the decks, and rather add to the danger than detract from it.}}

The practice of women and children first arose from the actions of soldiers during the sinking of the [[Royal Navy]] troopship {{HMS|Birkenhead|1845|6}} in 1852 after it struck rocks.&lt;ref name="Birkenhead"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16576289 "Costa Concordia: The rules of evacuating a ship"]. BBC. Retrieved 15 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Robert Salmond RN ordered Colonel Seton to send men to the [[chain pump]]s; sixty were directed to this task, sixty more were assigned to the [[block and tackle|tackles]] of the lifeboats, and the rest were assembled on the [[poop deck]] in order to raise the forward part of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Soldiers: Gallant Deeds of the British Army during Victoria's Reign|last=Kingston|first=William Henry Giles|year=1899|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23052|publisher=Nick Hodson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women and children were placed in the ship's [[cutter (ship)|cutter]], which lay alongside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wreck of HM Steamer "Birkenhead" – 26 Feb 1852|url=http://capeinfo.com/more/myths-legends-a-old-folks-stories/568-the-wreck-of-hm-steamer-qbirkenheadq-26-feb-1852 |publisher=Capeinfo |accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinking was memorialized in newspapers and paintings of the time, and in poems such as [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 1893 "Soldier an' Sailor Too".

===20th century===
By the turn of the 20th century, larger ships meant more people could travel, but regulations were generally still insufficient to provide for all passengers: for example British legislation concerning the number of lifeboats was based on the tonnage of a vessel and only encompassed vessels of "10,000 [[Gross_register_tonnage|gross tons]] and over". The result was that a sinking usually involved a moral dilemma for passengers and crew as to [[Lifeboat ethics|whose lives should be saved]] with the limited available lifeboats.

[[File:Titanic-lifeboat.gif|thumb|right|RMS ''Titanic'' survivors aboard a collapsible lifeboat]]

The phrase was popularised by its usage on the {{RMS|Titanic}}.{{sfn|Marshall|2004|p=?}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}  The [[Charles Lightoller|Second Officer]] suggested to [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Smith]], "Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?", to which the captain responded: "put the women and children in and lower away".{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=37}}  The First (Officer Murdoch) and Second (Officer Lightoller) officers interpreted the evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children ''first'', while Lightoller took it to mean women and children ''only''. Second Officer Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while First Officer Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=21}}  As a consequence, 74% of the women and 52% of the children on board were saved, but only 20% of the men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anesi.com/titanic.htm |title=Titanic Casualty Figures |first=Chuck |last=Anesi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some officers on the ''Titanic'' misinterpreted the order from Captain Smith, and tried to prevent men from boarding the lifeboats.{{sfn|Lord|1997|p=63}}{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=87}} It was intended that women and children would board first, with any remaining free spaces for men. Because not all women and children were saved on the ''Titanic'', the few men who survived, like [[White Star Line|White Star]] official [[J. Bruce Ismay]], were initially branded as cowards.{{sfn|Benedict|Gardner|2000|page=204}}

===21st century===
There is no legal basis for the protocol of women and children first in international [[maritime law]].

A more recent application of "women and children first" occurred in March 2011, when a [[floating restaurant]] in [[Covington, Kentucky]], tore from its moorings, stranding 83 people on the [[Ohio River]]. Women were rescued first; there were no casualties of either sex.&lt;ref name="ap20110313"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6209508&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines | title=Cris Collinsworth among 83 rescued | publisher=[[ESPN]] | date=2011-03-13 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zakī al-Arsūzī''' ({{lang-ar|زكي الأرسوزي}}; June 1899{{spaced ndash}}2 July 1968) was a Syrian philosopher, [[Philology|philologist]], [[sociology|sociologist]], historian, and [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]]. His ideas played a significant role in the development of [[Ba'athism]] and its political movement. He published several books during his lifetime, most notably ''The Genius of Arabic in its Tongue'' (1943).

Born into a middle-class family in [[Latakia]], Syria, al-Arsuzi studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he became interested in nationalism. In 1930, he returned to Syria, where he became a member of the [[League of National Action]] (LNA) in 1933. In 1938, he moved to [[Damascus]] because of his disillusionment with party work, and in 1939, he left the LNA. In Damascus al-Arsuzi established and headed a group consisting of mostly secondary school pupils who would often discuss European history, nationalism and philosophy. Shortly after leaving the LNA, al-Arsuzi established the [[Arab National Party (historical)|Arab National Party]], an Arab nationalist party with a "defined creed". It was not a success and, on his return to Syria in November 1940 after a brief stay in [[Baghdad]], al-Arsuzi established a new party, the [[Arab Ba'ath Party|Arab Ba'ath]]; by 1944, however, most of its members had left and joined [[Michel Aflaq]]'s and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]]'s [[Arab Ba'ath Movement]], which subscribed to a nearly identical doctrine.

In 1947, the two movements merged, forming a single [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Ba'ath Party]]. Despite the merger, Al-Arsuzi neither attended its founding conference nor was given membership.

During the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, al-Arsuzi stayed out of politics and worked as a teacher. He made a comeback during the 1960s power struggle in the Ba'ath Party between Aflaq and al-Bitar on one hand and [[Salah Jadid]] and [[Hafiz al-Assad]] on the other. When Aflaq and al-Bitar lost the power struggle and were forced to escape from Syria in 1966, al-Arsuzi replaced Aflaq as the main [[ideologue]] of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Syrian-led faction of the Ba'ath Party]].

Al-Arsuzi's theories about society, language and nationalism, which are collectively part of Ba'athist thought, hold that the [[Arab Nation]] will be unified when the Arab people reestablish the Arab identity they have lost over the past 1000 years. The key to Arab unification, according to al-Arsuzi, is through language. In contrast to the [[Latin language]], al-Arsuzi argued, Arabic was far less arbitrary and far more intuitive. Despite his contributions to Ba'athist thought, al-Arsuzi is barely mentioned in Western or Arab scholarship. This omission may be linked to the fact that [[Sati' al-Husri]], a contemporary Arab nationalist, had many of the same ideas as al-Arsuzi but was better able to articulate them.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early life: 1899–1930===

Zaki al-Arsuzi was born in 1900 or 1901 to a middle-class family&lt;ref&gt;Helms, 1984, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=JQ6jPM38qCwC&amp;pg=PA64 64–65.]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Alawi]] origins in Latakia on the Syrian coast of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; His mother, Maryam came from a prominent religious family, while his father, Najib was a lawyer. With his two brothers, one sister and his parents moved to [[Antioch]] in 1904. Arsuzi began his studies at a [[kuttab]] where he memorised the ''[[Quran]]''. Four years later, his parents enrolled him into a [[rüşdiye]] to give him a proper Ottoman education. His father was arrested by Ottoman authorities in 1915 for nationalist activities; Arsuzi later believed that this event triggered his interest in nationalist politics.{{sfn|Watenpaugh|1996|p=364}} His father was imprisoned for a short period before he and his family were sent to internal exile in the Anatolian city of [[Konya]]. After a year in exile, Najib and his family were allowed to move back to Antioch. According to Arsuzi, his father replaced the Ottoman flag with the [[Hashemite]] flag on the Antioch government house upon hearing the news that [[Faisal I of Iraq]] had entered [[Syria Vilayet|Damascus]]. This however, was never independently verified.{{sfn|Watenpaugh|1996|p=365}}

In the aftermath of [[World War I]], Arsuzi began studying at [[Institut Laïc]] in Lebanon. It was here that Arsuzi was introduced to philosophy. Also, during his stay, Arsuzi was able to perfect his French. During Arsuzi's studying at Institut Laïc his [[atheism]] became notorious, and he was often caught saying "Sons of Earth are more capable of directing their affairs than sons of heaven."{{sfn|Watenpaugh|1996|p=365}} After finishing his studies, Arsuzi got a job as a mathematics teacher in a local secondary school in Antioch. However, he later received the job of heading the school district of Arsuz – a job he held from 1924–26. In 1927 Arsuzi received a scholarship from the [[French High Commission]] to study at the [[Sorbonne University]] in France. He studied there from 1927 to 1930, but never obtained a degree from the Sorbonne. During his stay at the Sorbonne, Arsuzi befriended former French colonial administrator [[Jean Gaulmier]]. At the Sorbonne, Arsuzi developed an interest in 19th-century European philosophy; he became attracted to the thoughts of [[Georges Dumas]], [[Emile Brehier]], Leon Brunschvig (his philosophy professor), [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] among others. The books which influenced Arsuzi most at the time were Bergson's ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|L'Evolution créatrice]]'' and Fichte's ''Reden an die deutsche Nation''; of these, Fichte is the philosopher Arsuzi identified most with. Both Fichte and Bergson wrote of the importance of education and in the core there was the nation.{{sfn|Watenpaugh|1996|p=365}}

===The Alexandretta crisis and the founding of the Ba'ath: 1930–1939===

Al-Arsuzi returned to Syria in 1930 and later worked as a teacher in Antioch in 1932. "The awakening was brutal," according to historian [[Patrick Seale]]. The French authorities in Syria prohibited al-Arsuzi from teaching his students about European philosophy and the [[French Revolution]] among other topics. When he was caught teaching his students about the ideals of the French revolution—[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty, equality, fraternity]]—he was forced out of the class. In 1934 al-Arsuzi founded a student club, the [[Club des Beaux Arts]], with the ambition of spreading French culture; the club was frowned upon by the French authorities. Later that year al-Arsuzi began his political career in earnest and became a strident Arab nationalist.&lt;ref name="ppth"/&gt;

In August 1933, al-Arsuzi and fifty other Arab nationalists established the [[League of National Action]] (LNA) in the Lebanese city of Quarna'il. Most of the Arab parties at that time were dominated by the former Ottoman elite or had high levels of Ottoman membership. The LNA was one of the few exceptions; the majority of LNA members were young and had been educated in the West. While LNA initially proved popular with the people, its popularity shrank when its founder [[Abd al-Razzaq al-Dandashi]] died in 1935. Al-Arsuzi was the LNA's regional head in [[Hatay State|Antioch]], from the founding of the party in 1933 until 1939.&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;Moubayed, 2006, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA142 142–143.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Turkey first attempted to annex the province of [[Sanjak of Alexandretta|Alexandretta]] in the early 1930s, al-Arsuzi became one of the most vocal critics of Turkey's policy towards Syria; he became a symbol of the [[Arab nationalist]] struggle.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;Choueiri, 2000, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=4xiI0Q-fHzEC&amp;pg=PA144 144.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 France, which controlled Syria, ceded the province to Turkey in order to establish an alliance with that state.&lt;ref&gt;Moubayed, 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA143 143.]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Arsuzi left the LNA shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, 2008, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=kgfVNLWuy80C&amp;pg=PA91 91.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Arsuzi moved to Damascus in 1938 and began working on his idea of Arabism and Arab nationalism. Disillusioned with party politics, he gathered several secondary school pupils to establish a learning group. At the group's meetings, al-Arsuzi would talk about, for instance, the [[French Revolution]], the [[Meiji Restoration]], [[German Unification]] and [[Italian Unification]], or about the ideas of Fichte, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; Shortly after leaving the LNA, al-Arsuzi established the [[Arab National Party (historical)|Arab National Party]], an Arab nationalist party with a "defined creed". The party did not last long; al-Arsuzi left for [[Baghdad]] at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 1971, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA134 134–135.]&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Baghdad, al-Arsuzi tried, idealistically, to enlighten Iraqis with his thoughts of Arab nationalism, but returned to Syria disappointed in 1940.&lt;ref name="konya"&gt;Curtis, 1971, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA135 135].&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November 1940&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich, 1972, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=KqR5eFb3xGsC&amp;pg=PA7 7.]&lt;/ref&gt; al-Arsuzi founded the Arab Ba'ath.&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt;

===The Arab Ba'ath: 1940–1947===
Around the same time that al-Arsuzi founded the Arab Ba'ath another group, led by [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], established the [[Arab Ba'ath Movement|Arab Ihya Movement]]. [[Patrick Seale]] states that al-Arsuzi issued pamphlets under the name ''Al-Ba'ath, Al-'Arabi'', while the Arab Ilhya Movement published pamphlets under the name ''al-Ihya, al-'Arabi''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Seale, 1990, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA30 30.]&lt;/ref&gt; While Aflaq and al-Bitar left work to focus on the party organisation, al-Arsuzi worked as a teacher until 1959.&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; There were not many members in the party, and most of them used their time reading, writing and translating works. In June 1941 al-Arsuzi was exiled from Damascus, three members were arrested and the remaining members fled. The following year, in 1942, al-Arsuzi and his associates tried to revitalise the party, but the attempt failed. One of his associates claims that al-Arsuzi had become bitter and even paranoid during his one-year exile, exclaiming that the group "loved the people and hated the individual; [his group] held the whole sacred, but they despised the parts".&lt;ref name="gerfre"&gt;Curtis, 1971, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA137 137–138.]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1944 the majority of Arab Ba'ath members had left the organisation for the more active Arab Ihya Movement (renamed to Arab Ba'ath Movement in 1943).&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; Relations between Aflaq and al-Arsuzi were bitter at best; al-Arsuzi accused Aflaq of stealing his party's name.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

At the same time, al-Arsuzi's interest in politics was waning, and he spent an increasing amount of his time engaging in [[philology]]. In 1943 this work culminated in the publication of a book, ''The Genius of Arabic in its Tongue'', an analysis of the roots and distinctive features of the Arabic language (see the [[#Culture and language|Culture and language]] section). Despite this, al-Arsuzi appeared increasing unbalanced mentally. Several people noted that he became less social, and was more inclined to shun social contacts and friends. He would later suffer from delusions.&lt;ref name="ppf"/&gt; He was forced to move on again in 1949, this time living in [[Lattakia]] and later moving to live with his mother in [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]. It was there that his mother would die, poverty-stricken.&lt;ref name="ppt"&gt;Curtis, 1971, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA138 138.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of his associates, al-Arsuzi himself spent a great deal of time living in "extreme poverty", reduced "to a life of penury and persecution" by the French authorities.&lt;ref name="ppf"&gt;Seale, 1990, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA28 28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Arsuzi's popularity within his own ranks lessened after [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]]'s coup in Iraq. While Aflaq and al-Bitar founded the [[Syrian Committee to Help Iraq]] to support Iraq during the [[Anglo-Iraqi War|Anglo–Iraqi War]], al-Arsuzi opposed any involvement on the grounds that al-Gaylani's policies would fail. While several Arab Ba'ath members agreed with al-Arsuzi's conclusion, the majority were attracted to Aflaq's [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 1971, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA139 139.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the Arab Ba'ath's failure was al-Arsuzi's deep mistrust of others; when a party member had written a manifesto entitled ''Arab Ba'ath'', al-Arsuzi "saw in it an imperialist plot to block his way to the people".&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, 1971, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=1zxOruujp_IC&amp;pg=PA138 138–139.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Ba'ath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, was merged into the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947. During negotiations [[Wahib al-Ghanim]] and [[Jalal al-Sayyid]], not al-Arsuzi, represented the Arab Ba'ath, while Aflaq and al-Bitar represented the Arab Ba'ath Movement. The only policy issue which was discussed in great detail was how socialist the party was going to be. The groups came to an agreement; the Ba'ath movement became radicalised, and moved further to the left. Al-Arsuzi did not attend the founding congress, nor was he given membership in the new party.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, 1990, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA34 34.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life and death: 1948–1968===
[[File:The veteran Baath Party philosopher Zaki al-Arsuzi in the early 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|170px|al-Arsuzi as seen in the early 1960s]]
After his return from Baghdad in 1940, al-Arsuzi had gained a position teaching philosophy, but he was soon dismissed from it. From 1945 until 1952 he worked again as a secondary teacher, first in [[Hama]] and then in [[Aleppo]], and from 1952 until his retirement in 1959, he taught in a teacher training college.&lt;ref&gt;Charif, 2000, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, in the wake of the Sixth National Congress of the Ba'ath Party and the party's gradual alienation from its founders Aflaq and Bitar, [[Hafiz al-Asad]] arranged for Arsuzi to help with Ba'athist ideological formation in the army,&lt;ref&gt;Commins, 2004, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=_EhACvcqVXkC&amp;pg=PA47 47.]&lt;/ref&gt; and later ensured that he was granted a state pension.&lt;ref name="ppfive"&gt;Seale, 1990, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA89 89.]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Arsuzi was elected to a seat in the National Command of the [[Ba'ath Party]] in 1965. [[Salah Jadid]], the Ba'ath Party strongman at the time, opposed Aflaq's and al-Bitar's leadership of the party and, because of it, wanted al-Arsuzi to replace them as the original founder of Ba'athist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Choueiri, 2010, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=pgmc35nCzjIC&amp;pg=PA113 113.]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Ba'ath Party split of 1966 (the party split into two branches, one [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-led faction)|Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party]] and one [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Syrian-led Ba'ath Party]]) al-Arsuzi became the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party's main ideologue, while Aflaq was the ''de jure'' ideologue of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party.&lt;ref&gt;Bengio, 1998, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=9EIx365fH4gC&amp;pg=PA218 218.]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1966 to 1968 al-Arsuzi acted as al-Assad's and Jadid's personal ideological mentor.&lt;ref name="mentor"&gt;Moubayed, 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA144 144.]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Arsuzi died in Damascus on 2 July 1968.&lt;ref name="ppfive"/&gt;

==Al-Arsuzi's thought==
{{further|Ba'athism}}
{{Ba'athism sidebar}}

===Arab Nation===
{{main|Arab Nation}}

Al-Arsuzi's central thought was the unification of the Arab Nation. He believed that the Arab Nation could trace its roots to the pre-Islamic and early Islamic period of Arab history. The historical link to an Arab Nation was more important to al-Arsuzi than it was to other [[Arab nationalist]]s and [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]]s. The only way to create a new Arab Nation in the [[Modern Age]] was to reestablish a link between the Arab people of the past and those of the present through language—the only true remnant of the old Arab identity. In short, language was the key to regain what had been lost (the Arab Nation) and reinvigorate the Arab identity. Al-Arsuzi believed that the Arabs lost their common identity when they allowed non–Arabs to participate in government. The result was that several laws had non-Arab characteristics—these laws, and other changes brought by non-Arabs, weakened Arab identity.&lt;ref&gt;Suleiman, 2003, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=cAJwWEQpsmwC&amp;pg=PA148 148.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture and language===

Al-Arsuzi paid considerable attention to cultural matters, and Batatu records that the only condition of membership in his organisation was "to write or translate a book contributing to the resurrection [''ba'ath''] of Arab heritage."&lt;ref name="Batatu, p. 724"&gt;Batatu, 2000, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as a proponent of the "linguistic image of Arab nationalism", and in 1942 published one of his most important works, ''Abqariyyat al-'arabiyya fi lisaniha'' (''The Genius of Arabic in its Tongue''). His approach was distinguished by its emphasis on philology, but he did also pay attention to problems of the modern state and to questions of democracy and the locus of power.&lt;ref&gt;Batatu, 2000, p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; Batatu has also described al-Arsuzi as having a racist outlook, which proved in the end intellectually sterile and unsatisfactory to his followers, and as having been deeply influenced in his thought by the tenets of his Alawi religious background.&lt;ref name="Batatu, p. 724"/&gt;

Al-Arsuzi argued that unlike the [[Latin language]], which is conventional and uses arbitrary signs to explain certain objects, the [[Arabic language]] formed words derived from the vocalism of its [[syllables]] and "in its expression of a direct representation of a natural object" – unlike Latin, Arabic is essentially in [[conformity]] with nature. Arabic is, according to al-Arsuzi, an [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuitive]] language; there is "a natural sympathy" between the pronunciation of Arabic words and their meaning: an Arabic word is united with its meaning by definition of a [[referent]], which is absorbed in such an operation. For al-Arsuzi, the identity of the [[Arab Nation]] is embodied in the Arab language; it is the language that forms the source of the nationalist spirit. According to al-Arsuzi's theory, European nationalism is based on the principle of causality, while Arab nationalism is based on the principle of spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Choueiri, 2000, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=4xiI0Q-fHzEC&amp;pg=PA147 147–148.]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Arsuzi's definition of language is in contrast to that of [[Socrates]] and other thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Choueiri, 2000, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=4xiI0Q-fHzEC&amp;pg=PA148 148.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
Al-Arsuzi attributed the rise of [[European nationalism]] to revolutions in intellectual, social and economic domains. The first revolution came to being under the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], which gave birth to human casual{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and relative relationships. The second revolution, the [[Scientific Revolution]], led by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], ended the conception of nature developed during the [[Medieval Ages]]. These events created the foundations of modern rationality. On this subject al-Arsuzi said, "man was qualified to know the truth, since what is constructed by reason can be verified by experiment". Al-Arsuzi summed up this particular view of human behaviour and civilization with [[René Descartes]]'s words: "Common sense or reason is naturally equal to man".&lt;ref&gt;Choueiri, 2000, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=4xiI0Q-fHzEC&amp;pg=PA145 145.]&lt;/ref&gt; In al-Arsuzi's view, if humans were rational creatures, each would wish to organise themselves according to his or her own sense of reason, and hence would want to take over the affairs of state from oppressors ([[colonist]]s). The colonists acted as a barrier to such "rational" change.&lt;ref&gt;Choueiri, 2000, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=4xiI0Q-fHzEC&amp;pg=PA145 145–146.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern life existed because of two things—science and industry. Science eliminated superstition, and replaced it with facts; and Industry enabled civilization to create a more strong, organised society where liberty, equality and democracy could become permanent. The experiences of the [[English Revolution|English]] and [[French Revolution|French]] Revolutions proved this; the revolutions gave the individual certain rights, so that the individual "could conduct his own affairs according to his will". 
The demand for liberty would eventually evolve into the demand for independence, literally nationalism. Nationalism had, according to al-Arsuzi, manifested itself in all walks of life, from the [[rule of law]] to the arts; everything in a nation was the manifestation of that particular nation's identity. Al-Arsuzi's thesis marked a dividing line between the Medieval Ages and the Modern Age.&lt;ref&gt;Choueiri, 2000, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=4xiI0Q-fHzEC&amp;pg=PA146 146.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Al-Arsuzi's work and thought is almost unknown and barely mentioned in Western scholarship on [[Arab nationalism]]. When he is actually mentioned in a text, it is predominantly on his irredentist views of the unified Arab Nation. Although his collected works have been published since the mid-1970s, al-Arsuzi's work on the Arabic language, which is central to al-Arsuzi's nationalist thought, are rarely mentioned at all. The study of al-Arsuzi's ideas in Arabic scholarship also lacking. Academic [[Yasir Suleiman]] gives the principal reason for this as the similarity of al-Arsuzi's works to those of [[Sati' al-Husri]], a contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Suleiman, 2003, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=cAJwWEQpsmwC&amp;pg=PA146 146–147.]&lt;/ref&gt; Suleiman goes on to explain Al-Arsuzi's eclipsed legacy as the combination of a number of factors: firstly, in contrast to al-Husri's idea of language, al-Arsuzi's theory is self-defeating because it excluded other theories instead of including them. Secondly, his work was written with an [[elitist]] slant, rather than the [[Populism|populist]] one which al-Husri managed to convey. Thirdly, and in contrast to al-Husri's work, al-Arsuzi's work seemed old-fashioned, due to his use of old words and historical texts; moreover, while al-Arsuzi wrote about the symbolic need of an Arab Nation, al-Hustri wrote about the practical role of an Arab Nation—al-Arsuzi was obscure where al-Husri was transparent.
Whereas Al-Husri was able to prove his arguments with empirical data, al-Arsuzi was unable. Thus, Suleiman writes, al-Husri appeared more informed then al-Arsuzi, when really he was not. The lack of empirical data in al-Arsuzi's work made it look parochial at times, while at other times his conclusions bordered on [[machismo|machoistic nationalism]], which in turn could be interpreted as racism.&lt;ref&gt;Suleiman, 2003, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=F_A9ZQMP79oC&amp;pg=PA327 327.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for his "negligible" impact, according to Suleiman, was al-Arsuzi's idea on the need to replace the traditional Arabic grammar system with a new one.&lt;ref&gt;Suleiman, 2003, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=F_A9ZQMP79oC&amp;pg=PA158 158.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Research and Documentation on World Language Problems]] agrees with Suleiman's conclusion, but further claims that al-Arsuzi's work was "often far-fetched and 'airy-fairy'".&lt;ref&gt;CRDWLP, 2004, p. [http://www.google.no/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=%22al-arsuzi%22+remembered&amp;btnG=#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=no&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=%22al-arsuzi%22+forgotten&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=%22al-arsuzi%22+forgotten&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=4932l7963l2l8275l10l10l0l0l0l0l184l1430l1.9l10l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=647b73c9b1529052&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=645 287.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Ba'athists, mostly from the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party, have denounced Aflaq as a "thief"; these critics claim that Aflaq had stolen the Ba'athist ideology from al-Arsuzi and proclaimed it as his own.&lt;ref name="ppt"/&gt; Whatever the case may be, al-Arsuzi was hailed by [[Hafiz al-Assad]], the Ba'athist leader of Syria, as the principal founder of Ba'athist thought, following the 1966 [[Ba'ath Party]] split. The Iraqi branch, however, still proclaims Aflaq as the founder of Ba'athism.&lt;ref&gt;Sluglett, 2001, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=cAJwWEQpsmwC&amp;pg=PA147 147.]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Assad has referred to al-Arsuzi as the "greatest Syrian of his day" and claimed him to be the "first to conceive of the Ba'ath as a political movement."&lt;ref name="ppth"&gt;Seale, 1990, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&amp;pg=PA27 27.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian Ba'athists have erected a statue in al-Arsuzi's honour; it was erected following the 1966 coup.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, 1984, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=JQ6jPM38qCwC&amp;pg=PA89 89.]&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the majority of Ba'athists still agree that Aflaq, not al-Arsuzi, was the principal founder of the Ba'ath movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ayubi, 1996, p. [https://books.google.no/books?id=dXpOMVvlYFsC&amp;pg=PA140 140.]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, [[Keith David Watenpaugh]] believes Ba'athism was conceived by the "trio" consisting of al-Arsuzi, Aflaq and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], and not one principal founder.&lt;ref&gt;Watenpaugh, 2006, pp. [https://books.google.no/books?id=Jhf3xHnJIa8C&amp;pg=PA228 228–229.]&lt;/ref&gt;
