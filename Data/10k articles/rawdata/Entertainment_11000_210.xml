'''''500cc Grand Prix''''' was one of the first French-made games for the [[Atari ST]]. It was developed by [[Microïds]] in {{vgy|1987}}. The graphics and animation were not well developed in this motorcycle [[Racing video game|Racing game]] but on the other hand the fact that the game has a versus mode is well-appreciated.

==Gameplay==
The game provides a two-player mode simultaneously and three levels of general difficulty. In a single Grand Prix there are 12 available circuits, inspired by real circuits. The DOS and Atari ST version include a save mode after every race. Each race has 9 laps, with six racers (4 in the C64 version). In training mode, there are two laps and only 2 racers.

During the races, the screen is always divided vertically into two, which shows the point of view of two racers. When playing in single, the other racer is one of those controlled by the computer and it is possible to choose which side to play. The view in each half shows the racer in third person and the motorbike control panel.

'''The Arch Street Theatre''' in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] was during the 19th century one of the three main Philadelphia theaters for plays; the other two were the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] and the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]]. The Arch Street Theatre opened on 1 October 1828 under the management of [[William B. Wood (actor)|William B. Wood]]. The building's architect was [[John Haviland]].&lt;ref name=FreeLibrary&gt;[https://libwww.freelibrary.org/digital/item/39189 Arch Street Theatre, Free Library of Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building which housed the Arch Street Theatre was located between 6th and 7th Streets at 819 [[Arch Street (Philadelphia)|Arch Street]]. Famous performers, such as [[Fanny Davenport]], [[Joseph Jefferson]], and [[Charlotte Cushman]], played at what was popularly called "The Arch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pawlak, Debra Ann|title=The Lady in Charge|journal=Pennsylvania Heritage Magazine|volume=XL|number=3|date=Summer 2014|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/portal/communities/pa-heritage/louisa-lane-drew-lady-in-charge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wilkes Booth]] joined the theatre's stock company in 1857 and played for a full season. He appeared occasionally at the Arch during the 1850s and early 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.hsp.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/5117 Arch Street Theatre, Historical Society of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s [[Edwin Forrest]] played many successful roles at the Arch, and several original plays written at his request debuted there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hornblow, Arthur|title=A History of the Theatre in America|page=309|volume=vol. 2|year=1919|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 the Arch Street Theatre had an entire company of American actors, which was a first for American theater companies.&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp40&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b113925;view=1up;seq=60|title=Autobiographical sketch of Mrs. John Drew|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The managers were William Forrest, William Duffy, and William Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludlow, Noah Miller|title=Dramatic life as I found it|year=1880|pages=314–315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYkVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company included [[James Edward Murdoch|James E. Murdoch]].&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp40/&gt;

In 1860 the stockholders of the Arch suggested that [[Louisa Lane Drew]] should assume the management, and in 1861 the theatre was opened under the name "Mrs. John Drew's Arch Street Theatre".  Louisa Lane Drew was the grandmother of Lionel, Ethel and John Barrymore.&lt;ref&gt;The House of Barrymores, Margot Peters&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|For the next thirty-one years the theatre-going public was treated to one of the greatest of all American stock companies. After Drew's tenure ended in 1892 the theatre's stature went into a slow decline until the building itself was demolished in 1936.&lt;ref name=FreeLibrary/&gt;}}

During the third season under Louisa Lane Drew's management, [[Lester Wallack]], [[Edward Loomis Davenport|E. L. Davenport]], and [[Edwin Booth]] acted at the Arch.&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp110&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b113925;view=1up;seq=128|title=Autobiographical sketch of Mrs. John Drew|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1863 the theatre was pulled down and rebuilt (with red plush seats and crystal chandeliers) from the stage to the façade;&lt;ref name=MrsJohnDrewp110/&gt; the seating capacity was one thousand, nine-hundred eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/pj_display.cfm/16554 Arch Street Theatre, philadelphiabuildings.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 [[Moishe Finkel|Morris Finkel]] rented the Arch Street Theatre and presented Yiddish theater for several months, including one week of performances by [[Keni Liptzin]]; however Finkel soon abandoned the project and the Arch returned to vaudeville. In 1909 Mike (Mordechai) Thomashefsky took over the Arch and presented both vaudeville and Yiddish theatre until his death in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/jqp-archstreet.htm The Arch Street Theatre, The Jewish Quarter of Philadelphia, The Museum of Family History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/T/thomashefsky-mike.htm Mike (Mordechai) Thomashefsky, LIves in the Yiddish Theatre, Museum of Family History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamín Rausseo Rodríguez''' (born January 26, 1961) is a [[Venezuela]]n artist, [[stand-up comedian]] and career humorist best known for his character '''Er Conde del Guácharo''' (translation: "Da Count of [[Guacharo]]").

==Biography==
Benjamín Rausseo was born into poverty in the rural community of Musipán in the state of Monagas. 
He pursued university studies as an actor and, in 1981, presented as his graduation thesis a comedic monologue "el Conde del Guácharo." The "Conde" or Count became a TV personality and made Rausseo one of Venezuela's most successful stand-up comedians.  Beyond comedy he was also a dare-devil and stunt performer in the television variety show ''[[Sabado Sensacional]]''. In 2006 Rausseo was studying law and was one semester from graduating with a JD from the Universidad Santa María de Caracas. Rausseo owns a [[theme park]] in [[Isla Margarita]] called Musipán.

==Presidential aspirations==
In July 2006, he announced that he was running for president under his newly formed "Piedra Party," as a protest against the state of politics in Venezuela, and to challenge the presidency of [[Hugo Chavez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used.&lt;ref name=bas2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34–52|accessdate=29 May 2013|doi=10.1353/abs.2009.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from films "[[docudrama|based on a true story]]" or "[[historical drama film]]s" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Jamie Foxx]] all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Ben Kingsley as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), Depp as [[Ed Wood]] in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), Carrey as [[Andy Kaufman]] in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), and Foxx as [[Ray Charles]] in ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004).

In rare cases, sometimes called '''auto biopics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/autobiopic|title=autobiopic - definition of autobiopic in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of the film plays himself or herself: [[Jackie Robinson]] in ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]''; [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]''; [[Audie Murphy]] in ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]''; [[Patty Duke]] in ''[[Call Me Anna (film)|Call Me Anna]]''; [[Bob Mathias]] in ''[[The Bob Mathias Story]]'', [[Arlo Guthrie]] in ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''; [[Fantasia Barrino]] in ''[[Life Is Not a Fairytale: The Fantasia Barrino Story|Life Is Not a Fairytale]]''; and [[Howard Stern]] in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.

Biopic scholars include [[George F. Custen]] of the [[College of Staten Island]] and [[Dennis P. Bingham]] of [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]. Custen, in ''Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History'' (1992), regards the genre as having died with the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio era]], and in particular, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Custen |first=George F. |title=Bio/pics : how Hollywood constructed public history |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=1992 |oclc=24247491 |isbn=9780813517551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study ''Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Dennis |title=Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2010 |oclc=318970570 |isbn=9780813546582}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by [[Rick Altman]] in his study, ''[[Film/Genre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film/genre |last=Altman |first=Rick |year=1999 |publisher=British Film Institute |page= |oclc=41071380 |isbn=9780851707174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's ''Bio-Pics: a life in pictures'' (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheshire |first=Ellen |title=Bio-Pics: a life in pictures |page= |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2014 |oclc= |isbn=9780231172059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, "Taking Hollywood Back" in the 2009 issue of ''Cinema Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robé |first=Christopher |title=Taking Hollywood Back: The Historical Costume Drama, the Biopic, and Popular Front U.S. Film Criticism |jstor=20484449 |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2009 |pages=70–87 |doi=10.1353/cj.0.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Anchor|Ebert}} [[Roger Ebert]] defended ''The Hurricane'' and distortions in biographical films in general, stating "those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... ''The Hurricane'' is not a [[Documentary film|documentary]] but a [[parable]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hurricane-2000 |date=January 7, 2000 |title=The Hurricane |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|stretch}} Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'' was based on [[game show]] host [[Chuck Barris]]' widely debunked yet popular [[memoir]] of the same name, in which he claimed to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404266,00.html|title=Chuck Barris: Lying to Tell the Truth |last=Stein |first=Joel |date=2003-01-07 |newspaper=Time |issn=0040-781X |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kafka (film)|Kafka]]'' incorporated both the life of author [[Franz Kafka]] and the [[surrealism|surreal]] aspects of his fiction.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' tells the story of [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]] but is highly romanticized. The [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', mainly about [[Jim Morrison]], was highly praised for the similarities between Jim Morrison and actor [[Val Kilmer]], look-wise and singing-wise, but fans and band members did not like the way Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary James' Interview with Ray Manzarek |url= http://www.classicbands.com/RayManzarekInterview.html |publisher=Classicbands |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few of the scenes were even completely made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crystal-ship.com/entrevues.php?cht=03 |title=Chat with Ray Manzarek |publisher=Crystal-ship|date=17 November 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. [[Anthony Hopkins]] felt that he should not have played [[Richard Nixon]] in ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' because of a lack of resemblance between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The casting of [[John Wayne]] as [[Genghis Khan]] in ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], an African American actor, as Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in the 1982 TV miniseries ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/movies/upset-by-sadat-egypt-bars-columbia-films.html|title=UPSET BY 'SADAT,' EGYPT BARS COLUMBIA FILMS|last=Times|first=Judith Miller, Special To The New York|date=1984-02-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some objected to the casting of [[Jennifer Lopez]] in ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' because she is a New York City native of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] descent while [[Selena]] was [[Mexican-American]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Kathleen (2008).

A {{nihongo|'''''bishōjo''''' '''game'''|美少女ゲーム|bishōjo gēmu|lit. "pretty girl game"|lead=yes}}, or {{nihongo|'''gal game'''|ギャルゲーム|gyaru gēmu|often shortened to "'''galge'''"}}, is "a type of Japanese video game centered on interactions with attractive girls".&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "the Japanese word bishoujo (or bishojo) translates to 'pretty girl' and bishoujo games have been defined as 'a type of Japanese video game centered around interactions with attractive anime-style girls' (TheFreeDictionary.com, n.d.)."&lt;/ref&gt; These games are a subgenre of [[dating sim]]s targeted towards a heterosexual male audience.&lt;ref&gt;(Taylor 2007) One can define a dating-sim game, in short, as a video or computer game that focuses on dating or romance and may contain erotic content. Several subgenres can be identified: bishōjo {{nihongo2|美少女}} games, in which a playable male character interacts with attractive anime-style girls;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishōjo games are similar to ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' books in the way of narrative, in which the game tells a story but the player may make choices to change how the story flows.

Bishōjo games are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon.{{citation needed lead|date=September 2017}} While in the [[western world|Western]] industries, those games can be considered [[visual novel]]s, the Japanese market for bishōjo games have its own growth unrelated to the Western world.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

They form a sizeable fraction of the Japanese market: the most popular have sold over a million copies, and they make up the majority of [[single player|offline]] [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] games in Japan.{{Citation needed lead|date=September 2017}} Nevertheless, only a few titles of this sort have been translated or commercialized outside of [[East Asia]].{{Citation needed lead|date=September 2017}}

==History==

===1980s===
Bishōjo games began to appear in Japan in the beginning days of personal computers. The first bishōjo game commercialized in Japan appeared in 1982 as ''[[Night Life (video game)|Night Life]]'' by [[Koei]]. The first bishōjo games were not too popular,&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "The advent of bishoujo games came about in 1982 with the Japanese release of Night Life, a PC adventure game. NEC’s PC 88, PC98 and early DOS PCs were the platforms of choice for early bishoujo designers (Bishoujo Gaming News, n.d.). However, bishoujo gaming did not come to fruition until the late nineties when Widows 95 and CD-ROM technology were able to support vastly improved sound, imagery and storage capacity (Yukino, 2000)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Pesimo 2007) "In 1982, Koei Company released Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku [Seduction of the Condominium Wife] for the PC8001 home computer. This game, a mixture of text-based erotic adventure and crude graphics owing to the computer’s eight-color palette, was an instant hit. Koei became a major software company, and the bold new era of Bishojo games, or Galge [Gal games] had begun."&lt;/ref&gt; being limited to graphics of 16 colors or less.{{Original research inline|date=May 2010}} At the beginning of the genre almost all the games were pornographic.

A notable landmark was [[Jast (video game company)|Jast]]'s ''[[Tenshitachi no gogo]]'' (1985), a precursor to the modern [[dating simulation]]. Among early bishōjo [[adventure game]]s it had a degree of polish that previous games lacked. It was also the first to have recognizably modern [[anime]]-style artwork: its characters had very large eyes and a tiny nose and mouth but were otherwise basically normally proportioned, characteristics which today are found in virtually all bishōjo games. Prior to 1985, girls were generally drawn either as normally proportioned adults or [[super deformed]] children.

Some games involved elements of force and brutality. These came to national attention in Japan in 1986 with the release by dB-soft of ''[[177 (video game)|177]]'', a game where the player takes the role of a rapist. (The game's title originates from the number of the [[Japanese law]] criminalizing rape.) ''177'' was not actually the first game designed around this premise, but it was unusually explicit. The game caused debate in the [[Diet of Japan|Japanese parliament]] and was eventually recalled and re-released with the most controversial scenes removed.

===1990s===
The industry gradually moved away from proprietary Japanese hardware to the burgeoning [[DOS]] platform, and then later in the decade to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Throughout the nineties, bishōjo games underwent an evolution from being one of the most technologically demanding types of games (because their detailed 2D graphics required a large amount of storage space by the standards of early computers) to one of the least (they rarely use 3D graphics). Thus, more than regular games, the main employees required by bishōjo game companies today are not programmers but artists and writers.

In the early nineties the atmosphere in Japan became more and more hostile towards bishōjo games. In 1989 [[serial killer]] [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]] was arrested and was revealed to be a consumer of [[lolicon]] [[manga]], causing widespread opposition to pornographic manga, [[otaku]] and anything similar. In November 1991 there was an incident where a middle-schooler shoplifted an adult bishōjo game ''[[Saori: the House of Beautiful Girls]]'', resulting in increased police scrutiny for makers and retailers. Several prefectures began classifying games as obscene and pulling them off the shelves.

Faced with the threat of being forcibly censored out of existence by the government, in 1992 the bishōjo game industry formed the ''Computer Software Rinri Kikō'' (meaning "Ethics Organization for Computer Software", and often abbreviated ''EOCS'' or ''Sofu-rin''), setting industry guidelines for acceptable content and packaging. This organization tamed down the most objectionable content in the "wild west" of the 1980s. Thus free from controversy and fueled by continuing improvement in technology, in the 1990s the bishōjo game industry underwent a decade-long boom.

The first major title of the 1990s was ''[[Tokimeki Memorial]]''. Released in 1994 by [[Konami]] who was on the verge of bankruptcy, the [[platonic love|platonic]] dating sim becoming the first major Bishojo game since Koei's release of ''Night Life''. In 1999, ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' was released by [[Visual Arts]]/[[Key (company)|Key]]. While the title was another eroge title targeted at males for its sexual content, the players began to identify with the protagonist and the idea overcoming "the emotional trials and tribulations of pure love." A late [[PlayStation 2]] [[Arcade perfect|port]] removed the sexual content and sold better than the original leading eventually to two anime adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;(Pesimo 2007) "In 1994, Konami Company was about to close down when fans set up a fund to produce a platonic romantic simulation for the PC engine called Tokimeki Memorial. With no sex at all, it became the next best-selling Bishojo game and put Konami on the map. In 1999, an independent software development house Visual Art’s/Key published an adult game called Kanon for the Windows PC. In the game, the player meets five girls in a snowy small town and experiences tragic love affairs with them. Naturally, Kanon was a sex game, which initially attracted male consumers. But like the readers of girls’ comics, these men found themselves identifying with the protagonists over the emotional trials and tribulations of pure love. Kanon was then released for the PlayStation minus the explicit sex. It sold even better than the dirty PC version did.&lt;/ref&gt;

A turning point was [[ELF Corporation|ELF]]'s ''[[Dokyusei|Dōkyūsei]]'' (1992). ''Dōkyūsei'', whose gameplay focused on meeting girls and seducing them, established the standard conventions of the dating simulation genre.  ''Tokimeki Memorial'', the first dating sim, featured good graphics, full voice acting, and a [[role-playing game]]-like gameplay system. To be accessible to a more mainstream audience, it contained no erotic elements, seeking instead to create a "romantic" atmosphere. [[Sega]]'s popular bishōjo game series ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' also first saw publication in 1996 for the [[Sega Saturn]]; like ''Tokimeki Memorial'', it contained no erotic elements. However, it was unique in that it contained not only adventure-game elements but also a combat system borrowed from tactical combat games such as ''[[Tactics Ogre]]''.

Since the late nineties, there has been a trend towards better storytelling in mainstream bishōjo games. Particularly notable in this respect are [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]]'s ''[[To Heart]]'' (1997), and [[Key (company)|Key]]'s ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' (1999). Even though their gameplay involved little more than scrolling through text, they became hits largely due to the quality of their writing and characterization. Both were first released on the PC with erotic scenes, which were subsequently removed in their console ports.

=== 2000s ===
The bishojo gaming industry has resisted the transition into [[3D graphics]] because of the blocky and distorted nature when viewed zoomed up close. In 2001 ''[[Tokimeki Memorial 3]]'' became the first bishojo game to break this trend. However, low sales make it likely that other companies will stick with the traditional [[2D graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;(Taylor 2007) "Dating-sim games remain two dimensional, despite the vast majority of
other video games presently being rendered in rich three-dimensional graphics. One reason is the focus in dating-sim games on characters. Video games such as Rockstar Games’ 'Grand Theft Auto' can be animated in three dimensions because most visuals are landscapes. Three-dimensional characters, however, tend to look blocky and distorted when seen up close. Konami’s Tokimeki Memorial 3 {{nihongo2|ときめきメモリアル3}} (2001) was the first bishōjo game to be animated in three dimensions, but its low sales likely discouraged other companies from following this lead. Thus bishōjo games remain a slideshow of two-dimensional images plus voice and text.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the industry has grown, with most publishers making releases for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], including download only files. Some of the least pornographic and most successful also branching off into the [[video game console|console]] market. The main consoles used for bishōjo games in the nineties were the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Dreamcast]]. More recently the [[PlayStation 2]] has been the console of choice with a growing number of games for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Nintendo DS]] handhelds. Games ported to consoles usually have adult content removed.

==Characteristics==
The industry of bishōjo games is closely related to the industry of [[anime]] and Japanese [[manga]].&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "Bishoujo games bear a clear resemblance to comic art in this regard and have an especially strong relationship to manga (Japanese comics) due to closely related sets of stylistic conventions. It might even be said that some bishoujo games serve as an interactive extension of manga, permitting the player to assume the identity of a character similar to those he/she is already familiar with."&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the games are pornographic, the majority feature romantic situations with suggestive material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/05/bishojo-games-f/|title=Video: ''Bishoujo'' Games for the Summer|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|work=GameLife|date=May 30, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[dōjinshi]] groups produce bishōjo games, many with the objective to later form a real company or to be contracted by one of the great companies in the industry. Due to the short programming time and relatively small amount of content required in a bishōjo game, barriers to enter this industry is somewhat low, and is the reason why every year dozens of new companies emerge. 
A substantial part of the revenue of the industry comes from merchandising. Fans are often dedicated to particular characters within their favorite games, and are willing to pay premium prices for goods like [[poster]]s, [[figurine]]s and accessories representing them. Several conventions also exist where articles oriented to bishōjo fans are sold, like the popular dōjinshi market Comiket in [[Tokyo]], Japan.

Due to the representation of female characters in the majority of bishōjo games, a great majority of the market is males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=109662 |title=The Bishoujo Game Market: Not for Girl Gamers |publisher=UCLA Asia Institute |author=Ty, Kanara |accessdate=May 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717152408/http://asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=109662 |archivedate=July 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, from the year 2000 some developers began to expand their market creating games directed to girls and presented attractive young men in their cast ([[bishōnen]]). The most well-known and commercial of these titles is [[Konami]]'s experiment ''[[Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side]]'' (2002). There have even appeared a small amount of erotic games that present man-man homosexual relations ([[yaoi game]]s), which take their bases from the parallel subculture of [[yaoi]] anime and manga. Games targeted specifically at female players are not referred to as bishōjo games, but categorized under the broader genre of adventure or simulation by publishers, and commonly referred to as [[otome game]]s or [[Yaoi game|Boys' Love games]] by fans and reviewers.

===Gameplay===
[[File:Wikipe-tan visual novel (Ren'Py).png|thumb|A depiction of a [[visual novel]] type bishōjo game.]]
Bishōjo game elements can be present in practically any type of video  game,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and [[gameplay]] in bishōjo games varies within the genre. There are still some basic formula that defines the genre. The basic characteristics of bishojo games resemble those of [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] books.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "Japanese bishoujo videogames take on the characteristics of highly detailed 'choose your own adventure' novels."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lidor&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2004/06/63678|title=Sim Sex Not So Stimulating|author=Lidor, Danit|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic appearance of bishojo games in the West, {{as of|2005|lc=on}}, consisted of an image in the upper portion, a text box in the lower portion and a static background that occasionally changes extending to the edge behind both of the other two areas. The background images are often reused for various scenes and text descriptors are used to help distinguish differences in the surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "In terms of appearance, these games are unique in that many of them have three distinguishing features in common: (1) a large square box in the center of the screen for images, (2) a horizontally oriented rectangular box (located just below) for text, and (3) a background that encompasses both the image box and text box and extends to the edges of the screen (see Figure 1)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Taylor 2007) "Dating-sim games usually have no animation; the background remains static and changes only when the character moves to another location.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Often, the same backgrounds are reused in different situations. For example, if the character is in a classroom when other students are around, the room appears empty so it can be reused for scenes in which the character is alone. In cases such as these, text-based descriptions of the surroundings, rather than the images on the screen, establish whether others are present. Clearly, dating-sim games require the player to use his (or her)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; imagination much more than do typical video games."&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the games the player does not see their [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] and instead see the game from a [[first person (video games)|first person]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "For the games included in this case study, it is relatively rare (although not unheard of) for the player to actually see his/her virtual representation. Instead, players are embodied in such a way that, although they inhabit a different identity, they see the game-world directly through the avatar’s eyes, and, in this sense, the avatar’s body is experienced first-hand as their own."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some games use various techniques, such as the screen shaking, flashing or going black, to give further immersion by demonstrating various conditions. The games' range of [[sound effects]] are also used to represent the avatar's eardrums.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) ""Demonstrating thorough understanding of this concept, some bishoujo game developers have used various techniques to impact the player’s external retina so that a sense of actually being transported into the avatar is experienced. To illustrate, the screen will flash (''Season of the Sakura'', ''Three Sisters’ Story'') or shake (''Nocturnal Illusion'') if the avatar experiences an impact in the game. Similarly, a black screen is used to indicate covered eyes (''Runaway City''), sleep (''Season of the Sakura''), and unconsciousness (''Little My Maid'', ''Nocturnal Illusion'')

In terms of sound perception, perhaps speakers can be considered external eardrums. Pitch, timbre, range and directionality play an important role, not only in transporting the player to the world of the game, but immersing him/her in the world of the game.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{Taylor 2007} "The main character, with whom the gamer is meant to identify, rarely appears on the screen."&lt;/ref&gt; The characters of these games are less realistic and often limited to only several static facial expression, gestures and occasional eye blinks of which the former two coincide with the text displayed at the bottom of the scene and are constantly reused.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "There are several ways that the perceptual information provided by these bishoujo games is supplemented by psychological factors. For one thing, the bishoujo characters with whom the player interacts are less realistic representations than they are iconic signs. Furthermore, character movement is limited to the occasional eye blink, changing facial expression or gesture. These qualities indicate that the realism of bishoujo characters rely heavily on the player’s ability to imagine them.

Exaggerated postures and expressions speed recognition of character feelings and dispositions while the action described at the bottom of the page shapes the player’s fluid conception of the character icon. In other words, the iconic image presented onscreen requires the player to mentally reconfigure the depiction in the service of imagining events as they occur and are described in the text at the bottom of the screen."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{Taylor 2007} "Additionally, when the main character is interacting
with another person, that person appears in front of the background and remains still, merely alternating between poses (which, like the  backgrounds, are static and frequently reused) to match what the conversation partner is saying."&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic storylines for these games center around a male protagonist whom the player controls who interacts with various characters, notably females.&lt;ref&gt;{Taylor 2007) "Bishōjo games share a basic structure and feel. The gamer plays a male character who interacts with various female characters as well as secondary characters such as family members, neighbors, and teachers."&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction occurs at several points where choices—seemingly trivial—are given to the player while life-altering choices are generally not. These choices eventually lead to various good or bad endings with (or without for some bad endings) one or more female characters.&lt;ref&gt;"The interactive portions of the game arise through options presented to the gamer, which are typically binary, although options with three choices occasionally arise. These options occur sporadically and often involve seemingly trivial choices, such as whether to go to a movie or art museum. Any life-changing decisions in the game, such as whether the main character will donate a kidney, are often not decided by the game player. The game player takes advantage of options to manipulate the main character’s actions to bring about his desired result.

"These results come in the form of endings, of which dating-sim games have typically ten to twenty. Some are 'good endings,' in which the main character ends up with one (or more) of the female characters and lives happily with her, usually entailing marriage; others are 'bad endings,' which vary widely but may involve the death of a female character, one of the characters moving away, or the male and female characters living together unhappily. Usually, each female character has the potential to bring about both a good ending and a bad ending; the player must select the options carefully to get the one he wants."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beating these games does not mean just getting various good endings, but also in some cases bad endings as the goal is to [[unlockable (gaming)|unlock all of the bonus content]]. This makes the way to lose such games by getting the same ending twice and not unlocking any new content.&lt;ref&gt;(Taylor 2007) "Intuitively, one would think that players would aim for good endings, but such is not always the case. The only way to “beat" the game is to play it numerous times, experiencing all the endings. After playing through the game, players can go to the main menu and check their 'status,' which shows how much of the game is finished. To reach a status of 100 percent, signaling completion of the game, all endings must be reached. Essentially, the only way to 'lose' when playing a dating-sim game is not to get a bad ending but to get the same ending twice, since doing so prevents players from making any progress toward game completion. Thus, unlike most video games, dating-sim games are not particularly competitive; they have no final 'bosses' whom the players try to defeat. After getting through all the endings, extra scenes or characters may be unlocked, including,  occasionally, 'harem endings,' which allow the main character to end up living with all the female characters."&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ''[[Gals Panic]]'' is a variant of the classic game ''[[Qix]]'' where the objective is to uncover 75% or more of a picture of a girl. ''[[Money Idol Exchanger]]'' is a puzzle game comparable to the ''[[Magical Drop]]'' series (which is also categorized as a bishōjo game). In some cases, images of girls are used as prizes for skilled play, as is the case in [[Striptease|strip]] [[Mahjong]].  In other games, the bishōjo aspect can be integrated more tightly into the game: in most dating sims, the objective is to select the correct conversation lines while speaking with a female character to increase their "love meter". This type of game resembles [[role-playing game|role-playing]] or [[adventure game]]s. Many are very linear and are essentially interactive romance novels for men (sometimes called ''[[visual novel]]s'').

Most bishōjo games remain [[2D computer graphics|2D]]. The main reason is that bishōjo games are centered mainly on characters instead of landscapes, and for this intention, 2D [[bitmap]]s continue to look better than 3D models (which tend to be blocky when seen up close). The main advantage of 3D models in this context is smoother and more realistic animation, although this is usually discarded by the unpolished look of the 3D characters, in addition to the additional cost of production for this type of work.  ''[[Tokimeki Memorial 3: Yakusoku no Ano Basho de|Tokimeki Memorial 3]]'' (2001) was the first bishōjo game to have all its characters modeled in 3D, although the sales were smaller than hoped, perhaps discouraging other developers from the possibility of changing bishōjo games from 2D to 3D.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many bishōjo games nowadays are essentially a slideshow of 2D pictures plus voice and text.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Pornographic content===
{{See also|Eroge}}
[[File:HentaiYureeGame.png|thumb|Explicit images are normally censored, showing mosaics or bars on the genital areas.]]
While there are a number of bishōjo games entirely focused on hardcore pornography, many of the most popular titles, including all those available for [[video game console|home video consoles]], do not contain pornographic material, and many others only contain a small amount in relation to the story as a whole.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} For example, the 18+ version of the popular game ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' contains a total of 5 sex scenes and two other images of nudity within a branched story the size of a long novel.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The pornographic content of bishōjo games is regulated by the [[Ethics Organization of Computer Software]] (EOCS), the organization in charge of classifying the content of video games in the Japanese industry.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Pornography is prohibited in all console titles, and computer games are assigned a special classification alerting the public of its content.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Also, as in all legal [[Japanese pornography]], the explicit images are normally censored, showing mosaics or bars on the genital areas in order to satisfy Japanese decency laws.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Pornographic bishōjo games are often catalogued as "[[hentai]] games" in the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Japan, they are usually called ero-games, or frequently [[eroge]].

===Representation of girls===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
[[Image:Kanon nayuki screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nayuki Minase from ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' pictured in her [[Japanese school uniform|school uniform]].]]
The representation of girl in bishōjo games varies, but two generalizations can be made. First, most of the girls are portrayed as [[bishōjo]], meaning beautiful, attractive or cute.&lt;ref&gt;(Takahashi 2004) "The women in a girl game are usually young and slender with large eyes and a small nose; they have stereotypically attractive appearances."&lt;/ref&gt;

Two particularly common settings exist: Japanese [[high school|secondary schools]] and  medieval-atmosphered, pseudo-European fantasy lands. In secondary education settings, characters wear idealized [[Japanese school uniform]]s; whereas fantasy setting outfits range from witch robes to princess dresses, and Fantastic creatures like [[fairy|fairies]] and [[catgirl]]s may be found as well. When the game takes place in some other setting, it tends to explore other fashion possibilities, for example, the game ''[[Pia Carrot]]'' is located in a restaurant, in which the girls wear elaborate waitress uniforms.

The female characters frequently act in an endearingly childlike fashion, which is described by the Japanese slang term ''[[moe (slang)|moe]]'' (萌え), a characteristic that is often looked-for in bishōjo characters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reasons for this characteristic are not always merely sexual: sometimes it is used to present a pretty and affectionate character who is beloved and supported by the player. In fact, "little sisters" are a recurring fixture of bishōjo games. A very popular game that emphasizes the characteristic of ''moe'' is ''[[Sister Princess]]'', based on the premise of the player acquiring no fewer than 12 little sisters.

The majority of bishōjo games involve [[anime]] girls and not pictures of real-life girls. Since characters in bishōjo games are minors, the use of anime allows the studios of bishōjo games with adult content to avoid the penalty of Japanese [[child pornography]] laws, which prohibit the simulated representation of characters under 20 years of age. Even so, it is common to find the packages of these games stating that, the characters do not exceed 19 years old.

===Representation of men===
The main male character in bishōjo games is often rendered as someone the player can identify with, thus experiencing the story as he would live an episode of his own life. Often the game is viewed in a [[first person (video games)|first person]] view of the main character.
Since bishōjo games focus on female characters and the player's interaction with them, male characters often receive less time on-screen and the character that represents the player rarely appears; when this happens, his face is usually hidden outside the screen or otherwise, and he might not even be voiced. Sometimes the only male appearance in sex scenes is reduced to a penis entering from the side of the screen, with no other visible parts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dating-Simulation-Games-Romance-Virtual-ebook/dp/B01FQ6IL3A?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=nav_timeline_asin|title=Dating Simulation Games: Romance, Love, and Sex in Virtual Japan|last=Taylor|first=Emily|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The genre is extremely popular in Japan. It was estimated as late as 2005 that bishōjo game sales totaled a quarter of all software produced in Japan. It is estimated that an average 50 new titles are released each month or about 500 annually.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "As a product, Bishoujo games are extremely popular in Japan. Bishoujo Gaming News (n.d.) reports that, “Over 25 percent of software in Japan are interactive adult games of some kind" (Japanese Dating-Sim Game Report). It has also been estimated that approximately fifty new bishoujo titles are released every month in Japan (Peach Princess, 2004). Many of these can be classified under more specific subgenre headings such as “dating simulation" games, “ren’ai" (romantic) games, “hentai" (pornographic) games, and more."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Pesimo 2007) "�e visuals of Bishojo games strengthened the links between Anime, Manga and the electronics culture of Akihabara ward. A new Otaku industry was created where a small crew consisting of an illustrator, a scriptwriter, and a programmer could churn out a product that could sell as many as 30,000 copies. With some 500 new Bishojo titles debuting annually, this genre is estimated to account for 25% of all software sales in Japan."&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishōjo games for personal computers are usually sold in special stores or sections reserved for clients more than 18 years old. Nevertheless, console bishōjo games, which are generally less explicit, are sold next to other video games. At the present time, dozens of bishōjo games are released every month, and practically all the video game stores in Japan maintain a sizable stock of these. The games are initially relatively expensive compared to the Western market of videogames, fluctuating between 8000 and 10000 yen (approximately $75–$95) each, although soon they can be bought more cheaply second-hand.

==Influence in the West==
[[Image:princessmaker2 english.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The English localization of ''[[Princess Maker 2]]'', which was never officially released.]]
While bishojo games are produced in Japan for console market, that is largely not the case in the West where enthusiasm for the subgenre is lukewarm. What success these games have had has historically been dependent on the related industries of anime and manga.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "Eventually, bishoujo games were manufactured (in Japan) for game consoles such as Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast and Sony Playstation (TheFreeDictionary.com, n.d.; Yukino, 2000). Such popular enthusiasm has not been the case in the United States where bishoujo games are unavailable to consoles and the influx of games has been lukewarm even for the PC market. Despite this, however, companies such as JAST USA, Peach Princess, G-Collections and Himeya Soft have persevered in distributing these games to the West and, as a result, 2003 and 2004 were relatively prosperous years for bishoujo game translators and distributors in the United States. This success is in part do to the popularity and acceptance of other Japanese entertainment products such as anime and manga (TheFreeDictionary.com, n.d.)."&lt;/ref&gt; The common visual novel format that make up the majority of translations has been criticized as boring and not actually games.&lt;ref name=Lidor/&gt;

In addition the genre has been associated exclusively with poorly written eroge.&lt;ref name=Lidor/&gt; The popular discussion of bishōjo games is widely plagued by disagreement and disapproval of pornography. The debate tends to be remarkably divided: on one hand, critics condemn the genre as totally pornographic, while on the other hand, enthusiasts deny this generalization. This question does not cause as much controversy in Japan.

The attempts to massively trade bishōjo games in the West have caused a certain degree of public controversy. An example of this is the attempt to release the PC game ''[[Princess Maker 2]]'' in the United States. Though it was never officially released, a few newspapers critically accused the game of sexism. Adding to the uproar was a pre-release screen-capture containing nudity. However, the game is not pornographic; there was some nudity which was already censored by American localizer [[SoftEgg]], and the only way to see any real nudity is through an Easter egg cheat code. ''Princess Maker'' attracted negative attention due to the fact it was widely promoted as a mainstream video game, unlike other translated games which had been kept in adult-only channels as pornography.

The dōjinshi [[webcomic]] ''[[Megatokyo]]'', popular among Western followers of [[anime]], especially in the United States, was inspired in a large extent by dating sims. ''Megatokyo'' idealizes bishōjo games while simultaneously expresses another criticism commonly used in the West against them: that players resort to them as a form of escapism because they are socially inept (This type of criticism is also found in Japan, though in a quite different form: see [[otaku]]).

While translations of bishōjo games in English remain a relatively niche market confined mostly to the adult genre, elements of the gameplay do exist in a lot of games. ''[[Story of Seasons (series)|Story of Seasons]]'', ''[[Persona 3]]'', the ''[[Rune Factory]]'' series, and other games like them focus on the social interaction and the romancing of attractive anime girls. However, such games also offer much more social ties, even if the gameplay may favor social interaction with females.

=== Cultural transmission ===
Western players can use bishōjo games to help orient themselves to the Japanese culture through aspects of [[telepresence]].&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "The current case study seeks to present a series of “classic" bishoujo video games and explain how they function to orient the Western player to the culture of modern Japan through the phenomenon of telepresence. Aspects of telepresence that include transportation and immersion are considered toward the end of offering the player a degree of access to some aspects of modern Japanese culture. It is suggested that, by experiencing a sense of telepresence through inhabiting a Japanese avatar, the non-Japanese player has the potential to obtain a heightened level of competence in negotiating Japanese culture."&lt;/ref&gt; However, because bishōjo games rely heavily on iconic nature, their level of [[perceptual immersion]] is diminished in comparison to mediums like [[virtual reality]]. Instead, they rely on [[psychological immersion]].&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "The difficulty with applying a purely perceptual (as opposed to psychological) theory of immersion to bishoujo games is that their content tends to be highly iconic (see Figure 2) and the player is unlikely to have the sensation of being immersed in the game, at least as compared to other technology such as virtual reality. An alternative approach to understanding how these games immerse the user is psychological immersion."&lt;/ref&gt; These games are constructed around popular culture and other social phenomena of Japan which then combined with immersion and telepresence allows a Western player get better idea of what it is like living in Japan. According to Mathew T. Jones of [[Temple University]], Peter Payne, founder of Jast USA, says, " You’re reaching out and touching a little piece of Japan in the game – you really feel like you're experiencing love and life vicariously through the game characters".&lt;ref&gt;"(Jones 2005) Because the construction of memory and experience can be construed as a profoundly social phenomenon, popular culture plays an important role in mediating perception. Especially relevant to this discussion is the experience of international and intercultural encounters. Fontaine (1993) reports participant experiences of telepresence (including 'realness' and “vividness") in this context, demonstrating the potential to experience a sense of 'being there' across the gap of cultural difference. Further, Mantovani and Riva (1999) make special note of the impact culture has on presence experiences, explaining that '[s]peaking of mediation means speaking of culture, i.e., a network of instruments making up the everyday reality in which we live' (p. 541). This understanding of the relationship between culture and telepresence is exhibited in Peter Payne’s description of bishoujo gaming: 'You’re reaching out and touching a little piece of Japan in the game – you really feel like you’re experiencing love and life vicariously through the game characters' (Bishoujo Gaming News, n.d.)."&lt;/ref&gt; By using a first person avatar with Japanese identity, bishojo games offer an unprecedented means of cultural immersion that, according to Jones, travel and live [[interpersonal communication]] cannot. This is done by taking on the Japanese identity that allows for an intimate perspective of the Japanese culture while maintaining the ability to make choices throughout the game.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005 "By providing a protagonist/avatar with a Japanese identity through which the player is able to interact with a distinctly Japanese world, these bishoujo games offer access to a level of cultural knowledge that is unsurpassed by other media forms. This is attributable to bishoujo games’ ability to transport and psychologically immerse the player, providing the potential for creating a sense of telepresence.

"In a certain respect, these bishoujo games attempt to offer a level of cultural access and understanding that even travel and live interpersonal communication cannot: an intimate perspective on another culture. Stepping into a Japanese identity, but retaining the ability to make decisions permits a sense of belonging and identification that would be impossible in the flesh.")&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some English translations offer [[liner notes]] or in-game text to explain certain Japanese idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "the small companies responsible for the majority of bishoujo translations in the United States and other Western countries actively pursue intercultural leaning as an objective. For example, JAST USA occasionally provides parenthetical notes that explain certain cultural differences to players. In one instance (in Season of the Sakura) the class stands up to greet the teacher. Beneath it is noted: “(Japanese students do this every day when the teacher enters the classroom.)

"Other examples of intentional efforts to educate the Western player in Japanese culture are evidenced by the inclusion of “linear notes" in the readme files of some games and optional membership to the J-List listserv. Linear notes explain in detail the cultural references and nuances found in the game, and the J-List listserv sends out periodic emails that offer interesting facts and news events related to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge can be broken into five main categories: language; cultural events; stories; media; and sexual culture. In the former, language, common Japanese words become a part of the player's vocabulary. In addition, games with Japanese voicing adds an additional level of understanding to the player about the language's structure. In addition, major culture events, such as Japanese holidays, are portrayed. The player also comes to understand what stories and legends are known in Japan, both traditional ones and Western ones and how the latter are seen from a Japanese perspective. Manga titles popular in Japan are frequently referenced in these games and those likely playing the games read many of those manga referenced. Finally, Japanese sexual culture is referenced through the usage of various institutes like [[love hotel]]s, [[lingerie]] pubs and erotic [[public bath]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(Jones 2005) "Beginning with language, common Japanese terms necessarily become part of the player’s vocabulary. Words such as “Oniichan" (big brother) are defined through the context of gameplay. An even more advanced understanding of language can be gained from games that make use of character voices. In such games, the Japanese speech presented in conjunction with translated subtitles in the dialog box serves as a tutorial for both vocabulary and pronunciation.

Beyond language, elements of traditional and popular culture intermingle; giving the player what Peter Payne of JAST USA refers to as “a snapshot" of Japan (Bishoujo Gaming News, n.d.). In one game in particular (''Season of the Sakura''), the player experiences one full year of Japanese secondary school where various holidays (such as Golden Week) and events (such as the Sakura Dance, White Day and the Christmas party) are played out.[...]

"Another domain in which Japanese and Western traditions coexist within bishoujo games is in the realm of stories and legends. Often, to situate action within the game, common narratives are referenced to provide context. These narratives, however, are drawn from both Japanese and Western culture.[...]

"Along these same lines, popular manga that have become increasingly available and in demand worldwide are frequently referenced in bishoujo games. This phenomenon provides non-Japanese players with a sense of expanded cultural understanding and commonality because those who play bishoujo are also particularly likely to read manga.[...]

"A final category of cultural transmission and learning that should be mentioned with respect to these bishoujo games includes sexual culture. This should come as no surprise given the erotic content of many bishoujo games. Japanese establishments such as the “soapland" (erotic public bath), the “ran-pabu" (lingerie pub) and the “love hotel" (specialized hotel facilities where people go to have sex) are just a few of the many examples of sexual culture that populate bishoujo games."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
There are a number of terms roughly equivalent to "bishōjo game" in use, both in Japanese and English, and there is considerable disagreement and confusion about their proper use. There is no clear consensus on the precise meaning of many of the terms below. The naming difficulties reflect the fluid boundaries of the genre, as well as embarrassment caused by the pornographic nature of some of these games.

In general, "anime game" can be considered the most general term, and other names designate subgenres. Here are the most common terms currently in use:

;Bishōjo game, girl game, gal game
:This term designates any game involving pretty anime girls. The Japanese word "[[bishōjo]]" literally means "pretty young girl". "Girl game" and "gal game" are also used to describe these games.

;Boy's love game, [[BL game]]
:Girls' "bishōnen" game where teenage boys and young adult males engage in homosexual relationships. Most such games are ''visual novels'' (see below). See also [[Yaoi game]].

;[[Otome game]]
: A genre which literally means "maiden game", they are games which are aimed at female players and feature mainly heterosexual relationships. They are sometimes called "reverse harem" or GxB games because the genders of the protagonist and the romanceable characters are the opposite of bishōjo games. Otome games will occasionally contain lesbian romance as well.

;{{Nihongo|[[Eroge]]|エロゲー or エロゲ}}, H game, {{Nihongo|[[Hentai]]|変態}} game
:These terms are used in English to designate anime games with explicit erotic or pornographic elements. "H" is a letter used in Japanese to refer to sexual content, and "erogē" is an abbreviation of "erotic game". "Hentai", meaning "pervert" in Japanese, is not used to describe these games in Japanese, but it is common in English. In Japan, eroges are almost always sold for the PC, because console manufacturers such as [[Sony]] and [[Nintendo]] generally refuse to license pornographic games for their systems.

;[[Raising sim]]
:This is a subgenre where the goal is to "raise" a character, training and educating him/her to improve his/her (usually numerically quantified) attributes. This resembles [[role-playing game]]s except that the goal is to improve another character rather than yourself, not unlike a [[digital pet]]. The classic example is ''[[Princess Maker]]'', where the player's task is to raise a girl into a queen. Another is the [[Nintendo 64|N64]] game ''[[Wonder Project J2]]'' with an orphaned robot girl. Many hardcore eroge also start from this premise, in which case the character to be "raised" is usually some kind of sexual slave. This subgenre is called {{Nihongo3|"training"/"breaking" (animals)|調教|chōkyō}}.
:A variation of the raising sim genre involves the recruitment and training of pop [[Japanese idol|idols]] in the guise of a [[Music video game#Rhythm games|music rhythm game]]. One popular series of this genre is ''[[The Idolmaster]]''.

; {{nihongo|Romance game|恋愛ゲーム|ren’ai gēmu}}
:This term describes games focusing on romantic interactions with anime girls. This term is generally used to describe games which have little or no pornography, or for which erotic content is not the main focus of the game. To describe hardcore pornographic games, ''eroge'' is preferred. The games are often {{nihongo|"love [[adventure game]]s"|恋愛アドベンチャーゲーム|ren’ai adobenchā gēmu|extra=in short: 恋愛ADV/AVG}}, or {{nihongo|"love [[simulation game]]s"|恋愛シミュレーションゲーム|ren’ai shimyurēshon gēmu|extra=in short: 恋愛SLG}}.
:;[[Dating sim]]
::Strictly speaking, this term designates [[simulation game]]s focused on dating, the most famous being ''[[Tokimeki Memorial]]''. However, this term is frequently used by English speakers to describe any romance-driven game, regardless of game mechanics used.

:;[[Visual novel]]
::This is used to designate a type of game which is particularly story-focused, or containing novel-like narration in its writing. Examples of visual novels include ''[[To Heart]]'', ''[[Kana: Little Sister]]'', and ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]''. In Japan such games are generally referred to as {{Nihongo|"love adventure games"|恋愛ADV/AVG}}, whereas only such type of games with little to no interaction are called {{nihongo|''visual novel''|ビジュアルノベル|bijuaru noberu}} (predominantly for adult games) or {{nihongo|''novel game''|ノベルゲーム|noberu gēmu|extra=in short: NVL}}.

Also, note that many Japanese games which are not strictly bishōjo games contain elements of the genre. Many mainstream Japanese role-playing or fighting games feature attractive anime girls (such as ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Tifa Lockhart]] or many of the girls in the [[Dead or Alive (series)|''Dead or Alive'' video game series]]), but they are usually not considered bishōjo games unless this is a central aspect of the game.

'''BritBox''' is a subscription [[video on-demand]] service owned by [[BBC Studios]] and [[ITV plc]].

{{About|the play|the film based on the play|Broadway Bound (film)}}
'''''Broadway Bound''''' is a semi-[[autobiography|autobiographical]] play by [[Neil Simon]]. It is the last chapter in his [[Eugene trilogy]], following ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''.

==Plot overview==
The play is about Eugene and his older brother, Stanley, dealing with their parents' relationship falling apart as the brothers work together toward being comedy writers for the radio, and, eventually, television. They discover that their father, Jack, has been cheating on their mother, Kate. It is obvious to the family before Jack even admits it, and they try to find ways for Kate to cope with the loss when Jack may eventually leave. Jack reveals that the woman he has been seeing is dying. 

When Eugene and Stanley find a job where they can write short comedic skits for the radio, they obscurely make fun of their own family. Jack can hear the similarities between the fictional family in the broadcast and their own family, and becomes outraged. He gets into a major argument with Stanley, which turns into an argument about Jack's affair. Later, Kate holds a nostalgic conversation with Eugene, revealing how she had tried to win his father's heart when she was younger. 

Eventually, Jack leaves. Stanley and Eugene move out when they get the great offers for which they'd hoped. Kate remains in the house with her father, Ben (an elderly Jewish man with socialist leanings who provides the play with most of its warmth and humor), until Ben goes to follow his wife to Miami.

==Production history==
The play premiered at [[Duke University]]'s Reynolds Theater&lt;ref&gt;[http://theaterstudies.duke.edu/productions/theater-previews "Theater Previews History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506003305/http://theaterstudies.duke.edu/productions/theater-previews |date=May 6, 2012 }} theaterstudies.duke.edu, accessed April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; on October 6, 1986. Simon has indicated that the smaller premiere venue took pressure off trying to please the critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-08/entertainment/ca-430_1_neil-simon/3 1990 interview with Simon] by Judith Michaelson of the Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; 

The play opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] on December 4, 1986 and closed on September 25, 1988 after 756 performances. Produced by [[Emanuel Azenberg]] and directed by [[Gene Saks]], the cast starred [[Linda Lavin]] as Kate, [[Jonathan Silverman]] as Eugene, [[Jason Alexander]] as Stanley, [[Phyllis Newman]] as Blanche and [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Jack.&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, Frank.

A Broadway revival, directed by [[David Cromer]], was scheduled to open in November 2009 (previews) at the [[Nederlander Theatre]], running in repertory with ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]''.  The announced cast included [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Kate Jerome, [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] as Jack Jerome, Santino Fontana as Stanley Jerome, [[Jessica Hecht]] as Blanche, [[Josh Grisetti]] as Eugene Jerome and Allan Miller as Ben.  However, ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' closed on November 1, 2009 due to weak ticket sales and the  planned production of ''Broadway Bound'' was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/134259-Broadway's_Neil_Simon_Plays_Will_Close_Nov._1 "Broadway's Neil Simon Plays Will Close Nov. 1"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103081555/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/134259-Broadway%27s_Neil_Simon_Plays_Will_Close_Nov._1 |date=November 3, 2009 }} playbill.com, October 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Frank Rich]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: " ''Broadway Bound'' contains some of its author's most accomplished writing to date – passages that dramatize the timeless, unresolvable bloodlettings of familial existence as well as the humorous conflicts one expects. But the seamless merging of laughter, character and emotion that ignited ''Biloxi Blues'' is only intermittently achieved here. There are stretches, especially in Act I, when ''Broadway Bound'' isn't funny or moving but just reportorial and expository, with plot twists and thematic invocations piling up undigested, like the heavier courses at an attenuated Passover seder."&lt;ref name=rich/&gt;

'''Buatier de Kolta''' ([[né]] '''Joseph Buatier'''; November 18, 1845 – October 7, 1903) was a  [[French people|French]] [[magic (illusion)|magician]] who performed throughout the latter part of the 1800s in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]].  

Buatier de Kolta was born in [[Caluire-et-Cuire]] (Rhône, France). He was a contemporary of fellow French magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]].  Many of his illusions, such as Multiplying balls, the Expanding Die, the Vanishing Fat Lady, Spring Flowers from a Cone, and the [[vanishing bird cage]], are performed by magicians today. 

It is the Vanishing Lady that is so particularly known today and still used that magicians now refer to it as the De Kolta Chair.  A woman is seated on a chair, was then covered by a large cloth, and would appear to vanish before an audience.  The effect was a signature piece of [[Richiardi Jr]] – after he vanished the woman she apparently reappeared moments later from an empty trunk on the other side of the stage.

De Kolta is the subject of the book ''Buatier de Kolta: Genius of Illusion'' by [[Peter Warlock (magician)|Peter Warlock]].

In 1903 he died in New Orleans of acute [[Bright's disease]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57520">In [[United States|American]], [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Philippines|Philippine]] broadcasting, a '''city of license''' or '''community of license''' is the community that a [[radio station]] or [[television station]] is officially licensed to serve by that country's broadcast regulator.

In North American broadcast law, the concept of ''community of license'' dates to the early days of [[AM radio]] broadcasting. The requirement that a broadcasting station operate a ''main studio'' within a prescribed distance of the community which the station is licensed to serve appears in [[United States federal law|U.S. law]] as early as 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v53/no3/silverman.pdf |title=The FCC's Main Studio Rule: Achieving Little for Localism at a Great Cost to Broadcasters |first1=David M. |last1=Silverman |first2=David N. |last2=Tobenkin |work=Federal Communications Law Journal |date=May 2001 |volume=53 |number=3 |page=471 |publisher=[[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] |location=[[Bloomington, Indiana]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916201514/http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v53/no3/silverman.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various specific obligations have been applied to broadcasters by governments to fulfill [[public policy]] objectives of broadcast [[localism (politics)|localism]], both in radio and later also in television, based on the legislative presumption that a broadcaster fills a similar role to that held by community newspaper publishers.

== United States ==
In the United States, the [[Communications Act of 1934]] requires that "the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same."&lt;ref&gt;Text as amended, {{USCode|47|307(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Federal Communications Commission]] interprets this as requiring that every broadcast station "be licensed to the principal community or other political subdivision which it primarily serves."&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|73|1120}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For each broadcast service, the FCC defines a standard for what it means to serve a community; for example, commercial [[FM radio]] stations are required to provide an [[field strength]] of at least 3.16 [[millivolt]]s per meter (mV/m) over the entire land area of the community,&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|73|315}} paragraph (a). Retrieved 2010-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[non-commercial educational]] FM stations need only provide a field strength of 1 mV/m over 50% of the community's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|73|515}}. Retrieved 2010-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  This electric field contour is called the "principal community contour".

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) makes other requirements on stations relative to their communities of license; these requirements have varied over time.  One example is the requirement for stations to identify themselves, by [[North American call sign|call sign]] and community, at sign-on, sign-off, and at the top of every hour of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|73|1201}}. Retrieved 2010-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other current requirements include providing a local telephone number in the community's calling area (or else a toll-free number)&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|73|1125}}(e). Retrieved 2010-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt; and (in most cases) maintaining an official main studio within 25 miles of the community's geographic center.&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|73|1125}}(a)(3). Retrieved 2010-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy and regulatory issues ==

===Nominal main studio requirements===
The requirement that a station maintain a main studio within a station's primary coverage area or within a maximum distance of the community of license originated in an era in which stations were legally required to generate local content and the majority of a station's local, non-network programming was expected to originate in one central studio location. In this context, the view of broadcast regulators held that an expedient way to ensure that content broadcast reflected the needs of a local community was to allocate local broadcast stations and studios to each individual city.

The nominal main studio requirement has become less relevant with the introduction of [[videotape]] recorders in 1956 (which allowed local content to be easily generated off-site and transported to stations), the growing portability of broadcast-quality production equipment due to [[transistor]]ization and the elimination of requirements (in 1987 for most classes of US broadcast stations) that broadcasters originate any minimum amount of local content.{{synthesis|date=April 2010}}

While the main studio concept nominally remains in US broadcast regulations, and certain administrative requirements (such as the local employment of a manager and the equivalent of at least one other full-time staff member, as well as the maintenance of a public inspection file) are still applied, removal of the requirement that stations originate local content greatly weakens the significance of maintaining a local main studio. A facility capable of originating programming and feeding it to a [[transmitter]] must still exist, but under normal conditions there most often is no requirement that these local studio actually be in active use to originate any specific local programming.

In many cases, the use of [[centralcasting]] and [[broadcast automation]] has greatly weakened the role and importance of manual control by staff at the nominal local station studio facilities.

Exceptions to these rules have been made by regulators, primarily on a case-by-case basis, to deal with "satellite stations": transmitters which are licensed to comply with the technical requirements of [[Full service (radio format)|full service]] broadcast facilities and have their own independent [[call sign]]s and communities of license but are used simply as full-power [[broadcast translator]]s to rebroadcast another station. These are most often non-commercial educational stations or stations serving thinly populated areas which otherwise would be too small to support an independent local full-service broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Databases/documents_collection/let19981016.pdf |title=Re: Modification of Facilities of KGAC(FM), Saint Peter, MN (BPED-970203IC) |last=Blair |first=Linda |date=1998-10-16 |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |location=Washington, D.C. }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political considerations===
The requirement that a full-service station maintain local presence in its community of license has been used by proponents of [[localism (politics)|localism]] and [[community radio|community broadcasting]] as a means to oppose the construction and use of local stations as mere rebroadcasters or satellite-fed translators of distant stations. Without specific requirements for service to the local community of license, stations could be constructed in large number by out-of-region broadcasters who feed transmitters via [[communications satellite|satellite]] and offer no local content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04509192.asp ON THE RADIO: Corporate bigfoot CSN tunes out community stations, MIKE MILIARD, Boston Phoenix] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184146/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04509192.asp |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also has been a de facto preference by regulators to encourage the assignment of broadcast licenses to smaller cities which otherwise would have no local voice, instead of allowing all broadcast activity to be concentrated in large metropolitan areas already served by many existing broadcasters.

When dealing with multiple competing US radio station applications, current FM allotment priorities are: (1) first full-time aural service; (2) second full-time aural service; (3) first local aural transmission service; and (4) Other public interest matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2008/db1010/DA-08-2267A1.txt]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar criteria were extended to competing applicants for non-commercial stations by US legislation passed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.current.org/pbpb/fcc/nce-order2000.html CFR 47 § 73.7002 Fair distribution of service on reserved band FM channels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611051916/http://www.current.org/pbpb/fcc/nce-order2000.html |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suburban community problem====
Any policy favoring applicants for communities not already served by an existing station has had the unintended effect of encouraging applicants to merely list a small suburb of a large city, claiming to be the "first station in the community" even though the larger city is well served by many existing stations. "The Suburban Community Problem" was recognized in FCC policy as early as 1965. "Stations in metropolitan areas often tend to seek out national and regional advertisers and to identify themselves with the entire metropolitan area rather than with the particular needs of their specified communities," according to an FCC policy statement of the era. In order "to discourage applicants for smaller communities who would be merely substandard stations for neighboring, larger communities," the FCC established the so-called "Suburban Community presumption" which required applicants for AM stations in such markets to demonstrate that they had ascertained the unmet programming needs of the specific communities and were prepared to satisfy those needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/162470377.html Spectrum Efficiency and the Public Interest, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 01-DEC-06] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524181436/http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/162470377.html |date=May 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1969, the same issues had spread to FM licensing; instead of building transmitters in the community to nominally be served, applicants would often seek to locate the tower site at least halfway to the next major city. In one such precedent case (the Berwick Doctrine), the FCC required a hearing before Berwick, a prospective broadcaster, could locate transmitters midway between [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]] (the city of license) and a larger audience in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708020143/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m6836/is_4_50/ai_n25004469 Spectrum efficiency and the public interest, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, Dec 2006, Alan G. Stavitsky, Tad Odell]&lt;/ref&gt;

A related problem was that of 'move-in'. Outlying communities would find their small-town local stations sold to outsiders, who would then attempt to change the community of license to a suburb of the nearest major city, move transmitter locations or remove existing local content from broadcasts in an attempt to move into the larger city.

The small town of [[Anniston, Alabama]], due to its location 90 miles west of [[Atlanta]] and 65 miles east of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], has lost local content from both TV and FM stations which were re-targeted at one of the two larger urban centers or moved outright. ([[WNNX|WHMA-FM]] Anniston is now licensed as WNNX [[College Park, Georgia]] - an Atlanta suburb - after a failed attempt to relicense it to [[Sandy Springs, Georgia]] - another [[Metro Atlanta#Surrounding cities|Atlanta suburb]]. Transmitters are now in downtown Atlanta.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fybush.com/site-020605.html Fybush Northeast Radio Watch tower sites - Anniston, Alabama]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The same is true for WJSU, which served East Alabama with local news until the station was merged into a triplex to form [[WBMA|ABC 33/40]] which focuses its coverage on the central part of the state.

A 1988 precedent case (Faye and Richard Tuck, 3 FCC Rcd 5374, 1988) created the "Tuck Analysis" as a standard which attempts to address the Suburban Community Problem on a case-by-case basis by examining:
# the station's proposed signal coverage over the urbanized area (the "Coverage Factor");
# the relative population size and distance between the suburban community and the urban market (the "Relative Size and Distance Factor"); and
# the independence of the suburban community, based on various factors that would indicate self-sufficiency (the "Independence Factor").

Despite the best intentions of regulators, the system remains prone to manipulation.

{{quote|This has almost become a parlor game.  The goal of the game—whether you're applying for a new station or a station currently licensed to a rural area—is to move as close to a big market as possible.  The closer you get to a big market, the more potential listeners you can reach and hence the more advertising dollars you can attract.  But there's a catch—at least there's supposed to be.  The Commission is required by Section 307(b) of the Communications Act "to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service" to "the several States and communities."  The FCC cannot simply permit radio stations to relocate from rural areas to well-served urban markets without violating that mandate. That's when the game gets interesting.  Under our FM allotment rules, the Commission will give a preference to any applicant that proposes to serve a community with no current licensees—i.e., not that the community doesn't receive radio service (it could receive service from dozens of stations) but that no station lists that particular community as its "community of license."  That's where a good atlas comes in handy.  The next step is to scour the maps to find a community near an urban area that doesn't yet have any stations licensed to it.  You win the game if you get the FCC to grant you a preference for providing "first service" to a close-in suburban community while being able to cover the larger market.|Commissioners Copps &amp; Adelstein, Federal Communications Commission, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2008/db1103/FCC-08-205A2.txt Copps/Adelstein, FCC, 2008, re: FM (Evergreen, Alabama and Shalimar, Florida, MB Docket 04-219), (Lincoln and Sherman, Illinois, MM Docket 01-120)]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Licensing and on-air identity===
While becoming less meaningful over the decades, stations are still required to post a [[public file]] somewhere within 25 miles of the city, and to cover the entire city with a local [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]].  In the United States, a station's [[transmitter]] must be located so that it can provide a strong signal over nearly all of its "principal community" (5 mV/m or stronger at night for AM stations, 70 dbuV for FM, 35 dbu for DTV channels 2-6, 43 dbu for channels 7-13 and 48 dbu for channels 14+), even if it primarily serves another city.&lt;ref&gt;FCC Rules §73.24, §73.315 and §73.625&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, American television station [[WTTV]] primarily serves [[Indianapolis]]; however, the transmitter is located farther south than the other stations in that city because it is licensed to [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], 50 miles south of Indianapolis. In some cases, such as [[Jeannette, Pennsylvania]]-licensed [[WPCW]] 19, the FCC has waived this requirement; the station claimed that retaining an existing transmitter site 25.6 miles southeast of its new community of license of Jeannette would be in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements (avoiding interference to [[co-channel interference|co-channel]] [[WOIO]] 19 [[Shaker Heights, Ohio|Shaker Heights]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/1997/da971503.txt MM Docket No. 97-96 Table of Allotments, RM-8756 TV Broadcast Stations (Johnstown and Jeannette, Pennsylvania)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another extreme example of a station's transmitter located far from the city of license is the FM station [[KPNT]], formerly licensed to [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri]] and transmitting from [[Hillsboro, Missouri|Hillsboro]], but serving the [[St. Louis]] and [[Metro East]] market to the north. In 2015, the station was allowed by the FCC to move their city of license to [[Collinsville, Illinois]] and have a transmitter in St. Louis proper with a power decrease.

FCC regulations also require stations at least once an hour to state the station's call letters, followed by the city of license.  However, the FCC has no restrictions on additional names after the city of license, so many stations afterwards add the nearest large city.  For example, American television station [[WOIO]] is licensed to [[Shaker Heights, Ohio|Shaker Heights]], a suburb of [[Cleveland]].  It is identified as "WOIO [[Digital television|DT]] Shaker Heights-Cleveland." Similarly, northern [[New York (state)|New York]]'s WWNY identifies as [[WWNY-TV]] [[North American broadcast television frequencies|7]] [[Carthage, New York|Carthage]]-[[Watertown, New York|Watertown]] as a historical artifact; the original broadcasts originated from [[Champion, New York|Champion Hill]] in 1954 so the license still reflects this tiny location.

If the station is licensed in the primary city served, on occasion the station will list a second city next to it.  For example,  American television station [[WTVT]], licensed to [[Tampa, Florida]], its primary city, identifies as "WTVT/WTVT-DT Tampa/[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]", as St. Petersburg is another major city in the market.

There is no longer a requirement to carry [[program (management)|program]]s relevant to the particular community, {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  or even necessarily to operate or transmit from that community. Accordingly, stations licensed to smaller communities in major [[metropolitan area|metropolitan markets]] often target programming toward the entire market rather than the official home community, and often move their studio facilities to the larger urban centre as well. For instance, the Canadian radio station [[CFNY-FM]] is officially licensed to [[Brampton|Brampton, Ontario]], although its studio and transmitter facilities are located in downtown [[Toronto]].

This may, at times, lead to confusion — while media directories normally list broadcast stations by their legal community of license, audiences often disregard (or may even be entirely unaware of) the distinction.

== Table of allotments ==
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] maintains a Table of Allotments, which assigns individual channel frequencies to individual cities or communities for both [[television|TV]] and [[FM radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://recnet.com/allotments/ RECnet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814041756/http://recnet.com/allotments/ |date=August 14, 2007 }}, About the FM Table of Allotments&lt;/ref&gt;

A corresponding Table of Allotments for [[digital television]] was created in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/1997/nrmm7006.html Commission adopts Table of Allotments for DTV] (MM DOCKET NO. 87-268)&lt;/ref&gt; To operate a licensed station, a broadcaster must first obtain allocation of the desired frequencies in the FCC's Table of Allotments for the intended city of license. This process is subject to various political and bureaucratic restrictions, based on considerations including the number of existing stations in the area.

The term "city" has in some cases been relaxed to mean "community", often including the unincorporated areas around the city that share a mailing address. This sometimes leads to inconsistencies, such as the licensing of one [[metro Atlanta]] station to the unincorporated [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] community of [[Mableton, Georgia|Mableton]], but the refusal to license [[WNNX#History|another]] to [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/1997/da971334.txt MM Docket No. 89-686 Table of Allotments FM Broadcast Stations. RM-7035 (Eatonton and Sandy Springs, Georgia)]&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the largest cities in the state, and was at the time an unincorporated part of [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] only for political reasons in the [[Georgia General Assembly]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The definition of a "community" also comes into play when a broadcaster wants to take a station away from a tiny hamlet like [[North Pole, New York]] whose population is in decline. In general, regulators are loath to allow a community's only licence to be moved away - especially to a city which already has a station (a rare few exceptions were made to accommodate the then-fledgling third-rank [[American Broadcasting Company]] in the 1950s). A broadcaster may make the case that the "community" functionally no longer exists in order to be released from its local obligations. &lt;!-- see [[WPTZ]] below and its cited sources --&gt;

Often, the city of license does not correspond to the location of the station itself, of the primary audience or of the communities identified in the station's branding and advertising.

Some of the more common reasons for a community of license to be listed as a point far from the actual audience include:

;The "compromise" location: A broadcaster may wish to serve two different communities, both in the same region but far enough from each other that a transmitter in one market would provide poor service to the other. While a transmitter in each community served would be preferable, occasionally a station licensed to a small town between the two larger centres will be used.

;The [[suburb]]an station: In [[FM radio]] broadcasting, small local stations were sometimes built to serve suburban or outlying areas in an era where [[AM radio]] stations held the largest audiences and much of the FM spectrum lay vacant. In the era of [[vacuum tube]]s, the five-tube AM radio with no FM tuning capability and limited audio quality was common; later advances in receiver design were to make good-quality FM commonplace (even though most AM/FM stereo receivers still have severely limited AM frequency response and no [[AM stereo]] decoders). Eventually FM spectrum became a very scarce commodity in many markets as AM stations moved to the FM dial, relegating AM largely to [[talk radio]]. As cities expanded, former small-town FM stations found themselves not only in what were now becoming rapidly expanding suburbs but also on what was becoming some of the most valuable spectrum in broadcast radio. The once-tiny FM stations would often then be sold, increased (where possible) to much-higher power and used to serve a huge mainstream audience in the larger metropolitan area.

;The short-spaced station: To avoid [[co-channel interference]], a minimum distance is maintained between stations operating on the same frequency in different markets. On [[VHF]], full-power stations are typically 175 miles or more apart before the same channel is used again. An otherwise-desirable channel may therefore be unavailable to a community unless either it is operated at greatly reduced-power, forced onto a strongly directional antenna pattern to protect the distant co-channel station or relocated to some other, more distant location in the region to maintain proper spacing. The choice of another community as home for a station can be one possible means to avoid short-spacing, effectively shifting the entire station's coverage area to maintain the required distances between transmitters.

;The distant mountaintop antenna: In hilly or mountainous regions, a city would often be built in a waterfront or lakeside location (such as [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]]-[[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], both on [[Lake Champlain]]) - lower ground which in turn would be surrounded by tall mountain peaks. The only reliable means to get the [[VHF]] television or radio signals over the mountains was to build a station atop one of the mountain peaks. This occasionally left stations with a distant mountaintop (or its nearest small crossroads) as the historical city of license, even though the audience was elsewhere.

;The relocation of an existing station: Often, a license for a new station will not be available in a community, either because a regulatory agency was only willing to accept new applications within specified narrow timeframes or because there are no suitable vacant channels. A prospective broadcaster must therefore buy an existing station as the only way to readily enter the market, in some cases being left with a station in a suburban, outlying or adjacent-market area if that were the only facility available for sale.

||[[CHRO-TV]]
||[[Ottawa]]
||[[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]]
||Launched in the small city of Pembroke in 1961, the station struggled for financial viability until gaining carriage on cable systems in [[Ottawa]] and adding a news bureau there — but because it was affiliated with television networks that already had other affiliates in Ottawa proper, it was restricted to cable distribution. It was eventually acquired by [[CHUM Limited]] in 1997, and added an over-the-air transmitter in Ottawa after joining CHUM's [[NewNet]] system. CHUM subsequently centralized the station's operations and studios in Ottawa — legally, however, the Pembroke transmitter is still the primary station.

Although CHSJ remained licensed to Saint John, some of the station's programming was produced in Fredericton due to that city's status as the provincial capital.

Outbid by an outside buyer, NBC attempted to force the new owners to rebrand the station as "NBC 4" and greatly restrict the station's ability to schedule its programming differently from the main network.

||[[Pittsburgh]]
||[[Jeannette, Pennsylvania]]
||Originally a [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] station, one of the rare instances in which the community of license for an existing channel has successfully been changed. WPCW (then WTWB) managed to circumvent an [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] moratorium on new channel allocations in Pittsburgh by listing Jeannette, a small community of 11,000 people technically in the Pittsburgh market area, as the new city of license for an existing station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Notices/1997/da970540.txt FCC notice] of proposed rule making (Johnstown and Jeannette, Pennsylvania)&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively a [[flag of convenience (business)|flag of convenience]], this maneuver portrays the station's owners as moving it from a community that had at least two other broadcasters (Johnstown) to one that had none (Jeannette)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/1997/da971503.txt FCC report and order] Table of Allotments, RM-8756 (Johnstown and Jeannette, Pennsylvania)&lt;/ref&gt; - easier to justify for regulatory purposes. The actual intended target market, Pittsburgh, already has many local stations. While the transmitter remains in [[Jennerstown, Pennsylvania|Jennerstown]] (a small borough near Johnstown) and is inadequate to properly cover Pittsburgh over-the-air, this nominal community of license in the Pittsburgh market confers "[[must-carry]]" status for Pittsburgh's [[CATV|cable TV]] systems. Studios are at [[KDKA-TV]] Pittsburgh and city-grade coverage for Pittsburgh itself is supplied by a [[UHF]] [[broadcast translator|repeater]]. The main transmitters never were moved, and soon after taking a license to serve Jeannette the station applied for [[must-carry]] on cable in Johnstown, its former community of license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1998/da980102.txt FCC In re Petition of: Venture Technologies Group, Inc.

||[[Chicago]]
||[[Gary, Indiana]]
||WPWR operates from Chicago studios, transmitting from the [[Willis Tower]] (formerly known as the Sears Tower), but is licensed out-of-state. Its owners obtained this channel allocation by first buying an existing construction permit for a Gary, Indiana station which had been licensed as Channel 56 but never built, then swapping its channel allocations with [[WYIN]] - a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station also licensed to Gary, Indiana. WYIN had been refused a Sears Tower transmitter location as Chicago had two locally-licensed PBS member stations before 2017.

The station has no Kenosha facilities and has their offices in the northern Milwaukee suburb of [[Glendale, Wisconsin|Glendale]], while the station's digital transmitter is within the traditional tower site of all Milwaukee television stations on Milwaukee's northwest side,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; thus WPXE is a station based in Milwaukee which nominally serves a city thirty miles away from their station facilities.

||[[Philadelphia]]
||[[Reading, Pennsylvania]]
||An [[rimshot (broadcasting)|outlying UHF station]] which barely reaches Philadelphia despite applying for ever-increasing amounts of power, WTVE was near-bankrupt. Instead of building one main digital transmitter, WTVE is instead constructing a [[distributed transmission system]] composed nominally of eight co-channel transmitters in [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[North East, Maryland|North East MD]], [[Quarryville, Pennsylvania|Quarryville]], [[Myerstown, Pennsylvania|Myerstown]], [[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]] for a combined total of 136.67[[kilowatt|kW]] of digital TV. As the bulk of this power (126&amp;nbsp;kW) is assigned to the Philadelphia transmitter site alone, effectively this configuration is a full-power Philadelphia station with a series of small [[broadcast translator|low-power on-channel boosters]] covering the original service area and city of license.

||[[WWOR-TV]] 9 [[MyNetworkTV]]
||[[New York City]]
||[[Secaucus, New Jersey]]
||New York City's Channel 9, then having the [[call sign]] WOR-TV in 1983, was at that time owned by [[RKO General]]. Due to misconduct in its operations, RKO General was threatened with loss of its license to operate many of its broadcast stations, including WOR. RKO convinced [[New Jersey]] Senator [[Bill Bradley]] to introduce a bill in Congress guaranteeing an automatic renewal of a station's license if it moved to a state that did not have a [[VHF]] commercial television station under a claim of 'underservement'. Under that very specific criteria, only New Jersey and [[Delaware]] met those requirements (both states being dually served by stations from New York or [[Philadelphia]]). With the bill passed and signed by [[Ronald Reagan]], WOR relocated the station's operations to a business park in their new city of license, Secaucus (located directly across the [[Hudson River]] from [[Manhattan]]), and obtained an automatic license renewal, though their transmission facilities remained atop the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in Manhattan and requirements for the station to properly serve New Jersey, an issue that has continued to affect WWOR's operations to the present day (their last license renewal was delayed by several years due to FCC claims it did not fulfill this directive).

|[[WYCN-CD]] 15 [[NBC]]
|[[Boston]]
|[[Nashua, New Hampshire]]
|The newest example in this list, this was a result of the FCC's 2016 [[spectrum auction]] to [[Spectrum reallocation|reallocate television spectrum]] for the use of wireless devices. WYCN was previously a [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power]] community station serving Nashua carrying low-interest networks out of primetime, but was purchased by [[OTA Broadcasting]] in 2013, a company that mainly purchased stations to profit from their spectrum rather than a genuine interest in broadcasting. OTA won $80.4 million from the FCC for returning its spectrum, but also decided to retain the station's license for a channel sharing arrangement with another station, of which it had perfect timing; [[NBCUniversal]] was looking for both a full-market station and a way to broadcast their "[[NBC]] Boston" service (originating on equally low-power [[WBTS-LD]]) after their 2017 disaffiliation from [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]]. OTA, NBC, and the [[WGBH Educational Foundation]] then made an arrangement where WYCN would be purchased from OTA by NBC's [[NBC Owned Television Stations|O&amp;O group]], and WGBH would arrange to share their spectrum on secondary [[PBS]] member station [[WGBX-TV]], allowing NBC a full-market and central home for their NBC and [[Cozi TV]] programming in Boston on their signal, using the license of what is in technicality a low-power station. The station thus moved on January 18, 2018 from transmitting a low-power signal only serving Nashua, to a full-power signal transmitting {{convert|32|mi|km}} away in [[Needham, Massachusetts]], with NBC programming, sports and Boston news replacing the repeat-heavy [[Heroes &amp; Icons]] network (though WBTS-LD remains the originating station for NBC Boston).

;The [[border blaster]]: Occasionally, a community on an international border is served using a station licensed to another country. This may provide access to less restrictive broadcast regulation or represent a means to use [[local marketing agreement]]s or adjacent-market licences to circumvent limits on the number of stations under common ownership.

San Diego (channels 8 and 10), Los Angeles (channels 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) and Santa Barbara (channel 3) had already been allocated as early as 1952, with the remaining pair of VHF channels (6 and 12) allocated to [[Tijuana]] by [[Mexico|Mexican]] authorities. The only means to add a third [[VHF]] TV broadcaster to San Diego without unacceptable interference was therefore to enter a [[local marketing agreement]] with Mexican-owned [[Televisa]]. The station was a charter Fox affiliate until 2008, when San Diego-licensed [[KSWB-TV]] took over the affiliation. The digital age allowed XETV to affiliate with Televisa's [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] network using their DT2 signal, and for over a year until it was signed off in mid-July 2013, the analog signal carried Canal 5, made XETV the only North American station at the time to carry both an American-originated and Mexican-originated network on their signal. The station lost its affiliation to the CW after failing to reach an agreement with the Network, which later switched to [[KFMB-TV|KFMB]] on Sub-channel 8.1 and shutting down its news operations.

;The last-available frequency allocation: In the early days of television, the majority of stations could be found on the [[VHF]] band; in North America, this currently represents just twelve possible channels and in large markets any suitable allocations in this range were mostly full by the early 1950s. Occasionally, a prospective broadcaster could obtain one of these coveted positions by acquiring an existing station or permit in an adjacent community - although in some cases this meant a move out-of-state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">In [[rhetoric]], a '''climax''' ({{lang-grc-gre|κλῖμαξ}}, ''klîmax'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"staircase" or "ladder") is a [[figure of speech]] in which [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, or [[clause]]s are arranged in order of increasing importance.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 57&lt;br&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smyth | first = Herbert Weir | year = 1920 | title = Greek Grammar | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge MA | isbn = 0-674-36250-0 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its use with clauses, it is also sometimes known as '''[[auxesis (rhetoric)|auxesis]]''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"growth").&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
==Usage==
Climax is frequently used in [[persuasion]] (particularly [[advertising]]) to create [[false dilemma]]s and to focus attention on the positive aspects of the subject at hand. The initial inferior options make the final term seem still better by comparison than it would appear in isolation: "X is good, Y is better, Z is best" is a standard format. It can also be used in reverse to make the initial term seem better by comparison: "A isn't perfect but B is worse and C is worst."&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm|title=Auxesis|website=changingminds.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/|title=How to Use the Simple Power of Contrast to Become More Persuasive - Copyblogger|date=2007-04-30|work=Copyblogger|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/ 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* "There are three things that will endure: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 13:13&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think we've reached a point of great decision, not just for our nation, not only for all humanity, but for life upon the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wald |first=George |author-link=George Wald |title=A Generation in Search of a Future |date=4 March 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "...Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Shakespeare |first=William |author-link=William Shakespeare |title=The Passionate Pilgrim, ''XIII'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Anticlimax==
An '''anticlimax''' or '''anti-climax''' is an abrupt descent (either deliberate or unintended) on the part of a speaker or writer from the dignity of idea which he appeared to be aiming at,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"The English poet Herrick expressed the same sentiment when he suggested that we should gather rosebuds while we may. Your elbow is in the butter, sir."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=P.G. |last=Wodehouse |title=Much Obliged, Jeeves }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a relative term, anticlimax requires a greater or lesser climax to precede it in order to have proper effect. An anticlimax can be intentionally employed only for a jocular or satiric purpose. It frequently partakes of the nature of [[antithesis]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"Die and endow a ''college'' or a ''cat''."

A '''combine demolition derby''' is a [[demolition derby]] in which [[combine harvester]]s are used. Several [[fair]]s in the United States feature demolition derbies using combines, including events in Nebraska, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130907055343/http://www.bremercountyfair.com/schedule/combine-demolition-derby Iowa], ,&lt;ref name=bcf&gt;[http://www.bremercountyfair.com/schedule/combine-demolition-derby Iowa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907055343/http://www.bremercountyfair.com/schedule/combine-demolition-derby |date=2013-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan]],&lt;ref name=ng&gt;{{cite news|title=Competitive Combine|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/american-festivals/combine-demolition-derby-photos/|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ohio]],&lt;ref name=ttb&gt;{{cite news|title=Annual combine smash-up wows fans|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gmxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pAQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3848,3179525&amp;dq=combine-demolition-derby+michigan&amp;hl=en|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=The Toledo Blade|date=29 July 2007|page=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Dakota]],&lt;ref name=tnyt&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first=Brooke|title=In Farm State, Buchanan Finds No Help in History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/27/us/politics-north-dakota-in-farm-state-buchanan-finds-no-help-in-history.html|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|last=Jewell|first=Mark|title=Crunch Time|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7MdOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oB4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6479,5868060&amp;dq=combine-demolition-derby&amp;hl=en|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=Star-News|date=15 June 1998|agency=Associated Press|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://highlandspeedway.com/events/combine-demo-derby/|title=Combine Demo Derby|date=2016-01-01|newspaper=Highland Speedway|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Three combine heat.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Three combines about to begin a heat at the [[Columbiana County]] Fair]]

Derbies sometimes last for up to three hours. Competitors typically remove heavy or unneeded parts of the combines before competitions and reinforce the front, or header, of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=ng /&gt; A vehicle is deemed eliminated once its header section is destroyed or the combine is immobilized. Competitors attempt to use the header to pop other vehicle's [[tires]], rupture their [[drive belt]]s, or tear off their header.&lt;ref&gt;Palahniuk p.41&lt;/ref&gt; The competitions can end in ties if the only remaining machines become inextricably tangled together.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; The competition in [[Lind, Washington|Lind]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] often includes multiple heats, including rounds for event veterans, rookies, and consolation rounds for losers.&lt;ref&gt;Palahniuk p.46&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Michigan]], there is a derby circuit with competitions in several towns.&lt;ref name=ng /&gt;

Competitors use old worn-out combines for the competitions; the use of new combines would be prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; Many, but not all, of the contestants are farmers.&lt;ref name=ttb /&gt; Some of the combines used date from the 1960s.&lt;ref name=p42 /&gt; The vehicles used in competition often are {{convert|15|ft|m}} tall and weigh up to {{convert|15000|lbs|kg}}.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; Some competitions enforce rules about the height of the header, tire standards, age of the contestants, and the location and contents of the [[gas tank]].&lt;ref name=p42&gt;Palahniuk p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Most combines are given colorful nicknames by their owners.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; Many combine owners elaborately decorate their combines.&lt;ref&gt;Palahniuk p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Prizes are sometimes awarded for most impressively decorated combine.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; Though some competitions offer prizes of [[USD|$]]1,500, it is expensive to modify and maintain the combines and some winners lose money overall.&lt;ref name=ng /&gt;

Though the events are usually safe, during the 1999 event in Lind, one competitor suffered a broken leg after falling from his combine. This event led to more rules being enforced at the event, including a prohibition on concrete filled headers.&lt;ref name="p42" /&gt;

}}
'''''Crossing''''' (also known as '''''Keurosing''''') is a 2008 South Korean film directed by [[Kim Tae-kyun (director)|Kim Tae-kyun]]. It was selected as South Korea's submission to the [[List of submissions to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The film follows the journey of a North Korean man as he illegally leaves the country to find medicine for his sick wife, portraying the many hardships of the average North Korean citizen. The film had 907,255 admissions in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanfilm.org/films2008.html#boxoffice "Korean Movie Reviews for 2008"] ''koreanfilm.org''. Retrieved 2012-06-04&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[politics of North Korea]] in this film are left behind and are mainly in the background. Instead it concentrates more on the life of the average North Korean, such as the hardship in an impoverished state and the fear of getting caught and being persecuted in North Korea. Subtle themes include religion, which runs through the film, as Yong Soo hopes that his son comes back safely, as well as football which is a way in connecting the North Koreans to the outside world.

==Plot==
The story tells of a North Korean father and husband who decides to illegally cross into China to buy medicine for his pregnant wife who is suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. However, once he crosses into China, he realises that it's not as easy as he thought. He finds himself working as an illegal immigrant under the constant threat of being captured by the Chinese authorities and deported back to North Korea. He eventually finds his way to South Korea by entering the German embassy in China. Meanwhile, his wife has already died, leaving their son homeless and wandering around trying to find a way back to his father. Scenes switch between those of the father who is outside North Korea trying to find medicine, and those of the son, who ends up homeless and tries to defect also.

==Cast==
*[[Cha In-pyo]] as Kim Yong-soo, the main protagonist and the father.
*Sin Myeong-cheol as Kim Joon, the son of Kim Yong-soo.
*Seo Young-hwa as Yong-soo's wife
*[[Jung In-gi]] as Sang-cheol, friend of Yong-soo's who eventually gets sent to a labor camp, for smuggled goods.
*[[Joo Da-young]] as Mi-seon, daughter of Sang-cheol, friend of Joon.

==Awards and nominations==
;[[17th Buil Film Awards|2008]] [[Buil Film Awards]]
* Nomination - Best New Actor - Sin Myeong-cheol

;[[29th Blue Dragon Film Awards|2008]] [[Blue Dragon Film Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinemasie.com/en/fiche/oeuvre/crossing2008/recompenses.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Nomination - Best Director - [[Kim Tae-kyun (director)|Kim Tae-kyun]]

;2008 [[Korean Film Awards]]

* Nomination - Best New Actor - Sin Myeong-cheol

==Controversy==
Shortly after the film was released it became embroiled in controversy as it has been accused of [[plagiarism]] by [[Lee Kwang Hoon]]. He argued that the film was written on a screenplay titled "The Conditions of Human" based on the story of North Korean defector Yoo Sang-joon which he wrote. Lee's lawyer also said that director Lee and Yoo had signed a contract to make a film about Yoo's life and has been preparing for the past three years. The lawyer claimed that a court injunction was sought because director Kim has not discussed the matter with director Lee, although Kim had known about the existence of a screenplay about Yoo. The request for an injunction applies to all theater presentations, as well as in the forms of DVD, video, and internet videos. Vantage Holdings, the distributor of ''Crossing'' has countered the accusation by saying that the director nor the film company has not violated Lee's copyright and added that they are looking into taking legal measures themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Film "Crossing" may be banned from theaters | journal = Han Cinema | date = 2008-07-14 | url = http://www.hancinema.net/film-crossing-may-be-banned-from-theaters-14638.html | accessdate = 2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has also been selected as South Korea's submission to the [[List of submissions to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]. But the Korean Film Council will select another submission if ''Crossing'' is found guilty when the issue comes to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Han | first = Sunhee | title = S.

==Career==
Dennis Detwiller got in touch with [[John Scott Tynes]] after seeing an issue of [[Pagan Publishing]]'s ''The Unspeakable Oath'' magazine in 1991. He then started volunteering with the company.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|244}} When Tynes moved the company to Seattle in the mid-1990s, Detwiller agreed to move with him.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|245}} Detwiller worked at Pagan as art director where he co-created the [[Origins Award]]-winning game ''[[Delta Green]]'' in 1997 with Tynes and [[Adam Scott Glancy]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory6.phtml A Brief History of Game #6: Pagan Publishing: 1990-Present] RPGnet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ransom"&gt;[http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=blog&amp;id=5920&amp;Itemid=1 I’m Holding This Game For Ransom!] Bruce Baugh, September 20, 2008, Tor.com&lt;/ref&gt; Detwiller wrote a series of three [[chapbook]]s (1998-2000), and with Tynes and Glancy he expanded the setting in 1999 with ''Delta Green: Countdown''.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|246–247}} Detwiller illustrated ''[[The Hills Rise Wild!]]'', which also won an Origins Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He is known for his work in the collectible card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', to which he was a regular contributor. He also participated in many other projects at [[Wizards of the Coast]] and was a shareholder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Detwiller and [[Greg Stolze]] prepared their game ''[[Godlike (role-playing game)|Godlike]]'' for publication by Pagan Publishing. As Pagan was winding down, Detwiller took it to his friends Hsin Chen and Aron Anderson, who created the company Hawthorn Hobgoblynn Press (later known as [[Eos Press|EOS Press]]) in 2001 to publish the game.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|249}} After the release of ''Godlike'' in 2002 Detwiller founded [[Arc Dream Publishing]] with [[Shane Ivey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdice.com/1253/interview-shane-ivey-of-arc-dream-publishing/ Interview: Shane Ivey of Arc Dream Publishing], January 21, 2009, LivingDice.com&lt;/ref&gt; Detwiller and Ivey formed Arc Dream Publishing to produce supplements for ''Godlike'', and in 2003 Arc Dream acquired the licensing from Stolze to use his [[One-Roll Engine]] (ORE) dice system.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|250}} He has since worked on [[Wild Talents (role-playing game)|Wild Talents]], a follow-up to ''Godlike'', and the free horror game NEMESIS.&lt;ref name="ransom"/&gt; Detwiller and Ivey produced ''Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity'' (2010) and also resurrected Pagan's ''The Unspeakable Oath'' in 2010.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|250}}  Following a successful kickstarter campaign, Arc Dream publishing announced a new Delta Green game to be released in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delta-green.com/2015/08/delta-green-the-role-playing-game-coming-from-arc-dream-publishing/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disney Digital 3-D''' is a [[Brand|brand name]] used by [[The Walt Disney Company]] to describe [[3-D film|three-dimensional films]] made and released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] mostly under the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] label and shown exclusively using [[digital cinema|digital projection]].

Disney Digital 3-D in itself is not a presentation or a production format or technology, but rather purely a marketing concept. Films advertised as Disney Digital 3-D come from a number of sources, film, digital camera as well as animation software, and can be presented using any digital 3D technology, including [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby 3D]], [[XpanD 3D]] and [[MasterImage 3D]]. There is no specific handling involved.

==History==
===Pre-2005 Disney 3-D films===
Disney had previously released two 3D animated shorts in 1953, ''[[Melody (1953 film)|Adventures in Music: Melody]]'', the first American 3D animated short,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mouseplanet.com/8968/The_Original_Disney_3D |title= The Original Disney 3-D |work= MousePlanet |date= September 16, 2009 |accessdate= October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Working for Peanuts]]'', starring [[Donald Duck]] and [[Chip 'n' Dale]].

Disney also produced 3D films for its theme parks, including [[Disneyland]]'s ''3D Jamboree'' (1956), featuring the ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' Mouseketeers and including ''Melody'' and ''Working for Peanuts''; ''[[Magic Journeys]]'' (1982), ''[[Captain EO]]'' (1986), ''[[Muppet*Vision 3D]]'' (1991), ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience]]'' (1994), ''[[It's Tough to Be a Bug!]]'' (1998), the film portion of [[Tokyo DisneySea]]'s Magic Lamp Theater, and ''[[Mickey's PhilharMagic]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cdn.d23.disney.go.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/azsupp_082712.pdf |title= Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia supplement |first1= Dave |last1= Smith |authorlink= Dave Smith (archivist) |publisher= The Walt Disney Company |date= August 1, 2012 |accessdate= October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2005, Dimension Films (then-owned by [[The Weinstein Company]]) had made a couple of 3D films. Two of them were ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D]]''.

===Post-2005 Disney 3-D films===
The first Disney Digital 3-D film was ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'', which was released in late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Walt Disney Studios and Dolby Bring Disney Digital 3-D(TM) to Selected Theaters Nationwide With CHICKEN LITTLE on Dolby Digital Cinema|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=149089|accessdate=September 3, 2011|newspaper=PR Newswire|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the release, Disney collaborated with RealD to install RealD's 3D digital projection system featuring Christie CP2000 2K [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projectors along with silver screens for 84 screens in U.S. theaters.&lt;ref name = "Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web | date = March 7, 2007 | author = Carolyn Giardina | title = New dimension at Real D | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003554469 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181331/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003554469 | archivedate = September 30, 2007 | work = HollywoodReporter.com | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer-animated film ''Chicken Little'' was followed by a re-release of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' on October 20, 2006. ''Nightmare'', a 1993 [[stop motion|stop-motion]] film, was originally shot in 2D on 35mm-film with the 3D version generated by [[Industrial Light and Magic]] from this source using computer technology.

In 2007, Disney re-released the film ''[[Working for Peanuts]]'' with the theatrical release of the 3D version of ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''.

The first live-action Disney Digital 3-D release was ''[[Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert]]'', which followed in 2008. In 2009, ''[[G-Force (film)|G-Force]]'' became the first film in Disney Digital 3-D from producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]].

On May 29, 2009, Disney released [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'', the first Pixar film to be presented in 3D. This film was then followed by a 3D [[double feature]] re-release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' on October 2, 2009, although neither of these films' animations was altered. Subsequent Pixar films, such as ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Cars 2]]'', were also released in Disney Digital 3-D.

Two of Disney's traditionally animated films were reissued with 3D conversions in 2011; ''[[The Lion King]]'' – released on August 26 internationally and on September 16 in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Disney's 'The Lion King' to Return to Theaters in Digital 3D|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-s-lion-king-return-192621|accessdate=May 26, 2011|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' – limited to 13-day run in September at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles for North America, as well as short runs in New Zealand, Japan, Australia, India and Spain in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart |first=Andrew |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118041220?refCatId=13 |title='Beauty 3D' to single screen |publisher=Variety.com |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoyts.com.au/Movies/details/Beauty_and_the_Beast_3D.aspx |title=(3D) Beauty and the Beast at Hoyts Cinemas |publisher=Hoyts.com.au |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809153444/http://www.hoyts.com.au/Movies/details/Beauty_and_the_Beast_3D.aspx |archivedate=August 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These re-releases were being supervised by [[Don Hahn]], who produced both films. ''Beauty and the Beast'' in 3D received a wider release on January 13, 2012. Two more films were reissued in 3D in 2012; ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' on September 14 and ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' on December 19. ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' was going to be re-released in 3D on September 13, 2013, but was cancelled due to the underperformances of the other Disney 3D re-releases until further notice. The 3D version of ''The Little Mermaid'' did, however, play for a limited engagement at the El Capitan Theatre from September to October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood's El Capitan Will Be the Only Theatre in the World to Screen THE LITTLE MERMAID 3D, 9/13-10/13|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmovies/article/Hollywoods-El-Capitan-Will-Be-Only-Theatre-in-the-World-to-Screen-THE-LITTLE-MERMAID-3D-913-1013-20130827|author=Oliver Oliveros|date=August 27, 2013|access-date=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Disney has released films from [[Marvel Studios]] and [[Lucasfilm]] in the 3D format, beginning with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), respectively. However, the 3D format was not branded as "Disney."

'''''Dragon Age: Inquisition''''' is an [[action role-playing video game]] developed by [[BioWare#BioWare Edmonton|BioWare Edmonton]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The third major game in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' franchise, ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' is the sequel to ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age II]]''. The game was released worldwide in November 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Xbox One]].

The story of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' follows a [[player character]] known as the Inquisitor on a journey to settle the [[civil unrest]] in the continent of Thedas and close a mysterious tear in the sky called the "Breach", which is unleashing dangerous demons upon the world. The Inquisitor is viewed by some as the 'chosen one', as they have a 'Mark' on their hand capable of closing the Breach. The Inquisitor assembles the titular Inquisition in an attempt to stop Corypheus, an ancient darkspawn, who opened the breach in an attempt to conquer Thedas.

Gameplay of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' is similar to its predecessors and mostly consists of elements found in a typical action role-playing game; players control their customized Inquisitor, and the companions they meet. They can defeat enemies with swords and magic, complete side quests, interact with [[non-playable character]]s, and progress through the main story. Players mainly control their protagonists in a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] view, though a traditional [[role-playing game]] top down camera angle is also available.

After the release of ''Dragon Age II'', the ''Dragon Age'' series was seen by some as a series with an "identity crisis". As a result, Bioware sought to create a third ''Dragon Age'' game that combined the elements of the first two. Having begun development in 2011, the game was officially announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo]]. The game's soundtrack was primarily composed by [[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]], who replaced [[Inon Zur]], the composer of the ''Dragon Age: Origins'' and ''Dragon Age II'' soundtracks. Several [[downloadable content]] expansion packs were also released.

''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising its story, voice acting, soundtrack, detailed environments, and engaging combat. The game did receive some criticism for the presence of technical issues. It was awarded over 150 year-end accolades and nominated for more, including [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] and Best Role-playing awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]].

==Gameplay==
''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' is an [[action role-playing game]] similar to its predecessors. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a race for their player character: human, dwarf, elf, are playable races, with Qunari playable for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/a020815/Dragon-Age--Inquisition-features-Qunari-as-a-playable-race|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition features Qunari as a playable race|last=Dawe|first=Matthew|publisher=[[PSU.com]]|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players customize the Inquisitor's physical appearance, and gender, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dragon-age-inquisition-gameplay-stream-shows-off-incredibly-detailed-character-creation-options/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition gameplay stream shows off character creation|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=September 29, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players choose from three classes, warrior, mage, and rogue, and can specialize their character, which grant them specific abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/25/5652246/dragon-age-inquisition-character-classes-info|title=BioWare is helping you plan your Dragon Age: Inquisition character with this class breakdown|first=Emily|last=Gera|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 25, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character would later evolve to become the Inquisitor of Thedas, who is considered "holy" by the citizens there. As the Inquisitor, players had to make choices and decisions that affect and change the game's world state. In addition, they can "judge" certain people on their behaviors and decide their fate.&lt;ref name="QA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/youll-lose-yourself-dragon-age-inquisitions-fantastic-storytelling/|title=You'll lose yourself in Dragon Age: Inquisition's fantastic storytelling|first=Lorenzo|last=Veloria|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thedas is the game's world, which includes Ferelden, where ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' was set, as well as three new unexplored regions, which include Orlais, Nevarra and the Free Marches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dragon-age-inquisition-first-look-on-returning-characters-and-open-world-fortresses/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition first look - on returning characters and open world fortresses|first=Chris|last=Thursten |date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is not an [[open world]] video game, as the world is broken up into several sections, which can be freely explored by players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/09/11/dragon-age-inquisition-isnt-open-world-is-multi-region-says-bioware/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition isn’t open world, is "multi-region" says BioWare|first=Dave|last=Cook|work=[[VG247]]|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, BioWare claimed that one of the levels featured in ''Inquisition'' is larger than the entire game of ''Dragon Age II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-22-dragon-age-3-longer-in-pre-production-than-da1-da2-and-mass-effect|title=Dragon Age 3 longer in pre-production than DA1, DA2 and Mass Effect|first=Robert|last=Purchese|date=October 22, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, each region features different environments like deserts, swamps, and mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/07/22/bioware-aiming-to-fix-dragon-ages-choices-exploration/|title=BioWare Aiming To Fix Dragon Age’s Choices, Exploration|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to allow players to navigate the game's world faster, mounts, which are creatures that can be ridden by players, are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dragon-age-inquisition-to-reintroduce-multiple-playable-races-add-mounts/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition to reintroduce multiple playable races, add mounts|first=Phil|last=Savage|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The romance aspect of the game has been overhauled. As opposed to the previous gift and dialogue based system, romance arcs occur in reaction to story events and variables specific to each character and include sex scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/dragon-age-inquisition-romance-details/|title=‘Dragon Age: Inquisition’ To Feature a New Take on Romance|last=Dyce|first=Andrew|publisher=Game Rant|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-dragon-age-inquisition-sex-scenes-will-be-mature-and-tasteful/1100-6415563/|title=BioWare: Dragon Age Inquisition sex scenes will be "mature and tasteful"|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, not all romance arcs require sex. Josephine, for example does not have an explicit sex scene with the inquisitor during the main plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dgaider.tumblr.com/post/91870167579/in-the-interview-with-ashe-you-mentioned-the/|title="Not all the DAI romance arcs culminate in a "sex scene""|last=Gaider|first=David|publisher=David Gaider's Tumblr|date=July 15, 2014|accessdate=November 1, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141102000641/http://dgaider.tumblr.com/post/91870167579/in-the-interview-with-ashe-you-mentioned-the/|archivedate=November 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the nine companions, who assist players in battle, and three advisers, eight of them can be romanced. Some of these [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members would decide whether to fall in love with the Inquisitor based on their gender and race.&lt;ref name="QA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-09-huge-dragon-age-inquisition-q-and-a-info-dump|title=Huge Dragon Age: Inquisition Q&amp;A info dump|first=Robert|last=Purchese|date=July 11, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-03-these-are-your-party-members-companions-followers-in-dragon-age-inquisition|title=These are your Dragon Age: Inquisition party members|first=Robert|last=Purchese|date=July 3, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customization was significantly overhauled,&lt;ref name="Priestly"&gt;{{cite tweet|user=TheEvilChris|author=Chris in Christmas|number=297438959108231168|date=1 February 2013|title=I think DA fans will be pleased with the amount of customization in DA3. #sprintreviewday}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically by allowing equipment and other items to modify their appearance based on who it is equipped to. Depending upon which party member has received it, a piece of armour would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining their identity. Players can craft and customize armour or weapons using the materials they have collected; rarer materials give the particular weapon or armour piece better attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/crafting-in-dragon-age-inquisition|title=Crafting in Dragon Age: Inquisition|work=[[IGN]]|date=July 11, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can customize their keeps, such as rebuilding a garden as a Chantry church or a herb garden. These upgrades have minor effects on the Inquisitions espionage, commerce or military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_inquisition/b/playstation4/archive/2014/09/04/dragon-age-inquisition-skyhold.aspx|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition: What You Need To Know About Skyhold|first=Joe|last=Juba|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/04/dragon-age-inquisitions-home-base-can-be-customised/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition’s home base can be customised|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players do not have the ability to import their save files from the first two games into ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' "to shore up world consistency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/dragon-age-keep-lets-you-customize-a-world-import-it-into-dragon-age-inquisition|title=Dragon Age Keep lets you customize a world, import it into Dragon Age Inquisition|work=GameZone|first=Lance|last=Liebl|date=August 7, 2011|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Bioware released a cloud-based online interactive story creator called ''Dragon Age Keep'', which is narrated by Varric. Players can detail the major plots of the previous two ''Dragon Age'' games to provide this level of customization without requiring replay of the initial games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-30-dragon-age-keep-enters-open-beta|title=Dragon Age Keep enters open beta
|first=Robert|last=Purchese|date=October 30, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players gain influence in areas of the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort or establishing camps, which are used to provide fast travel and resupply points. Operations can be discovered to repair various structures and pathways, such as bridges or collapsed caves. These operations will allow exploration of previously unreachable locations and side quests.&lt;ref name="Pelaajaboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8xJMWRI-cA|title=DigiExpo 2013 - Dragon Age: Inquisition Gameplay|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dragon Age Inquisition Tactical View.jpg|thumb|right|Tactical view introduced in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' returns in ''Inquisition''.]]
Combat focuses on the player's ability to prepare, position, and form a cohesive team with their party members.&lt;ref name="Laidlaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/31/bioware-hints-at-the-future-of-dragon-age-dlc-and-3/|title=Bioware hints at the future of Dragon Age DLC and 3|publisher=Joystiq|date=August 31, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inquisition'' features two forms of combat systems.&lt;ref name="Muzyka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/21/muzyka-bioware-to-throw-previous-dragon-age-games-into-a-blende/|title=Muzyka: BioWare to throw previous Dragon Age games into a blender for next title|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|date=August 21, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is reminiscent of that which is found in most [[action role-playing game]]s, including ''Dragon Age II''. During combat, players can switch to control other party members, while [[artificial intelligence]] will take control of the Inquisitor and other members in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/06/11/e3-2014-bioware-is-saying-all-the-right-things-with-dragon-age-inquisition/88934/|title=E3 2014: Bioware is Saying All The Right Things With Dragon Age Inquisition|first=Matt|last=Beaudette|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[Hardcore Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is action-oriented and follows the player in a typical over-the-shoulder third person style. The second is closer to that of classic [[role-playing game]]s, including ''Dragon Age: Origins''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/e3-2014/2014/6/9/5794258/dragon-age-inquisition-ea-e3-2014|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition lets players switch between third-person and top-down combat|first=Alexa|last=Ray Corriea|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combat system allows players to pause the game, assign locations and orders to the party members and then resume the game to see it played out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_inquisition/b/playstation4/archive/2014/07/29/learn-about-the-pause-and-play-tactical-combat.aspx|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition: Learn about the Pause-and-play Tactical Combat|first=Kyle|last=Hilliard|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the use of this second more strategic combat system, the camera will be closer to that of a top down view, instead of the usual over-the-shoulder third person style of the action based combat system. This combat system is named Tactical View and allows for the placing of traps while the game is paused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/dragon_age_inquisition/preview-3792.html|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition - The return of the king|first=John|last=Robertson|work=VideoGamer.com|date=August 21, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisitor also has the ability to close and manipulate the rift, which can stun all the enemies nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-20-11-dragon-age-inquisition-walkthrough-and-game-guide?page=2|title=Dragon Age Inquisition - The Wrath of Heaven, Forward Camp, Pride Demon, Elfroot|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Inquisitor, players influence how to deploy agents and troops of the Inquisition through their primary advisers, which influences the rewards and time requirements of the effort undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/11-things-you-should-know-about-dragon-age-inquisitio-1657127952|title=11 Things You Should Know About Dragon Age: Inquisition|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 11, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various regions that make up the game world do not scale in level. They have a fixed level, which means players can be either too weak or strong for the enemies found in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dragon-age-inquisition-preview/|title=Dragon Age Inquisition preview: fortresses, friendship and the Fade in BioWare's open world|first=Chris|last=Thursten |date=August 31, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' also introduces multiplayer, which is described as a "[[dungeon crawling]] experience" by BioWare. The game features a [[co-operative gameplay|co-operative multiplayer mode]] which tasks players to play as an Agent of the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="PolyCoop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6072201/dragon-age-3-inquisition-multiplayer-co-op-mode|title=Multiplayer comes to Dragon Age with Inquisition's 4-player co-op mode|first=Michael|last=McWhertor |date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players had to play through levels, and to fight against increasingly difficult AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-01-dragon-age-inquisition-mulitplayer-preview|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition's multiplayer is a first draft with potential|first=Robert|last=Purchese|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mode can be played with three other players, or be completed solo.&lt;ref name="PolyCoop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/people-are-soloing-dragon-age-inquisition-s-multiplayer-mode-on-the-max-difficulty-already-285653.phtml|title=People are soloing Dragon Age: Inquisition's multiplayer mode on the max difficulty already|first=Nic|last=Rowan|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=March 1, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At launch, the game features three multiplayer campaign and nine playable characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-has-multiplayer-first-detai/1100-6421934/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition Has Multiplayer; First Details Revealed|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=July 29, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mode is completely separated from the main campaign. As a result, the progress made by the player in the multiplayer mode would not carry to the campaign. Players can upgrade and craft items, and unlock new characters in the multiplayer mode. Since time is needed to unlock new characters, [[micro-transactions]] are featured. Players can purchase an in-game currency called Platinum to speed up the process of unlocking new characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/dragon-age-inquisitions-co-op-multiplayer-is-all-about-loot|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition's Co-op Multiplayer Is All About Loot|first=Mitch|last=Dyer|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{long plot|date=April 2016}}

===Setting===
''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' is set in the continent of Thedas, the fantasy world in which the two previous games are set. The game covers more geographic territory than its predecessors, with one map being described as four to five times the size of Ferelden, the setting of the first game in the series. The setting overhaul allows the players to go back and forth between Ferelden and Orlais.&lt;ref name="Laidlaw"/&gt; Following the events described in the supplementary novels ''Dragon Age: Asunder'' and ''The Masked Empire'', a [[civil war]] between the loyalists of the ruling Empress and a powerful noble faction led by her cousin, Grand Duke Gaspard, broke out in Orlais. Simultaneously, the Circle of Magi has gone rogue, in part due to the events of ''Dragon Age II'', and the Templar Order seceded from the Chantry to wage their own civil war on the mages.

The area traversable in ''Inquisition'' is much larger than both ''Dragon Age: Origins'' and ''Dragon Age II'', and is said to cover two countries and the land between. The countries are: Ferelden (setting of ''Dragon Age: Origins'') and Orlais, with a land known as the Dales located within.&lt;ref name="Pelaajaboard" /&gt;

===Characters===
{{See also|Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition}}

In 9:41, the mage-templar war is temporarily halted during the Conclave, a peace conference orchestrated by Divine Justinia. During the negotiations, an explosion destroys the Conclave, killing the Divine and many senior Chantry clerics, along with many mages and templars, and creates the Breach, a massive hole in the Veil, the magical boundary between the physical world and the Fade, the world of spirits. The only survivor of the blast is the player character, who emerges from a rift with a mark on their hand capable of closing the rifts that have sprung up in the Breach's wake, but no memory of what happened.

After assisting Cassandra in closing several rifts, the player begins to be referred to as the "Herald of Andraste". With the Chantry leaderless, Cassandra and Leliana re-establish its predecessor, the Inquisition, to carry out one of the Divine's last orders. They resolve to establish authority, close the Breach, and defeat its creator. After gaining the assistance of either the mages or the templars, the Herald succeeds in closing the Breach. During a victory celebration, Haven is attacked by a corrupted version of whichever faction the player did not side with. The attackers are led by Corypheus, an ancient Tevinter magister turned darkspawn who was responsible for opening the Breach. Aided by a [[dragon]] that appears to be an Archdemon, Corypheus overcomes Haven's defences and forces the Inquisition to flee.

Confronting the Herald, Corypheus refers to the mark as "the Anchor", the means by which he would physically enter the Fade and claim the Maker's throne in the Black City, attaining [[apotheosis]] for himself. He attempts to remove the Anchor with a magical elven orb, only to discover that the Anchor is permanently attached; the Herald escapes Corypheus by setting off an avalanche that buries Haven and decimates Corypheus's army. The Herald regroups with other survivors of the attack, and Solas leads the Inquisition to the abandoned and forgotten fortress of Skyhold, high in the mountains, which becomes their new base. The player character becomes the Inquisitor, leader of the Inquisition.

With the assistance of Hawke, who fled Kirkwall after ''[[Dragon Age II]]'', the Inquisitor investigates the disappearance of the Grey Wardens, discovering that they were being manipulated by Corypheus into raising a demon army. Hawke and the Inquisitor are assisted by a Grey Warden in hiding; either Alistair, Loghain, or Stroud (depending on choices made in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]''). The Inquisitor reenters the Fade and regains memories of the Conclave, which reveal that the Inquisitor obtained the Anchor upon coming into contact with Corypheus's orb, after stumbling on a ritual carried out by enthralled Grey Wardens to unlock the orb's power. Either the Grey Warden or Hawke gives their life to help the others escape the Fade, and the Inquisitor must decide whether to exile or recruit the remaining Wardens.

The Inquisitor also attends a ball at the Winter Palace and resolves the ongoing civil war in Orlais. Morrigan, an advisor to the Empress, joins the Inquisition as Imperial liaison. Following her advice, the Inquisitor travels to the Temple of Mythal in order to stop Corypheus from obtaining an Eluvian, a powerful artifact which would enable him to physically enter the Fade. The Inquisitor witnesses Corypheus seemingly destroyed by the temple's defenses, only for him to be reborn in the body of a nearby Grey Warden. Taking refuge inside the temple, either the Inquisitor or Morrigan gains the powers of the Well of Sorrows, the magical 'key' to the resident Eluvian, providing the recipient wisdom of previous servants of Mythal but also binding them to her will. Mythal is revealed to be Flemeth, the Witch of the Wilds. If Morrigan conceived a child in ''Origins'' with the soul of an Old God, the soul is taken by Flemeth.

In either case, voices from the Well reveal that Corypheus' dragon is the key to stopping him; it is a facsimile of an Archdemon, which, if killed, would disrupt Corypheus' ability to leap into other bodies and leave him vulnerable. The Inquisitor then confronts Corypheus as he reopens the Breach and defeats him and his dragon, resealing the Breach permanently and hurling the darkspawn magister to the Fade, destroying his physical body in the process. After finding Corypheus's orb destroyed, a dismayed Solas departs the Inquisition. The epilogue, narrated by Morrigan, details the outcomes of the Inquisitor's decisions for the Mage-Templar war, the Grey Wardens, and the leadership of Orlais. Also, depending on the player's choices, either Cassandra, Leliana, or Vivienne will succeed Justinia as Divine Victoria.

In the post-epilogue, Flemeth meets with Solas, who is revealed to be Fen'Harel, the elven god of betrayal. Their conversation reveals that Solas had given his orb to Corypheus, since he was too weak to unlock the orb's true power after his slumber. Though remorseful for his actions and recognizing that he deserves punishment, Solas deems himself too important to be killed, claiming that the elves need him. As Flemeth embraces Solas, his eyes begin to glow and he seemingly absorbs Mythal into himself.

====Trespasser====
Two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisition goes to the Winter Palace to engage in talks regarding its future; Ferelden wishes the organisation disbanded, while Orlais wants to incorporate it into its armed forces. During the negotiations, a dead Qunari appears, leading the Inquisitor to discover a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, referred to as "Dragon's Breath". Qunari agents within the Inquisition would smuggle barrels of gaatlock (the Qunari equivalent of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power and governance across southern Thedas, allowing the Qunari to wipe out its leadership and facilitate an invasion. They also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plans. Concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life.

While investigating the Qunari plot, the Inquisitor learns that the elven gods, the Evanuris, were in truth extremely powerful mages from ancient times who became corrupt and arrogant in their power, and that Fen'Harel had led a rebellion against them. They also learn that the Veil was created by Fen'Harel, and that his doing so caused the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. The Inquisitor can also learn that Fen'Harel is Solas, depending on how well they search.

The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari in charge of Dragon's Breath who claims that the Qunari instigated it in order to prevent an incident like the Breach's appearance - which they blamed on the south's failure to adequately control mages - from being repeated. After the Inquisitor foils the plot, they convince the Viddasala that they are not Fen Harel's agents, and the Viddasala in turn reveals that Solas is the agent of Fen'Harel who has been disrupting the Dragon's Breath plot, unaware that they are one and the same. She pursues Solas into the Eluvian network, with the Inquisitor following, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. Ultimately, the Viddasala is petrified by Solas.

Solas temporarily calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor, confessing to being Fen'Harel and creating the Veil in order to seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, the only one who kept their ambition in check. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of ancient elves, even if he must destroy the present world. If asked about his role in the events of the core story, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain his magical orb, hoping he would unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb, use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, and restore the ancient elven world. After Corypheus instead survived the blast, Solas joined the Inquisition, seeing them as the best hope of defeating him. If questioned about why he arranged for Dragon's Breath to be discovered, he will either state his desire to avoid unnecessary bloodshed or, if he is friends with the Inquisitor, admit that he sees value in the present world. Ultimately, Solas amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor either resolving to stop him by any means necessary, or convince him to abandon his plan.

Upon returning to the Winter Palace, the Inquisitor must either disband the Inquisition or repurpose it to serve Divine Victoria, risking either weaker efforts against Solas or corruption in the ranks. An epilogue reveals that the Qunari resumed their war with Tevinter following their failed plot, and that elves across Thedas have disappeared to join Solas, in addition to detailing the fates of the Inquisitor's allies. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, and plans to gather allies in Tevinter, noting that given Solas's familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition, they need to recruit people he has not encountered before.

Developer BioWare was planning on fusing elements of both earlier games in the series, ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age II]]'', into the creation of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition''.&lt;ref name="Muzyka"/&gt; The game features larger environments with more opportunity for exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalxbox.com/79850/dragon-age-inquisitions-xbox-360-version-is-a-challenge-tech-will-benefit-battlefield/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition's Xbox 360 version is "a challenge", tech will benefit Battlefield|author=Edwin Evans-Thirlwell|work=[[Official Xbox Magazine]]|date=July 30, 2014|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' was first informally announced on [[Twitter]],&lt;ref name="McNally"/&gt; on May 19, 2011, by [[BioWare]]'s creative lead Alistair McNally.&lt;ref name="McNally"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/05/20/dragon-age-3-artists-wanted-bioware-sr-director-tweets/|title=Dragon Age 3 artists wanted, Bioware sr. director tweets|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=September 4, 2011|date=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea for ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'', namely that there would be an inquisition and the player character would be its leader, was originally intended to be the follow-up to ''Dragon Age: Origins''.&lt;ref name="Jason"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967501381|title=Blood, sweat, and pixels : the triumphant, turbulent stories behind how video games are made|last=Jason,|first=Schreier,|isbn=9780062651235|edition= First|location=New York|oclc=967501381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, 2012, nearly two weeks after BioWare released ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', creative director Mike Laidlaw tweeted that BioWare was finished working on content for ''Dragon Age II''. Executive producer Mark Darrah mentioned that BioWare originally had plans for an expansion pack, entitled "Exalted March", to mark the first anniversary of ''Dragon Age II'' but canceled it in favor of developing other opportunities for the series. Although ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' had not been officially announced, Darrah asked fans to give feedback on what they would like to see in future ''Dragon Age'' installments.&lt;ref name="Darrah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dragon-age-iii/1221093p1.html|title=BioWare Seeking Fan Feedback for Dragon Age 3|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wedbush Securities]] analyst [[Michael Pachter]] speculated that ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' would be released some time in 2014. The title was believed to be scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2013, but Pachter suggested it had been delayed so BioWare and [[video game publisher]] [[Electronic Arts]] could fix problems and create new content for ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''.&lt;ref name="SWmmoDAteam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-05-08-star-wars-mmo-pulling-talent-away-from-dragon-age-team|title=Star Wars MMO pulling talent away from Dragon Age team?|last=Brightman|first=James|publisher=GamesIndustry|date=May 8, 2012|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pachter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/dragon-age-3-delayed-the-old-republic-cj-147982/|title=Analyst Says Dragon Age 3 Delayed to Focus on The Old Republic|last=Smillie|first=C.J.|publisher=Game Rant|date=May 9, 2012|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many BioWare developers, such as Mary Kirby, claimed this was inaccurate, stating that "''Dragon Age III''{{'}}s development will not be delayed by BioWare's other games."&lt;ref name="BioWareSocialDA3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.bioware.com/forum/Dragon-Age-II/Dragon-Age-II-Game-Owner-General-Discussion-NO-Spoilers-allowed/If-DA-has-separate-studio-why-delay-DA3-for-SWTOR-Content-13098256-1.html|title=Dragon Age III Delay?|publisher=BioWare Social|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's development faced several challenges. Criticism of ''Dragon Age II'' added pressure to make the next game a success. The decision was made to switch from the Eclipse engine used in the first two series installments to [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite]]. Frostbite had been used to make ''Battlefied'' and other first-person shooters and did not have any of the required tools for an RPG, like save functions or inventory management systems. Consequently, the ''Dragon Age: Inquistion'' team had to build these features at the same time as they were creating the new game. Art director Matt Goldman said of development, "Basically we had to do new consoles, a new engine, new gameplay, build the hugest game that we've ever made, and build it to a higher standard than we ever did, with tools that don't exist."&lt;ref name="Jason"/&gt;

In September 2012, Mark Darrah, ''Dragon Age''{{'}}s executive producer, revealed in an open letter that ''Dragon Age III'', titled ''Dragon Age III: Inquisition'', was officially under development and had been since about eighteen months previous to the announcement.&lt;ref name="DA3announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dragonage.bioware.com/inquisition/|title=Dragon Age III: Inquisition announcement|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[E3 2013]], it was announced along with the trailer that the game would debut "Fall 2014" and that the title would be ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'', dropping the "III". Later in 2013, it was confirmed that the PC was the lead development platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/dragon_age_3_inquisition/news/pc_confirmed_as_lead_platform_for_dragon_age_inquisition.html|title=PC confirmed as lead platform for Dragon Age: Inquisition|last=Scammell|first=David|work=VideoGamer.com|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2014, BioWare released a trailer for ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' entitled ''Discover the Dragon Age'', showcasing some of the landscapes that can be explored while playing the game. On April 22, 2014, BioWare released a trailer for ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' featuring gameplay from the game and confirming an October 7, 2014 release date. On June 9, 2014, at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]], BioWare released a third trailer for ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'', entitled ''Lead Them or Fall'', revealing more elements of the game's storyline. On July 22, 2014, BioWare pushed back the game's release date to November 18, 2014.  BioWare confirmed on October 31, 2014 that ''Inquisition'' had declared [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|gold]], indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.bioware.com/2014/10/31/dragon-age-inquisition-has-gone-gold/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition Has Gone Gold|last=Darrah|first=Mark|publisher=Electronic Arts|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a607637/dragon-age-inquisition-goes-gold.html|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition goes gold|last=Fahmy|first=Albaraa|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=November 3, 2014|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Muzyka]], BioWare's former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], said in an interview with [[Wired (website)|Wired.com]] that ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' would be influenced by more open world games, such as ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', which BioWare is "checking out aggressively".&lt;ref name="WiredDA3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/12/dragon-age-3/|title=BioWare: Next Dragon Age Will Draw From Skyrim|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired.com]]|date=December 20, 2011|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers stated that they would no longer reuse environments, which was considered a main issue in ''Dragon Age II''.&lt;ref name="Swain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameranx.com/features/id/6055/article/bioware-and-dragon-age-panel-the-future-of-dragon-age/|title=BioWare and Dragon Age Panel: The Future of Dragon Age|publisher=Gameranx|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2014, BioWare announced that ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' would have a four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] mode that is separate from the single-player mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Dragon Age: Inquisition' Has Co-Op Multiplayer Mode, Microtransactions|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/08/27/dragon-age-inquisition-has-co-op-multiplayer-mode-microtransactions/|last=Kain|first=Eric|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=August 27, 2014|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A competition, called "Untold Relics of Thedas Contest" was launched by BioWare in July 2015. The competition tasks participants to design a new item, whose name, backstory and attributes can be changed. A ''Dragon Age'' prize packs will be given to the winner of the contest, and the item designed by the winner will be added to the game via a future content pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-contest-gives-you-the-chanc/1100-6428953/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition Contest Gives You the Chance to Make an In-Game Item|first=Alex|last=Newhouse|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=July 16, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]] replaced [[Inon Zur]], the composer of ''Dragon Age: Origins'' and ''Dragon Age II'' to compose the soundtracks for ''Dragon Age: Inquisition''. The change was due to the desire in presenting players a "new experience" yet keeping familiar themes for those who enjoyed the music in previous versions. The development of the music started earlier than the other aspects of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/dragon-age-inquisition-music/|title=Behind the epic music of Dragon Age: Inquisition|author=Lisa Granshaw|work=The Daily Dot|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released digitally on November 17, 2014, a day before the game's official release.

===Pre-release===
Pre-release comments of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' were positive. [[Kotaku]] writer Jason Schrier had very good first impressions, noting the game's apparent ambition and BioWare's ability to listen to fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-next-dragon-age-is-crazy-ambitious-1232404991|title=The Next ''Dragon Age'' Is Crazy Ambitious|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=August 31, 2013|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] listed the game as their second best shown at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]] 2013, commenting on its openness and combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-pax-2013/|title=The 10 best games of PAX 2013|date=September 5, 2013|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walker of [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] was pleased to hear of the top-view camera coming back, though remained cautious; after playing the demo, he said he was "left optimistic, but uninformed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/08/31/eyes-on-dragon-age-inquisition/|title=Eyes On: Dragon Age – Inquisition|last=Walker|first=John|date=August 31, 2013|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s  Kimberley Wallace listed it as one of the most anticipated RPGs to be released in 2014, saying "''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' has a lot to prove after BioWare received plenty of feedback from disappointed fans about ''Dragon Age II''. However, if our cover trip was any indication, BioWare is up for the challenge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/01/03/6494039.aspx|title=Kim's Anticipated RPGs For 2014|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|date=January 3, 2014|work=Game Informer|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamecritics writer Brad Gallaway gave a hands on preview and was less impressed stating "for me personally, this was not the kind of content I was hoping to see" and mentioning graphical issues, lack of interest in the characters and the amount of random quests given within a few short minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecritics.com/brad-gallaway/dragon-age-inquisition-preview-an-errand-girl-for-the-kingdom|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition Preview - An Errand Girl For The Kingdom|last=Gallaway|first=Brad|date=November 2, 2014|publisher=Gamecritics|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-release===
''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' received "Generally favorable" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt;

Alexander Sliwinski from [[Joystiq]] gave the game a perfect score. He described the game as "an immense fantasy epic, a sprawling adventure across the many landscapes of Thedas, unapologetically mature in its exploration of politics and brazen in its combat, It's everything that a sequel to ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' should have been." He also described the game as "the redemption song of the developer [[BioWare]]".&lt;ref name="JoystiqRev"/&gt; Adam Beck from ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' also awarded ''Inquisition'' a perfect score, saying that while "the artistic and visual fidelity help with immersion, it's the branching, player driven storyline and exquisitely layered combat system" that make the game special.&lt;ref name="Hardcore Gamer"/&gt; Philip Kollar from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' gave the game a 9.5/10. He praised the well-written characters, engrossing plot cliffhangers, tightly-connected story, as well as the combat system, as he described it as "a smart blend of the combat systems from ''Origins'' and ''Dragon Age 2'' which makes those long stretches exploring the wilderness fun."&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; Joe Juba from ''[[Game Informer]]'' also gave the game a 9.5/10. He praised the detailed environments, character models and spell effects, excellent voice acting and soundtracks, responsive combat and high replay value, but criticizing the disappointing center story arc, lack of a storage chest and multiple weapons sets, as well as some minor crashes and audio bugs. However, he still stated that "With the mixture of open-world exploration, entertaining combat, and top-tier characters, the team at BioWare has found a winning formula that isn't shackled to either ''Dragon Age: Origins'' or ''Dragon Age II''. ''Inquisition'' is not defined by the traditions it returns to, but by the new directions it forges for this magnificent fantasy universe."&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

Phil Savage from ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the rich content, fulfilling, dramatic and memorable plot, as well as the tough yet world-shifting decisions made throughout the game. However, he criticized the slow animation for the rogue career, as well as the tactical view, which could be confusing when encountering multiple enemies. He stated that such small yet noticeable flaws made ''Inquisition'' imperfect.&lt;ref name="PCGUS"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd from [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 9/10. He praised the wonderful cast of interesting and relatable characters, overarching narrative, diverse environments, as well as the fantastic balance between exploration, combat, story, and customization. Yet, he criticized the combat system, which required relatively less strategy.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Vince Ingenito from [[IGN]] gave the game a 8.8/10. He praised the substantial replay value from the multiplayer, as well as surprisingly huge, dense and detailed world. However, he criticized the weak and less compelling story, as well as numerous technical issues encountered. He described the game as "not only one of the most expansive RPGs I've ever played, but one of the few that successfully fills its gorgeous, massive world with meaningful things to do and see. A frustratingly vague plot and typical BioWare bugginess drag it down a bit, but both in combat and out, ''Inquisition'' marks a welcome return to the RPG depth that made Bioware's previous products ''Dragon Age: Origins'' and ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' so magnetic."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

Both [[Steven O'Donnell (Australian actor)|Bajo]] and [[Stephanie Bendixsen|Hex]] from ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' gave the game 10/10, the only such score they handed out in 2014. Both hosts praised the game's writing, voice acting, graphics, and gameplay, with Hex saying that "the writing and voice acting is just excellent" and that "Those sword and board hits though Bajo! So rewarding! It's classic dungeon crawling combat isn't it?". Bajo praised the game's challenge, stating that "where the combat truly shines is when you're in trouble" as well as offering a minor criticism that "The crafting system is a little hard to get your head around".&lt;ref name="Good Game"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s4131074.htm/|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 18, 2014 |website=Good Game |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also awarded it "Game of the Year" in their annual Christmas special.&lt;ref name="Good Game2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbTu5uOioZs&amp;list=UUSWJTP7X8ytO_xhA6x5v21Q|title=Good Game Awards - Best Game of 2014 - TX: 9/12/14 |author="Good Game" |date= December 9, 2014 |website=Youtube |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Hatsuyuki Kawano is a third-year student, one of the rare delinquents at his school. He reluctantly shows up in order to fulfill his graduation requirements. As the first snow of the year falls in December, Hatsuyuki encounters a beautiful girl wearing a white dress in the old town. She is wandering the streets in search of a rabbit. A few days later, the girl in the dress, Sakura, transfers into his school to take Hatsuyuki along towards the last winter.

==Characters==

===Main characters===

;{{Nihongo|Hatsuyuki Kawano|河野 初雪|Kawano Hatsuyuki}}
:Voiced by: none
:The protagonist of the story and is  a third-year student of {{Nihongo|Shirasaki Academy|白咲学園|Shirasaki Gakuen}}.

;{{Nihongo|Sakura Tamaki|玉樹 桜|Tamaki Sakura}}
:Voiced by: Minto Yamaha ([[Ai Shimizu]])
:Sakura Tamaki is a mysterious girl Hatsuyuki meets in the ruined old town, while she is searching for her bunny Nemu. She is somewhat weird and likes to use Nemu for BUNNY impersonations, which include things like the simple bunny, bunny-copter, old man’s beard, muffler, etc. She is strangely attracted to Hatsuyuki and has the habit of holding his hands whenever they are together, saying that his hands feel good. Highly allergic to adult themes in conversation, she is prone to scream "pyaa pyaa" and escape the scene whenever she hears it. She attends the same class as Hatsuyuki and seems to be a normal genki girl who gets along with everyone.

;{{Nihongo|Aya Kozakai|小坂井 綾|Kozakai Aya}}
:Voiced by: [[Fūri Samoto]] ([[Michiru Yuimoto]])
:Aya Kozakai is Hatsuyuki’s senior by one year. She works with him at a café filled with dolls, while waiting to get into college after failing the college entrance exam. She used to be the student council president and was the perfect student everyone looked up to but did not dare to get close to. No one knows what she is thinking, but she has a curious familiarity with Hatsuyuki despite having already graduated and supposedly never spending time with him before working at the café.

;{{Nihongo|Yoru Azuma|あずま 夜|Azuma Yoru}}
:Voiced by: Hana Kiritani ([[Atsumi Tanezaki]])
:Yoru Azuma is Hatsuyuki’s junior by one year and an expert ice skater who practices on the skating rinks every day after school. She is so good at it that she once had a shot at competing in the world championship but blew it in the preliminary matches. She is quite popular in school and the most level-headed of the bunch, often stopping Sakura and Nozomu from doing stupid things and providing valuable tsukkomi that only such a level-headed person could muster.

;{{Nihongo|Nozomu Shinonome|東雲 希|Shinonome Nozomu}}
:Voiced by: Mitsu Anzu ([[Mai Kadowaki]])
:Nozomu Shinonome is Hatsuyuki’s junior by two years and the leader of the committee who guides students on their futures. Having grown up around her older brother Sai’s guy friends, she looks up to Hatsuyuki like a hero and speaks like a boy to forge a “manly” relationship with him. She is kind of air-headed and easily manipulated by Hatsuyuki, though genuinely helpful to anyone who asks for her advice.

;{{Nihongo|Shirokuma|シロクマ||"[[polar bear|white bear]]"}}
:Voiced by: Sui Suzumiya (Motomi Nanaho)
:Shirokuma is a mysterious loli who claims to have come from Russia despite obviously not being Russian. Everyone calls her Shirokuma, though that is not her real name. She is highly dependent on other people, like a princess shut in her home surrounded by servants. Her real name is {{Nihongo|Takara Mochizuki|望月 宝|Mochizuki Takara}}.

===Secondary characters===

;{{Nihongo|Ran|ラン}}

The '''Hispanic–Latino naming dispute''' is an ongoing disagreement over the use of the [[ethnonym]]s "[[Hispanic]]" and "[[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]" to refer collectively to the inhabitants of the [[United States of America]] who are of [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] or Spanish origin—that is, Latino or Hispanic Americans.

==History==
The term "Hispanic" was adopted by the United States government in the early 1970s during the administration of [[Richard Nixon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/june97/rodriguez_6-18.html|title = A Cultural Identity|date=1997-06-18|accessdate = 2006-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Hispanic members of an interdepartmental Ad Hoc Committee to develop racial and ethnic definitions recommended that a universal term encompassing all Hispanic subgroups—including Central and South Americans—be adopted.&lt;ref name=HuffLatinoHispanic&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/latino-or-hispanic_n_3956350.html Huffington Post: "Latino Or Hispanic?

Previously, Hispanic and Latino Americans were categorized as "Spanish-Americans", "Spanish-speaking Americans", or "Spanish-surnamed Americans". However:

* Although a large majority of Hispanic and Latino Americans have Spanish ancestry, most are not of direct, "from-Spain-to-the-U.S."&lt;ref name="KanellosWeaver1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicolás Kanellos|author2=Thomas Weaver|author3=Claudio Esteva Fabregat|title=Handbook of Hispanic Cultures in the United States: Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hMsnIMQxN8C&amp;pg=PA92|year=1994|publisher=Arte Publico Press|isbn=978-1-61192-161-8|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamie Martinez Wood|title=Latino Writers and Journalists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIlaa0cLu2AC&amp;pg=PR7|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0785-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish descent; many are not primarily of Spanish descent; and some are not of Spanish descent at all. People whose ancestors or who themselves arrived in the United States directly from Spain are a tiny minority of the Hispanic or Latino population (see figures in this article), and there are Hispanic/Latino Americans who are of other [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ancestries]] in addition to [[Spanish people|Spanish]] (e.g., [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[German people|German]], and Middle Eastern, such as the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]]).&lt;ref name=pewpatriots&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/17.3.pdf |title=U.S. Latino Patriots: From the American Revolution to Afghanistan, An Overview |last=Rochin |first=Refugio I. |author2=Lionel Fernandez |accessdate=2013-09-20 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=Pew Research Hispanic Center}} Latino denotes "the inclusion of the non-Spanish cultures of Latin America that have contributed immensely to the development and structure of present-day Latino cultural groups. These groups may include people of Latin American descent whose cultural heritage may be African, Asian, American Indian or indigenous, Middle Eastern and/or European."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most Hispanic and Latino Americans can speak Spanish, but not all, and most Spanish-speaking Americans are Hispanic or Latino, but not all. For example, Hispanic/Latino Americans often do not speak Spanish by the third generation, and some Americans who speak Spanish may not identify themselves with Spanish-speaking Americans as an ethnic group.
* Not all Hispanic and Latino Americans have [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish surnames]], and ''most'' Spanish-surnamed Americans are Hispanic or Latino, but not all. Those without Spanish surnames but of Hispanic or Latino origin include politician [[Bill Richardson]], former [[National Football League]] (NFL) star [[Jim Plunkett]], and actress [[Salma Hayek]]. Likewise, while [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creoles]] and [[Cajuns]] may have Spanish surnames, they identify with the mostly [[Culture of France|French]]—though partially Spanish—culture of their region.

The term "Hispanic" actually refers to ''[[Hispania#Etymology|Hispania]]''—a large geographical area notably recognized in the Roman era. It consists of the entire Iberian peninsula, not just the modern-day state of Spain. Thus, the more recent division between the modern-day states of Spain and Portugal arguably has no bearing on these terms. (In this manner, Brazilians would be considered Hispanic.) Additionally, the term "Latin America" ({{lang|fr|Amérique latine}}) is a relatively recent invention by the French in the 19th century, intended to promote all Latin-based European interests and influence in the Western Hemisphere—further highlighting a clear and arguably erroneous inconsistency if excluding [[Quebec]], modern [[French Louisiana#Modern French Louisiana|French Louisiana]], the [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French Caribbean]], and [[French Guiana]] from the terms "Latin America" or "Latino". Ultimately, one may use the term "Hispanic America" instead.

== Usage of "Hispanic" ==
{{further|Hispanic}}
The term "Hispanic" has been the source of several debates in the USA. Within the U.S., the term originally referred typically to the [[Hispanos of New Mexico]] until the U.S. government used it in the [[1970 United States Census|1970 Census]] to refer to "a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race."&lt;ref name="Cobos-1"&gt;Cobos, Rubén (2003) "Introduction," ''A Dictionary of New Mexico &amp; Southern Colorado Spanish'' (2nd ed.); Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press; p. ix; {{ISBN|0-89013-452-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OMB1997" /&gt; The OMB did not accept the recommendation to retain the single term "Hispanic". Instead, the OMB has decided that the term should be "Hispanic or Latino" because regional usage of the terms differs. Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion of the United States. Since the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], the identifier has changed from "Hispanic" to "Spanish/Hispanic/Latino".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0075/twps0075.html#f1 |title=Identification of Hispanic Ethnicity in Census 2000: Analysis of Data Quality for the Question on Hispanic Origin, Population Division Working Paper No. 75 |last=Crese |first=Aruthur R. |last2=Schmidley |first2=Audrey Dianne |last3=Ramirez |first3=Roberto R. |at=Figure 1 |publisher=[[US Census Bureau]] |date=July 27, 2004|accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other federal and local government agencies and non-profit organizations include Brazilians and Portuguese in their definition of "Hispanic:. The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines "Hispanic" as "persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or others [of] Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/civilrights/faq.htm |publisher=US Department of Transportation Office of Civil Rights |title=What is a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)? |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109165512/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/civilrights/faq.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been adopted by the [[Small Business Administration]] as well as by many federal, state, and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to minority-owned businesses.
 
The [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]] (CHC)—which was organized in 1976 by five Hispanic Congressmen: Herman Badillo (NY), Baltasar Corrada del Río (PR), Kika de la Garza (TX), Henry B. Gonzalez (TX) and Edward Roybal (CA)—and the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]] include representatives of Spanish and Portuguese descent. The [[Hispanic Society of America]] is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[Latin America]]. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, which proclaims itself the champion of Hispanic success in higher education, has member institutions in the US, Puerto Rico, Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.

In a recent study, most Spanish speakers of Spanish or Latin American descent did not choose to use the terms "Hispanic" or "Latino" when describing their identity. Instead, they preferred to be identified by their country of origin. Over half of those surveyed said they had no preference for either term. When forced to choose, 33% chose "Hispanic" and 14% chose "Latino."&lt;ref&gt;http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/04/04/study-most-hispanics-prefer-describing-identity-from-familys-country-of-origin/&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in 2009 shows that there is not a significant difference between the attitudes or preferences towards the terms among young (18–25) and older individuals. The statistical numbers are almost identical. Among the overall Hispanic population, young Hispanic prefer to identify themselves with their family's country of origin. Both groups prefer the term "American" versus "Latino/Hispanic". Yet, older Hispanics are more likely to identify as white than younger Hispanics.&lt;ref name="PewCenter2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pew Hispanic Center staff|title=Between Two Worlds: How Young Latinos Come of Age in America I.

== Origin of "Latino" ==
{{further|Latino}}
The term Latin America was first coined by the French in the 19th century as ''Amérique latine'', during the time of the French Intervention in Mexico. It is a combination of the European word "latino" and the New World; "America". It was used to symbolically sever Mexico's Spanish roots, while at the same time, reinforcing a notion of belonging between the two nations. The ''Latin race'', as defined in this context, was composed of all people descending from nations who spoke [[romance languages|romance tongues]], descending from Latin. Hence, this definition would effectively include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish peoples etc. as "latinos" along with the people descended from the Latin colonies. Juan Francisco Martinez wrote that "France began talking about Amerique Latine during the rule of Napoleon III as a way of distinguishing between those areas of the Americas originally colonized by Europeans of Latin descent and those colonized by peoples front northern Europe. But the term was used to justify French intervention in the young republics of Latin America."&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Juan Francisco. 2009. "Identity (Latino/a vs. Hispanic)".

Regarding it as an arbitrary, generic term, many [[Latin American]] scholars, journalists and organizations have objected to the [[mass media]] use of the word "Latino", pointing out that such ethnonyms are optional and should be used only to describe people involved in the practices, ideologies and [[identity politics]] of their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.eserver.org/clogic/1-2/gimenez.html |title=Latinos/Hispanics ...

== Distinctions among the terms "Latino", "Latina", and "Hispanic" ==
Some authorities of [[American English]] maintain a distinction between the terms "Hispanic" and "Latino":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though often used interchangeably in American English, Hispanic and Latino have slightly different ranges of meaning. Hispanic, from the Latin word for "Spain," has the broader reference, potentially encompassing all Spanish-speaking peoples in both hemispheres and emphasizing the common denominator of language among communities that might sometimes seem to have little else in common. Latino—which in Spanish means "Latin" but in English is probably a shortening of the Spanish word ''latinoamericano''—refers more exclusively to persons or communities of Latin American Spanish-speaking origin. Of the two, only Hispanic can be used in referring to Spain and its history and culture. In practice, however, this distinction is of little significance when referring to Spanish-speaking residents of the United States, most of whom are of Latin American origin and can thus theoretically be called by either word. · Since the 1980s Latino has come to be much more prevalent than Hispanic in national media, but actual Americans of Spanish-speaking Latin American heritage are far from unified in their preferences. For some, Latino is a term of ethnic pride, evoking the broad mix of Latin American peoples, while Hispanic, tied etymologically to Spain rather than the Americas, has distasteful associations with conquest and colonization. But in recent polls of Americans of Spanish-speaking Latin American ancestry, Hispanic is still preferred over Latino among those expressing a preference, while those having no preference constitute a majority overall.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' also distinguishes between the terms. The ''Stylebook'' limits "Hispanic" to persons "from—or whose ancestors were from—a Spanish-speaking land or culture. Latino and Latina are sometimes preferred". It provides a more expansive definition, however, of "Latino". The ''Stylebook'' definition of "Latino" includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking land or ancestry, but also more generally includes persons "from—or whose ancestors were from— ... Latin America." The ''Stylebook'' specifically lists Brazilians as an example of a group that can be considered Latino.

It is important to note the difference between Latino and Latina. Latino is traditionally reserved for males and Latina for females. A group of Latina women is termed "Latinas", whereas a group of Latino men or a combination of Latino and Latina individuals are designated as "Latinos" ([[Latino (demonym)|See Latino (demonym)]]).

=== Lack of use of the term "Latina" ===

The term "Latina" is not used as much as the term "Latino", because in Spanish grammar the grammatical gender of the adjective  "Latino" is masculine when it modifies either a group of males, a group of males and females, a group described by a grammatically masculine noun, or a group whose actual gender is not known.  For this reason, the use of the grammatically masculine form is much more common.

== Alternate terms ==
=== Latino/a and Latin@ ===
Both Latino/a and Latin@ aim to challenge the gender binary that is inherent in the Spanish language,&lt;ref name="merriam"&gt;{{cite web|title='Latinx' And Gender Inclusivity|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/word-history-latinx|website=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combines the Spanish masculine ending "o" and the feminine "a".

Latin@ has been noted to have the symbolical importance of suggesting inclusiveness, by having the "o" encircle the "a", in one character.&lt;ref name="merriam"/&gt; Latin@ may be used to promote gender neutrality or be used to encompass both Latinos and Latinas without using the masculine "Latinos" designation for the mixed genders group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Latin@: Its Pronunciation and Meaning|url = https://www.noodle.com/articles/latin-what-it-means-and-how-to-say-it|accessdate = 2015-06-12|first = Orly|last = Michaeli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Latin@' Offers A Gender-Neutral Choice; But How To Pronounce It?|url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/01/07/168818064/latin-offers-a-gender-neutral-choice-but-how-to-pronounce-it|accessdate = 2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Latinx]] was introduced in the early 2000s as a gender-neutral term for Latino/Latina,&lt;ref name="merriam"/&gt; in addition to encompassing those who identify outside of the [[gender binary]], such as those who are [[transgender]], or those who are [[Genderqueer|gender-fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes|first1=Raul A.|title=To Be Or Not to Be Latinx?

==Hispanic/Latino ethnic groups==
The U.S. government has defined "Hispanic or Latino" persons as being "persons who trace their origin [to] ... Central and South America, and other Spanish cultures".&lt;ref name="OMB1997"/&gt; The Census Bureau's 2010 census provides a definition of the terms "Latino" and "Hispanic": "Hispanic or Latino" refers to a person of Mexican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. It allows respondents to self-define whether they were Latino or Hispanic and then identify their specific country or place of origin. On its website, the Census Bureau defines "Hispanic" or "Latino" persons as being "persons who trace their origin [to] ... Spanish-speaking Central and South America countries, and other Spanish cultures".&lt;ref name="OMB1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hispanic/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702001018/http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hispanic/about.html |archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These definitions thus arguably do not include [[Brazilian American]]s,&lt;ref name="OMB1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In contrast, some dictionary definitions may include Brazilian Americans or [[Brazilian people]], or both in general.&lt;/ref&gt; especially since the Census Bureau classifies Brazilian Americans as a separate ancestry group from "Hispanic or Latino".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPCharIterationServlet?_ts=309784655920 |title=Select Population Groups |work=2009 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, Selected Population Profile |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A surge of Portuguese-Americans faced a big scare when the Census Bureau revealed plans to categorize people of Portuguese descent as "Hispanics" in the 2020 National Census.

The rapid spread of "Latino" in the US has been possible due to the policies of certain newspapers such as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and other [[California]]-based media during the 1990s. The use of the term as a label has been the target of journalists like Raoul Lowery who have attacked it, denouncing it as a misleading and simplistic way of tagging a group as diverse as Latin Americans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For years I have campaigned against the ''Los Angeles Times''-imposed word, "Latino", in describing the country's fastest growing ethnic "Group," those with Spanish-surnames, those who speak Spanish, et al. The ''LA Times'' set its feet in concrete and the use of the word "Latino" and nothing has cracked the concrete since. Worst of all, other newspapers have followed the ''Times''{{'}} lead and news coverage, accuracy and the community have suffered.{{sfn|Contreras|2002|p=7}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lowery argues that, according to the statistics of the Census Bureau, most [[middle-class]] people with Latin-American background living in the United States reject the term.{{sfn|Contreras|2002|p=3}} He traces the polarization of the word to ''Los Angeles Times'' columnist Frank del Olmo, who regarded the term "Hispanic" as "ugly and imprecise".{{sfn|Contreras|2002|p=7}} He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The third reason Del Olmo objected to the word "Hispanic" and championed the word "Latino" was that "[[Chicano]]" had been roundly rejected by all Mexican Americans but the most radical, [[blue collar]], less educated, under-class people of Mexican-origin. Del Olmo pushed "Latino" as a substitute for the rejected "Chicano." Unfortunately, he was in a position to push this substitution into the language of the "[[Newspaper of Record]]" in the West. Other papers and broadcast stations took up the word because it was the "style" of the ''LA Times''. Frank Del Olmo single-handedly branded millions of people.{{sfn|Contreras|2002}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Latino, Hispanic or national identity ==
The naming dispute is a phenomenon that has its roots mainly in [[California]] and other neighboring states.{{sfn|Contreras|2002}} Before the adoption of the ethnonym "[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]]" by the [[United States Government]], the term Hispanic was commonly used for statistical purposes. However, many people did not feel satisfied with the term and started [[civil society campaign|campaigns]] promoting the use of "Latino" as a new ethnonym. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] has stated that the new term should be, indeed, "Hispanic or Latino" because the usage of the terms differs—"Hispanics is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion".&lt;ref name="omb97"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html|title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.

'''Instead, OMB has decided that the term should be "Hispanic or Latino."''' Because regional usage of the terms differs—Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion—this change may contribute to improved response rates.}} (Boldface in the original.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, debates regarding the proper name of the perceived homogeneous population of US citizens with Latin American or Spanish background still abound, and are even more acute. To find out how much people agree or disagree with either term, many polls have been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/homberger.html|title=Review: Other Immigrants: The Global Origins of the American People – A poll in 2000 revealed that 'Latinos' and 'Latinas' use neither term to describe themselves|last=Homberger|first=Eric|work=Reviews in History|date=November 2009|accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossculturecommunications.com/latino-hispanic.pdf|title=Latino or Hispanic Panic: Which Term Should We Use?|format=pdf|first=Edward|last=Retta|first2=Cynthia|last2=Brink|publisher=crossculturecommunications.com|year=2007|accessdate=2012-12-09|quote=In Texas, a Pew Hispanic Center poll found that 45% of Latinos prefer the term Hispanic and 8% prefer Latino.

Daniel David Arreola, in his book ''Hispanic spaces, Latino places: community and cultural diversity in contemporary America'', points out that many Latin Americans feel more comfortable identifying themselves with their country of origin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What most of us know and what the results from the 1992 Latino National Political survey demonstrate is a preference for place of origin or national identity in what we call ourselves. Face-to-face interviews of 2,817 people were conducted in 1989 and 1990. Some 57 percent to 86 percent of Mexicans and [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]]s—whether born in Mexico or born in the United States, whether born in the island or in the mainland—preferred to call themselves Mexican or Puerto Rican rather than panethnic names like Hispanic or Latino.{{sfn|Arreola|2004}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Pew Hispanic Center survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/04/04/when-labels-dont-fit-hispanics-and-their-views--identity/|title=When Labels dont fit Hispanics and Their Views of Identity|last=Taylor|first=Paul|last2=Lopez|first2=Mark Hugo|last3=Martínez|first3=Jessica Hamar|last4=Velasco|first4=Gabriel|publisher=Pew Hispanic Center|accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted November 9 – December 7, 2011, and published April 4, 2012, reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly four decades after the United States government mandated the use of the terms "Hispanic" or "Latino" to categorize Americans who trace their roots to Spanish-speaking countries, a new nationwide survey of Hispanic adults finds that these terms still haven't been fully embraced by Hispanics themselves. A majority (51%) say they most often identify themselves by their family's country of origin; just 24% say they prefer a pan-ethnic label.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Academic opinion and the social sciences ==
{{further|Ethnonym}}
One of the major arguments of people who object to either term is not only the perceived [[stereotype|stereotypical]] overtones they carry, but the unjust and unfair labeling of people who do not even belong to the practices and ideologies of such identities.&lt;ref&gt;

Journalist Juan Villegas writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The word 'Latino' may be loaded with negative connotations when used by non-Latinos in American culture because of its association with the sign 'Latin' which may imply a stereotyped character partially imposed by [[Hollywood]]. Latino is a sign that needs to be contextualized. It may bring some groups together, but it also may contribute to depoliticize a movement and to stereotype a diversity of social groups and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;

These characteristics that are often used, such as Hollywood, to classify a person of Latina/o culture and identity has been termed by scholars, "As a system of media signification, Latinidad is a performative and performed dynamic set of popular signs associated with Latinas/os and Latina/o identity. Common signifiers of Latinidad are language, linguistic accents, religious symbols, tropical and spicy foods, and brown skin as a phenotypic identity." (Berg Ramirez p.&amp;nbsp;40–41).  As Guzman discusses, "signifiers most commonly associated with Latinidad produce a sense of authenticity within media texts", (p.&amp;nbsp;235). Ramirez continues to discuss how these signifiers of Latinidad do not necessarily mean they are stereotypical. In actuality, Latina/os may utilize these "signifiers" for self-identifying purposes. In terms of media portrayal, Hollywood has invested a lot of time and money to develop a general notion of "Latinidad" because marketers, advertisers and media content producers have found that they are a very bankable demographic, thus turned "Latinidad" and Latina/o culture and identity to a commodity. What is problematic about this is when creating this general notion, the diversity within this demographic becomes suppressed and flattened in a demographic that is very heterogeneous just so marketers, advertisers and media content producers can communicate their version of "authentic" racial identity to consumers. Consequently, this opens the space for stereotypes to be created and perpetuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mediating Frida : Negotiating Discourses Of Latina/O Authenticity In Global Media Representations Of Ethnic Identity|last = Guzman|first = Isabel|date = 2006|journal = Critical Studies In Media Communication|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Catherine Alexandra Carter and [[Rodolfo Acuña]], address the issue from a more global and political perspective, stressing the importance of terms like "Latino" or "Hispanic" for the marketing industry and for statistical ends:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino', although first created for the purpose of lumping together a diverse group of people and making them more economically marketable, have grown into something far more significant. Over time the legitimacy and accuracy of these terms have come to influence not only the functioning of the marketing industry, but the organization and structure of many other aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When and why the Latino identity came about is a more involved story. Essentially, politicians, the media, and marketers find it convenient to deal with the different U.S. Spanish-speaking people under one umbrella. However, many people with Spanish surnames contest the term "Latino". They claim it is misleading because no Latino or Hispanic nationality exists since no Latino state exists, so generalizing the term "Latino" slights the various national identities included under the umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davila expands on the ramifications of the mass media's dominant use of "Latino" or "Hispanic" to categorize this demographic, "... the extent to which assertions of cultural differences intersect with dominant norms of American citizenship that give preeminence to white, monolingual, middle-class producers of and contributors to a political body defined in national terms. My concern is ... with how notions of citizenship, belonging, and entitlement are directly intertwined and predicated on dominant U.S. nationalist categories. Such categories conflate race, culture, and language with nationality, establishing the hierarchies and coordinates against which cultural and linguistic differences are ultimately evaluated (Ong 1999; Williams 1989). It is therefore these hierarchies that frame the discourses of Latinidad channeled in the media, as well as the media's treatment of language and what it may potentially communicate to and about Latino's claim to belonging, and in what terms they may or may not be within the political community of the United States." Consequently, this may leave issues, concerns, and topics relevant to this demographic left unheard, discussed and addressed. They are left invisible, therefore not only conflating the cultural differences, but also marginalizing them for the sake of convenience and marketability to the mass media. However, this is not to say this is a monolithic issue. Instead, this further gives incentive for the demographic to create a space in which they can transform these notions where the representations are more diverse, complex and authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = |title = Mapping Latinidad: Language and Culture in the Spanish TV Battlefront |first = Arlene |last = Davila |date = February 2000 |journal =Television &amp; New Media |volume=1 |number=1 |pages=75–94 |doi = 10.1177/152747640000100105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone rejects the terms and in fact feel that this idea of Latinidad is taken for granted. G. Christina Mora, author and UC Berkeley sociologist professor emphasizes the importance of the Hispanic term. In her book, "Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mora|first1=G. Cristina|title=Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226033839}}&lt;/ref&gt; she explains the origins of the term and how it positively unites Hispanics. The term officially came into existence through United States government but it was due to an activist movement. Before this term, groups such as Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans were only accounted for in census data as "white". The lack of specific data tied to Hispanics failed to show their social circumstance and therefore could not create necessary changes. There was no data to back up that they were significantly being affected by poverty, discrimination, and disadvantageous education. Without data, Hispanics would not receive adequate funding to change their circumstances and future. Due to the activism on behalf of Chicano and Puerto Rican individuals, there is data that supports and unites a group towards social equality.

Mora, states the following about the term and what she hopes it will mean for her daughter:

"I hope that my daughter will be conscious that the idea of Latino/Hispanic was actually rooted in an effort to work for social justice and political inclusion. Though we are a diverse community, many still grapple with disadvantage, discrimination and underrepresentation. All in all, I hope my daughter will embrace her Latinidad by being conscious of its roots in social justice and by continuing the cause of civil rights and political participation in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voices: How We Became Hispanic – NBC News|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hispanic-heritage-month/voices-how-we-became-hispanic-n209131|accessdate = 2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of American newspapers''' begins in the early 18th century with the publication of the first [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial]] newspapers.  American newspapers began as modest affairs—a sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for [[American independence]]. Following independence the first article of [[U.S. Constitution]] guaranteed [[freedom of the press]].  The [[Postal Service Act|U.S. Postal Service Act of 1792]] provided substantial subsidies:  Newspapers were delivered up to 100 miles for a penny and beyond for 1.5 cents, when first class postage ranged from six cents to a quarter.

The American press grew rapidly during the [[First Party System]] (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans.  From the 1830s onward, the [[Penny press]] began to play a major role in American journalism.  Technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s also helped to expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted. 
 
By 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, [[muckraking]] and [[sensationalism]], along with serious, and [[journalistic objectivity|objective]] news-gathering. During the early 20th century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles.

In the late 20th century, much of American journalism became housed in big media chains. With the coming of digital journalism in the 21st century, all newspapers faced a business crisis as readers turned to the Internet for sources and advertisers followed them.

==Colonial period==
Merchants published mainly commercial papers. For example, The Boston Daily Advertiser was reported on ship arrivals and departures.

Prior to the 1830s, a majority of US newspapers were aligned with a political party or platform. Political parties would sponsor anonymous political figures in The Federal Republican and Daily Gazette. This was called partisan press and was not unbiased in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik, McIntosh|first1=John V., Shawn|title=Converging Media|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first editors discovered readers loved it when they criticized the local governor; the governors discovered they could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought [[John Peter Zenger]] to trial for criminal libel after the publication of satirical attacks. The jury acquitted Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press.  The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies (only New Jersey was lacking one), and the satirical attack on government became common practice in American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Olson, "The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America."

===''The New England Courant''===
[[File:NewEnglandCourant 00001.jpg|thumb|''The New England Courant'']]
It was [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]]  (1697–1735), Benjamin Franklin's older brother, who first made a news sheet something more than a garbled mass of stale items, "taken from the ''Gazette'' and other Public Prints of London" some six months late. Instead, he launched a third newspaper,  ''[[The New England Courant]]''."  His associates were known as the Hell-Fire Club; they succeeded in publishing a distinctive newspaper that annoyed the New England elite while proving entertaining and establishing a kind of literary precedent.  Instead of filling the first part of the ''Courant'' with the tedious conventionalities of governors' addresses to provincial legislatures, James Franklin's club wrote essays and satirical letters modeled on ''[[The Spectator]]'', which first appeared in London ten years earlier.  After the more formal introductory paper on some general topic, such as zeal or hypocrisy or honor or contentment, the facetious letters of imaginary correspondents commonly fill the remainder of the ''Courant'''s first page. Timothy Turnstone addresses flippant jibes to Justice Nicholas Clodpate in the first extant number of the ''Courant''. Tom Pen-Shallow quickly follows, with his mischievous little postscript: "Pray inform me whether in your Province Criminals have the Privilege of a Jury." Tom Tram writes from the moon about rumors of a certain "villainous Postmaster". (The ''Courant'' was always perilously close to legal difficulties and had, besides, a lasting feud with the town postmaster.) Ichabod Henroost complains of a gadding wife. Abigail Afterwit would like to know when the editor of the rival paper, the Gazette, "intends to have done printing the Carolina Addresses to their Governor, and give his Readers Something in the Room of them, that will be more entertaining." Homespun Jack deplores the fashions in general and small waists in particular. Some of these papers represent native wit, with only a general approach to the model; others are little more than paraphrases of ''The Spectator''. And sometimes a ''Spectator'' paper is inserted bodily, with no attempt at paraphrase whatever. They also published poetry, histories, autobiographies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Williard Grosvenor Bleyer, "The beginning of the Franklins' New-England Courant." ''Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly'' 4.2 (1927): 1+&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Franklin, journalist
[Benjamin Franklin] saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through the construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England.  Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain, It was more than a business venture,  for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 1997 | title = Benjamin Franklin's Journalism | url = | journal = [[Fides et Historia]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 60–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted three "wretched little" news sheets, [[Andrew Bradford]]'s ''American Mercury'', and [[Samuel Keimer]]'s ''Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania Gazette''. This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from Chambers's Universal Dictionary.  Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the ''Instructor,'' and made it ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. The ''Gazette'' soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun.  From the first he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called "The Busy-Body," which he wrote for Bradford's ''American Mercury'' in 1729, followed the general Addisonian form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as Isaac Bickerstaff had been in the ''Tatler''. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the "sowre Philosopher", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, Samuel Keimer.

As time went on, Franklin depended less on his literary conventions, and more on his own native humor. In this there is a new spirit—not suggested to him by the fine breeding of Addison, or the bitter irony of Swift, or the stinging completeness of Pope. The brilliant little pieces Franklin wrote for his ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' have an imperishable place in American literature.

The ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', like most other newspapers of the period was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the ''Gazette.'' His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal.  On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them.

Franklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, ''Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklins-Printing-Network-Disseminating/dp/0826216145/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  He began in Charleston, South Carolina in 1731. After the second editor died his widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success, 1738-46. She was one of colonial era's first woman printers.&lt;ref&gt;Ira L. Baker,  "Elizabeth Timothy: America's First Woman Editor," "Journalism Quarterly'' (1977) 54#2 pp 280-285.&lt;/ref&gt;  For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter who took over in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, "'The Partnership at Carolina Having succeeded, was Encourag'd to Engage in Others': The Genesis of Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network," ''Southern Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the South'' (2006), Vol. 13 Issue 1/2, pp 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' had a policy of impartiality in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Editor Peter Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias, and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Jeffery A. | year = 1993 | title = Impartiality and Revolutionary Ideology: Editorial Policies of the 'South-Carolina Gazette,' 1732-1735 | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 511–526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Franklin's ''Connecticut Gazette'' (1755–68) proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 2003 | title = 'I am now about to establish a small Printing Office ... at Newhaven": Benjamin Franklin and the First Newspaper in Connecticut | url = | journal = Connecticut History | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 77–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Virginia Gazette''===
Early theatrical notices may also be followed in ''The Virginia Gazette'', a paper of unusual excellence, edited by William Parks in Williamsburg, the old capital of Virginia. Here ''The Busy-Body'', ''The Recruiting Officer'', and ''[[The Beaux' Stratagem]]'' were all performed, often by amateurs, though professionals were known as early as 1716 in Williamsburg. Life in Williamsburg in 1736 had a more cosmopolitan quality than in other towns. A sprightly essay-serial called The Monitor, which fills the first page of ''The Virginia Gazette'' for twenty-two numbers, probably reflects not only the social life of the capital, but also the newer fashion in such periodical work. It is dramatic in method, with vividly realized characters who gossip and chat over games of piquet or at the theatre. ''The Beaux' Stratagem'', which had been played in Williamsburg three weeks before, is mentioned as delightful enough to make one of the ladies commit the indiscretion of giggling. The Monitor represents a kind of light social satire unusual in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Manson Myers, "The Old Dominion Looks to London: A Study of English Literary Influences upon" The Virginia Gazettte"(1736-1766)." ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 54.3 (1946): 195-217. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4245413 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics in the later newspapers===
After 1750, general news became accessible, and the newspapers show more and more interest in public affairs. The literary first page was no longer necessary, though occasionally used to cover a dull period. A new type of vigorous polemic gradually superseded the older essay. A few of the well-known conventions were retained, however. We still find the fictitious letter, with the fanciful signature, or a series of papers under a common title, such as ''The Virginia-Centinel'', or Livingston's ''Watch-Tower''. The former is a flaming appeal to arms, running through ''The Virginia Gazette'' in 1756, and copied into Northern papers to rouse patriotism against the French enemy. The expression of the sentiment, even thus early, seems national. Livingston's well-known ''Watch-Tower'', a continuation of his pamphlet-magazine ''The Independent Reflecto''r, has already the keen edge of the Revolutionary writings of fifteen and twenty years later. The fifty-second number even has one of the popular phrases of the Revolution: "Had I not sounded the Alarm, Bigotry would e'er now have triumphed over the natural Rights of British Subjects." ([[Hugh Gaine|Gaine]]'s ''Mercury'' in 1754–1755)

==Revolutionary epoch and early national era: 1770–1820==
(This section is based on [http://www.bartleby.com/226/index.html#12 Newspapers, 1775–1860 by Frank W. Scott])
[[Image:Massachusetts Spy 3a10607u.png|thumb|right|''Massachusetts Spy'', July 7, 1774]]
Weekly newspapers in major cities and towns were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers). They printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters and pronouncements.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Sue Humphrey, ''The American Revolution and the Press: The Promise of Independence'' (Northwestern University Press; 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the eve of Revolution Virginia had three separate weeklies at the same time named ''The Virginia Gazette''—they all kept up a heavy fire against the king and his governors.&lt;ref&gt;Stella F. Duff,  "The Case Against the King: The Virginia Gazettes Indict George III." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 6#3 (1949): 383-397.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1919983 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Massachusetts Spy'' and the Patriotic Press===
[[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]]'s ''[[Massachusetts Spy]]'', published in Boston and Worcester, was constantly on the verge of being suppressed, from the time of its establishment in 1770 to 1776 and during the [[American Revolution]]. In 1771-73 the ''Spy'' featured the essays of several anonymous political commentators who called themselves "Centinel," "Mucius Scaevola" and "Leonidas." They spoke in the same terms about similar issues, kept Patriot polemics on the front page, and supported each other against attacks in progovernment papers. Rhetorical combat was a Patriot tactic that explained the issues of the day and fostered cohesiveness without advocating outright rebellion. The columnists spoke to the colonists as an independent people tied to Britain only by voluntary legal compact. The ''Spy'' soon carried radicalism to its logical conclusion. When articles from the ''Spy'' were reprinted in other papers, as the country as a whole was ready for [[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine's]] ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (in 1776).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = York | first1 = Neil L. | year = 1995 | title = Tag-Team Polemics: The 'Centinel' and his Allies in the ''Massachusetts Spy'' | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society | volume = 107 | issue = | pages = 85–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbulent years between 1775 and 1783 were a time of great trial and disturbance among newspapers. Interruption, suppression, and lack of support checked their growth substantially. Although there were forty-three newspapers in the United States when the treaty of peace was signed (1783), as compared with thirty-seven on the date of the [[battle of Lexington]] (1775), only a dozen remained in continuous operation between the two events, and most of those had experienced delays and difficulties through lack of paper, type, and patronage. Not one newspaper in the principal cities, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, continued publication throughout the war. When the colonial forces were in possession, royalist papers were suppressed, and at times of British occupation Revolutionary papers moved away, or were discontinued, or they became royalist, only to suffer at the next turn of military fortunes. Thus there was an exodus of papers from the cities along the coast to smaller inland places, where alone it was possible for them to continue without interruption. Scarcity of paper was acute; type worn out could not be replaced. The appearance of the newspapers deteriorated, and issues sometimes failed to appear at all. Mail service, never good, was poorer than ever; foreign newspapers, an important source of information, could be obtained but rarely; many of the ablest writers who had filled the columns with dissertations upon colonial rights and government were now otherwise occupied.

News from a distance was less full and regular than before; yet when great events happened reports spread over the country with great rapidity, through messengers in the service of patriotic organizations. The quality of reporting was still imperfect. ''The Salem Gazette'' printed a full but colored account of the battle of Lexington, giving details of the burning, pillage, and barbarities charged to the British, and praising the militia who were filled with "higher sentiments of humanity." The Declaration of Independence was published by Congress, 6 July 1776, in the ''Philadelphia Evening Post'', from which it was copied by most of the newspapers in the new nation; but some of them did not mention it until two weeks later, and even then found room for only a synopsis. When they were permitted to do so, they printed fairly full accounts of the proceedings of provincial assemblies and of Congress, which were copied widely, as were all official reports and proclamations. On the whole, however, a relatively small proportion of such material and an inadequate account of the progress of the war is found in the contemporaneous newspapers.

The general spirit of the time found fuller utterance in mottoes, editorials, letters, and poems. In the beginning both editorials and communications urged united resistance to oppression, praised patriotism, and denounced tyranny; as events and public sentiment developed these grew more vigorous, often a little more radical than the populace. Later, the idea of independence took form, and theories of government were discussed. More interesting and valuable as specimens of literature than these discussions were the poems inspired by the stirring events of the time. Long narratives of battles and of heroic deaths were mingled with eulogies of departed heroes. Songs meant to inspire and thrill were not lacking. Humor, pathos, and satire sought to stir the feelings of the public. Much of the poetry of the Revolution is to be found in the columns of the newspapers, from the vivid and popular satires and narratives of [[Philip Freneau]] to the saddest effusions of the most commonplace schoolmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlesinger | first1 = Arthur M. | year = 1954 | title = A Note on Songs as Patriot Propaganda 1765-1776 | jstor = 1923150 | journal = William and Mary Quarterly | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 78–88 | doi=10.2307/1923150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for full details see Gillian B. Anderson, ''Freedom's Voice in Poetry and Song. Part 1, An Inventory of Political and Patriotic Lyrics in Colonial American Newspapers, 1773-1783. Part 2, Song Book'' (1977), 888pp&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspapers of the Revolution were an effective force working towards the unification of sentiment, the awakening of a consciousness of a common purpose, interest, and destiny among the separate colonies, and of a determination to see the war through to a successful issue. They were more single-minded than the people themselves, and they bore no small share of the burden of arousing and supporting the often discouraged and indifferent public spirit. ''[[The New Jersey Journal]]'' became the second newspaper published in New Jersey. It was established by [[Shepard Kollock]] at his press during 1779 in [[Chatham Borough, New Jersey|the village of Chatham, New Jersey]]. This paper became a catalyst in the revolution. News of events came directly to the editor from [[George Washington|Washington]]'s headquarters in nearby [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], boosting the morale of the troops and their families, and he conducted lively debates about the efforts for independence with those who opposed and supported the cause he championed. Kollock later relocated the paper twice, until 1785, when he established his last publication location in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] under the same name. The ''Elizabeth Daily Journal'' ceased publication on January 2, 1992 after having been in continuous publication for 212 years, the fourth oldest newspaper published continuously in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF85130C5B9627&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "NEW JERSEY LOSES OLDEST PAPER"], ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', January 3, 1992.

Vezza wouldn't say how much money the 212-year-old newspaper had lost. Most of its 84 employees will be laid off."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the papers, however, which were kept alive or brought to life during the war could not adapt themselves to the new conditions of peace. Perhaps only a dozen of the survivors held their own in the new time, notably the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'', which declined rapidly in the following decade, The ''[[Connecticut Courant]]'' of Hartford, ''The Providence Gazette'', and ''[[Pennsylvania Packet|The Pennsylvania Packet]]'' of Philadelphia, to which may be added such representative papers as the ''[[Massachusetts Spy]]'', Boston's ''[[Independent Chronicle]]'', the ''New York Journal and Packet'', the ''[[The Newport Daily News|Newport Mercury]]'', the ''[[Maryland Gazette]]'' of Annapolis, the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette (newspaper)|Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' and ''[[The Pennsylvania Journal]]'', both of Philadelphia. Practically all were of four small pages, each of three or four columns, issued weekly. In 1783, the ''[[Pennsylvania Evening Post]]'' became the first American daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 1965 |title=Benjamin Towne: The Precarious Career of a Persistent Printer |journal=[[Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography]] |volume=89 |issue=3 |jstor=20089817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the ''[[Pennsylvania Packet]]'' was published three times a week, and the ''New York Journal'' twice a week, as were several of the papers begun in that year. There was a notable extension to new fields. In Vermont, where the first paper, established in 1781, had soon died, another arose in 1783; in Maine, two were started in 1785. In 1786, the first one west of the Alleghenies appeared at Pittsburgh, and following the westward tide of immigration the ''[[Kentucky Gazette]]'' was begun at Lexington in 1787.

Conditions were hardly more favorable to newspapers than during the recent conflict. The sources of news were much the same; the means of communication and the postal system were little improved. Newspapers were not carried in the mails but by favor of the postmen, and the money of one state was of dubious value in another. Consequently, circulations were small, rarely reaching a thousand; subscribers were slow in paying; and advertisements were not plentiful. Newspapers remained subject to provincial laws of libel, in accordance with the old common law, and were, as in Massachusetts for a short time in 1785, subject to special state taxes on paper or on advertisements. But public sentiment was growing strongly against all legal restrictions, and in general the papers practiced freedom, not to say license, of utterance.

With independence had come the consciousness of a great destiny. The collective spirit aroused by the war, though clouded by conflicting local difficulties, was intense, and the principal interest of the newspapers was to create a nation out of the loose confederation. Business and commerce were their next care; but in an effort to be all things to all men, the small page included a little of whatever might "interest, instruct, or amuse." Political intelligence occupied first place; news, in the modern sense, was subordinated. A new idea, quite as much as a fire, a murder, or a prodigy, was a matter of news moment. There were always a few items of local interest, usually placed with paragraphs of editorial miscellany. Correspondents, in return for the paper, sent items; private letters, often no doubt written with a view to such use, were a fruitful source of news; but the chief resource was the newspapers that every office received as exchanges, carried in the post free of charge, and the newspapers from abroad.

===Partisan newspapers===
Newspapers became a form of public property after 1800.  Americans believed that as republican citizens they had a right to the information contained in newspapers without paying anything. To gain access readers subverted the subscription system by refusing to pay, borrowing, or stealing. Editors, however, tolerated these tactics because they wanted longer subscription lists. First, the more people read the newspaper, more attractive it would be to advertisers, who would purchase more ads and pay higher rates.  A second advantage was that greater depth of coverage translated into political influence for partisan newspapers. Newspapers also became part of the public sphere when they became freely available at reading rooms, barbershops, taverns, hotels and coffeehouses.&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Steffen, "Newspapers for Free: The Economies of Newspaper Circulation in the Early Republic," ''Journal of the Early Republic,'' Fall 2003, Vol. 23 Issue 3, pp 381-419&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor, usually reflecting the sentiment of a group or a faction, began to emerge as a distinct power. He closely followed the drift of events and expressed vigorous opinions. But as yet the principal discussions were contributed not by the editors but by "the master minds of the country." The growing importance of the newspaper was shown in the discussions preceding the Federal Convention, and notably in the countrywide debate on the adoption of the Constitution, in which the newspaper largely displaced the pamphlet. When [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], and [[John Jay]] united to produce the Federalist Essays, they chose to publish them in ''The Independent Journal'' and ''The Daily Advertiser'', from which they were copied by practically every paper in America long before they were made into a book.

When the first Congress assembled 4 March 1789, the administration felt the need of a paper, and, under the influence of Hamilton, [[John Fenno]] issued at New York, 15 April, the first number of ''[[The Gazette of the United States]]'', the earliest of a series of administration organs. The editorship of the ''Gazette'' later fell to [[Joseph Dennie]], who had previously made a success of ''The Farmer's Weekly Museum'' and would later found ''Port Folio'', two of the most successful newspapers of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lora |first=Ronald |title=The Conservative Press in Eighteenth-and Nineteenth-century America  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRpKaRzq6OMC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=The+Farmer%27s+Weekly+Museum |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=1999 |pages=103–111 |isbn=0-313-31043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seat of government became the journalistic center of the country, and as long as party politics remained the staple news interest the administration organs and their opponents were the chief sources of news for the papers of the country.

Partisan bitterness increased during the last decade of the century as the [[First Party System]] took shape. The parties needed newspapers to communicate with their voters. New England papers were generally [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]; in Pennsylvania there was a balance; in the West and South the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] press predominated. Though the Federalists were vigorously supported by such able papers as Russell's ''Columbian Centinel'' in Boston, [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas's]] ''Massachusetts Spy'', ''The Connecticut Courant'', and, after 1793, [[Noah Webster|Noah Webster's]] daily ''Minerva'' (soon renamed ''Commercial Advertiser'') in New York, the ''Gazette of the United States'', which in 1790 followed Congress and the capital to Philadelphia, was at the center of conflict, "a paper of pure Toryism", as Thomas Jefferson said, "disseminating the doctrines of monarchy, aristocracy, and the exclusion of the people." To offset the influence of this, Jefferson and Madison induced [[Philip Morin Freneau|Philip Freneau]], who had been editing ''The Daily Advertiser'' in New York, to set up a "half weekly", to "go through the states and furnish a Whig [Republican] vehicle of intelligence." Freneau's ''[[National Gazette]]'', which first appeared 31 October 1791, soon became the most outspoken critic of the administration of Adams, Hamilton, and Washington, and an ardent advocate of the French Revolution. Fenno and Freneau, in the ''Gazette of the United States'' and the ''National Gazette'', at once came to grips, and the campaign of personal and party abuse in partisan news reports, in virulent editorials, in poems and skits of every kind, was echoed from one end of the country to the other.  The ''National Gazette'' closed in 1793 due to circulation problems and the political backlash against Jefferson and Madison's financial involvement in founding the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pasley | first1 = Jeffrey L. | year = 2000 | title = The Two National Gazettes | url = | journal = Early American Literature | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 51–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other Republican paper of primary importance was the ''Aurora General Advertiser'', founded by Ben Franklin's grandson and heir, Benjamin Franklin Bache, on October 2, 1790. The ''Aurora'', published from [[Franklin Court]] in Philadelphia, was the most strident newspaper of its time, attacking John Adams' anti-democratic policies on a daily basis. No paper is thought to have given Adams more trouble than the ''Aurora''. His wife, Abigail, wrote frequent letters to her sister and others decrying what she considered the slander spewing forth from the ''Aurora''. Jefferson credited the ''Aurora'' with averting a disastrous war with France, and laying the groundwork for his own election. Following Bache's death (the result of his staying in Philadelphia during a yellow fever epidemic, while he was awaiting trial under the Sedition Act), William Duane, an immigrant from Ireland, led the paper until 1822 (and married Bache's widow, following the death of his own wife in the same Yellow Fever epidemic). Like Freneau, Bache and Duane were involved in a daily back-and-forth with the Federalist editors, especially Fenno and Cobbett.

[[Noah Webster]], strapped for money, accepted an offer in late 1793 from [[Alexander Hamilton]] of $1,500 to move to [[New York City]] and edit a Federalist newspaper. In December he founded New York's first daily newspaper, ''American Minerva'' (later known as ''The Commercial Advertiser''). He edited it for four years, writing the equivalent of 20 volumes of articles and editorials. He also published the semi-weekly publication, ''The Herald, A Gazette for the country'' (later known as ''The New York Spectator''). As a partisan he soon was denounced by the Jeffersonian Republicans as "a pusillanimous, half-begotten, self-dubbed patriot", "an incurable lunatic", and "a deceitful newsmonge ... Pedagogue and Quack." Fellow Federalist Cobbett labeled him "a traitor to the cause of Federalism", calling him "a toad in the service of sans-culottism", "a prostitute wretch", "a great fool, and a barefaced liar", "a spiteful viper", and "a maniacal pedant." The master of words was distressed. Even the use of words like "the people", "democracy", and "equality" in public debate, bothered him for such words were "metaphysical abstractions that either have no meaning, or at least none that mere mortals can comprehend."

The first party newspapers were full of vituperation. As one historian comments,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was with the newspaper editors, however, on both sides that a climax of rancorous and venomous abuse was reached. Of the Federalist editors, the most voluminous masters of scurrility were William Cobbett of ''Porcupine's Gazette'' and John Ward Fenno of the ''United States Gazette'', at Philadelphia; Noah Webster of the ''American Minerva'', at New York; and at Boston, Benjamin Russell of the ''Columbian Centinel'', Thomas Paine of the ''Federal Orrery'', and John Russell of the ''Boston Gazette''. Chief of these was Cobbett, whose control of abusive epithet and invective may be judged from the following terms applied by him to his political foes, the Jacobins: "refuse of nations"; "yelper of the Democratic kennels"; "vile old wretch"; "tool of a baboon"; "frog-eating, man-eating, blood-drinking cannibals"; "I say, beware, ye under-strapping cut-throats who walk in rags and sleep amidst filth and vermin; for if once the halter gets round your flea-bitten necks, howling and confessing will come too late." He wrote of the "base and hellish calumnies" propagated by the Jacobins, and of "tearing the mask from the artful and ferocious villains who, owing to the infatuation of the poor, and the supineness of the rich, have made such fearful progress in the destruction of all that is amiable and good and sacred among men." Among the milder examples of his description of Jacobins was the following:

"Where the voice of the people has the most weight in public affairs, there it is most easy to introduce novel and subversive doctrines. In such States too, there generally, not to say always, exists a party who, from the long habit of hating those who administer the Government, become the enemies of the Government itself, and are ready to sell their treacherous services to the first bidder. To these descriptions of men, the sect of the Jacobins have attached themselves in every country they have been suffered to enter. They are a sort of flies, that naturally settle on the excremental and corrupted parts of the body politic ... The persons who composed this opposition, and who thence took the name of Anti-Federalists, were not equal to the Federalists, either in point of riches or respectability. They were in general, men of bad moral characters embarrassed in their private affairs, or the tools of such as were. Men of this caste naturally feared the operation of a Government imbued with sufficient strength to make itself respected, and with sufficient wisdom to exclude the ignorant and wicked from a share in its administration."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Warren, ''Jacobin and Junto'', (1931) pp 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This decade of violence was nevertheless one of development in both the quality and the power of newspapers. News reporting was extended to new fields of local affairs, and the intense rivalry of all too numerous competitors awoke the beginnings of that rush for the earliest reports, which was to become the dominant trait in American journalism. The editor evolved into a new type. As a man of literary skill, or a politician, or a lawyer with a gift for polemical writing, he began to supersede the contributors of essays as the strongest writer on the paper. Much of the best writing, and of the rankest scurrility, be it said, was produced by editors born and trained abroad, like Bache of the ''Aurora'', Cobbett, Cooper, Gales, Cheetham, Callender, Lyon, and Holt. Of the whole number of papers in the country towards the end of the decade, more than one hundred and fifty, at least twenty opposed to the administration were conducted by aliens. The power wielded by these anti-administration editors impressed John Adams, who in 1801 wrote: "If we had been blessed with common sense, we should not have been overthrown by Philip Freneau, Duane, Callender, Cooper, and Lyon, or their great patron and protector. A group of foreign liars encouraged by a few ambitious native gentlemen have discomfited the education, the talents, the virtues, and the prosperity of the country."

The most obvious example of that Federalist lack of common sense was the passage of the Alien and Sedition laws in 1798 to protect the government from the libels of editors. The result was a dozen convictions and a storm of outraged public opinion that threw the party from power and gave the Jeffersonian Republican press renewed confidence and the material benefit of patronage when the Republicans took control of the government in 1800. The Republican party was especially effective in building a network of newspapers in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize in its favor. [[Fisher Ames]], a leading Federalist, blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson: they were "an overmatch for any Government ... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition."&lt;ref&gt;Noble Cunningham, ''The Jeffersonian Republicans: 1789–1801'' (1957) p 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspapers continued primarily party organs; the tone remained strongly partisan, though it gradually gained poise and attained a degree of literary excellence and professional dignity. The typical newspaper, a weekly, had a paid circulation of 500. The growth of the postal system, with the free transportation of newspapers locally and statewide, allowed the emergence of powerful state newspapers that closely reflected, and shaped, party views.

===Growth===
[[File:Newspaper growth.png|thumb|350px|Growth in newspapers]]

The number and geographical distribution of newspapers grew apace. In 1800 there were between 150 and 200; by 1810 there were 366, and during the next two decades the increase was at least equally rapid.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; With astonishing promptness the press followed the sparse population as it trickled westward and down the Ohio or penetrated the more northerly forests. By 1835 papers had spread to the Mississippi River and beyond, from Texas to St. Louis, throughout Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and into Wisconsin. These pioneer papers, poorly written, poorly printed, and partisan often beyond all reason, served a greater than a merely local purpose in sending weekly to the seat of government their hundreds of messages of good and evil report, of politics and trade, of weather and crops, that helped immeasurably to bind the far-flung population into a nation. Every congressman wrote regularly to his own local paper; other correspondents were called upon for like service, and in some instances the country editors established extensive and reliable lines of intelligence; but most of them depended on the bundle of exchanges from Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, and reciprocally the city papers made good use of their country exchanges.

Meanwhile, the daily newspapers were increasing in number. The first had appeared in Philadelphia and New York in 1784 and 1785; in 1796 one appeared in Boston. By 1810 there were twenty-seven in the country—one in the city of Washington, five in Maryland, seven in New York, nine in Pennsylvania, three in South Carolina, and two in Louisiana. As early as 1835 the ''Detroit Free Press'' began its long career.

==The press in the Party System: 1820–1890==
(This section is based on [http://www.bartleby.com/226/index.html#12 Newspapers, 1775–1860 by Frank W. Scott])

The political and journalistic situation made the administration organ one of the characteristic features of the period. Fenno's Gazette had served the purpose for Washington and Adams; but the first great example of the type was the ''[[National Intelligencer]]'' established in October, 1800, by [[Samuel Harrison Smith (printer)|Samuel Harrison Smith]], to support the administration of Jefferson and of successive presidents until after Jackson it was thrown into the opposition, and ''The United States Telegraph'', edited by [[Duff Green]], became the official paper. It was replaced at the close of 1830 by a new paper, ''The Globe'', under the editorship of [[Francis P. Blair]], one of the ablest of all ante-bellum political editors, who, with [[John P. Rives]],&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt; conducted it until the changing standards and conditions in journalism rendered the administration organ obsolescent. The Globe was displaced in 1841 by another paper called ''The National Intelligencer'', which in turn gave way to ''The Madisonian''. [[Thomas Ritchie (journalist)|Thomas Ritchie]] was in 1845 called from his long service on ''The Richmond Enquirer'' to found, on the remains of ''The Globe'', the ''Washington Union'', to speak for the Polk administration and to reconcile the factions of democracy. Neither the Union nor its successors, which maintained the semblance of official support until 1860, ever occupied the commanding position held by the ''Telegraph'' and ''The Globe'', but for forty years the administration organs had been the leaders when political journalism was dominant. Their influence was shared and increased by such political editors as M. M. Noah and [[James Watson Webb]] of the ''[[New York Courier and Enquirer]]'', [[Solomon Southwick]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt; of the ''Albany Register'', Edwin Croswell, who edited ''The Argus'' and who, supported by [[Martin Van Buren]] and others, formed what was known as the "[[Albany Regency]]." The "Regency", the Richmond "Junta", which centered in the Enquirer, and the "Kitchen Cabinet" headed by the editor of ''The Globe'', formed one of the most powerful political and journalistic cabals that the country has ever known. Their decline, in the late thirties, was coincident with great changes, both political and journalistic, and though successors arose, their kind was not again so prominent or influential. The newspaper of national scope was passing away, yielding to the influence of the telegraph and the railroad, which robbed the Washington press of its claim to prestige as the chief source of political news. At the same time politics was losing its predominating importance. The public had many other interests, and by a new spirit and type of journalism was being trained to make greater and more various demands upon the journalistic resources of its papers.

The administration organ presents but one aspect of a tendency in which political newspapers generally gained in editorial individuality, and both the papers and their editors acquired greater personal and editorial influence. The beginnings of the era of personal journalism were to be found early in the 19th century. Even before Nathan Hale had shown the way to editorial responsibility, [[Thomas Ritchie (journalist)|Thomas Ritchie]], in the ''Richmond Enquirer'' in the second decade of the century, had combined with an effective development of the established use of anonymous letters on current questions a system of editorial discussion that soon extended his reputation and the influence of his newspaper far beyond the boundaries of Virginia. Washington Barrow and the ''Nashville Banner'', [[Amos Kendall]] and ''The Argus of Western America'', [[George Wilkins Kendall|G. W. Kendall]] and the ''New Orleans Picayune'', John M. Francis and the ''Troy Times'', and Charles Hammond and the ''Cincinnati Gazette'', to mention but a few among many, illustrate the rise of editors to individual power and prominence in the third and later decades. Notable among these political editors was [[John Moncure Daniel]], who just before 1850 became editor of the ''Richmond Examiner'' and soon made it the leading newspaper of the South. Perhaps no better example need be sought of brilliant invective and literary pungency in American journalism just prior to and during the Civil War than in Daniel's contributions to the ''Examiner''.

Though it could still be said that "too many of our gazettes are in the hands of persons destitute at once of the urbanity of gentlemen, the information of scholars, and the principles of virtue", a fact due largely to the intensity of party spirit, the profession was by no means without editors who exhibited all these qualities, and put them into American journalism. [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]], for instance, who, encouraged by [[Alexander Hamilton]], founded the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' in 1801, was a man of high purposes, good training, and noble ideals. The ''Evening Post'', reflecting variously the fine qualities of the editor, exemplified the improvement in tone and illustrated the growing importance of editorial writing, as did a dozen or more papers in the early decades of the century. Indeed, the problem most seriously discussed at the earliest state meetings of editors and publishers, held in the thirties, was that of improving the tone of the press. They tried to attain by joint resolution a degree of editorial self-restraint, which few individual editors had as yet acquired. Under the influence of [[Thomas Ritchie (journalist)|Thomas Ritchie]], vigorous and unsparing political editor but always a gentleman, who presided at the first meeting of Virginia journalists, the newspaper men in one state after another resolved to "abandon the infamous practice of pampering the vilest of appetites by violating the sanctity of private life, and indulging in gross personalities and indecorous language", and to "conduct all controversies between themselves with decency, decorum, and moderation." Ritchie found in the low tone of the newspapers a reason why journalism in America did not occupy as high a place in public regard as it did in England and France.

===Editorials===
The editorial page was assuming something of its modern form. The editorial signed with a pseudonym gradually died, but unsigned editorial comment and leading articles did not become an established feature until after 1814, when Nathan Hale made them a characteristic of the newly established ''Boston Daily Advertiser''. From that time on they grew in importance until in the succeeding period of personal journalism they were the most vital part of the greater papers.

===Penny Press===
In the 1830s new high speed presses allowed the cheap printing of tens of thousands of papers a day. The problem was to sell them to a mass audience, which required new business techniques (such as rapid citywide delivery) and a new style of journalism that would attract new audiences. Politics, scandal, and sensationalism worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brazeal | first1 = Donald K. | year = 2005 | title = Precursor to Modern Media Hype: The 1830s Penny Press | url = | journal = Journal of American Culture | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 405–414 | doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.2005.00243.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James L. Crouthamel,  "James Gordon Bennett, the" New York Herald", and the Development of Newspaper Sensationalism." ''New York History'' (1973): 294-316. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23169403 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Gordon Bennett Sr.]] (1794–1872) took the lead in New York.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Crouthamel, ''Bennett's New York Herald and the rise of the popular press'' (1989) [https://books.google.com/books?id=o_JkAAAAMAAJ in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a decade of unsuccessful effort as a political journalist he had become familiar with the increasing enterprise in news-gathering. He despised the upscale journalism of the day—the seriousness of tone, the phlegmatic dignity, the party affiliations, the sense of responsibility. He believed journalists were fools to think that they could best serve their own purposes by serving the politicians. As Washington correspondent for the ''[[New York Enquirer]]'', he wrote vivacious, gossipy prattle, full of insignificant and entertaining detail, to which he added keen characterization and deft allusions. Bennett saw a public who would not buy a serious paper at any price, who had a vast and indiscriminate curiosity better satisfied with gossip than discussion, with sensation rather than fact, who could be reached through their appetites and passions. The idea that he did much to develop rested on the success of the one-cent press created by the establishment of the [[New York Sun (historical)|''New York Sun'']] in 1833. To pay at such a price these papers must have large circulations, sought among the public that had not been accustomed to buy papers, and gained by printing news of the street, shop, and factory. To reach this public Bennett began the ''[[New York Herald]]'', a small paper, fresh, sprightly, terse, and "newsy".  "In journalistic débuts of this kind", Bennett wrote, "many talk of principle—political principle, party principle—as a sort of steel trap to catch the public. We ... disdain ... all principle, as it is called, all party, all politics. Our only guide shall be good, sound, practical common sense, applicable to the business and bosoms of men engaged in every-day life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin H. Ford and Edwin Emery, eds.|title=Highlights in the History of the American Press: A Book of Readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rS2HabGJABsC&amp;pg=PA153|year=1954|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News was but a commodity, the furnishing of which was a business transaction only, which ignored the social responsibility of the press, "the grave importance of our vocation", prized of the elder journalists and of the still powerful six-cent papers. ''The Herald,'' like the ''Sun,'' was at once successful, and was remarkably influential in altering journalistic practices.  The penny press expanded its coverage into "personals"—short paid paragraphs by men and women looking for companionship. They revealed people's intimate relationships to a public audience and allowed city folk to connect with and understand their neighbors in an increasingly anonymous metropolis.  They included heavy doses of imagination and fiction, typically romantic, highly stylized. Sometimes the same person updated the paragraph regularly, making it like a serial short short story. Moralists were aghast, and warned of the ruin of young girls. (Commenting on censorship of books in the 1920s, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker said he had seen many girls ruined, but never by reading.) More worrisome to the elders they reflected a loss of community control over the city's youth, suggesting to Protestant leaders the need for agencies like the YMCA to provide wholesome companionship. Personals are still included in many papers and magazines into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = Pamela | year = 2012 | title = 'Villainous Little Paragraphs,' | url = | journal = Media History | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 21–32 | doi = 10.1080/13688804.2011.632197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialty media===
In a period of widespread unrest and change many specialized forms of journalism sprang up—religious, educational, agricultural, and commercial, which there is no space here to discuss. Workingmen were questioning the justice of existing economic systems and raising a new labour problem; the socialistic ideas of Cabet and Fourier were spreading; Unitarianism and Transcendentalism were creating and expressing new spiritual values; temperance, prohibition, and the political status of women were being discussed; abolition was a general irritant and a nightmare to politicians. The subject of controversy most critically related to journalism was abolition. The [[:Category:Abolitionist newspapers|abolitionist press]], which began with ''[[The Emancipator]]''&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt; of 1820, and had its chief representative in [[William Lloyd Garrison|William Lloyd Garrison's]] ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|Liberator]]'', first issued 1 January 1831, forced the slavery question upon the newspapers, and there ensued a struggle for the freedom of the press more acute than any since that caused by the Alien and Sedition laws. Many abolitionist papers were excluded from the mails; their circulation was forcibly prevented in the South; in Boston, New York, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Alton, and elsewhere, editors were assaulted, offices were attacked and destroyed; rewards were offered in the South for the capture of Greeley and Garrison; in a few instances editors, like Lovejoy at Alton, lost their lives at the hands of mobs.

===Rural papers===
Nearly every county seat, and most towns of more than 500 or 1000 population sponsored one or more weekly newspapers.  Politics was of major interest, with the editor-owner typically deeply involved in local party organizations.  However, the paper also contained local news, and presented literary columns and book excerpts that catered to an emerging middle class literate audience. A typical rural newspaper provided its readers with a substantial source of national and international news and political commentary, typically reprinted from metropolitan newspapers. Comparison of a subscriber list for 1849 with data from the 1850 census indicates a readership dominated by property owners but reflecting a cross-section of the population, with personal accounts suggesting the newspaper also reached a wider non-subscribing audience.  In addition, the major metropolitan daily newspapers often prepared weekly editions for circulation to the countryside.  Most famously the ''Weekly New York Tribune'' was jammed with political, economic and cultural news and features, and was a major resource for the Whig and Republican parties, as well as a window on the international world, and the New York and European cultural scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Marshall, "The Rural Newspaper and the Circulation of Information and Culture in New York and the Antebellum North," ''New York History'', Spring 2007, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp 133-151,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspapers of the Territories ===
The first newspaper to be published west of the Mississippi was the Missouri Gazette. Its starting issue was published on July 12, 1808 by Joseph Charless an Irish printer. Swayed by [[Meriwether Lewis|Meriweather Lewis]] to leave his home in Kentucky and start a new paper for the [[Missouri Territory]] Charles was identified by the paper's masthead as "Printer to the Territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/look-back-st-louis-gets-its-first-newspaper-in/article_3164aca0-8fd6-56bb-abee-51cce4a9ffc8.html|title=St. Louis gets its First Newspaper in 1808|last=O'Neil|first=Tim|date=April 5, 2104|website=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|publisher=St. Louis Today|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper published advertisements for domestic help, notice for runaway slaves, public notices, and sales for merchandise like land plots or cattle. Newspapers like the Gazette were instrumental in the founding new territories and supporting their stability as they become states.

With westward expansion other territories, like Nebraska, followed in Lewis and Missouri's plan for territory stability and founded a newspaper alongside the opening of the [[Nebraska Territory]] in 1854. The Nebraska Palladium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nebnewspapers.unl.edu/lccn/sn84020241/|title=About Nebraska palladium|last=Walter|first=Katherine|date=|website=Nebraska Newspaper|publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a rough newspaper that produced poetry and news from the East, ran advertisements, and created a space for emerging political editorials.  that developed a sense of community and cultural influence in the territory. Produced during a time when pioneers were far removed from neighbors these early territorial papers brought a sense of community to the territories. Because of the information gap felt by new settlers of the territories such as Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, and Oklahoma there was a mass startup numerous newspapers. It has been stated on the period that Wherever a town sprang up ... a printer with a rude press and a 'shirt-tail-full of type' was sure to appear".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Journalism: A History, 1690-1960|last=Mott|first=Frank Luther|publisher=Macmillan|year=1962|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition was intense between the large number of pop-up papers and often the newspapers would fail within a year or condense themselves with other publications.

===Associated Press and impact of telegraphy===
This idea of news and the newspaper for its own sake, the unprecedented aggressiveness in news-gathering, and the blatant methods by which the cheap papers were popularized aroused the antagonism of the older papers, but created a competition that could not be ignored. Systems of more rapid news-gathering (such as by "[[Pony express (newspapers)|pony express]]") and distribution quickly appeared. Sporadic attempts at co-operation in obtaining news had already been made; in 1848 the ''Journal of Commerce'', ''Courier and Enquirer'', ''Tribune'', ''Herald'', ''Sun'', and ''Express'' formed the New York Associated Press to obtain news for the members jointly. Out of this idea grew other local, then state, and finally national associations. European news, which, thanks to steamship service, could now be obtained when but half as old as before, became an important feature. In the forties several papers sent correspondents abroad, and in the next decade this field was highly developed.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Silberstein-Loeb, "Exclusivity and Cooperation in the Supply of News: The Example of the Associated Press, 1893–1945," ''Journal of Policy History'' (2012) 24#3 pp 466-498&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Rosewater, ''History of Cooperative News Gathering in the United States'' (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

The telegraph, invented in 1844, quickly linked all major cities and most minor ones to a national network that provided news in a matter of minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. It transformed the news gathering business. Telegraphic columns became a leading feature. The Associated Press (AP) became the dominant factor in the distribution of news. The inland papers, in such cities as Chicago, Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and New Orleans, used AP dispatches to become became independent of papers in Washington and New York.&lt;ref&gt;J. Steven Smethers, "Pounding Brass for the Associated Press: Delivering News by Telegraph in a Pre-Teletype Era." ''American Journalism'' 19#2 (2002): 13-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Schwarzlose, ''The Nation's Newsbrokers. Vol. 1: The Formative Years, from Pretelegraph to 1865'' (1989); ''Nation's Newsbrokers Volume 2: The Rush to Institution: From 1865 to 1920'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In general, only one newspaper in each city had the Associated Press franchise, and it dominated the market for national and international news. United Press was formed in the 1880s to challenge the monopoly. The growing number of chains each set up their own internal dissemination system.

===Great editors===
Out of the period of restless change in the 1830s there emerged a few great editors whose force and ability gave them and their newspapers an influence hitherto unequalled, and made the period between 1840 and 1860 that of personal journalism. These few men not only interpreted and reflected the spirit of the time, but were of great influence in shaping and directing public opinion. Consequently, the scope, character, and influence of newspapers was in the period immensely widened and enriched, and rendered relatively free from the worst subjection to political control.

[[File:1862 political cartoon ("Lincoln spins the news").JPG|thumb|350px|Lincoln spins the news—a [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] cartoon from 1862 (note the horns)]]

Naturally, the outstanding feature of this personal journalism was the editorial. Rescued from the slough of ponderousness into which it had fallen in its abject and uninspired party service, the editorial was revived, invigorated, and endowed with a vitality that made it the center about which all other features of the newspaper were grouped. It was individual; however large the staff of writers, the editorials were regarded as the utterance of the editor. "Greeley says" was the customary preface to quotations from the Tribune, and indeed many editorials were signed. [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.]], [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles]] (1826–78), [[Horace Greeley]] (1811–72), and [[Henry J. Raymond]] (1820–69) who were the outstanding figures of the period. Of Bennett's influence something has already been said; especially, he freed his paper from party control. His power was great, but it came from his genius in gathering and presenting news rather than from editorial discussion, for he had no great moral, social or political ideals, and his influence, always lawless and uncertain, can hardly be regarded as characteristic of the period. Of the others named, and many besides, it could be said with approximate truth that their ideal was "a full presentation and a liberal discussion of all questions of public concernment, from an entirely independent position, and a faithful and impartial exhibition of all movements of interest at home and abroad." As all three were not only upright and independent, but in various measure gifted with the quality of statesmanship at once philosophical and practical, their newspapers were powerful molders of opinion at a critical period in the history of the nation.

The news field was immeasurably broadened; news style was improved; interviews, newly introduced, lent the ease and freshness of dialogue and direct quotation. There was a notable improvement in the reporting of business, markets, and finance. In a few papers the literary department was conducted by staffs as able as any today. A foreign news service was developed that in intelligence, fidelity, and general excellence reached the highest standard yet attained in American journalism. A favorite feature was the series of letters from the editor or other member of the staff who traveled and wrote of what he heard or saw. Bowles, Olmsted, Greeley, Bayard Taylor, Bennett, and many others thus observed life and conditions at home or abroad; and they wrote so entertainingly and to such purpose that the letters—those of Olmsted and Taylor, for instance—are still sources of entertainment or information.

The growth of these papers meant the development of great staffs of workers that exceeded in numbers anything dreamed of in the preceding period. Although later journalism has far exceeded in this respect the time we are now considering, still the scope, complexity, and excellence of our modern metropolitan journalism in all its aspects were clearly begun between 1840 and 1860.

===Greeley's ''New York Tribune''===
The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' under [[Horace Greeley]] exhibited the best features of the new and semi-independent personal journalism based upon political party supporters and inspired with an enthusiasm for service that is one of the fine characteristics of the period. In editing the ''New Yorker'' Greeley had acquired experience in literary journalism and in political news; his ''Jeffersonian'' and ''Log Cabin,'' were popular Whig campaign papers, had brought him into contact with politicians and made his reputation as an insightful, vigorous journalist. He was a staunch party man, therefore he was chosen to manage a party organ when one was needed to support the Whig administration of Harrison. The prospectus of the ''New York Tribune'' appeared 3 April 1841. Greeley's ambition was to make the ''Tribune'' not only a good party paper, but also the first paper in America, and he succeeded by imparting to it a certain idealistic character with a practical appeal that no other journal possessed. His sound judgment appeared in the unusually able staff that he gathered about him. Almost from the first, the staff that made the Tribune represented a broad catholicity of interests and tastes, in the world of thought as well as in the world of action, and a solid excellence in ability and in organization, which were largely the result of the genius of Greeley and over which he was the master spirit. It included [[Henry J. Raymond]], who later became Greeley's rival on the ''Times'', George M. Snow, [[George William Curtis]], [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]], [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], William H. Fry, [[Margaret Fuller]], Edmund Quincy, and Charles T. Congdon. It is easy to understand how with such a group of writers the idea of the literary newspaper, which had been alive from the beginning of the century, should have advanced well-night to its greatest perfection.

The great popular strength of the ''Tribune'' doubtless lay in its disinterested sympathy with all the ideals and sentiments that stirred the popular mind in the forties and fifties. "We cannot afford", Greeley wrote, "to reject unexamined any idea which proposes to improve the moral, intellectual, or social condition of mankind." He pointed out that the proper course of an editor, in contrast to that of the time-server, was to have "an ear open to the plaints of the wronged and suffering, though they can never repay advocacy, and those who mainly support newspapers will be annoyed and often exposed by it; a heart as sensitive to oppression and degradation in the next street as if they were practiced in Brazil or Japan; a pen as ready to expose and reprove the crimes whereby wealth is amassed and luxury enjoyed in our own country as if they had only been committed by Turks or Pagans in Asia some centuries ago." In conformity with these principles Greeley lent his support to all proposals for ameliorating the condition of the labouring men by industrial education, by improved methods of farming, or even by such radical means as the socialistic Fourier Association. He strongly advocated the protective tariff because he believed that it was for the advantage of the workingman; and the same sympathy led him to give serious attention to the discussion of women's rights with special reference to the equal economic status of women. There were besides many lesser causes in which the Tribune displayed its spirit of liberalism, such as temperance reform, capital punishment, the Irish repeals, and the liberation of Hungary.

On the most important question of the time, the abolition of slavery, Greeley's views were intimately connected with party policy. His antipathy to slavery, based on moral and economic grounds, placed him from the first among the mildly radical reformers. But his views underwent gradual intensification. Acknowledged the most influential [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] party editor in 1844, he had by 1850 become the most influential anti-slavery editor—the spokesman not of Whigs merely but of a great class of Northerners who were thoroughly antagonistic to slavery but who had not been satisfied with either the non-political war of Garrison or the one-plank political efforts of the [[Free Soil]] party. This influence was greatly increased between 1850 and 1854 by some of the most vigorous and trenchant editorial writing America has ever known. The circulation of the Tribune in 1850 was, all told, a little less than sixty thousand, two-thirds of which was the Weekly. In 1854 the Weekly alone had a circulation of 112,000 copies. But even this figure is not the measure of the ''Tribune'''s peculiar influence, "for it was pre-eminently the journal of the rural districts, and one copy did service for many readers. To the people in the Adirondack wilderness it was a political bible, and the well-known scarcity of Democrats there was attributed to it. Yet it was as freely read by the intelligent people living on the Western Reserve of Ohio", ([[James Ford Rhodes]]) and in Wisconsin and Illinois. The work of Greeley and his associates in these years gave a new strength and a new scope and outlook to American journalism.

Greeley was a vigorous advocate of freedom of the press, especially in the 1830s and 1840s. He fought numerous libel lawsuits waged battles with the New York City postmaster,  and shrugged off threats of duels and physical violence to his body. Greeley used his hard-hitting editorials to alert the public to dangers to press freedom. He would not tolerate any threats to freedom and democracy which curtailed the ability of the press to serve as a watchdog against corruption and a positive agency of social reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = Daxton R. | year = 2012 | title = Freedom's Vanguard: Horace Greeley on Threats to Press Freedom in the Early Years of the Penny Press | url = | journal = American Journalism | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 60–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After replacing Greeley [[Whitelaw Reid]] became the powerful long-time editor of the ''Tribune.'' He emphasized the importance of partisan newspapers in 1879:
: The true statesman and the really influential editor are those who are able to control and guide parties. ... There is an old question as to whether a newspaper controls public opinion or public opinion controls the newspaper. This at least is true: that editor best succeeds who best interprets the prevailing and the better tendencies of public opinion, and, who, whatever his personal views concerning it, does not get himself too far out of relations to it. He will understand that a party is not an end, but a means; will use it if it lead to his end, -- will use some other if that serve better, but will never commit the folly of attempting to reach the end without the means. ... Of all the puerile follies that have masqueraded before High Heaven in the guise of Reform, the most childish has been the idea that the editor could vindicate his independence only by sitting on the fence and throwing stones with impartial vigor alike at friend and foe.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelaw Reid, ''American and English Studies, Vol. II'' (1913), pp. 258-60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry Raymond and the ''New York Times''===
[[Henry Jarvis Raymond]], who began his journalistic career on the ''Tribune'' and gained further experience in editing the respectable, old-fashioned, political ''Courier and Enquirer'', perceived that there was an opening for a type of newspaper that should stand midway between Greeley, the moralist and reformer, and Bennett, the cynical, non-moral news-monger. He was able to interest friends in raising the hundred thousand dollars that he thought essential to the success of his enterprise. This sum is significant of the development of American daily journalism, for Greeley had started the ''Tribune'' only ten years earlier with a capital of one thousand dollars, and Bennett had founded the ''Herald'' with nothing at all. On this sound financial basis, Raymond began the career of the ''[[New York Times]]'' with his business partner [[George Jones (publisher)|George Jones]] on September 18, 1851, and made it a success from the outset. He perfected his news-gathering forces and brought into play his intimate acquaintance with men of affairs to open up the sources of information. Above all he set a new standard for foreign service. The American public never had a more general and intelligent interest in European affairs than in the middle years of the 19th century. The leading papers directed their best efforts toward sustaining and improving their foreign service, and Raymond used a brief vacation in Europe to establish for his paper a system of correspondence as trustworthy, if not as inclusive, as that of the ''Herald'' or ''Tribune''. If our newspapers today are immeasurably in advance of those of sixty years ago in almost every field of journalism, there is only here and there anything to compare in worth with the foreign correspondence of that time. The men who wrote from the news centers of Europe were persons of wide political knowledge and experience, and social consequence. They had time and ability to do their work thoroughly, carefully, and intelligently, innocent of superficial effort toward sensation, of the practices of inaccurate brevity and irresponsible haste, which began with the laying of the Atlantic cable.
[[File:Nytrib1864.jpg|thumb|400px|The ''Tribune'' spoke for the Republican party in 1864]]

The theory of journalism announced by Raymond in the ''Times'' marks another advance over the party principles of his predecessors. He thought that a newspaper might assume the rôle now of a party paper, now of an organ of non-partisan, independent thought, and still be regarded by the great body of its readers as steadily guided by principles of sincere public policy. An active ambition for political preferment prevented him from achieving this ideal. Although he professed conservatism only in those cases where conservatism was essential to the public good and radicalism in everything that might require radical treatment and radical reform, the spirit of opposition to the ''Tribune'', as well as his temperamental leanings, carried him definitely to the conservative side. He was by nature inclined to accept the established order and make the best of it. Change, if it came, should come not through radical agitation and revolution, but by cautious and gradual evolution. The world needed brushing, not harrowing. Such ideas, as he applied them to journalism, appealed to moderate men, reflected the opinions of a large and influential class somewhere between the advanced thinkers and theorists and the mass of men more likely to be swayed by passions of approbation or protest than by reason.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Party1896.JPG|thumb|400px|The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' celebrates a Republican victory in 1896]] --&gt;

It was the tone of the ''Times'' that especially distinguished it from its contemporaries. In his first issue Raymond announced his purpose to write in temperate and measured language and to get into a passion as rarely as possible. "There are few things in this world which it is worth while to get angry about; and they are just the things anger will not improve." In controversy he meant to avoid abusive language. His style was gentle, candid, and decisive, and achieved its purpose by facility, clearness, and moderation rather than by powerful fervor and invective. His editorials were generally cautious, impersonal, and finished in form. With abundant self-respect and courtesy, he avoided, as one of his coadjutors said, vulgar abuse of individuals, unjust criticism, or narrow and personal ideas. He had that degree and kind of intelligence that enabled him to appreciate two principles of modern journalism—the application of social ethics to editorial conduct and the maintenance of a comprehensive spirit. As he used them, these were positive, not negative virtues.
[[File:Puck112188c.jpg|thumb|350px|Vile gossip and scandal spew from the press in the 1888 ''Puck'' cartoon]]

Raymond's contribution to journalism, then, was not the introduction of revolutionizing innovations in any department of the profession but a general improving and refining of its tone, a balancing of its parts, sensitizing it to discreet and cultivated popular taste. Taking ''[[The Times|The Times of London]]'' as his model, he tried to combine in his paper the English standard of trustworthiness, stability, inclusiveness, and exclusiveness, with the energy and news initiative of the best American journalism; to preserve in it an integrity of motive and a decorum of conduct such as he possessed as a gentleman.

===Postwar trends===
Newspapers continued to play a major political role. In rural areas, the weekly newspaper published in the county seat played a major role. In the larger cities, different factions of the party have their own papers.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wahlgren Summers, ''The press gang: newspapers and politics, 1865-1878'' (1994) [https://www.questia.com/library/6617289/the-press-gang-newspapers-and-politics-1865-1878 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Reconstruction era]] (1865-1877), leading editors increasingly turned against corruption represented by President Grant and his Republican Party. They strongly supported the third-party [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] movement of 1872, which nominated Horace Greeley for president.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew T. Downey, "Horace Greeley and the Politicians: The Liberal Republican Convention in 1872." ''Journal of American History'' (1967) 53#4 pp: 727-750 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1893989 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Democratic Party endorsed Greeley officially, but many Democrats could not accept the idea of voting for the man who had been their fiercest enemy for decades; he lost in a landslide. Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the Reconstruction South were edited by [[scalawags]] (Southern born white men) – only 20 percent were edited by [[carpetbaggers]] (recent arrivals from the North who formed the opposing faction in the Republican Party.  White businessmen generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Vaughn, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American journalism'' (2007) p 441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Abbott, ''For Free Press and Equal Rights: Republican Newspapers in the Reconstruction South'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers were a major growth industry in the late nineteenth century.  The number of daily papers grew from 971 to 2226, 1880 to 1900. Weekly newspapers were published in smaller towns, especially county seats, or for German, Swedish and other immigrant subscribers.  They grew from 9,000 to 14,000, and by 1900 the United States published more than half of the newspapers in the world, with two copies per capita.  Out on the frontier, the first need for a boom town was a newspaper.  The new states of North and South Dakota by 1900 had 25 daily papers, and 315 weeklies.  Oklahoma was still not a state, but it could boast of nine dailies and nearly a hundred weeklies. In the largest cities the newspapers competed fiercely, for newsboys sold each copy and they did not rely on subscriptions.  Financially, the major papers depended on advertising, which paid in proportion to the circulation base.  By the 1890s in New York City, especially during the Spanish–American War, circulations reached 1 million a day for Pulitzer's ''World'' and Hearst's ''Journal.''  While smaller papers relied on loyal Republican or Democratic readers who appreciated the intense partisanship of the editorials, the big-city papers realized they would lose half their potential audience by excessive partisanship, so they took a more ambiguous position, except at election time.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Meier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898 '' (1933) pp 185-87&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chicago-Daily-News-1901.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' was a major daily 1876-1978; like most afternoon papers it could not compete with TV news and closed down]]

After the Civil War, there were several transitions in the newspaper industry.  Many of the main founders of the modern press died, including Greeley, Raymond, Bennett, Bowles. and Bryant.  Their successors continued the basic policies and approaches, but were less innovative.  The civil war put a premium on news reporting, rather than editorials, and the news columns became increasingly important, with speed of the essence as multiple newspapers competed on the city streets for customers.  The major papers issued numerous editions the day each with blaring headlines to capture attention.  Reporting became more prestigious.  There was no newspaper that exerted the national influence of Greeley's ''New York Tribune.''  Western cities, developed influential newspapers of their own in Chicago, San Francisco and St. Louis; the Southern press went into eclipse as the region lost its political influence and talented young journalists headed North for their careers.  The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news.  Circulation growth was facilitated by new technology, such as the stereotype, by which 10 or more high-speed presses could print the same pages.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''The Emergence of Modern America: 1865-1878'' (1927) pp 240-41&lt;/ref&gt;

With the movement of thousands of people with the conclusion of the Civil War new territories and states experienced and influx of settlers. The growth of a state and territory could be measured by the growth of the areas newspapers. With settlers pushing westward communities were considered stable if they had a newspaper publishing. This was a form of communication for all of the settlers and pioneers that lived in the far, rural communities.  Larger, more established towns would begin to grow multiple newspapers. One of the papers would promote a Democratic view and the other Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nebnewspapers.unl.edu/nebraska_publishing/|title=Publishing History of Newspapers in Nebraska|last=Walter|first=Katherine|date=|website=Nebraska Newspapers|publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass markets, yellow journalism and muckrakers, 1890–1920==

===Muckrakers===
A muckraker is an American English term for a person who investigates and exposes issues of corruption. There were widely held values, such as political corruption, corporate crime, child labor, conditions in slums and prisons, unsanitary conditions in food processing plants (such as meat), fraudulent claims by manufacturers of patent medicines, labor racketeering, and similar topics. In British English however the term is applied to sensationalist scandal-mongering journalist, not driven by any social [original text missing; "journalist" above likely should be "journalism" or "a ... journalist."].

The term muckraker is most usually associated in America with a group of American investigative reporters, novelists and critics in the Progressive Era from the 1890s to the 1920s. It also applies to post 1960 journalists who follow in the tradition of those from that period. See History of American newspapers for Muckrakers in the daily press.

Muckrakers have most often sought, in the past, to serve the public interest by uncovering crime, corruption, waste, fraud and abuse in both the public and private sectors. In the early 1900s, muckrakers shed light on such issues by writing books and articles for popular magazines and newspapers such as ''Cosmopolitan'', ''The Independent'', ''Collier's Weekly'' and ''McClure's''. Some of the most famous of the early muckrakers are Ida Tarbell, Lincoln Steffens, and Ray Stannard Baker.

====History of term muckraker====
President Theodore Roosevelt coined the term 'muckraker' in a 1906 speech when he likened the muckrakers to the Man with the Muckrake, a character in John Bunyan's ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neuzil,  "Hearst, Roosevelt, and the Muckrake Speech of 1906: A New Perspective." ''Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly'' 73#1 (1996) pp: 29-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt disliked their relentless negativism. as he attacked them for stretching the truth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are, in the body politic, economic and social, many and grave evils, and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them. There should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man whether politician or business man, every evil practice, whether in politics, in business, or in social life. I hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform, or in book, magazine, or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack, provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Yellow Journalism====

Yellow journalism is a pejorative reference to journalism that features scandal-mongering, sensationalism, jingoism or other unethical or unprofessional practices by news media organizations or individual journalists.

The term originated during the circulation battles between [[Joseph Pulitzer|Joseph Pulitzer's]] ''New York World'' and [[William Randolph Hearst|William Randolph Hearst's]] ''New York Journal'' from 1895 to about 1898, and can refer specifically to this period. Both papers were accused by critics of sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well. The ''New York Press'' coined the term "Yellow Journalism" in early 1897 to describe the papers of Pulitzer and Hearst.&lt;ref&gt;W. Joseph Campbell, ''Yellow journalism: Puncturing the myths, defining the legacies'' (Greenwood, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Origins: Pulitzer v. Hearst=====
Joseph Pulitzer purchased the ''World'' in 1882 after making the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' the dominant daily in that city. The publisher had gotten his start editing a German-language publication in St. Louis, and saw a great untapped market in the nation's immigrant classes. Pulitzer strove to make ''The World'' an entertaining read, and filled his paper with pictures, games and contests that drew in readers, particularly those who used English as a second language. Crime stories filled many of the pages, with headlines like "Was He A Suicide?" and "Screaming for Mercy". Pulitzer provided a bargain: he only charged two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information (the only other two-cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary S. Messinger|title=The Battle for the Mind: War and Peace in the Era of Mass Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDsKkR7oTHIC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2011|publisher=U of Massachusetts Press|page=5|isbn=1558498532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were many sensational stories in the ''World'', they were by no means the only pieces, or even the dominant ones. Pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society, and he put the ''World'' in the service of social reform. During a heat wave in 1883, ''World'' reporters went into the Manhattan's tenements, writing stories about the appalling living conditions of immigrants and the toll the heat took on the children. Stories headlined "How Babies Are Baked" and "Lines of Little Hearses" spurred reform and drove up circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher H. Sterling|title=Encyclopedia of Journalism vol 4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLV1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1343|year=2009|publisher=SAGE|page=1343|isbn=9781452261522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just two years after Pulitzer took it over, the ''World'' became the highest circulation newspaper in New York, aided in part by its strong ties to the Democratic Party.  Older publishers, envious of Pulitzer's success, began criticizing the ''World'', harping on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting—trends that influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism, both then and now. Charles Dana, editor of the ''New York Sun'', attacked the ''World'' and said Pulitzer was "deficient in judgment and in staying power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Denis Brian|title=Pulitzer: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcWkl_k4uvIC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2002|publisher=Wiley|page=70|isbn=9780471217336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulitzer's approach made an impression on William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir who acquired the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' from his [[George Hearst|father]] in 1887. Hearst read the ''World'' while studying at Harvard University and resolved to make the ''Examiner'' as bright as Pulitzer's paper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Under his leadership, the ''Examiner'' devoted 24 percent of its space to crime, presenting the stories as morality plays, and sprinkled adultery and "nudity" (by 19th century standards) on the front page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Nasaw|title=The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ET4uTW2k-9QC&amp;pg=PA77|year=2001|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=77|isbn=0618154469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after taking over the paper, the ''Examiner'' ran this headline about a hotel fire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;HUNGRY, FRANTIC FLAMES. They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by the Bay of Monterey, Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From Pinnacle to Foundation. Leaping Higher, Higher, Higher, With Desperate Desire. Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice, Archway and Facade. Rushing in Upon the Trembling Guests with Savage Fury. Appalled and Panic-Striken the Breathless Fugitives Gaze Upon the Scene of Terror. The Magnificent Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes. The "Examiner" Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible Disaster. Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Morning's Train—A History of Hotel del Monte—The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated Hostelry—Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Procter|title=William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863-1910|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yIUlXrEeWQC&amp;pg=PA49|year=1998|publisher=Oxford UP|page=49|isbn=9780195354584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hearst could go overboard in his crime coverage; one of his early pieces, regarding a "band of murderers", attacked the police for forcing ''Examiner'' reporters to do their work for them. But while indulging in these stunts, the ''Examiner'' also increased its space for international news, and sent reporters out to uncover municipal corruption and inefficiency. In one celebrated story, ''Examiner'' reporter Winifred Black was admitted into a San Francisco hospital and discovered that indigent women were treated with "gross cruelty". The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the piece appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Marie Lutes|title=Front Page Girls: Women Journalists in American Culture and Fiction, 1880-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iWO4FlsquQC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2007|publisher=Cornell UP|page=33|isbn=0801474124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
With the ''Examiner'''s success established by the early 1890s, Hearst began shopping for a New York newspaper. Hearst purchased the ''New York Journal'' in 1895, a penny paper that Pulitzer's brother Albert had sold to a Cincinnati publisher the year before.

Metropolitan newspapers started going after department store advertising in the 1890s, and discovered the larger circulation base, the better. This drove Hearst; following Pulitzer's earlier strategy, he kept the ''Journal'''s price at one cent (compared to The ''World''s two cent price) while doubling the size to 16 pages. Crime news featured big bold headlines, and startling graphic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Frazier|title=William Randolph Hearst: Press Baron|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBtUyQV8zZEC|year=1989|publisher=Silver Burdett Press|page=42|isbn=9780382095856}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach worked, and as the ''Journal''s circulation jumped to 150,000, Pulitzer had to cut his price to a penny, hoping to drive his young competitor (who was subsidized by his family's fortune) into bankruptcy. In a counterattack, Hearst raided the staff of the ''World'' in 1896.  In the 1880s Pulitzer had annoyed his rivals when he raided their staffs; now it was his turn. Hearst picked off the best journalists, especially those who considered Pulitzer difficult man to work for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Miraldi|title=The Pen Is Mightier: The Muckraking Life of Charles Edward Russell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvfIBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|year=2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=88|isbn=9781466886469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the competition between the ''World'' and the ''Journal'' was fierce, the papers were temperamentally alike. Both were Democratic, both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants (a sharp contrast to publishers like the ''New York Tribune'''s Whitelaw Reid, who blamed their poverty on moral defects), and both invested enormous resources in their Sunday publications, which functioned like weekly magazines, going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Campbell, ''The Year That Defined American Journalism: 1897 and the Clash of Paradigms'' (Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages, and some theorize that the term yellow journalism originated there, while as noted above the New York Press left the term it invented undefined. [[The Yellow Kid]], a comic strip revolving around a bald child in a yellow nightshirt, became exceptionally popular when cartoonist Richard Outcault began drawing it in the ''World'' in early 1896. When Hearst predictably hired Outcault away, Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue the strip with his characters, giving the city two Yellow Kids.  The use of "yellow journalism" as a synonym for over-the-top sensationalism in the U.S. apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excesses of "the Yellow Kid papers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. David Sloan |author2=Lisa Mullikin Parcell |title=American Journalism: History, Principles, Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOItkXKZ-3EC&amp;pg=PA345|year=2002|publisher=McFarland|page=345|isbn=9780786413713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish–American War===
Pulitzer and Hearst are often credited (or blamed) for drawing the nation into the [[Spanish–American War]] with sensationalist stories or outright lying. In fact, the vast majority of Americans did not live in New York City, and the decision makers who did live there probably relied more on staid newspapers like the ''Times'', the ''Sun'' or the ''Post''. The most famous example of the exaggeration is the apocryphal story that artist Frederic Remington telegrammed Hearst to tell him all was quiet in Cuba and "There will be no war." Hearst responded "Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war." The story (a version of which appears in the Hearst-inspired Orson Welles' film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'') first appeared in the memoirs of reporter James Creelman in 1901, and there is no other source for it.

But Hearst was a war hawk after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895. Stories of Cuban virtue and Spanish brutality soon dominated his front page. While the accounts were of dubious accuracy, the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not need, or necessarily want, his stories to be pure nonfiction. Historian Michael Robertson has said that "Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting, opinion and literature."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Hearst's treatment was more effective and focused on the enemy who set the bomb—and offered a huge reward to readers. Pulitzer, though lacking Hearst's resources, kept the story on his front page. The yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurately, but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough. The island was in a terrible economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Having clamored for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran "How do you like the Journal's war?" on his front page.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In fact, President William McKinley never read the ''Journal'', and newspapers like the ''Tribune'' and the ''New York Evening Post'', both staunchly Republican, demanded restraint. Moreover, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City, and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead. The ''Journal'' and the ''World'' were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers, and the stories simply did not make a splash outside Gotham.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} War came because public opinion was sickened by the bloodshed, and because conservative leaders like McKinley realized that Spain had lost control of Cuba. These factors weighed more on the president's mind than the melodramas in the ''New York Journal''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Hearst sailed directly to Cuba, when the invasion began, as a war correspondent, providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for exposing the horrors of Spanish misrule, arguing, "no true history of the war ... can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish–American War was due to the enterprise and tenacity of yellow journalists, many of whom lie in unremembered graves."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===After the War===
Hearst placed his newspapers at the service of the Democrats during the 1900 presidential election. He later campaigned for his party's presidential nomination, but lost much of his personal prestige when columnist [[Ambrose Bierce]] and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that called for the assassination of McKinley. When McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, the Republican press went livid, accusing Hearst of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed. Hearst did not know of Bierce's column and claimed to have pulled Brisbane's after it ran in a first edition, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Pulitzer, haunted by his "yellow sins",{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} returned the ''World'' to its crusading roots as the new century dawned. By the time of his death in 1911, the ''World'' was a widely respected publication, and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931.

===In popular culture===
In many movies, sitcoms and other works of fiction, reporters often use yellow journalism against the main character, which typically works to set up the reporter character as an antagonist. This is done so often that it is sometimes considered to be a cliché.

For instance in the [[Spider-Man]] franchise, publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] spitefully and constantly smears the superhero in his ''Daily Bugle'' despite having his suspicions repeatedly proven wrong. Likewise, in the 1997 James Bond movie ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', the deranged media magnate and main [[antagonist]] Elliot Carver (played by [[Jonathan Pryce]]) tries to start a war between Great Britain and China via sensationalized news stories; in the movie, he even alludes to Hearst's role in the Spanish–American War, using the apocryphal quote "You provide the pictures and I'll provide the war" as an excuse to prove that his plot is not new. (This quotation is also in Orson Welles' classic film ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.) In [[Thomas Harris]]' novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', from the Hannibal Lecter series, a sleazy yellow journalist named Freddy Lounds, who writes for the ''National Tattler'' tabloid, is tortured and set aflame for penning a negative article about serial killer Francis Dolarhyde.

In the movie ''[[Bob Roberts]]'', Senator Roberts characterises media investigations into his business dealings (and particularly the links between his anti-drugs charity and CIA drug trafficking) as "yellow journalism".

==Ethnic press==
While the English language press served the general population, practically every ethnic group had its own newspapers in their own language. Many immigrant populations in the 19th century were drawn to the rich farmlands of the [[Great Plains]] states such as Minnesota, Nebraska, and Iowa. In small communities that drew large influxes of specific ethnic groups community newspapers became a place where political and religious interests could be promoted in familiar languages. Many of these papers also wanted to embody the spirit of American democracy within their readers. One paper committed to ensuring all [[Danish Americans|Danish-American]] citizens took part and exercised their rights was the Den Danske Pionerr or The Danish Pioneer in translation. This paper was backed by Sophus F. Neble a Danish immigrant who had failed at dairy farming and instead set to typing and enhancing the paper in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethnic Press in the United States: A Historical Analysis and Handbook|last=Marion Tuttle|first=Marzolf|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1987|isbn=|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=Sally M.|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=61–65|chapter=The Danish Press|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Neble that paper rose to a circulation of 40,000 during World War I.

German publishers were one of the most influential immigrant groups in developing the ethnic press. By 1890 there were 1,000 German-language newspapers published each year in the United States. Prior to World War I Germans were accepted as a reputable immigrant group with over five million immigrants moving to the country between 1820 and 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/divisions/preservation/featured-project/chronicling-americas-historic-german-newspapers-and-the-grow|title=Chronicling America's Historic German Newspapers and the Growth of the American Ethnic Press|last=Weinryb Grohsgal|first=Leah|date=July 1, 2104|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However once America entered the conflict national opinion changed and German culture was no longer welcome in the country. A large amount of anger was focused at German newspapers which some American's viewed as supporting Germany in the war effort. In October 1917 Congress passed legislation that sought to control foreign-language press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=215|title=Valentin Josef Peter|date=2016-01-01|newspaper=Immigrant Entrepreneurship|language=English|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws stated that newspapers must translate all printed material concerning the war.  The German papers nearly all folded in World War I, and after 1950 the other ethnic groups had largely dropped foreign language papers.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Olzak and Elizabeth West. "Ethnic conflict and the rise and fall of ethnic newspapers." ''American Sociological Review'' (1991): 458-474.

In 1915 the circulation of the daily [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly papers and the many magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Yiddish is a dialect of German written in the Hebrew alphabet and based entirely in the Jewish population. {{cite book|author=Robert Moses Shapiro|title=Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American &amp; International Journalism During the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3lItIwOzCkC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=KTAV|page=18|isbn=9780881257755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative was the situation in Chicago, where the [[Polish Americans]] sustained diverse political cultures, each with its own newspaper. In 1920 the community had a choice of five daily papers - from the Socialist ''Dziennik Ludowy'' [People's daily] (1907–25) to the [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America|Polish Roman Catholic Union's]] ''Dziennik Zjednoczenia'' [Union daily] (1921–39) - all of which supported workers' struggles for better working conditions and were part of a broader program of cultural and educational activities. The decision to subscribe to a particular paper reaffirmed a particular ideology or institutional network based on ethnicity and class, which lent itself to different alliances and different strategies.  Most papers preached assimilation into middle class American values and supported [[Americanization]] programs, but still included news of the home country.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bekken, "Negotiating Class and Ethnicity: the Polish-language Press in Chicago." ''Polish American Studies'' 2000 57(2): 5-29. {{ISSN|0032-2806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1965, there was a large surge of new immigration, especially from Asia. They set up few major papers. By the 21st century, over 10 percent of the population was Hispanic. They patronized Spanish-language radio and television, but outside large cities it was hard to find Spanish newspapers, books or magazines for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Hawson|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Intermediate Spanish, 2nd ed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQYpbPxTewMC&amp;pg=PT62|year=2007|publisher=DK Publishing|page=62|isbn=9781440650550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leara D.

==Chains and syndicates, 1900–1960==
[[File:HEARST2.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Ad for the Hearst chain, 1923]]
[[E. W. Scripps]] founder of the first national newspaper chain in the United States, sought in the early years of the 20th century to create syndicated services based on product differentiation while appealing to the needs of his readers. Success, Scripps believed, depended on providing what competing newspapers did not. To achieve this end while controlling costs and centralizing management, Scripps developed a national wire service ([[United Press]]', a news features service ([[Newspaper Enterprise Association]]), and other services. Scripps successfully reached a large market at low costs in new and different ways and captured the interests of a wider range of readers, especially women who were more interested in features than in political news. However, the local editors lost a degree of autonomy and local news coverage diminished significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J. Baldasty, "Centralizing Control in Newspaper Chains: E. W. Scripps and the Newspaper Enterprise Association, 1902–1908," ''American Journalism'', April 2001, Vol. 18 Issue 2, pp 13–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In part to aid in his political ambitions, Hearst opened newspapers in other cities, among them Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston. By the mid-1920s he had a nationwide string of 28 newspapers, among them the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'', the ''[[Boston American]]'', the ''[[Chicago Examiner]]'', the ''[[Detroit Times]]'', the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' and the ''[[Washington Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Herald]]'' and his flagship the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. In 1924 he opened the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'', a racy [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] frankly imitating the ''[[New York Daily News]]''. Among his other holdings were the magazines ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''; two news services, [[Universal News]]  and [[International News Service]]; [[King Features Syndicate]]; and a film company, [[Cosmopolitan Productions]], as well as real estate. Hearst used his influence to help [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] win the 1932 Democratic nomination. However he broke with Roosevelt in 1935 because Roosevelt did not want to fund the veterans' bonus. After that the Hearst chain became the bitter enemy of the New Deal from the right. The other major chains likewise were hostile, and in 1936 Roosevelt had the support of only 10% of the nation's newspapers (by circulation).

==Competition: television and Internet, 1970–present==
{{main|Decline of newspapers#United States}}
A 2015 report from the [[Brookings Institution]] shows that the number of newspapers per hundred million population fell from 1,200 (in 1945) to 400 in 2014.  Over that same period, circulation per capita declined from 35 percent in the mid-1940s to under 15 percent.  The number of newspaper journalists has decreased from 43,000 in 1978 to 33,000 in 2015.  Other traditional news media have also suffered. Since 1980 the television networks have lost half their audience for evening newscasts; the audience for radio news has shrunk by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine C. Kamarck and Ashley Gabriele, "The news today: 7 trends in old and new media" [http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2015/11/09-kamarck-gabriele-listicle-media/new-media.pdf  ''Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings,'' November 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid decline in circulation===
The circulation of the nation's daily newspapers plunged since 2006, in one of the sharpest declines in recent history. The slide continues a decades-long trend and adds to the woes of a mature industry already struggling with layoffs and facing the potential sale of some of its flagships. In addition newsstand sales of magazines fell more than 4 percent, to about 48.7 million copies. Among domestic newsweeklies, ''Time'' magazine reported the biggest drop. Analysts pointed to the increased use of the Internet, noting that more people in 2006 read the ''New York Times'' online than on paper. Newspaper readership goes up with education, and education levels are rising. That favorable trend is offset by the choice of people in each age group to read fewer papers.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Q. Seelye, "Newspaper Circulation Falls Sharply", ''New York Times'' October 31, 2006. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/31/business/media/31paper.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin online] and Journalism.org ''The State of the News Media 2004'' (2005) online at [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in readership and revenues continued into 2014. American dailies lost 60% of their ad revenue--$30 billion—between 2005 and 2014. The typical response is a drastic cut in the employment of journalists. Their numbers also fell 60% from about 50,000 in 2005 to 20,000 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;"Up against the paywall" [https://www.economist.com/news/business/21678799-many-publishers-still-see-little-alternative-continual-cutbacks-up-against-paywall ''The Economist'' (21 Nov 2015) p 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate turmoil===
After 1950 newspaper readership grew slower than the population. After 1990 the number of readers started to decline. The number of papers also declined, especially as afternoon papers collapsed in the face of television news. However sales of advertising remained strong and profits were still high. In 2002, newspapers reported advertising revenues of $44 billion. According to Morton Research, a market analysis firm, in 2003, the 13 major publicly traded newspaper companies earned an average pretax profit margin of 19 percent.&lt;ref&gt;see [journalism.org (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 to 2003 showed an industry in transition. Although 305 newspapers ceased daily publication during this period, 64% of these newspapers continued to serve their markets as weeklies, merged dailies, or zoned editions. The 111 dailies that went out of business were offset by 63 dailies that started publication. In effect, the newspaper industry lost service in 48 markets during 17 years.  After 2003 the process speeded up, as revenue from advertising fell and circulation declined, as more people relied on the internet for news.&lt;ref&gt;Hiromi Cho et al., "An Industry in Transition: Entry and Exit in Daily Newspaper Markets, 1987-2003," ''Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly'', Summer 2006, Vol. 83 Issue 2, pp. 381–396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish and Asian language newspapers===
The first Spanish-language newspapers in the United States were ''El Misisipí'' and ''El Mensagero Luisianés'', which began publication in [[New Orleans]] in 1808 and 1809. ''La Gaceta de Texas'' and ''El Mexicano'', the first newspapers in what is now considered the Southwest, were written and typeset in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]] but printed in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]] in 1813. They supported the Mexican independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanellos|first=Nicolas|title=Hispanic Periodicals in the United States, Origins to 1960: A Brief History|year=2000|publisher=Arte Publico Press|location=Houston|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latino Print Network estimated the combined circulation of all Hispanic newspapers in the United States at 16.2 million in 2003. Mainstream (English) daily newspapers owned 46 Hispanic publications—nearly all of them weeklies—that have a combined circulation of 2.9 million. From 1990 to 2000, the number of Hispanic newspapers alone nearly doubled from 355 to 652

In 1976 the ''Miami Herald'' started ''El Herald'', a one-page Spanish insert that was reborn in 1987 as ''El Nuevo Herald'', a daily supplement to the ''Miami Herald''. ''El Nuevo Herald'' became independent of the ''Herald'' in 1998 and by 2003 had an average daily circulation of 90,300.
In 1981, the Gannett chain entered daily Spanish publishing when it bought ''[[El Diario/La Prensa]]'', a 52,000-circulation New York City tabloid that is the nation's oldest Spanish daily.

The Tribune Co., Belo Corp. and [[Knight Ridder]] launched daily Spanish-language papers in 2003. Hispanic-oriented newspapers and magazines generated $1.3 billion in revenue in 2002. By comparison, the operating revenue that year for Knight Ridder's 32 papers was $2.8 billion. Readership remains small, however. New York City already had two Spanish-language dailies with a combined circulation of about 100,000, as well as papers from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and a score of weeklies. But Louis Sito said their "circulation levels were very, very minimal when compared to the population size." (New York, population 8 million, is 27 percent Hispanic; the Bronx, 1.3 million, is 48 percent Hispanic.) Sito urged ''Newsday'' publisher Raymond A. Jansen to launch a daily instead of a weekly, and ''Hoy'' premiered on November 16, 1998, with a circulation of 25,000. By 2003, ''Hoy'' sold 91,000 copies a day in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York metro]] area. The Dallas-Fort Worth market contains 1.3 million Latinos—22 percent of the population and growing (estimated to reach 38 percent by 2006). The ''Dallas Morning News'' developed ''Al Día'' to entice that audience. The Monday-through-Saturday paper debuted in September 2003 with a staff of 50, an initial circulation of 40,000 and a newsstand price of 25 cents. ''Diario La Estrella'' began in 1994 as a dual-language insert of the ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' and first grew into an all-Spanish stand-alone paper with a twice-weekly total circulation of 75,000 copies distributed free via newsstands and selective home delivery.

With the notable exception of ''[[Viet Mercury]]'', a now-defunct, 35,000-circulation weekly Vietnamese-language paper published by Knight Ridder's ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', U.S. media companies have generally eschewed the Asian market even though daily papers in Chinese, Korean or Vietnamese are thriving in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and other cities. The Mandarin-language ''World Journal'', which distributes from San Francisco to Toronto and states a circulation (unaudited) of 350,000. ''World Journal''; its biggest competitor, ''Sing Tao'' (181,000 circulation unaudited); and ''Korea Times'' (254,000, also unaudited) are owned by international media giants based in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Seoul, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Porter, "Dismantling the Language Barrier" ''American Journalism Review'' October/November 2003 [http://spanish.about.com/b/a/031319.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''Connecting Cleveland'', a four-page paper with stories in English and [[Nepali language|Nepali]] was launched to serve Nepali-speaking [[Bhutanese refugees|Bhutanese]] families in the [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Robert L |title=Nepali teen launches newspaper to guide his community in the Cleveland tradition |work=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=2014-07-24 |date=2014-07-24|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2014/07/in_the_cleveland_tradition_nep.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucky Blondo''' (born '''Gerard Blondiot''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letelegramme.fr/ig/generales/regions/bretagne/lucky-blondo-j-etais-terrorise-sur-scene-11-11-2012-1902484.php |title=Lucky Blondo: «J'étais terrorisé sur scène»|date=11 November 2012|publisher=Le Télégramme|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23 July 1944 in [[Paris]], [[France]]) is a French singer who was popular in the 1960s.

His heyday came during the emergence of [[French rock]].

==Career==
His main successes were "Sheila", "Baby Face", "Dix petits indiens", "Sur ton visage une larme" (a French version of the song "Una lacrima sul viso" by [[Bobby Solo]]), and "Des roses rouges pour un ange blond".

He is one of the few French singers to have performed, in 1977, 33 tours in [[Nashville]] with [[The Jordanaires]], the vocal group that sang with [[Elvis Presley]].

In 1978, still in Nashville, he recorded an album of [[Cover version|covers]] entitled ''Ce vieux cow boy'', including, in particular, "Une santé dacier" and "On ne t'oubliera jamais". 

He then worked in advertising, before returning to singing in 2006 for a retro show.

He lives in [[Audierne]], a seaside city in southern [[Finistère]], where he lived in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostalgie.fr/artistes/lucky-blondo|title=Lucky Blondo|work=Nostalgie.fr|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon Carvalho''' (18 January 1825 – 29 December 1897) was a French [[impresario]] and [[stage director]].

==Biography==
Born '''Léon Carvaille''' in [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]], he came to France at an early age. He studied at the Paris Conservatory and sang as a [[baritone]] at the [[Opéra-Comique]] (1850–55), where he met the soprano [[Marie Caroline Miolan-Carvalho|Marie Caroline Miolan]], whom he married in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner S. Léon Carvalho. In Sadie, S: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' London &amp; New York, Macmillan, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then gave up singing and took on the direction of the [[Théâtre Lyrique]] in 1856, where he presented works by [[Beethoven]], [[Mozart]], [[Rossini]], [[Weber]], but most importantly opened his doors to new French composers turned down by the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, such as [[Berlioz]], [[Gounod]], [[Bizet]], [[Saint-Saëns]] and [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]]. He also staged the premiere of the revised version in a French translation of [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]] in 1865.

In early 1868 Carvalho started another operatic venture at the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]]. However he was declared bankrupt on 6 May 1868, forcing him out from both theatres.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;[[Walsh TJ]]. ''Second Empire Opera – The Théâtre-Lyrique Paris 1851-1870.'' John Calder Ltd, London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carvalho then moved to manage the [[Théâtre du Vaudeville]]. Although the principal focus was straight plays, he revived the melodrama – a play with incidental music. He commissioned Bizet to write music for a production of [[Alphonse Daudet|Daudet’s]] ''[[L'Arlésienne (play)|L'Arlésienne]]'' on 1 October 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Dean W. ''Bizet.'' London, J M Dent &amp; Sons, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became director of the Opéra-Comique in 1876, and although he promoted many new works, his choice of repertory became somewhat conservative, emphasising the traditional French repertoire. However, he also produced the premieres of ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann|Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]'', ''[[Lakmé]]'', ''[[Manon]]'' and ''[[Le roi malgré lui]]'', and in his second tenure from 1891 ''Le Reve'' and ''[[L'attaque du moulin]]''.&lt;ref name="Huebner"&gt;Huebner S. ''French Opera at the Fin de Siecle.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Carvalho also brought ''[[Carmen]]'' back to the Opera-Comique in 1883, firstly in an expurgated version, and then with the creator of the title-role, [[Galli-Marié]], and some of the more earthy elements restored.

In 1884 he prepared to bring ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' to the Parisian stage, visiting Vienna to study a production there, but was eventually forced by a virulent press campaign to abandon his plan in early 1886.&lt;ref name="Huebner"/&gt;

After the burning of the [[Opéra-Comique|Salle Favart]] in 1887, which caused the death of 84 persons, he was held responsible,&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; condemned for negligence and imprisoned. However, after an appeal he was acquitted, and reinstated as director of the theatre in 1891, where he continued promoting new talent.

His extravagant nature, both personal and in his work as an impresario, led to debt and a succession of bankruptcies.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

'''''Magicians''''' is a 2007 [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy]] film released on 18 May 2007.&lt;ref name=c4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/advertorial/magicians/|title=Magicians|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=2007-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars comic duo [[Robert Webb]] and [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]] as [[stage magic]]ians Karl and Harry. The two magicians compete together in a magic competition, despite their personal differences. Parts and ideas of the film have been taken to parody the 2006 film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' by [[Christopher Nolan]], though this had not been released when ''Magicians'' was filmed (though the original novel by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]] had been published in 1995). The film is directed by [[Andrew O'Connor (actor)|Andrew O'Connor]] and written by [[Jesse Armstrong]] and [[Sam Bain]], who are also the writers of the [[Channel 4]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', which stars Mitchell and Webb. Other principal cast members include [[Jessica Hynes]], [[Darren Boyd]], [[Steve Edge]], [[Peter Capaldi]],&lt;ref name=c4/&gt; and [[Andrea Riseborough]].&lt;ref name=Riseborough&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a43909/mitchell--webb.html?page=1|title=Mitchell &amp; Webb (page 1)|date=2007-04-11|accessdate=2007-04-14|author=Oatts, Joanne|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Harry Kane and Karl Allen are best friends who work together in a successful and popular magic [[double act]], with Harry's wife Carol working as their assistant. After one show, however, Harry discovers Karl and Carol backstage in a magic box having sex (during an agreement between Harry and the theatre owner about letting the act go on for 4 more weeks and letting them do an act on a cruise ship). During the next show, Carol is locked into a [[guillotine]] as part of a climatic trick, only for the blade to decapitate her; it is not immediately clear whether Harry, despite his protestations of innocence, has murdered her or whether she was the victim of a freak accident. Four years later, the act has broken up and the two friends – now bitter rivals – have gone their separate ways; Harry, having given up professional magic, is working in a [[Wilkinson (shop)|Wilkinson]] hardware store, only to be fired after a customer complains when he creates an illusion of him cutting his arm severely with a knife blade during a sales pitch, whilst Karl is attempting to reinvent himself as a [[Derren Brown]]-esque magician called the Mindmonger, with limited success. During an unsuccessful impromptu-pitch at a television corporation, the only person he manages to impress is Dani, the tea girl, who Karl immediately gets a crush on much to the jealousy of his incompetent agent Otto, who nurses an unsubtle homosexual crush on him.

After numerous failed attempts at raising money, Harry sees a poster for the "Magic shield" competition held in [[Jersey]], with a prize of £20,000, and decides to enter. Trying to find a new assistant, Harry is forced to recruit the only applicant, Linda, an old work friend whose only entertainment skill is a poor dancing routine. Harry swallows his pride and contacts Karl, who agrees to enter the competition with him; although their reputation in the magic community is still strong enough to get them into the tournament without an audition, the tensions between them ultimately prove too strong and they decide to go solo from that point on. As Harry and Linda rehearse their magic act, they begin to grow closer, but whilst Linda is open about her interest in Harry, he is too uptight and insecure to fully express his reciprocation. Much to his discomfort, Linda discovers the guillotine amongst his magic props and convinces him to use it as the centrepiece of the finale. Karl, meanwhile, is delighted to learn that Dani has come down from London to see him perform, but is slightly alarmed to discover that she believes him to be a genuine psychic. He nevertheless goes along with her belief, particularly as the interest in the competition has seen him approached by a television producer who wants to make him the centrepiece of a psychic show. Karl agrees to make his act for the finale a [[Mediumship|medium]] display, but begins to suffer a crisis of conscience. Karl tries a trick where he is buried in sand for a day.

Upon learning that Harry has not told Linda of what happened to his wife, Karl informs her. Harry panics when he discovers that her hotel room is vacant, believing she has returned to London. He conquers his fear of flying to immediately fly back to London, only to discover as soon as he gets there that she has merely switched rooms and forgotten to inform him. Managing to return to Jersey in time to compete by telling Linda to make one of the judges delay the act, both Harry and Karl make it through to the final; Linda claims that she is okay with hearing about what happened to Carol, but tensions between both begin to grow as she struggles to trust him. The night of the finale, Harry is heartbroken to learn that Linda has apparently slept with another magician, the sleazy and unethical Tony White; although Linda confirms it, she is lying in an attempt to force Harry to open up about his feelings, which he is still unable to do. Karl, meanwhile, finally prepares to consummate his relationship with Dani, but admits that he is not a true psychic after she thinks he is contacting her dead father, and betrayed, she shuns him.

That night, Karl and Harry have a confrontation backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds it easier to believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience that he is not able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at the moment of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to be ruined when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.

== Production ==
The duo had not expected to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that "it probably came much earlier than we thought we would do a film.  It landed very fortuitously on our doormat."&lt;ref name=ne&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/1394221.double_exposure/|title=Double exposure|accessdate=2007-05-13|date=2007-05-12|publisher=[[The Northern Echo]]|author=Pratt, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind "it became clear they could do these parts really well.  And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them".&lt;ref name=scot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=734022007|title=A peep inside the magic|accessdate=2007-05-14|author=Richardson, Jay|date=2007-05-12|publisher=Scotsman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, [[Olivia Colman]] does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us.  I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [Mitchell and Webb] and Olivia in ''Peep Show'', to have taken that same relationship, it would have been a really weird thing for the audience.  I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/infocus/entertainment/entertainment/mitchell-and-webbs-latest-magic-trick-$1086600.htm|title=Mitchell and Webb's latest magic trick|accessdate=2007-05-19|date=2007-05-18|author=Champion, Matthew|publisher=This is news.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he "really got into" his role as Harry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.aol.co.uk/bigstoryents/davids-magic-practice/article/20070517055809990001|title=David's magic practice|publisher=AOL Entertainment|accessdate=2007-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell and Webb were taught basic magical skills for the film, with them each receiving "welcome pack of DVDs telling the history of magic".&lt;ref name=ne/&gt; Andrew O'Connor was a member of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] but was thrown out for revealing secrets, so he and [[Scott Penrose]] taught Mitchell and Webb magical skills.&lt;ref name=ne/&gt; Webb spent two weeks "trying to roll a coin across [his] fingers and [he] still couldn't do it", with Mitchell admitting that "magic proved far more problematic than we anticipated".&lt;ref name=mos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/home/moslive/article-452796/Peepshows-Mitchell-Webb-let-secrets.html |title=Peepshow's Mitchell and Webb let us in on a few secrets|accessdate=2007-05-13|date=2007-05-05|publisher=[[The Mail on Sunday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb stated that the worst part that he had to film "was being buried up to the neck in sand. It's not the most comfortable place to be. I'd be buried for 30 minutes at a time, which doesn't sound that long, but it was the middle of summer and there were a lot of wasps around."&lt;ref name=mos/&gt; Mitchell had to kiss Jessica Hynes in the film, but admitted that he would have preferred to have kissed Robert Webb as he had done in ''Peep Show'', which he claimed to have been easier, as for that scene he had to "look absolutely rigid at the time".&lt;ref name=mos/&gt; On the subject of the scene with Hynes, he stated that "the scene went surprisingly well considering we had to do it in front of 700 extras, but if I'd had a single moment more to think about it I'd have been mortified with embarrassment."&lt;ref name=mos/&gt; Whilst filming in [[Nottingham]], unit signs being used in the film were repeatedly being stolen by teenagers as they had the word "magic" on them. Multiple signs had to be ordered, at £3 each.&lt;ref name=empiremag&gt;[[Empire Magazine]], Issue 216&lt;/ref&gt; The magic shield competition takes place in [[Jersey]], but the filming for these was done in [[Skegness]].&lt;ref name=empiremag/&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews. ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' reviewer Olly Richards gave ''Magicians'' three stars, concluding that "The bumbling charms of the stars just about pull this through, but there'll be few calls for an encore come the final curtain."&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134881|title=Magicians|accessdate=2007-05-19|author=Richards, Olly|publisher=Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derek Malcolm said that Mitchell and Webb "don't exactly cover themselves with glory in their first feature film. But they just about reach par."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4172">'''MilkandCookies''' was an archive of [[internet meme]]s from [[sarcastic]], [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[geek]]s about [[humor]], [[video clip]]s, independent media, [[music]], [[technology]], [[toilet humor]], [[television]], [[politics]], risque behavior, [[blooper]]s, [[celebrities]], [[cult]]s and [[religion]]s.

==System==

''MilkandCookies'' is designed to allow the users to interact to not only help build up the site's massive database of links, but also to weed out the good, entertaining links, from the bad, boring or horrible links. It also allows the  users to report malicious and/or [http://www.milkandcookies.com/faq/2/ unsuitable content]. The best links of the day are added to the front page in the form of [[headlines]].

Only members can submit links, but anyone can anonymously vote and view links. Members collect points by, among other things, submitting highly voted links. Experience points grant members increased access to the website's features and allow submission of more links per day.

==History==

''MilkandCookies'' came about when Jaxon Brooks' personal website merged with Hellroy's Junkmail mailing list. Jaxon's site started around 1995 as a static personal bookmarks page saved out of [[Netscape]] Navigator and posted to his personal account. It followed him as he jumped from ISP to ISP. Along the way it became a dynamic site with the ability to post links directly through the sites administrative interface. It also became searchable and browsable with categories.

Shortly after that Hellroy's Junkmail mailing list started. It was created to make it easier to email links to people who actually wanted to receive them. As part of a regular exercise, he would email highly offensive content to the list to weed out the sensitive.

In 1998, Jaxon and Hellroy decided that they hated their jobs and brain-stormed an online venture called MilkandCookies.com. The domain was registered Thursday, May 14, 1998. But they soon realized that they would not be able to play ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and ''[[Quake II]]'', and surf the web all day, if they worked for themselves. The idea was scrapped.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The MilkandCookies.com domain name came out of just a few brainstorming sessions between Jaxon and Hellroy. Even by 1998, most of the single word and other short names were taken, so the focus turned toward names that were easy to remember. They also wanted a name that had to do with pop culture and, although they loved to offend, they wanted a name that would be inviting.

Junkmail and Jaxon's personal page merged in early 1999 with the MilkandCookies name. In December of that year, Jaxon junked the code that he had been hacking together for the last 4 years and went with a packaged [[Content Management System]] (CMS). All links were transferred over by hand.

In November 2006, Jaxon hired Skiplogic to help rewite the MilkandCookies backend from scratch. This effort came to fruition on June 10, 2007, when the old code was abandoned and the new code went live. The rollout included many improvements and several new features.

This site was covered more than once on [[TechTV]]. [[Cat Schwartz]] called it the "Funniest Site on the Net".{{ref|schwartz-review}}

It was routinely ranked as a top site on the web by sites like [[Technorati]]{{ref|rank-technorati}}, and [[Alexa Internet]]{{ref|rank-alexa}}.

Portland's mascot in Japan with an awesome song |website=KGW.com |date=2016-09-21 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The bearded, blue character was introduced in a video hosted on the website Odnarotoop.com, which was created by Travel Portland in 2016 as part of a campaign called the "World of Odnarotoop". The campaign's name comes from the Japanese pronunciation of Portland, spelled backwards.&lt;ref name=Acker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/trending/2016/09/in_japan_portland_has_a_mascot.html|title=In Japan, Portland has a mascot named Mr. Dude and he has an awesome theme song|work=[[The Oregonian]]|date=September 27, 2016|accessdate=September 28, 2016|first= Lizzy|last=Acker|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|issn=8750-1317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KOIN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koin.com/2016/09/27/travel-portland-uses-mr-dude-to-increase-tourism/|title=Travel Portland uses Mr. Dude to increase tourism|publisher=[[KOIN]]|date=September 27, 2016|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video's theme song is performed by the Portland-based rock band [[Ages and Ages]] in Japanese, with some English words and phrases such as "breakfast", "crazy donuts", and "ice cream". Mr. Dude is featured on the website, saying, "Are you the one who want to go to Odnarotoop? I am your guide/camera man. Nice to meet you. Let's take a picture to start the trip."&lt;ref name=Acker/&gt; He also instructs users to upload their pictures, which are integrated into the music video.&lt;ref name=Acker/&gt;

The mascot was inspired by "the joy and lightheartedness that the city embodies" and Sasquatch (or [[Bigfoot]]).&lt;ref name=KOIN/&gt; Some [[Reddit]] users speculated that Mr. Dude was derived from a Portland man who is often seen wearing blue makeup, though a Travel Portland representative has denied that the mascot was based on any particular individual. He clarified, "[Mr. Dude] is a characterization of the city, but any resemblance to a real person is purely coincidence. The character is not based on 'a man who walks around Portland in blue makeup' and that person is not associated with Travel Portland."&lt;ref name=Acker/&gt;

A live version of Mr. Dude has appeared before the Japanese Association of Travel Agents and at a tourism conference in Tokyo.&lt;ref name=Acker/&gt;&lt;ref name=KOIN/&gt;

==Impact==
In September 2016, Travel Portland credited Mr. Dude and the "World of Odnarotoop" campaign with helping to increase Japanese visitation to Portland by as much as eleven percent in the preceding eighteen months.&lt;ref name=KOIN/&gt;

A '''Non-Equity''' theater company or [[Stagecraft|theater production]] is produced and performed by personnel who are not members of the [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors Equity Association]] Union. Non-Equity theaters tend to be small "storefront" theaters that may mount productions infrequently or rely heavily on non-professional actors and production staff.

'''Physical comedy''' is a form of [[comedy]] focused on manipulation of the body for a humorous effect. It can include [[slapstick]], [[Clown|clowning]], [[Mime artist|mime]], physical stunts, or making funny faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get Funny! Tips on Directing Physical Comedy|url = http://www.videomaker.com/article/c18/15703-get-funny-tips-on-directing-physical-comedy|website = Videomaker.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical comedy originated as part of the [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Physical Comedy - Roundabout Theatre Company Official Blog|url = http://blog.roundabouttheatre.org/2014/07/16/history-of-physical-comedy/|website = blog.roundabouttheatre.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now sometimes incorporated into sitcoms; for example, in the sitcom [[Three's Company]], actor [[John Ritter]] frequently performed '''pratfalls''' (landing on the [[buttocks]]). Cartoons also commonly depict physical comedy, such as in [[Tom and Jerry]] and [[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Physical Comedy? (with pictures)|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-physical-comedy.htm|website = wiseGEEK|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slapstick elements include the trip, the slip, the [[Double-take (comedy)|double take]], the collide, the fall (or faint), and the roar.{{clarify|date=September 2016}}

==Examples==
[[Charlie Chaplin]] started his film career as a physical comedian; although he developed additional means of comic expression, Chaplin's mature works continued to contain elements of slapstick.

Other comedians to employ physical comedy as a medium for their characters include [[Buster Keaton]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Benny Hill]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Harpo Marx]], [[Martin Short]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Don Knotts]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Danny Kaye]], and [[Johnny Lever]].

In sitcoms, the use of physical comedy was seen in, for example, [[Dick van Dyke]]'s character Rob Petrie on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', [[Larry Hagman]]'s character Major Anthony Nelson on ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', [[John Ritter]]'s character [[Jack Tripper]] on ''[[Three's Company]]'', the two main characters of [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Bronson Pinchot]] on ''[[Perfect Strangers (TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'', [[Michael Richards]]'s character [[Cosmo Kramer]] on ''[[Seinfeld]]'', [[Penny Marshall]]'s character [[Laverne DeFazio]] and [[Cindy Williams]]' character [[Shirley Feeney]] on ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'', [[Jennifer Saunders]]' character [[Edina Monsoon]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]'s character [[Patsy Stone]] on ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', [[Neil Morrissey]]'s character Tony in ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]'', [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s character [[Mr. Bean]], and [[Jaleel White]]'s character [[Steve Urkel]] on ''[[Family Matters]]''.

In the movies, physical comedy is used by, for example, [[Jacques Tati]] as [[Monsieur Hulot]] and [[Peter Sellers]] as [[Chief Inspector Clouseau]] in [[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]] film series.

'''''Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge''''' is a 1991 [[direct-to-video]] [[horror film]] written by [[Charles Band]], [[C. Courtney Joyner]] and David Schmoeller, and directed by [[David DeCoteau]]. It is the third film in the [[Puppet Master (franchise)|''Puppet Master'' franchise]], a [[prequel]] to 1989's ''[[Puppet Master (film)|Puppet Master]]'' and 1991's ''[[Puppet Master II]]'', and stars [[Guy Rolfe]] as a [[puppeteer]] whose ability to animate lifeless material attracts the attention of the [[Nazis]], whose members are played by [[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]], [[Ian Abercrombie]], and [[Walter Gotell]].

''Toulon's Revenge'', as well as the second, [[Puppet Master 4|fourth]], and [[Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter|fifth]] installments of the series, are only available in [[DVD]] format through a [[Full Moon Features]] box set that has since been discontinued.  However, in 2007, Full Moon Features reacquired the rights to the first five films, and the box set has since been reissued and is available directly from Full Moon, as well as through several online retailers.

The film is also available on DVD along with the first two films on a triple feature "Midnight Horror Collection" at a budget price. A remastered edition Blu-ray and DVD of the film was released on September 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullmoonhorror.com/2012/07/18/puppet-master-1-2-3-coming-to-blu-ray/ |title=Puppet Master 1,2,3 Coming to Blu-Ray! Full Remastered transfers in 16:9 and 5.1 |publisher=Full Moon Horror |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film is set during 1941 in [[World War II]] [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]]. A [[scientist]] named Dr. Hess is forced by the [[Nazis]], especially his [[Gestapo]] liaison Major Kraus, to create a [[drug]] capable of animating corpses to use as living shields on the battlefield after losing too many on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. But, Dr. Hess cannot get it right: While the corpses do reanimate, they have a tendency towards mindless [[violence]]. In a small [[theater]] downtown, [[Andre Toulon|André Toulon]] has set up a [[Political satire|politically satirical]] puppet show for children, starring a six-armed [[American Old West]] puppet named [[Six Shooter (Puppet Master)|Six-Shooter]], who attacks an inanimate reconstruction [[puppet]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]. The show is, next to a crowd of children, also attended by [[Leutnant|Lt]]. Erich Stein, Kraus' driver. After the performance, Toulon and his wife Elsa feed the puppets with the formula which sustains their life force, but they are watched by Stein, who informs his superior the next morning. Hess, genuinely fascinated by the formula, wants Toulon to freely share the secret with him, but Kraus wants to take Toulon in for [[treason]] and insulting of the [[Führer]].

The next day, André gives Elsa a puppet crafted in her likeness as a gift, but soon afterwards Kraus, Hess, and a squad of soldiers break into the [[Atelier (art)|atelier]] and take Toulon, Tunneler, and Pinhead. When Elsa attempts to prevent them from taking the formula as well, she is shot by one of the escort, and Toulon is dragged away from her. When Kraus prepares to leave, the wounded Elsa [[Spitting|spits]] at him in defiance, and in [[retaliation]], Kraus shoots her dead in cold blood. However, while transporting Toulon off, the two soldiers guarding him are killed by Pinhead and Tunneler, enabling Toulon to escape.

After hiding for the remainder of the night, Toulon returns to his theater to find that the stage has been burnt by the Nazis. He finds Six-Shooter and Jester and leaves with them, then discovers a partially destroyed hospital and decides to set up camp in it. Seeking [[revenge]], Toulon, Pinhead, and Jester break into the morgue to get his wife's life essence and inserts it into the woman puppet he made for her, and as she comes to life, he inserts several [[leech]]es he found in a jar into her. Later that night, Toulon carries out the first revenge attack on Stein while he fixes Kraus' car, along with Pinhead, Jester and [[Leech Woman]]. On his flight from his pursuers, Toulon subsequently finds [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] in a [[bombed-out]] [[building]].

Back in his lab, Dr. Hess is studying Toulon's formula, and desperate to meet and talk with him, he goes back to the old theater. Meanwhile, some friends from the puppet show, a boy named Peter Hertz and his father, find André and decide to live with him after Peter's mother was arrested on charges of espionage. The next day, Toulon sends Six-Shooter to kill [[General]] Müller, the supervisor of the Nazi reanimation project, while Müller is visiting a [[brothel]]. Six-Shooter manages to kill the general, but Müller shoots off one of the puppet's arms beforehand. Peter goes back to Toulon's old atelier to look for a replacement arm and is caught by Dr. Hess, who treats him kindly and gets him to take him to Toulon.

Dr. Hess finds and talks to Toulon, who tells him about the puppets' secret, and the two become friends. But Peter's father betrays Toulon by telling Major Kraus about his hideout in exchange for a pardon for his family. Kraus and his men storm the ruin, but the puppets fight back, enabling Toulon and Hess to escape. Kraus stops Peter and his father, demanding to know where Toulon is; Hertz fights against and is shot by Kraus. While searching the nearby houses, one of Kraus' men is shot by Six-Shooter; but when Hess approaches him, the soldier puts a [[knife]] into him before expiring. Hess dies from the injury, telling Toulon to keep fighting. Toulon returns once more to his old theater, where he falls asleep from exhaustion and is soon joined by the now orphaned Peter.

At night, Major Kraus returns to his office, only to fall prey to an ambush by Toulon and his puppets, now joined by [[Blade (Puppet Master)|Blade]], infused with Hess' essence. Toulon takes terrible revenge on Kraus by hanging him from the ceiling by his [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and [[neck]], which are impaled by sharp [[wikt:hooks|hooks]]. After having a [[halberd]] from Kraus' office decorations planted into the floor, point up, Toulon sets the rope on [[fire]]; the rope eventually snaps, and Kraus fatally falls right onto the halberd. The film ends with Toulon, posing as Kraus, and Peter leaving the country for [[Geneva]] on the [[express train]].

==Timeline Issue==
* Andre’ Toulon escaped Berlin in 1941 in this film. However, Toulon commits suicide on March 15, 1939, in the [[Puppet Master (film)|first installment]], and this film mentions the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], whose conduct of operations did not take place until summer of 1941. This film could have taken place in that year.

'''''Red Zone''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Zyrinx]] and published by [[Time Warner Interactive]] in 1994 for the [[Sega Genesis]] console.

A pre-release version of this game - ''Hardwired'' - has been deemed by the (now defunct) developer as publicly distributable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sega-16.com/2006/09/developers-den-zyrinx |title=Developer's Den: Zyrinx |accessdate=September 28, 2010|author=Nick Gibson |date=September 1, 2006 |website=Sega-16.com |quote=In a move that was certainly unorthodox at the time, Zyrinx [released] the beta of Red Zone into the public domain }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eidolons-inn.net/old/sega/roms.html |title=Freeware Genesis ROMs |accessdate=28 September 2010 |website=Eidolon's Inn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107080228/http://www.eidolons-inn.net/old/sega/roms.html |archivedate=7 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game used a number of technologies that were not prevalent at the time on the Genesis/Mega Drive.{{cn|date=July 2016}} 

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' determined that the game is difficult to get used to, particularly its top-down perspective, but that the number of usable weapons and missions are impressive and "Both the combat and aerial sequences are innovative and enjoyable". They scored it a 6.8 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Red Zone|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=December 1994|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'', while commenting that the helicopter handling and graphical intro are impressive, concluded that the poor controls when maneuvering characters on the ground effectively kill any potential enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Red Zone|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=76|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that "While ''Red Zone'''s plot and gameplay are surely blatant rip-offs from ''Urban Strike'', the enormous challenges and fundamentally make this title a viable alternative to the ongoing success of the ''Strike'' series."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=2|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=February 1995|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''School Days'''''|スクールデイズ|Sukūru Deizu|}} is a Japanese [[visual novel]] developed by [[0verflow]], released on April 28, 2005 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] as an [[Eroge|adult game]]. It was later [[Porting|ported]] as a [[DVD game]] and for the [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) and [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP). The story, a dramatic [[slice-of-life]], follows Makoto Ito, a high school student who becomes the ambivalent love interest of several girls during his second term, and the effects this has on himself and his relationships with other characters. Though the game requires little interaction from users, ''School Days'' engages the player through a plot that they are given opportunities to change the course of during play. The game concludes with an ending specific to the outcome of the story, some of which became notorious for their [[graphic violence]].

0verflow announced work on ''School Days'' in October 2004 and marketed it through public venues that showcased the game's innovative use of [[anime]]-like cinematics and voice. The game ranked as the best-selling visual novel in Japan for the time of its release, continuing to chart in the national top 50 for nearly five months afterward. 0verflow would then go on to produce [[#Sequels|multiple sequels]] including a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the original story called ''[[Summer Days]]'', and a [[Sequel#Parallel|parallel]] story called ''[[Cross Days]]''. Another spin-off, ''[[Island Days]]'', has been developed by Klon for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. ''School Days'' was remastered as ''School Days HQ'' on October 8, 2010 and localized in North America on June 27, 2012. The original game was officially discontinued April 21, 2011.

Following the game's release, ''School Days'' made several transitions into other media. The original story was adapted into a [[manga]] and serialized in the [[Kadokawa Shoten]] magazine ''[[Comp Ace]]''; it was later published into two volumes. [[Comic anthology|Comic anthologies]], [[light novel]]s and [[art book]]s were also published, as were [[audio drama]]s and several albums of music. An animated television series, two [[direct-to-video]] ([[OVA]]) single releases, and a [[concert film]] were also produced, the first of which became a precursor for an [[internet meme]] when its finale was pulled from broadcast.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Schooldayshqcscreen.jpg|thumb|left|Example of a selection screen from the North American release of ''School Days HQ''. Here, Kotonoha has asked Makoto a question. Players may choose one of the available options or none at all.]]
As a visual novel, ''School Days'' contains extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation is composed of scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress up to that point in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish,&lt;ref name="schoolspec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdspec.html|title=School Days: Spec|publisher=[[0verflow]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of [[French kissing]], masturbation, oral sex, intercourse, and nudity (both female and male) or a combination thereof. Genitalia are [[pixelization|pixelated]] in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of ''School Days HQ'' is uncensored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=196481&amp;gc=gc|title=Getchu.com: School Days|publisher=Getchu.com|accessdate=2012-01-03|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.

Each route the game takes invariably concludes with an ending specific to the choices made up to that point. Depending on these choices, the outcome of the story will either be good or bad. ''School Days'' became popularly known for its bad endings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanator.com/a-new-version-of-school-days-a-new-way-to-die-horribly-16909.phtml|title=A new version of School Days, a new way to die horribly |publisher=Japanator|date=2010-10-15|author=Pedro Cortes|accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depict the deaths of characters. In one ending titled "The Bloody Conclusion", a character's neck is slit open with a [[dōzuki]], causing her to collapse and die in a fountain of blood to the manic laughter of her assailant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=School Days|developer=[[0verflow]]|publisher=Stack|date=2005-04-28|platform=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]|version=|scene={{nihongo|''Ryuuketsu no Ketsuron''|流血の結論||extra2="The Bloody Conclusion"}}|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another called "Eternally", a character commits suicide leaning over and falling off the roof of a school, landing headfirst on a sidewalk to the horror of other characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=School Days|developer=[[0verflow]]|publisher=Stack|date=2005-04-28|platform=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]|version=|scene={{nihongo|''Eienni''|永遠に||extra2="Eternally"}}|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's good endings, by contrast, depict the well-being of characters and their relationships. In the ending "Christmas Eve", a couple share an embrace in a hotel room as snow falls around a surrounding cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=School Days|developer=[[0verflow]]|publisher=Stack|date=2005-04-28|platform=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]|version=|scene={{nihongo|''Kurisumasu Ibu''|クリスマスイブ||extra2="Christmas Eve"}}|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another titled "Two Lovers", a pair of characters agree to have a [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship with the male lead instead of rivaling with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=School Days|developer=[[0verflow]]|publisher=Stack|date=2005-04-28|platform=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]|version=|scene={{nihongo|''Futari no Koibito''|二人の恋人||extra2="Two Lovers"}}|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the numerous [[alternate ending]]s that can be achieved, players who wish to watch additional endings and sex scenes will have to play through the game more than once.&lt;ref name="vn_definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visual-novels.net/vn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=259&amp;Itemid=47|title=What are visual novels?|publisher=Visual-novels.net|accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional visual novels that consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue,&lt;ref name="vn_definition"/&gt; ''School Days'' is unusual in that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved at any time in up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play.&lt;ref name="schoolspec"/&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|List of School Days characters}}
''School Days'' focuses on the life of Makoto Ito, a first-year high school student&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldayshq.0verflow.com/chara_makoto.html|title=School Days HQ: Makoto It|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|publisher=[[0verflow]]|accessdate=2012-01-07|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; living with his divorced and [[Unseen character|unseen]] mother in the fictional city of Haramihama. During his second term, he becomes infatuated with Kotonoha Katsura, a soft-spoken schoolmate who shares train rides with him to and from campus. When his homeroom seating plan is rearranged, he becomes acquaintances with Sekai Saionji, an upbeat girl who takes a special interest in his newfound crush, befriending the two and providing them the grounds to meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldayshq.0verflow.com/chara_sekai.html|title=School Days HQ: Sekai Saionji|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|publisher=[[0verflow]]|accessdate=2012-01-07|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of her triumphant efforts however, Sekai becomes jealous of the new couple, having developed feelings for Makoto herself.

==Development==
''School Days'' was 0verflow's tenth game to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.0verflow.com/html/products/index.html|title=0verflow game list|publisher=0verflow|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan|accessdate=2012-01-09|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of ''School Days'' first surfaced on October 5, 2004 when 0verflow posted a link to the game's then-live website and development log on their official site.&lt;ref name="overflowhp_910"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.0verflow.com/html/top.html|title=0verflow blog: Public School Days Special Page|publisher=[[0verflow]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-07|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009164803/http://www.0verflow.com/html/|archivedate=2004-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the blog, 0verflow revealed that ''School Days'' had been in pre-production for roughly two years and would be a fully animated game. Updates on the development of the game were scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays, and the company encouraged fans to attend Dream Party 2004, an upcoming anime convention at [[Tokyo Big Sight]] in [[Ariake, Tokyo|Ariake]], on October 11, where it would make its first public showcase of the game and characters.&lt;ref name="sd_blog_10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdays_0410.html|title=Development blog: October 2004|publisher=[[0verflow]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-08|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up of the venue was made on October 15. Toward the end of the month on October 26, 0verflow posted that new information about ''School Days'' would be circulated in the November issue of ''Tech Gian'',&lt;ref name="sd_blog_10"/&gt; an adult magazine published by [[Enterbrain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techgian.jp/official/tg201202/|title=Tech Gian official website|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|location=Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-08|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promotion for the game began shortly after. In a November 6 development post, 0verflow announced that it was planning a public screening of new game material, but was experiencing difficulty acquiring space for it. The company had initially chosen to have the venue in [[Akihabara]] but was unable to find a retailer willing to host it, prompting a visit to [[Osaka]] the following week.&lt;ref name="sd_blog_11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdays_0411.html|title=Development blog: November 2004|publisher=[[0verflow]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-08|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; News that the game would contain music by artists such as [[Minami Kuribayashi]], [[Haruko Momoi]], [[Yozuca|Yozuca*]] and [[YURIA]] was posted on November 30, along with a release date change to February 25, 2005.&lt;ref name="sd_blog_11"/&gt;

On December 28, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdays_0412.html|title=Development blog: December 2004|publisher=0verflow|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan|accessdate=2012-01-08|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; 0verflow released a public trial of ''School Days'' and announced that the company would be attending [[Comiket]] 67 at Tokyo Big Sight from December 29 to 30, handing out [[phonecard]]s to the first 50 visitors to their booth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdevent.html|title=Event information: Comiket 67|publisher=[[0verflow]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-07|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230234007/http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdevent.html|archivedate=2004-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, on February 2, 2005, the company announced that the game had been postponed again to April 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdays_0502.html|title=Development blog: February 2005|publisher=0verflow|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan|accessdate=2012-01-13|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 5 to April 8, 0verflow concluded their development log with comments from [[Soyogi Tōno]], Kaname Yuzuki, Tatsuya Hirai, [[Yuki Matsunaga]], Hikaru Isshiki and Hana Yamamoto, the respective voices of Kotonoha, Sekai, Makoto, Otome, Hikari and Setsuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scdays.html|title=Development blog: April 2004|publisher=0verflow|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan|accessdate=2012-01-13|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address bugs that were later found in the game, 0verflow released a patch to bring ''School Days'' to a stable build of 1.11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooldays.0verflow.com/html/scddownload.html|title=School Days downloads|publisher=[[0verflow]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-13|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On June 26, 2007, 0verflow and Lantis-net radio began to air an internet radio drama called "Radio School Days".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0verflow.com/html/diary/2007/20070626_diary.html|title=Radio School Days begins today!|publisher=[[0verflow]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-13|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009164803/http://0verflow.com/html/diary/2007/20070626_diary.html|archivedate=2004-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasts finished up March 28, 2008 with 39 episodes aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lantis-net.com/schooldays/index.html|title=Radio School Days: 39th final broadcast|publisher=[[Lantis (company)|Lantis]]|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|accessdate=2012-01-13|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902040854/http://lantis-net.com/schooldays/index.html|archivedate=2008-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release history===
''School Days'' was [[Porting|ported]] to three other platforms. The first of these was by AiCherry, an [[interactive movie]] developer, who announced on August 20, 2007 that it had picked up the game for development,&lt;ref name="506summerblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicherry.com/mainpage.html|title=Update History: Latest title: School Days|publisher=AiCherry|accessdate=2012-01-02|language=Japanese|archiveurl=

====Delay of finale====

On September 17, 2007, the day before the twelfth and final episode of the televised anime was to air on TV Kanagawa, a sixteen-year-old girl murdered her forty-five-year-old father in their [[Kyoto]] home with an axe. TV Kanagawa promptly cancelled the Tuesday airing of the finale for its similarly violent content,&lt;ref name="mainichi"/&gt; replacing it instead with a thirty-minute video compilation of scenery footage from [[Norway]], played to [[August Wilhelmj]]'s "[[Air on the G String]]". Newspapers such as ''[[The Japan Times]]'' and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' reported on the killing and episode preempt on September 19.&lt;ref name="mainichi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/mantan/anime/archive/news/2007/09/20070919mog00m200002000c.html|title=Schoolgirl murders father, defers final broadcast of School Days|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|accessdate=2012-01-10|language=Japanese|date=2007-09-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015145502/http://mainichi.jp/enta/mantan/anime/archive/news/2007/09/20070919mog00m200002000c.html|archivedate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20070919a6.html|title=Teenage girl admits killing dad with ax|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=2012-01-10|date=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Mainichi Shimbun'', Chiba TV and TV Aichi had also cancelled their airings, with AT-X the only station remaining indecisive.&lt;ref name="mainichi"/&gt; 0verflow issued an apology through their blog the same day,&lt;ref name="0verflow_topics"/&gt; asking viewers to stay tuned for updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.0verflow.com/html/topics/070919_schooldays_12.html|title=About the School Days episode 12 broadcast|location=Kanda, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo|publisher=[[0verflow]]|date=2007-09-19|accessdate=2012-01-10|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217130238/http://www.0verflow.com/html/topics/070919_schooldays_12.html|archivedate=2008-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following week, 0verflow announced that it had arranged for two screenings of the edited finale at the [[Tokyo Anime Center|Akihabara 3D Theater]] on September 27.

==Reception==
''UK Anime Network'', a British online anime and manga magazine, gave the television series a 7 out of 10, summarizing it as "An utter subversion of the high school romance genre, which is disturbing and unsettling... yet oddly compelling in its own way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Hanley, Andy |url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/School_Days.html |title=Anime Review: School Days |work=UK Anime Network |date=June 8, 2009&lt;!-- |date_rem=The date "08/06/2009" is presumed to be in a &lt;abbr&gt;DMY&lt;/abbr&gt; format.--&gt; |accessdate=August 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''THEM Anime Reviews'', a website devoted to the review of anime, gave the series a less favorable 1 out of 5 stars, citing "overblown, shallow, and flat" characters and that although "''School Days'' looks fascinating when you see screenshots of it and read episode guides", the reviewer found it to be "annoying, stupid, mean-spirited, and full of some of the biggest idiots [he had] seen in an anime in a long time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Jones, Tim |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1185 |title=School Days |work=THEM Anime Reviews |date=March 25, 2010&lt;!-- |date_rem=Found at http://www.themanime.org/viewnews.php?m=3&amp;y=2010 --&gt; |accessdate=August 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2015, the [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Chinese Ministry of Culture]] listed ''School Days'' among 38 anime and manga titles banned in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2015/06/12/china-bans-38-japanese-anime-manga-titles-including-attack-titan |title=China bans 38 anime &amp; manga titles incuding ''Attack on Titan'' |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=2015-06-12 |accessdate=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Kaumaram}}
'''Sooranporu''' or '''Soorasamharam''' part of '''Skanda Sashti Vratham''' festival is a ritual folk performance that recreates the killing of [[Asuras]] by [[Lord Murugan]].&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt; It is performed in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Palakkad district|district of Palakkad]] in [[Kerala]] at temples dedicated to Murugan. The ''Soorasamharam'' festival is also celebrated in Thiruvannur Subramanya Swami temple in [[Kozhikode District]] kerala for more than a century in the name ''' Sooranpada'''.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=The fall of demons|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/theatre/the-fall-of-demons/article4244670.ece|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Devotees throng Palani for Soorasamharam|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devotees-throng-palani-for-soorasamharam/article881272.ece|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 date is November 5.&lt;ref&gt;http://tiruchendur.org/2016.kandasashti.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Sooranporu performance is based on the story of Murugan, also known as [[Murugan|Skanda]], as given in the [[Skanda Purana|Skandapurana]]. In the days preceding the performance the Skandapaurana is narrated in the temple. The performance ends with the killing of Soorapadman (or Padmasura) and his race which is depicted through the symbolic beheading of the four Asuras Anamughan, Panumughan, Simhamughan and Soorapadman.&lt;ref name="thehindu" /&gt; The Asuras are beheaded by Murugan using his weapon the ''vel'' a kind of spear or javelin. For the performance the ''vel'' is specially consecrated and during the staging of the show it is ceremonially placed on the neck of the effigy after which the head is removed, depicting the beheading of the Asura.&lt;ref name="thehindu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu_a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of devotees witness 'Soorasamharam'|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thousands-of-devotees-witness-soorasamharam/article4110361.ece|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sooranporu is staged at the end of a week-long ''Kanda Sashti'' festival.&lt;ref name="thehindu_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Soorasamharam' performed|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/soorasamharam-performed/article3067049.ece|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sooranporu is preceded by several ceremonies on the last day of the ''Kanda Sashti'' festival. Special [[Puja (Hinduism)|pujas]] are conducted and the deity of Murugan is ritually anointed ([[abhishekam]]) and devotees seek the deity's darshan. In some parts of Tamil Nadu women devotees observe a six-day fast which they break at the end of the Sooranporu. In [[Palani]], a procession of Lord Murugan (known here as ''Dandayuthapaniswamy'') is taken down from the [[Palani Murugan temple|hill temple]] and led through the main thoroughfares of the town before the Sooranporu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilnadu.com/temples/dhandapani-murugan-kovil.html|title=Dhandapani Murugan Kovil|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=5 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307142728/http://tamilnadu.com/temples/dhandapani-murugan-kovil.html|archivedate=7 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands witness 'Soorasamharam'|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thousands-witness-soorasamharam/article881500.ece|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television in Spain''' was launched in October 1956, when the state broadcaster [[Televisión Española]] (TVE) started regular broadcasts. The first private channels started in 1990. Colour transmissions started in 1972 after two years of test transmissions, with all programming transmitted in color from 1977, and colour commercials, which started in 1978. Currently, television is one of the leading mass media of the country, and by 2008 was in 99.7% of households in Spain according to INE statistics.

Until recently terrestrial television was considered an essential public service. Broadcasting is managed both directly by the State and indirectly, through controlled concessions to private firms. The Audiovisual Law of 2010 changed this by defining radio and television as commercial services that individuals pay for, fostering liberalization within some constraints.

==Analogue terrestrial television==
Analogue terrestrial television in Spain began on 28 October 1956. Televisión Española (now [[La 1 (Spain)|La 1]]) was the very first regular television channel, and operated alone until 1966, when a second channel (now [[La 2 (Spain)|La 2]]) was launched. La 1 and La 2 were the only authorized television channels in Spain until 1982, when [[Euskal Telebista]] was launched in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and, in the following year, [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]] in [[Catalonia]], thus ending TVE's monopoly. More channels were launched in the 1980s, each broadcasting to their respective [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]]: [[Canal Nou|Canal 9]], [[Canal Sur]], [[Telemadrid]], and [[Televisión de Galicia]] (TVG), prior to the full liberalization of television with the law of 1989 which permitted the establishment of private commercial channels.

[[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]], [[Telecinco]] and [[Canal+ Spain|Canal+]] were launched in 1990, in January, March and September respectively, finishing the public television monopoly in Spain. Through the 1990s and 2000s (decade), more autonomic channels (most of them public, but some of them private) were launched, and all of them created [[FORTA]], a union of public autonomic channels. Many local channels were also launched, some of them created the [[Localia]] Network. During the 1990s, dozens of local channels started broadcasting without a license. The government declared that channels that proved to be operating for a long time could go on working, but blocked new unlicensed channels.

In the 2000s (decade), the analog national and autonomic channels started [[simulcast]] on digital terrestrial television. In 2005, Canal+ stopped its analog service to move to [[Digital Plus]] and was substituted by [[Cuatro (TV channel)|Cuatro]]. Some weeks later, the last analog national private channel, [[La Sexta]], started testing broadcasts, to begin its regular analog schedule in 2006. In 2009, the analog service started its closure in a process that lasted one year. On 3 April 2010 the analog service was officially discontinued but there are still some small local analog channels operating, most of them the unlicensed analog channels.

==Digital terrestrial television==

The development of digital terrestrial television was very similar to the failure of [[ITV Digital]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Digital terrestrial television was introduced in the country by the pay per view platform [[Quiero Television]]. In May 2002, statewide operators were required to start broadcasting in [[DVB-T]]. Yet, Quiero TV ceased transmissions in 2002 after a commercial failure. Unlike the UK, the three and half multiplexes left by the platform were not reassigned to other operators, and so 5 channels were squashed into a single multiplex.

On 30 November 2005, digital terrestrial television was relaunched as a free service with 20 channels and 14 radio stations, along with 23 regional- and local-language channels in their respective areas. Currently about 95% of the population can receive DTT. Each multiplex has a minimum of 4 SD channels each or one HD channel. [[Televisió de Catalunya]] and [[Aragón Televisión]] are using spare bandwidth in their own digital multiplex to broadcast test HD streams.

==Cable==

Digital cable is slowly replacing the aging analogue service of the major cable provider [[ONO (Spain)|Ono]]. [[TeleCable (Spain)|Telecable]], a cable ISP operating in [[Asturias]] has begun trials for 1000 mega bytes per second service and is the first to broadcast HD channels. 
[[Mundo-R|R]], a cable operator in Galicia, has completely switched pay TV to digital (DVB-C) by 2008 but free channels are simulcast as analog services, so users without a set-top box can watch them (including most free-to-air channels available on digital terrestrial TV in each location).

==Satellite==

Digital satellite services has existed since 1997 from [[SES Astra|Astra]] and Hispasat satellites. The [[Movistar+]] pay platform has carried some HDTV tests on [[Astra 19.2°E]] on 16 June 2005. This platform (before Canal+) has a lot of exclusives channels as "#0" by February 2016 without having to pay the licence of the brand Canal+.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movistarplus.es/diales&lt;/ref&gt;

A high definition version of Canal+ 1 (Canal+ 1 HD) now is called "#0"; started on 29 January 2008, together with HD versions of Canal+ Deportes (now movistar Deportes) and Canal+ DCine (now movistar Dcine) broadcast from [[Astra 1KR]].

==IPTV==

During 2007 [[Telefónica]] ran trials of [[VDSL]] services up to 52 Mbit/s - However, the results were not as good as expected. For this reason, Telefónica will use [[FTTH]] for future IPTV services.
Now Telefónica use Movistar+ in IPTV and Satellite.

Its original name is ''Posel Smrti'' ({{lang-cz|Death's Messenger}}). The game features 150 locations and 5 hours of spoken dialogue. ''The Black Mirror'' became a commercial success, with 500,000 units sold worldwide by 2008. It was particularly successful in Germany, under publisher [[DTP Entertainment]]. Two sequels, ''[[Black Mirror II: Reigning Evil|Black Mirror II]]'' and ''[[Black Mirror III: Final Fear|Black Mirror III]]'', were released. Additionally, a reboot titled ''[[Black Mirror (2017 video game)|Black Mirror]]'' was released on November 28, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-17-black-mirror-reboot-in-the-works|title=Black Mirror reboot in the works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

[[Image:Black Mirror manor.jpg|thumb|left|The exterior of Black Mirror Castle.]]

== Plot ==
The story takes place in the 1980s, primarily at Black Mirror, the ancestral [[Manor house|manor]] of the Gordon family located in Scotland. The protagonist, Samuel Gordon, is forced to return to the Black Mirror manor after 12 years absence upon hearing of the death of his grandfather, William Gordon. Despite the mysterious circumstances surrounding William's death, it is considered a suicide by everyone except for Samuel.

Upon his arrival in Black Mirror, Samuel begins his investigation of his grandfather's death. Samuel's investigation soon reveals that his grandfather had interests in the arcane, and up until his death had spent near every waking hour working to uncover the mystery of the Gordon family's curse. From his grandfather's writings and other sources, Samuel discovers that centuries ago, in the 1200s, the Gordon line began with two brothers, Marcus and Mordred Gordon. The eldest, Mordred, was a monster of a man, opening a dark [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] known as the Black Mirror deep under where the manor now stands. The younger, Marcus, fought his brother, killing him and containing - but not closing - the Black Mirror. In his dying breath the elder cursed the younger, stating that he and his descendants would be forever cursed until five souls were sacrificed and his evil was unleashed once more. William's notes also speak of five sacred keys required to shut the portal for good, entrusted to different members of the Gordon family. Samuel then begins his quest to seek out the five sacred keys and close the Black Mirror permanently.

As the story progresses, further strange and unexpected deaths occur to individuals around Black Mirror, each one accompanied by a strange blood red [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]]. Samuel travels the land around Black Mirror, visiting a local town, chapel, and [[sanatorium]], and also at one point travels to his family's second manor in [[Wales]] to obtain a key there. At long last Samuel obtains the five keys, but moments later also discovers the horrifying truth: he is the killer responsible for all the deaths, ending the lives of the victims in his sleep; this is the nature of the Gordon family curse. Samuel enters the [[catacombs]] beneath the mansion, enters the Black Mirror, and using the five keys seals the portal. After this, unable to live with the atrocities he has committed, Samuel jumps from the top of the mansion, falling onto the same spiked fence which killed his grandfather.

The game is divided into six chapters:

*Chapter I: Return of the Future
*Chapter II: Back to the Light
*Chapter III: Hidden Legacy
*Chapter IV: Forgotten Bound
*Chapter V: Confession of the Truth
*Chapter VI: Look Through the Mirror

==Development==
The game's development started in early 2000 with a development team of 5 people. The release date was initially late 2002, but after slight delays, it was released in March 2003.&lt;ref name=sector&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buday|first1=Pavol|title=Posel Smrti Interview s Unknown Identity|url=http://www.sector.sk/clanok/5225/posel-smrti-interview-s-unknown-identity.htm|website=Sector.sk|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
===Sales===
A few weeks after ''The Black Mirror''{{'}}s initial release in the Czech Republic, Marcel Speta of Future Games reported that it was selling adequately and according to company forecasts.&lt;ref name=inventoryint&gt;{{cite magazine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813153740/http://www.justadventure.com:80/TheInventory/TheInventory.shtm | url=http://www.justadventure.com:80/TheInventory/TheInventory.shtm | title=The Celebrity Corner; Interview with Future Games / Unknown Identity | date=March 2003 | issue=7 | magazine=The Inventory | publisher=[[Just Adventure]] | archivedate=August 13, 2006 | pages=20-26 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; GMX Media president Eugene Perry remarked in March 2004 that the game had "been very successful in every territory",&lt;ref&gt;https://adventuregamers.com/news/view/19360&lt;/ref&gt; and Future Games saw it as a "solid" seller in the United States.&lt;ref name=sme&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405161223/http://hry.sme.sk/clanok-1911332.html | url=http://hry.sme.sk/clanok-1911332.html | title=Rozhovor s M.

At the time, it had just launched in Germany, and the company was hopeful regarding its performance in the region.&lt;ref name=malik1&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040816133348/http://www.adventure-treff.de/artikel/interviews.php?id=21&amp;lang=eng | url=http://www.adventure-treff.de/artikel/interviews.php?id=21&amp;lang=eng | title=Interviews; Martin Malík | date=May 19, 2004 | author=Schneider, Jan | work=Adventure-Treff | archivedate=August 16, 2004 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed position #1 on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.de]]'s sales rankings upon release, although Carsten Fichtelmann of German publisher [[DTP Entertainment]] noted that certain [[brick and mortar]] stores had ordered "very small" shipments, a decision he considered to be a mistake.&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721194919/http://www.mediabiz.de/games/news/black-mirror-top-bei-amazon/152408 | url=http://www.mediabiz.de/games/news/black-mirror-top-bei-amazon/152408 | title="''Black Mirror''" top bei Amazon | date=April 8, 2004 | work=The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games | author=Staff |  archivedate=July 21, 2018 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Gameswelt'', ''The Black Mirror'' received harsh reviews from critics in the United States.&lt;ref name=gwfuture /&gt; While most critics praised its dark atmosphere - created mostly by meticulously drawn backgrounds, music, ambiance and realistic animation and sound effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Black Mirror Review |url=https://www.gamespot.com/the-black-mirror/reviews/ |website=Gamespot.com |publisher=Gamespot |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the quality of the English voice-overs was unsatisfying to many.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Other points of criticism include the game's rigid linear structure, [[pixel hunting]] elements, plot holes and inconsistencies (acts later revealed to have been committed by certain characters were not possible given their location at the time) and most especially the game's ending.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In 2011, [[Adventure Gamers]] named ''Black Mirror'' the 83rd-best adventure game ever released.&lt;ref name=top100&gt;{{cite web | author=AG Staff | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604021011/http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/18643 | url=http://www.adventuregamers.com:80/articles/view/18643 | title=Top 100 All-Time Adventure Games | date=December 30, 2011 | archivedate=June 4, 2012 | work=[[Adventure Gamers]] | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

German-based [[Cranberry Production]] developed a sequel, ''[[Black Mirror II: Reigning Evil|Black Mirror II]]'', in 2009. It takes place in the 1990s, twelve years after the original game. When solitary Darren Michaels befriends the beautiful Angelina Morgan, he has no idea what the fates hold in store for him. The alluring Angelina has also attracted the eye of several others; and when she suddenly disappears, Darren finds himself questioning what has happened to her while he is haunted by a series of torturous and ever-intensifying nightmares. Darren's search for his missing friend and his own sanity take him on a chilling expedition from his small New England town to Willow Creek, England - and the reigning evil of Black Mirror Castle.

Darren's journey will immerse him in the dark secrets and turbulent history of the castle's ill-fated Gordon Family. Legend has it that the Gordons were haunted by an ancient curse that ultimately led to their demise more than a decade earlier. Will Darren be able to overcome these demons and find Angelina? Will Darren's search lead him to redemption or the hell of insanity? Or will he become the curse's next victim?

KING Art Games and THQ Nordic are releasing Black Mirror; a modern re-imagining of the acclaimed Gothic-horror adventure series. New protagonist David Gordon never knew his estranged father particularly well. Still it comes as a shock when he is summoned to his family's ancestral home in the Scottish highlands, after his father has taken his own life there. David does not know much about his father's final weeks, but the circumstances of his death seem more than peculiar. Settling the heritage is merely an excuse for David to find out more about the castle his father grew up in, meeting the family he never knew and for shedding light on the mysteries surrounding his father's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackmirror-game.com/game/story-and-game/|title=The Game – Black Mirror|website=blackmirror-game.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland, 1926. Following the suicide of his father, David Gordon visits his ancestral home for the first time in his life. A life that is soon threatened by the dark secrets that claimed the sanity of many Gordons before him. Tormented by nightmares and waking dreams for all his life, David fears that it might be his destiny to follow in his father's footsteps, down a path that leads to madness, and death. Is there really a Curse that has been haunting his family, like his father believed? It is up to David to uncover the horrible truths, buried under generations of silence and fathoms of stone.

'''''The Dumb Waiter''''' is a one-act play by [[Harold Pinter]] written in 1957.

"Small but perfectly formed, ''The Dumb Waiter'' might be considered the best of Harold Pinter's early plays, more consistent than [[The Birthday Party (play)|''The Birthday Party'']] and sharper than ''[[The Caretaker]]''. It combines the classic characteristics of early Pinter – a paucity of information and an atmosphere of menace, working-class small-talk in a claustrophobic setting – with an oblique but palpable political edge and, in so doing, can be seen as containing the germ of Pinter's entire dramatic oeuvre".&lt;ref name=Derby&gt;Derbyshire, Harry. "Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter (review)", ''Modern Drama'', vol 53, no 2 (2010), pp266-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

"''The Dumb Waiter'' is Pinter distilled – the very essence of a writer who tapped into our desire to seek out meaning, confront injustice and assert our individuality."&lt;ref name=Glover&gt;Glover, Jamie. "The Dumb Waiter" (programme notes). The Print Room, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Two [[Hitman|hit-men]], Ben and Gus, are waiting in a basement room for their assignment. As the play begins, Ben, the senior member of the team, is reading a newspaper, and Gus, the junior member, is tying his shoes. Gus asks Ben many questions as he gets ready for their job and tries to make tea. They argue over the [[semantics]] of "light the kettle" and "put on the kettle". Ben continues reading his paper for most of the time, occasionally reading excerpts of it to Gus. Ben gets increasingly animated, and Gus's questions become more pointed, at times nearly nonsensical.

In the back of the room is a [[dumbwaiter]], which delivers occasional food orders. This is mysterious and both characters seem to be puzzled why these orders keep coming; the basement is clearly not outfitted as a restaurant kitchen. At one point they send up some snack food that Gus had brought along. Ben has to explain to the people above via the dumbwaiter's "speaking tube" that there is no food. 

Gus leaves the room to get a drink of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's speaking tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and is on his way to the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.

==Title==
The [[Dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumb waiter]] of the title refers to the serving hatch and food lift that delivers orders to the gunmen. It could also refer to Gus, who fails to realise that he is waiting to be the victim, or even to Ben, whose obedience to a higher authority eventually forces him to eliminate his partner.&lt;ref name=Bill&gt;Billington, Michael. ''Harold Pinter''. Faber &amp; Faber, 2nd edition, 2007, p89 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
The windowless basement is characteristic of Pinter's sets. "Pinter's rooms are stuffy, non-specific cubes, whose atmosphere grows steadily more stale and more tense. At the opening curtain these rooms look naturalistic, meaning no more than the eye can contain. But, by the end of each play, they become sealed containers, virtual coffins."&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;Cohn, Ruby. "The World of Harold Pinter", ''Tulaine Drama Review'', 6 (March 1962), pp55-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Pinter's writing in ''The Dumb Waiter'' combines "the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk and the urban thriller".&lt;ref name=Bill /&gt; The dialogue between Ben and Gus, while seemingly concerned only with trivial newspaper stories, football matches and cups of tea, reveals their characters. In Pinter's early plays, "it is language that betrays the villains – more pat, more cliché-ridden, with more brute power than that of their victims".&lt;ref name=Cohn /&gt;

In the theatre, the emotional power of the play is more readily felt than understood. Pinter "created his own theatrical grammar – he didn't merely write characters that had an emotional response to something... But instead, through his characters' interactions and phrasings, Pinter seemed to conjure the very visceral emotion itself".&lt;ref name=Glover /&gt;

==Interpretation==
Although the play is realistic in many ways, particularly the dialogue between Ben and Gus, there are also elements that are unexplained and seemingly absurd, particularly the messages delivered by the dumb waiter itself, and the delivery of an envelope containing twelve matchsticks. Pinter is notable for leaving the plays open to interpretation, "wanting his audience to complete his plays, to resolve in their own ways these irresolvable matters".&lt;ref name=Lawford&gt;Lawford, Cindy. {{Cite web|url=http://www.cindylawford.co.uk/theatre/dumb-waiter-by-harold-pinter/|title=The Dumb Waiter (programme notes)|work=|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinter stated that "between my lack of biographical data about [the characters] and the ambiguity of what they say lies a territory which is not only worthy of exploration but which it is compulsory to explore".&lt;ref name=Lawford /&gt;

One interpretation is that the play is an absurdist comedy about two men waiting in a universe without meaning or purpose, like [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. "The Dumb Waiter.... achieves, through its unique blend of absurdity, farce, and surface realism, a profoundly moving statement about the modern human condition".&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;Brewer, Mary F. (Ed) "Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter". Rodopi, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation is that the play is a political drama showing how the individual is destroyed by a higher power. "Each of Harold Pinter's [first] four plays ends in the virtual annihilation of an individual.... It is by his bitter dramas of dehumanisation that he implies "the importance of humanity". The religion and society, which have traditionally structured human morality, are, in Pinter's plays, the immoral agents that destroy the individual."&lt;ref name=Cohn /&gt; Pinter supported the interpretation of [[The Birthday Party (play)|''The Birthday Party'']] and ''The Dumb Waiter'' as "political plays about power and victimisation".&lt;ref name=Bill /&gt;

Overall, "it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership. Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority and a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, talking past each other and raking over old times".&lt;ref name=Bill /&gt; It is "a strongly political play about the way a hierarchical society, in pitting the rebel against the conformist, places both at its mercy", but at the same time "a deeply personal play about the destructiveness of betrayal".&lt;ref name=Bill /&gt;

"For an audience to gaze into Ben and Gus' closed basement room and overhear their everyday prattle is to gain insight into ... the terrifying vision of the dominant-subservient battle for power, a battle in which societies and individuals engage as a part of daily existence".&lt;ref name=Brewer /&gt;

==Comedy==
Although the play uses "the semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music hall comedy"&lt;ref name=Bill /&gt; and is generally considered funny, this is not comedy for its own sake, but "a crucial part of the power-structure".&lt;ref name=Bill /&gt;

"The comedy routines in the early plays are maps to the themes and meaning of the plays as a whole.... Our failure to laugh may be an indication that we, the audience, have come to side (or have been taught to side) with the victim rather than the victimiser."&lt;ref name=Coppa&gt;Coppa, Francesca. "The Sacred Joke: Comedy and Politics in Pinter’s Early Plays", ''The Cambridge Companion to Harold Pinter''. Cambridge University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stories Ben picks out from his newspaper have a similar purpose. He describes an old man, wanting to cross the street, who crawls under a lorry and is run over by it (but it is not clear if the man is killed or not). Ben seems to expect the response, "What an idiot!" but Gus replies "Who advised him to do a thing like that?" which shifts responsibility and suggests the old man was a victim to be pitied. "The eventual split between Ben and Gus is foreshadowed in the very first joke.... By the end of the play, Pinter has trained us to see that the content of the joke-exchange is meaningless: what is important is the structure, and the alliances and antagonisms it reveals."&lt;ref name=Coppa /&gt;

'''Theatre in Bangladesh''' is believed to have its origin in the 4th century AD in the form of [[Sanskrit drama]]. The conquest of [[Bengal]] by the [[Gupta empire|Gupta dynasty]] led the ingress of the northern Indian culture into the ancient [[Bangladeshi culture]] which eventually introduced the tradition of theatre in [[Bangladesh]]. At present, apart from the Sanskrit theatre, the influence of the European theatre and the indigenous folk culture can also be seen in the theatre art of Bangladesh.

== Sanskrit theatre ==
Through the conquest of Bengal by the Guptas, the culture of ancient Bangladesh assimilated the Aryan culture of the [[North India|northern India]] and got heavily influenced by it. At that time, theatre activities, which was in form of Sanskrit theatre, was generally practised by the urban folks. The vigorous trade by the local people led to the rise of some urban areas which were home to the art and cultural centre of ancient Bangladesh. ''Lokananda'' is believed to be a popular play from this period which was structured in four acts with a prologue and was written by [[Chandragomin]].{{sfn|Bharucha|1993|pp=3}}

The close political integration of many parts of ancient Bangladesh with the Aryan culture carried on through the 8th century. During this period, emperors like [[Bhaskaravarman]], [[Yashovarman]], [[Lalitaditya]] greatly influenced the Sanskrit theatre movement in the region. However, the theatre activities in this period witnessed the greatest patronage by [[Harshavardhana]]. According to the [[Kashmir]]i poet [[Kalhana]], there was a great theatre dancer named Kamala in the ancient kingdom of [[Pundravardhana]], now a part of northern Bangladesh. During the [[Pala empire|Pala rule]] (8th to 12th century), [[Bikrampur]] was the centre of a thriving Sanskrit theatre tradition in Bangladesh. This development of Sanskrit theatre also flourished during the [[Sena dynasty|Sena rule]].{{sfn|Bharucha|1993|pp=5}}

The tradition of Sanskrit theatre witnessed a major impediment through the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|arrival of Muslim]] rule in the early 13th century. Few theatre activities are recorded from this period which were mostly supported by some [[Hindu]] feudal lords. Lakshmana Manikya of [[Bhulua]] was a great patron of Sanskrit theatre of this period.{{sfn|Bharucha|1993|pp=6}}

== Folk theatre ==
The term '''Folk theatre''' encompasses all forms of theatre which originated in the geographical region of Bangladesh. Unlike the Sanskrit theatre, the folk theatre was always in direct contact with the people and was often created and supported by them. However, it was not closed to the refined techniques of the Sanskrit theatre. In the folk theatre, the performers include actors, dancers, singers, musicians, and puppeteers (both male and female). Their performance is not restricted to dialogue in prose but is comprehensive and wide-ranging. It includes any one or more of the following elements: (i) dance, (ii) instrumental music and (iii) speech rendered in prose, verse or lyric, either in the form of narration or that of dialogue. The folk theatre of Bangladesh has developed in distinct forms, which can be loosely categorised into (i) the Narrative, (ii) the Song-and-Dance, (iii) the Processional, and (iv) the Supra-personae.{{sfn|Bharucha|1993|pp=7}}

=== Narrative forms ===
In the narrative forms of theatre, the lead-narrator (gayen) describes an event, portrays various characters related to the event and enacts the action, all in the third person. While engaged as described above, s/he partly speaks his/her lines in prose, partly recites in verse, and partly sings his/her story. S/he is assisted by the choral singers-cum-musicians (dohars), who employ musical instruments (Mridanga and Mandira) and sing choral passages. The gayen carries a chamar (whisk) in religious performances and occasionally dances while singing. Usually, the performer makes effective use of vocal inflections and physical gestures in his/her portrayal of the characters. Sometimes s/he also readjusts his/her basic costume, and uses a few props to make the portrayal more effective.{{sfn|Ahmed|2000|pp=4}}

=== Song-and-dance forms ===
A song-and-dance performance (nata-gita) is characterised by dances rendered by performers enacting characters while singing their lines or dancing silently to songs sung by a group of choral singers and musicians.{{sfn|Ahmed|2000|pp=21}}

=== Supra-personae forms ===
The masked dance of the [[Gombhira]] festival was originally an ancient shamanist or spirit cult performance of the Koch community. By the 9th century, the [[Tantric Buddhism]] in Bangladesh assimilated the performance to evolve their own forms of masked dance, which were similar to ''Astamatrika'' Dance, ''Mahakali Pyayakhan'', ''Devi Pyayakhan'' ([[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]) and [[Tibetan Buddhist]] masked dances. These dances were performed in the Buddhist monasteries during religious festivals, very much as in [[Tibet]]an and Nepalese practice. These performances were given at the year-ending celebration of Chaitra Sangkranti and were given after processional performances.{{sfn|Ahmed|2000|pp=52}}

By the end of the 12th century, when Tantric Saivism in Bangladesh had assimilated decaying Tantric Buddhism, Buddhist masked dances were also adapted to give rise to Mahakali Pyayakhan, Devi Pyayakhan and similar dances. Tantric Saivite masked dances in Bangladesh, unlike those of [[Kathmandu Valley]] (Nepal), decayed because of Muslim conquest. What remains today can be seen in ''Mukho Nacha'', ''Kali Kach'', Gambhira festival and ''Sang Jatra''.{{sfn|Ahmed|2000|pp=56}}

=== Performance with scroll painting ===
The existence of patuya sangit (performances with scroll paintings) in ancient Bangladesh is confirmed by two sources: Yamapattika as referred to in [[Harshacharita]] (7th century AD) and scroll painting of the [[Santal people|Santals]]. Banabhatta (the court-poet of Harsavardhan) in his Harshacharita briefly describes a popular performance of Yamapattaka witnessed by Harsavardhan on his way back to the capital after he learnt of the death of his brother. It was given by a performer with the help of a scroll-painting showing Yama, the King of the Underworld. On the other hand, recent ethnographic studies have shown that the Santal people have among them a type of scroll painting representing the origin of life (Ko Reyak Katha) and the passage of the dead from the mortal world to the life beyond (Chaksudan Pat). These too point to the ancient origin of Patuya Gan performances in Bangladesh. In the medieval period, scroll painting performances eulogising [[Ramachandra]], [[Krishna]], [[Manasa]], [[Chandi]] were extremely popular. By the 18th century, scroll-painting performances gained popularity even among the Muslims, as evinced by Gazir Pat (scroll-painting performances eulogising Pir Gazi), which can still be seen in Bangladesh today.{{sfn|Ahmed|2000|pp=241}}

=== Puppet theatre ===
It is not known when [[puppet]] theatre was introduced in Bangladesh. The earliest extant literary evidence of the existence of the form in Bangladesh is a couplet in [[Yusuf Zulekha]] (1391–1410). As signified there, these performances were given with the help of string puppets. It is possible that orally composed tales of gods and goddesses, such as those of Krishna, Rama, Manasa etc., were produced in these performances. Mukunda Chakravarti's [[Chandimangal]] (1555–56) and [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]]'s [[Chaitanya Charitamrita]] (c 1560–80) definitely point to the existence of puppet theatre during this period. Judging by the popularity of cults and the existing tradition among current performers, it could be safely assumed that these were related to Krishna, Rama, Manasa, Chandi and Chaitanya. No Islamic narrative ever seems to have been performed by puppets in Bangladesh. String puppets still exist in Bangladesh today.{{sfn|Ahmed|2000|pp=184}}

=== Processional Forms ===
{{main|Jatra (Bengal)}}
Processional performances are characterised by the use of tableaux, music, song and dance, all of which form a part of large processions (jatra) attended by adherents of a particular religious faith. In many ways, these performances hold the key to the history of indigenous theatre because they brought together all the three types discussed above, to give birth to jatra, the most popular form of the indigenous theatre which can claim to be indeed the national theatre idiom.{{sfn|Ahmed|2000|pp=38}}

== European influence ==
Political and economic measures undertaken by the [[British raj|English colonisers]] from 1757 onwards led to the [[Bengali renaissance]] in the early 19th century, which affected all aspects of intellectual pursuits in Bangladesh. Its immediate effect was a bifurcation of society into the rural and urban cultures. The elitist urban culture and the European theatre of the economically powerful minority fashioned itself around European models. It demonstrated tremendous vitality, opened new directions, but, as in most cases, also lost touch with the majority and their rural culture. The indigenous theatre, which in most cases remained a part of the rural culture, has failed to meet the demands of the 21st century life in Bangladesh and a process of fossilisation has already set in. On the other hand, the European theatre has been dynamic because the elite urban intelligentsia, who have been responding to the needs of urban spectators, have sustained it. Inception of the European theatre in Bangladesh or erstwhile [[East Bengal]] took place in 1855 with a performance of ''Svarna Sharnkhal'' by Durgadas Kar at [[Barisal]].{{sfn|Bharucha|1993|pp=63}}

== Theatre during East Pakistan period ==
{{see also|East Pakistan}}
Until 1947, the theatre of the urban elite in Bengal was centred in [[Calcutta]], the economic and political seat of power of 19th century India. With the [[Partition of India|creation of Pakistan]], [[Dhaka]] gained importance as the urban cultural centre of eastern Bengal which later turned into East Pakistan. The theatre of the new country was slowly but decisively moving towards polarisation of two opposing camps: (i) the religion-based nationalists and (ii) the language-based nationalists. The religion-based trend was dominant in the urban areas outside Dhaka. It sought to glorify [[History of Islam|Islamic history]] through historical plays on Muslim rulers of the Middle East, India and Bengal, and the [[Pakistan movement|independence struggle of Pakistan]]. Akbaruddin, Ibrahim Khan and Ibrahim Khalil are some of the most prominent playwrights of this trend. The second trend was dominant mainly in Dhaka city and playwrights belonging to this trend were also linked with [[Dhaka University]]-based play productions. This trend was pioneered by [[Natyaguru]] [[Nurul Momen]]. He wrote, published, directed, enacted, broadcast and staged the earliest couple of plays which were secular, non-communal, progressive and international in their themes and plots. The [[Natyaguru]], [[Nurul Momen]]'s first play 'Rupantor'(Transformation) was a 1942 play which propounded the cause of women's lib and empowerment at a time when even the western world wasn't vocal enough about equal rights for women.  Some other important playwrights who followed [[Natyaguru]] [[Nurul Momen]] in this trend include [[Shawkat Osman]], Askar Ibne Shaikh, [[Jasimuddin]] and [[Munier Chowdhury]].

== Theatre in post independence period ==
Theatre was possibly the most forceful and exuberant expression of post-liberation Bangladesh. Numerous non-professional theatre groups were formed all over the country, modelled after the group theatre movement in post-Nabanna Calcutta. The most important among these in Dhaka city were ''Theatre'' (established February 1972), ''Nagarik Natya Sampraday'' (established 1968, first performance August 1972), ''Natyachakra'' (established August 1972), ''Aranyak Natyadal'' (established 1972), ''Dhaka Theatre'' (established July 1973) and, in [[Chittagong]], ''Theatre '73'' (established 1973), and ''Arindam'' (established September 1974). The range of texts performed by the groups varied widely, from Euro-American plays to contemporary originals written by group members themselves. A completely new set of playwrights appeared, important among whom were [[Abdullah al Mamun]], [[Mamunur Rashid]], [[Syed Shamsul Huq]], [[Selim Al Deen]], Mumtazuddin Ahmed, S M Solaiman, Abdullahel Mahmud, Mannan Heera, [[Azad Abul Kalam]] and Saymon Zakaria.

== Significance ==
The culture of theatre has great significance in the history as well as the daily lives of Bangladeshis. The theatre performances had vehemently inspired the independence movements during the British rule in Bangladesh. It also had great impact in the [[Bengali language movement]]. The language-based nationalists during the East Pakistan period played an important role in this regard. ''Kabar'' written by Munier Chowdhury is a famous play based on the language movement. The theatre performances also significantly influenced the [[Bangladesh liberation war|independence struggle of Bangladesh]]. At present, many NGOs use theatre as a forceful medium to create awareness for many social issues in the rural areas of Bangladesh.

'''Ursa''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' portrayed by actress [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]. The character made her comic book debut in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #845 (January 2007). An adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Superman]] and [[accomplice]] of [[General Zod]], she is typically depicted as having been imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]] along with Zod and [[Non (comics)|Non]].

==Character==
[[Image:GeneralZodForPresident20084.jpg|thumb|General Zod ([[Terence Stamp]], center), [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]] ([[Jack O'Halloran]]), and Ursa ([[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]) in ''[[Superman II]]''.]]
Ursa is depicted in both films as a hater of any member of the male gender anywhere. The only exceptions to this prejudice appear to be Non and General Zod. In the first film, this aspect of her character is emphasized by Jor-El in his speech as he sentences them to the Phantom Zone. In the second film, as directed by [[Richard Lester]], Ursa's male hating tendencies survive, but the reprise of Jor-El's speech emphasizes a different aspect of her character. In Lester's ''Superman II'', Jor-El says "Ursa, the only feeling you showed was for your vicious general. Your only wish, to rule at his side." Lester's inclusion of this material (shot by Donner) alters the character slightly, making her softer and, at least to a degree, in love with General Zod. In ''Superman II'' footage shot by [[Richard Donner]], Ursa is more vicious and expresses her desire to kill as many men as she can in one scene from an extended TV version. During the moon scene, Ursa meets an astronaut. Ursa tears off his NASA patch, killing him. She then kicks him between the legs, sending him off into space. This one scene showcases how cruel and powerful Ursa is. In Donner's footage, Ursa does not necessarily appear to be in love with General Zod, but is with him because they share common goals.

If there is one female whom she truly despises, it is [[Lois Lane]]. This is likely because of her close relationship with [[Superman]], the only real threat to Ursa and the trio's reign of terror on Earth.

Throughout ''Superman II'', Ursa collects symbols and badges as she encounters law enforcement and military officers on Earth, and she keeps these badges on her costume as symbols of those she has conquered or killed. She takes a NASA patch from an astronaut, a Sheriff's badge, a badge from a military officer's uniform at the White House, and several more badges and symbols that can be seen attached to her uniform as the film progresses.

In [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''Last Days Of Krypton'' novel, the character of Aethryr is analogous to Ursa in appearance and role as sidekick to Zod, although little mention is made about her attitude towards males.

==Comics==
Until 2006, the character of Ursa had never appeared in the ''Superman'' [[comic book]]s, but a similar character, named [[Faora]], made several appearances in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] ''Superman'' comics. Faora was a Phantom Zone villain who first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #471 (May, 1977).&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Faora | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 118  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Ursa, Faora hates all members of the male sex and was in fact sentenced to the Phantom Zone for "wantonly causing the death of 23 Kryptonian men in her own male concentration camp."

In ''JSA Classified'' #3, [[Power Girl]] (who was unsure about her true origins, at the time) was confronted by an escaped prisoner, from the [[Phantom Zone]]. He claimed that Power Girl's true identity, is Ursa, who had escaped the Zone with their help and promised to help the others escape. However, the prisoner was later revealed to be an illusion, created by the [[Psycho-Pirate]].

''Action Comics'' #845 (January 2007), which is the second part of the "Last Son" arc by [[Geoff Johns]] &amp; [[Richard Donner]], finally introduced Ursa to the ''Superman'' comic book canon. This version of her contains elements similar to the originally released version of Superman II (even though Donner is co-writing this arc) where she is in love with Zod. Zod and Ursa are the parents of [[Chris Kent (comics)|the Kryptonian boy]] that Superman and Lois Lane adopted.

In a flashback in Action Comic Annual #10 a fleshed out retelling of the story told in Superman II partly aligned her story to her movie counterpart. Lover of General Zod, and part of the Kryptonian guard, she believed that [[Non (DC comics)|Non]] and [[Jor-El]] were right about Krypton's final fate, and sought to rebel against the Council. When Non was kidnapped, lobotomized and turned into a brute with minimal intelligence and unable to speak, Zod and Ursa snapped, instigating open rebellion, while Jor-El surrendered to the Council, eventually using the Phantom Zone projector upon the trio during the trial seen in at has been the movie. Ursa stayed loyal to Zod, even in their "exile", and believing that Jor-El should have been able to save Krypton, or at least his lineage, agreed with Zod in pursuing and taking vengeance over the House of El.

Ursa appears in another flashback alongside Zod in Action Comics #866. Here, she and Zod encounter [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], who shrinks [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]. During this encounter Brainiac killed the whole unit under Ursa's command. This paralyzes her with fear, changes her into the more vindictive person she is now. She runs a Black Ops squad that has been living on earth in secret. After Zod's attack on New Krypton she seem to be unable focus on her work and goes to Zod's side. Superman and even Non, lobotomized, seem to know her pain and seems to want to comfort her at this time. She is along with Superman or Commander El and Commander Gor now the leader of the Kryptonian military.

Despite her initial, brief joy in motherhood, she still shows the brunt of her misandric belief on her son, [[Chris Kent (comics)|Lor-Zod]], who was abused on a regular basis on the account of his perceived weakness (due to his conception in the Phantom Zone, Lor ages in uncontrollable ''grow spurts'' and exhibits weaker powers than the rest of his race under a yellow sun). As a result, Ursa is now completely estranged from Lor, who arrived on Earth and was raised as [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]]—the foster son of [[Clark Kent]] and his wife [[Lois Lane]]. Chris, upon returning to Earth one more time, openly defied his own legacy, mercilessly beating Ursa to save [[Thara Ak-Var]], his current paramour. Ursa no longer considers Chris part of her family, and still resents Lois Lane for her bond with her estranged son.&lt;ref name="ac876"&gt;''Action Comics'' #876 (April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

This version has developed a weakness to bright light and wears goggles. This apparently came about as a side-effect of being imprisoned in the Phantom Zone repeatedly.

Following ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Ursa has been reintroduced in the new continuity as Zod's wife, along with their son Lor-Zod. After joining Henshaw's [[Superman Revenge Squad]] and making believe them to free his army, General Zod used the Phantom Zone projector to free them. Along with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] II, they fled to another planet, planning to create a New Krypton.&lt;ref name="ac984"&gt;''Action Comics'' #984 (July 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As a Kryptonian, Ursa derives her superhuman abilities from the yellow sun of Earth's solar system. Her basic abilities are high levels of superhuman strength, superhuman speed and superhuman stamina sufficient to bend steel in her bare hands, overpower a locomotive, outrun a speeding bullet and leap over a tall building in a single bound as well as heightened senses of hearing and sight including X-ray vision as well as telescopic and microscopic visions; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing; longevity; heat vision; powerful freezing breath; and flight. Being female, her power levels are more akin to Supergirl and Wonder Woman.

Similar to other Phantom Zone escapees, Ursa typically never experiences the full measure of her abilities as she is never given enough time to absorb and metabolite the yellow solar energy of Earth's sun before she is defeated and banished back to the Zone. As such, Ursa could prove more powerful than even Supergirl and possibly Wonder Woman as well due to her being a fully matured Kryptonian female while Supergirl is a later adolescent Kryptonian female and Wonder Woman is an Amazon. Her full strength would also make her a sufficient threat to Superman due to her combat prowess.

Beyond just her superhuman strength and experienced hand-to-hand combat skills, Ursa is a ruthless killer who will do anything immoral to achieve her ends. She is fiercely loyal to General Zod and is willing to fight and die for his loyalty. Ursa is also a radical feminist with an extreme sociopathic hatred of males with the only apparent exception being General Zod and her Phantom Zone cohorts. This sentiment seems to extend to a lesser degree to her own son, Lor-Zod, as she willingly and gleefully stood by while Zod violently and physically abused the young boy.

Like all Kryptonians, Ursa is vulnerable to [[Kryptonite]] and red solar radiation. Her virtual invulnerability does not provide protection from mind control or magic and can be overpowered and cause her to experience significant and even fatal injuries with significant force such as that of several atomic explosions or strikes from an opponent with superior strength and durability such as [[Doomsday_(comics)|Doomsday]]. Her superhuman strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and her superhuman speed is inferior to Speedsters like the Flash. Her superhuman strength is limited due to her natural limits even while within the empowering light of Sol.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Ursa appeared in the ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]] (1988 Animated series)'' episode "The Hunter," voiced by [[Ginny McSwain]]. Ursa was a criminal on the planet Krypton and was banished to the Phantom Zone for her crimes. Afterwards she and Faora assisted Zod when he sent the "hunter" to Metropolis to fight Superman.
* A very similar character named '''[[Mala (Kryptonian)|Mala]]''' appeared in three episodes of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Seemingly based on both Ursa and [[Faora]], she was played initially by [[Leslie Easterbrook]] and then by Sarah Douglas in her second and final appearance on the series.
* Ursa can be seen as one of the many Phantom Zone prisoners attacking the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]''. She is seen alongside General Zod. Drax, a character bearing a "Z" symbol similar to Superman's "S", mentions his parents throughout the episode (leading to speculation that Zod and Ursa are Drax's parents).
* In the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' season 10 episode "Dominion", a character that may have been Ursa appears as one of [[General Zod]]'s minions in the [[Phantom Zone]]. Toward the end of the episode, there is a scene that mirrors a scene in ''[[Superman II]]'', which shows Zod, [[Non (comics)|Non]] and Ursa stuck in the dimensional "glass," as it's represented, and floating off into space.

===Film===
* In the first ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film, Ursa (played by Sarah Douglas) appears alongside [[General Zod]] and [[Non (comics)|Non]] as they are being sentenced to eternal imprisonment in the [[Phantom Zone]] by Krypton's Ruling Council of Elders. The chief accuser is Superman's biological father [[Jor-El]], who declares that Ursa's "perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind have threatened even the children of the planet Krypton." Ursa, Zod, and Non are imprisoned in the Phantom Zone where they should remain for all eternity and are not heard from again in the first film. Once in the Phantom Zone, she desperately screams, "Forgive me!" repeatedly.

* In the theatrical version of ''[[Superman II]]'', Ursa, Zod, and Non are freed from the Phantom Zone when a [[hydrogen bomb]] thrown into space by Superman detonates near the Zone, shattering it. The three villains encounter a group of astronauts on Earth's moon. She meets an astronaut, asking him what sort of a creature he is. When he replies that he is a man, Ursa tries to tear the International Space Exploration emblem off his spacesuit. The astronaut attempts to get away, but Ursa flies around and cuts him off. She then rips the emblem off his suit, decompressing it and killing him. A pleased Ursa then sends him into space with a swift kick to his rear. Following the Lunar confrontation, Ursa and the villains make their way to Earth, which they believe is called "Houston", and proceed to lay waste to the small town of East Houston, Idaho. From there, they move to the White House, where the [[President of the United States]] (played by [[E.G. Marshall]]) is forced to kneel before Zod. When Ursa, Zod, and Non finally meet Superman, an epic battle sequence takes place in the streets of Metropolis, which ends when Ursa and Non throw a bus onto Superman and he flees the scene. Lex Luthor then tells the villains he knows where Superman has gone and suggests taking [[Lois Lane]] along because of her relationship with Superman. The villains are led to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] in the Arctic, where Ursa and Non threaten to tear Lois Lane in two if Superman does not kneel to General Zod. Superman attempts to trick the villains into a molecule chamber that will take away their powers but ends up being forced into it himself by Zod. However, Superman has actually tricked the villains: he reversed the effects of the molecule chamber so that its red sun radiation is beamed throughout the fortress while Superman remains protected inside the chamber. The villains are stripped of their powers and Ursa is last seen when Lois punches her, knocking her into a crevasse in the Fortress where she disappears into the mist. In extended versions of the film that have screened on television, Ursa has a slightly expanded role. She is seen ripping a badge off a military officer's uniform at the White House while remarking how peculiar it is that men wear ribbons and jewelry on this planet. She easily manages to defeat one man in a game of [[arm wrestling]], knocking him unconscious, and when another of the men challenges her, [[General Zod]] throws him through the wall into the street. In one deleted scene, a boy in East Houston attempts to escape and get help, but Non rips the light from the top of a police car and throws it like an artillery round, killing the boy and his horse in the distance. A horrified woman remarks "He was only a boy!" to which, with obvious pleasure, Ursa replies, "Who will never become a man!" Also, in some extended versions, a powerless Ursa, Zod, and Non are seen being led into Arctic Police vehicles following the final confrontation at the Fortress. The theatrical version suggests that they are dead, as they are all seen falling into crevices inside the Fortress from which they never come out.

* In ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' (a retooled 2006 version of the film as conceived by its original director, [[Richard Donner]]), Zod, Ursa and Non are released from their imprisonment when Superman redirects a nuclear missile headed for [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], [[New Jersey]] into space. The resulting explosion destroys the Phantom Zone, freeing the criminals. At the end of the film, Superman uses a time warp to reverse all the damage Zod, Ursa, and Non had done to Earth, as well as re-imprisoning them back into the [[Phantom Zone]], as Superman is totally against capital punishment under any circumstance. Unlike the slightly more campy portrayals in the [[Richard Lester]] cut of the film, the villains, including Ursa, in this version are portrayed as far more serious and menacing.

===Video games===
* Ursa appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game, voiced by Adrienne Mishler.
* Ursa appears as a support card in the mobile version of [[Injustice: Gods Among Us]].
* In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Ursa makes a cameo appearance in Sub-Zero's character ending where she, Non, and General Zod are shown to have joined forces with the One Earth Regime's Superman who had been imprisoned in the Phantom Zone after the defeat of Brainiac. The Kryptonian villains and Superman manage to escape when Batman's Justice League accidentally create a portal to the Phantom Zone while trying to create a portal to Earthrealm for Sub-Zero. Sub-Zero feeling responsible for their escape joins forces with Batman's Justice League. In the ending, Ursa and Non are shown fighting with Batman while Supergirl clashes with General Zod, and Sub-Zero faces Superman. Additionally Supergirl also has two alternate color palettes called ''Fury of Ursa'' in reference to her.

In 1997, Jih's parents returned to their home to further their career.

Jih currently resides in [[Los Angeles]], California.

On October 20, 2013 Victor participated in The Amazing Los Angeles Race Disneyland edition.

==''The Amazing Race''==
Victor and his sister, Tammy, were selected for the race after she had pushed for them to apply, although he had been the longer fan of the show. According to Victor, the siblings had led a very structured life growing up. Their parents taught them to do everything to the best of their ability and to obey all rules in an orderly manner. As a result, the siblings studied hard at school, obtained good grades, and graduated from the world's top universities with law degrees. Even after graduation, they took no break and immediately ventured into the workforce. It was because of such a structured upbringing and the fact that both of them had not taken any major risks in life that made them decide to apply for the show. They wanted to step outside of their normal routine as lawyers and take an adventure of a lifetime. After twelve grueling legs spanning 40,000 miles, they were declared the winners of the ''race'' after narrowly avoiding elimination during the third leg in Romania. As a result, they made history by becoming the first [[Asian-American]] team to win the competition. Jih has written blogs and commentaries for further seasons of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20421422,00.html |title=Victor Jih Blogs About The Amazing Race - The Amazing Race |publisher=People.com |date=2010-02-13 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer for the Chinese language newspaper, [[World Journal]], based in [[North America]], praised the team as "Glory of Taiwan", "famous product of Taiwan" 台灣之光 台灣名產 for representing [[Taiwanese Americans]] in the media spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;http://la.worldjournal.com/view/full_la/2651910/article-台灣之光-台灣名產?&lt;/ref&gt; They were portrayed as humble, gracious and  friendly, but also extremely competitive.

As three legs of the second half of the race were spent in [[China]], where the siblings could speak the local language, a blogger for the Chicago Sun Times and many detractors questioned whether the team had an unfair advantage. Both of them disagreed and Victor explained that every team brings to the game different skills and strengths, and their ability to speak Mandarin balances out against other teams' advantages e.g. choreography, athleticism, swimming, physical strength, life experiences, et cetera. They explained how their mother would fight with them to get them to attend Chinese school and force them to speak the language at home. Both were extremely thankful for their parents' good intentions and not giving up on them when they were young. In previous seasons of the race, there were also teams that spoke the local language of the countries they visited.

==Career==
Jih was a partner at the Century City office of [[O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP]], specializing in entertainment and media litigation until May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omm.com/victorjih/ |title=O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP &amp;#124; Professionals &amp;#124; Victor Jih |publisher=Omm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, he is a partner at the Los Angeles office of [[Irell &amp; Manella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irell.com/professionals-Victor-Jih.html |title=Victor Jih: Irell &amp; Manella LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13965">The '''Wakefield''' or '''Towneley Mystery Plays''' are a series of thirty-two [[mystery play]]s based on the [[Bible]] most likely performed around the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Feast of Corpus Christi]] probably in the town of [[Wakefield]], England during the late [[Middle Ages]] until 1576.  It is one of only four surviving English mystery play cycles. Some scholars argue that the Wakefield cycle is not a cycle at all, but a mid-sixteenth-century compilation, formed by a scribe bringing together three separate groups of plays.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Introduction to Early English Theatre, Janette Dillon (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique [[manuscript]], now housed at the [[Huntington Library]], San Marino, [[California]], originated in the mid-fifteenth century.  The [[Towneley (family)|Towneley family]] who lent their name to the manuscript, sold it at an auction in 1814, but it was probably part of their library at a much earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;The Tudor Origins of Mediaeval Drama, Theresa Coletti and Gail McNurray Gibson, Chapter 14, A Companion to Tudor Literature, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Although almost the entire manuscript is in a fifteenth-century hand, the cycle was performed as early as the fourteenth century in an earlier form.

The Wakefield Cycle is most renowned for the inclusion of ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'', one of the jewels of [[medieval theatre]].

Theatre Royal Wakefield, (formerly Wakefield Theatre Royal &amp; Opera House) produced a modern-day version of the plays in Wakefield Cathedral with a young community cast from 11–20 August 2016

==Authorship==

The cycle is the work of many authors, some sourced from the [[York Mystery Plays|York Cycle]]. However, the most significant contribution has been attributed to an anonymous author known as the "Wakefield Master." It is believed that his additions include ''Noah, The First Shepherds' Play, The Second Shepherds' Play, Herod the Great and The Buffeting of Christ.'' This common authorship is suspected due to a unique thirteen-line rhymed stanza, which is evident in all five texts.&lt;ref&gt;The Broadview Anthology of Medieval Drama, Fitzgerald (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Wakefield Master" emerged from a need to distinguish some material in the Towneley manuscript from a mass of unexceptional material, and was first coined by [[Charles Mills Gayley]]. In 1903, Gayley and Alwin Thaler published an anthology of criticism and dramatic selections entitled ''Representative English Comedies''.  It had long been believed that the Towneley Play was a mediocre work that showed extensive borrowing from other sources but containing vibrant and exciting material, apparently by one author, who was responsible for four or five complete pageants and extensive revisions.  Gayley refers to this person as the "master" (with a lowercase ''m'') in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Representative English comedies with introductory essays and notes, an historical view of our earlier comedy, and other monographs by various writers, Charles Mills Gayley&lt;/ref&gt;  Then in a 1907 article, Gayley emended this to "The Wakefield Master," the name which is still frequently used.

Within the Broadview Anthology of Medieval Drama, Christina M. Fitzgerald and John T. Sebastian find it important to note, "the quotation marks placed around the name 'Wakefield Master' are thus to be taken to indicate that the ascription of authorship is the product of convention, rather than proven fact. All that can be said with confidence is that there seems clearly to have been a common force involved in the shaping of all five of these plays.&lt;ref&gt;The Broadview Anthology of Medieval Drama, Fitzgerald (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;"

The most obvious of these characteristics is that several of the pageants use a distinctive stanza, sometimes called the Wakefield Stanza (see below). The pageants that manifest the Wakefield Stanza are noted for comedy, social satire, and intense psychological realism.  These qualities also show up throughout the Towneley Cycle, most often where it seems to depart from its presumed sources.

Some question the existence of one "Wakefield Master", and propose that multiple authors could have written in the Wakefield Stanza. Barbara Palmer suggests that the story of the Wakefield Master and the suggestion that the Second Shepherd's Play was performed as part of the Wakefield Cycle were both inventions of an amateur historian named J. M. W. Walker. However, scholars and literary critics find it useful to hypothesize a single talent behind them, due to the unique poetic qualities of the works ascribed to him.&lt;ref&gt;“Recycling ‘The Wakefield Cycle’,” Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama" (vol 41) 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staging==
There is widespread disagreement among scholars concerning the staging of the Wakefield Cycle, and of mystery plays in general.  It is known that the cycle at York was staged on wagons that moved from place to place in the city, with multiple plays staged simultaneously in different locales in the city.  However, there is disagreement as to whether the Wakefield plays were performed in a similar manner.

One problem is the population of Wakefield in 1377, which is approximately the date of the first performance of the plays. It consisted of 567 people aged sixteen or older. Assuming that half were male, that leaves only about 280 men to play the 243 roles in the plays. This leaves many to believe that multiple plays were performed by the same cast during most of the lifetime of the cycle.

Another way in which the Wakefield cycle differed in its staging from other cycles is that lack of association with the guilds.  In other towns York and [[Coventry]] certain plays were staged by different guilds, according to their specialty (such as the shipwrights staging the [[Noah]] play).  Although the names of four guilds are found on the manuscript (the [[Tanning (leather)|barkers]], glovers, litsters, and fishers), they are found in a later hand than most of the manuscript.  This has led some to believe that for its entire lifetime, the Wakefield Cycle was sponsored and produced by other associations, either governmental or religious.  Either way, it was surely performed by non-professional actors from the community, as were all the cycles.

==Wakefield Stanza==
The most notable poetic innovation in the manuscript is called the Wakefield Stanza, which is found in the Noah play, the two shepherds' plays, the Herod play, and the Buffeting of Christ pageant. This unique characteristic may be described as:

a nine-line stanza containing one quatrain with internal rhyme and a tail-rhymed cauda, rhyming AAAABCCCB; or, a thirteen-line stanza containing a cross-rhymed octet frons, a tercet cauda with tail-rhymes, the whole rhyming ABABABABCDDDC.

The former description was based upon the earliest editions of the play that reflected the space-saving habits of the medieval scribe, who often wrote two verse-lines on a single manuscript line.  Thus, depending upon how one interprets the manuscript, a stanza (from the Noah pageant) might appear in either of the following forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The thryd tyme wille I prufe what depnes we bere
:Now long shalle thou hufe, lay in thy lyne there.
:I may towch with my hufe the grownd evyn here.
:Then begynnys to grufe to us mery chere;
::Bot, husband,
:::What grownd may this be?
:::The hyllys of Armonye.
:::Now blissid be he
::That thus for us can ordand.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The thryd tyme wille I prufe
:what depnes we bere
:Now long shalle thou hufe,
:lay in thy lyne there.
:I may towch with my hufe
:the grownd evyn here.
:Then begynnys to grufe
:to us mery chere;
::Bot, husband,
:::What grownd may this be?
:::The hyllys of Armonye.
:::Now blissid be he
::That thus for us can ordand.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(All the punctuation and indentations are editorial and not part of the original manuscript.)

In the first case above, the first four lines contain internal [[rhyme]] (i.e., "prufe," "hufe," "hufe," and "grufe"); but the second example arranges the same verses in shorter lines, which in the manuscript are separated from one another by apparently random use of the obelus (÷), virgules [/], double-virgules[//], and line-breaks.  In the second example, it is readily seen that the poet uses a cross-rhymed octet frons with a five-line tail-rhymed cauda.  It is this innovative use of the cauda that is most distinctive in the stanza.

There is some disagreement over whether the Wakefield Stanza is nine or thirteen lines long. Owing largely to [[Arthur Clare Cawley|A.C.Cawley]]'s 1957 edition of five of the pageants, and to others' arrangement of the manuscript lines, this is sometimes thought to be a nine-line stanza, with the quatrain containing internal rhyme.  This view predominated in the critical literature until the late twentieth century, and has fallen out of favor.  When Cawley himself edited the entire cycle with Martin Stevens for publication in 1994, the two opted to present the lines as a thirteen-line stanza.  In any case, the number of syllables in the lines is variable, and the number of stressed syllables can usually be counted at two or three per line in the thirteen-line version.

Since the Towneley Play was a drama and therefore spoken rather than read silently, to some degree this presentation of the poetic units in graphical form is somewhat arbitrary and inconsequential.  But it does provide insights into the poetic influences and innovations of the Wakefield Master.

==Protestant alterations==

In 1576, the Wakefield plays were altered by the [[Protestant]] authorities, before being discontinued completely. "In that year, the Diocesan Court of High Commission at York revealed their attitude to the citizens of Wakefield in no uncertain terms. Permission was granted for the performance of their Cycle provided that:

'In the said play no pageant be used or set further wherein the Ma(jest) ye of God the Father, God the Sonne, or God the Holie Goste or the administration of either the Sacrementes of baptism or of the Lordes Supper be counterfeited or represented, or anything plaid which tend to the maintenance of superstition and idolatry or which be contrary to the laws of God or of the realm.'" (Kyng Johan, Lines 413-15)&lt;ref&gt;Early English Stages 1300 to 1660, Volume One 1300 to 1576, Glynne Wickham (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Such strictures are a Protestant form of the [[aniconism in Judaism]], the forbidding of any depiction of God or other supernatural beings, such as angels or demons.&lt;ref name="Herzfeld"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herzfeld|first1=Garson|title=In Praise of Art|url=http://www.jewishpresstampa.com/news/2016-02-26/Rabbinically_Speaking|website=Jewish Press|publisher=Jewish Press Group of Tampa Bay, Inc.|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, alterations were sometimes made in the scripts to reflect Reformed doctrine.  For example, the play involving [[John the Baptist]] was altered to conform to Protestant doctrines about the [[sacraments]].  The word "[[pope]]" was excised from "Herod the Great," and twelve leaves are completely missing, which scholars suspect contained plays about the death, [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], and coronation as Queen of Heaven of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].

==Sources of the plays==
The majority of the plays that make up the Wakefield Cycle are based (some rather tenuously) on the [[Bible]], while the others are taken from either [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or [[folklore|folk]] tradition.

==Appearance in popular culture==
When the Andrew Lloyd Webber–Tim Rice musical ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' was in its infancy in 1972, it was so short that productions needed an added preamble to create a valid showpiece. [[Frank Dunlop (director)|Frank Dunlop]], in the first British theatrical performances of the musical on stage, preceded his [[Young Vic]] productions of ''Joseph'' with his own adaptation of the first six Wakefield Mystery Plays, which were credited in the programme. The entire production was a double bill called ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat#American and Young Vic performances|Bible One: Two Looks at the Book of Genesis]]''. Part I, entitled ''The Creation to Jacob'' (or ''Mediaevel Mystery Plays''), was Dunlop's reworking of the first six Wakefield plays, with music by Alan Doggett. Part II was ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Vocal Selections: Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat | publisher = Hal Leonard | year =1994 | location =Milwaukee, WI| isbn =0-7935-3427-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the Regular and Open categories, it consists of three different age groups: Elementary, [[junior high school|Junior High]] and [[senior high school|Senior High]]. Participants below the age of 13 are considered as Elementary, participants from ages 13 until 16 years old are considered Junior High and participants between 17–19 are considered Senior High. Participants can also compete outside their age group, but they must be younger than the specified age range and must partner up with someone in that age range. For example, a 12-year-old participant can join the Junior High sub-category only if teamed up with someone between 14 and 16.

==History==

WRO was formally established in 2003, with the first international WRO final being organized in 2004. Organizations from China, Japan, Singapore and Korea are considered the founding countries. In 2004 teams from China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Russia, Singapore and Thailand took part in the first international final, held in Singapore.

In 2003 the four founding countries established the international WRO Committee (now known as the WRO Advisory Council), which decided to establish a new and permanent robotics organisation, based on the idea that students from all over the world should have the opportunity to meet with other students to fulfil the new mission statement:

"To bring together young people all over the world to develop their creativity, design &amp; problem solving skills through challenging &amp; educational robot competitions and activities"

The WRO Committee decided on the new name World Robot Olympiad, and new WRO logos were developed.

Finally the WRO Statutes and a set of General Rules were worked out to ensure a sound and safe future for WRO. One of the major decisions, which appears in the Statutes, was that the international WRO event should be hosted by a new country each year and the WRO Committee should elect a chairman.

In 2017, the host country of WRO was Costa Rica. This was the first time the competition was held outside the Asia Region and the first time it came to the Americas.

== WRO Categories ==
{{advertisement|date=June 2018}}
At WRO, challenging competitions are offered for everyone in the age from 6 – 25. WRO have four competition categories, with their own characteristics and challenges:
* Regular Category
* Open Category
* WRO Football
* Advanced Robotics Challenge
Each season the challenges and theme for the Regular and Open Category are developed with the country that hosts the International Final. The WRO Football rules and the Advanced Robotics Challenge game are designed together with experts in the robotic sciences community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wro-association.org/competition/overview/|title=Overview|date=July 22, 2017|work=World Robot Olympiad Association|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WRO2012 Spielfeld Junior.jpg|thumb|The Game Table of the WRO2012 Junior High division.]]
Teams must create a robot which can complete a specified mission determined by the organiser and usually based on the Open Category theme. Before the competition begins, the robot must be fully dismantled: for example, the batteries must be taken out of the brick or the tyres must be taken out from the wheels. It must be built in a specified time (150 minutes) before the first qualification round begins. If a team finishes building their robot before the 150 minutes finish, the team can practice on the competition fields. Each robot is restricted to be {{convert|25|xx|25|xx|25|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} before the round begins, and may consist of only LEGO certified parts, with specified motors and sensors depending on each competition. It must finish the mission autonomously, within a maximum time of two minutes.  Teams are judged on their scores. If two teams' scores are equal, they are judged by their time to the nearest millisecond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wro-association.org/competition/regular-category/|title=Regular Category|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2017|work=World Robot Olympiad Association|access-date=2017-11-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced Robot Challenge (University/College) ===
The Advanced Robotics Challenge (ARC) is the newest category. The games are designed to test older and more experienced student's engineering and programming skills to the limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wro-association.org/competition/advanced-robotics-challenge/|title=Advanced Robotics Challenge|date=July 22, 2017|work=World Robot Olympiad Association|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams compete on a set challenge. Robots may be pre-built and may use certain TETRIX and MATRIX elements. Teams may use either one MyRIO or KNR controller, or two EV3/NXT controllers; there are no restrictions on choice and number of sensors, motors and servos. The size of the robot before it begins must be within {{convert|45|xx|45|xx|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The maximum time differs depending on each competition.

In 2015 and 2016 it ran a Bowling game and in the 2017 season it was introduced the Tetrastack challenge.

==== Advanced Robotics Challenge characteristics ====
* '''One age group:''' 17–25 years old.
* '''Hardware:''' Robots must be built using MATRIX and TETRIX® building systems only. There are no restrictions about the use and brand of sensors, batteries or electrical motors and servos.
* '''Controllers:''' Only National Instruments™ myRIO or KNR (myRIO based). Note: 2017 is the last year that LEGO® EV3 controllers can be used.
* '''Software:''' Control software must be written in LabVIEW from National Instruments™ or any text-based language like C, C++, C#, RobotC, Java or Python.
* '''Maximum robot size:''' 45&amp;nbsp;cm x 45&amp;nbsp;cm x 45&amp;nbsp;cm.
* '''Team:''' A team consists of 1 coach and 2 or 3 team members.

==Changes to the Gameplay==
As the missions of the Regular, WRO Football and College Category get tougher and more teams in the Open Category are willing to present more creative-looking robots, organisers have to make changes to the list of eligible sensors, motors and bricks to be used in the competition. Initially only RCX bricks, motors and sensors were allowed. In the 2007 competition NXT bricks, motors and sensors were allowed as well. In 2011  the NXT colour sensor was added; in 2012, the HiTechnic colour sensor. In 2013 an EV3 robot was exhibited that used all four motors. In 2014, however, EV3 bricks, motors and sensors were allowed, but the number of motor ports was limited to three, and the EV3 Gyro sensor was not allowed. The 2015 competition allowed four motor ports and the gyro sensor, but not RCX bricks, motors, or sensors.

There are also a few changes to the number of categories. The earlier versions of this competition, before 2006, consists of only Regular and Open and that further sub-divides to only two age groups, Primary and High School.

== Age Group Definitions ==

=== Compete with peers ===
WRO have the ambition of being relevant to students of different ages. That is why it is offer competitions on platforms that provide fun and challenging experiences.

It is also why it have decided two of the categories into three age groups. In the Regular Category, each age group has a different mission. In the Open Category, the challenge is the same for all participants, but they are judged within their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wro-association.org/competition/regulations/|title=Regulations|date=August 16, 2017|work=World Robot Olympiad Association|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Please note:'''''

''The mentioned ages reflect the age of the participant in the year of the competition, '''not''' at the competition day. For participation in the international WRO final it is strictly enforced that students cannot, at any time in the year of the competition, be older than specified in the age group definitions. Example: A participant that is still 12 years old at the time of the international WRO final in November, but turns 13 years old in December the same year cannot participate in Elementary Category.''

== Table of Eligibility (TOE) ==

=== Qualification for the international final ===
Only teams that participated in a national competition in one of our member countries can qualify for the international final. The WRO Table of Eligibility (TOE) defines how many teams a WRO National Organizer can register for the international final.
* The number of teams a National Organizer may send to the international final depends on the number of teams in the national competition.
* Each competition category has its own TOE. 
* A country has to have minimum 5 teams in a competition category to register teams for the international WRO final for that category.
* A team may participate in only one competition; Regular Category, Open Category, WRO Football or Advanced Robotics Challenge.
* Any student may participate in one team only.
* The numbers in the tables are maximum per age group and category and cannot be transferred from one age group or category to another. National Organizers may register fewer teams than allowed, but never more. 
* In Regular category, if a country does not compete in a certain age group, it is not allowed to swap teams around. (For example: If you have 5–99 teams and you don't compete in Senior age group, it is not allowed to bring 1 Elementary and 2 Junior teams.)

'''''World Wide What?''''' is a 2015 British film written, directed and filmed by Adam Townsend and Andy Trace of Cavalier, and produced by Poppy Gaye of [[Founders Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/18/founders-forum-just-posted-this-video-of-huge-entrepreneurs-and-its-hilarious/ |title=Founders Forum Just Posted This Video Of Huge Entrepreneurs And It’s Hilarious |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2015-06-18 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film shows a parallel universe in which [[Tim Berners-Lee]] failed to invent the [[World Wide Web]] and the subsequent impact that would have on the lives of high-profile tech entrepreneurs. The film is narrated by [[Stephen Fry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/06/19/tech-entrepreneurs-stephen-fry-founders-forum-no-internet_n_7620138.html |title=Stephen Fry-Narrated Video Shows World's Biggest Tech Entrepreneurs If The Internet Hadn't Been Invented |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2015-06-19 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes cameos from [[Jimmy Wales]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Sean Parker]], [[Tim Berners-Lee]], [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Michael Bloomberg]], [[Michael Acton Smith]], [[Martha Lane Fox, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho]], [[Brent Hoberman]], and [[Steve Case]].

==Plot==
The film begins in 1989 at the offices of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known as [[CERN]], where [[Tim Berners Lee]] is working on his aspirations for the [[World Wide Web]]. He reflects to himself in private that this project could go on to promote "world peace" and also help people "share pictures of kittens". Upon leaving his office, [[Stephen Fry]] describes how a short-sighted assistant could have changed the course of humanity if she had accidentally put [[Tim Berners Lee]]'s research in a waste paper basket. The film then goes on to depict a succession of sketches played out by global tech entrepreneurs in which they are forced to carry out analogue versions of their digital jobs. In order of appearance:

* [[Arianna Huffington]] is a newspaper girl, throwing paper copies of the [[Huffington Post]] onto doorsteps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/18/arianna-world-without-internet_n_7617946.html |title=Arianna In A World Without The Internet |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-06-18 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sean Parker]] is unable to keep himself occupied with [[Napster]] and creates his own [[selfie]] empire of polaroids instead
* [[Steve Case]] is a postman delivering huge numbers of [[Advertising mail|junk mail]] to people whilst repeatedly stating [[You've got mail]], a phrase synonymous with [[AOL]]
* [[Venture Capitalist]] [[Danny Rimer]] is left creating his own infomercials instead of investing in [[startup company]] [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]
* [[Bebo]] founder [[Michael Birch (businessman)|Michael Birch]] desperately tries to release funds from [[mafia]] bank owner [[Max Levchin]], famous for founding [[PayPal]]
* [[Skype]] founder [[Niklas Zennström]], as an expert in communications is asked to crack the [[Enigma Machine]]
* [[Martha Lane Fox, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho]] visits the man who helped her float [[lastminute.com]] to try and book a holiday
* [[Brent Hoberman]] is a holiday sales agent, desperately trying to sell a holiday
* [[Reid Hoffman]] is a secretary using a [[Rolodex]] to categorise the entire world
* [[Michael Acton Smith]] is a street vendor selling [[Moshi Monsters]] toys
* [[Fon (company)|Fon]] founder [[Martín Varsavsky]] is a nuisance caller asking people if they want a new deal on their 'fon'
* [[Jonathan Goodwin (entrepreneur)]] is a hunter looking for a [[Unicorn (finance)]]
* [[Candy Crush]] and [[King (company)|King]] founder Ricardo Zucconi is selling sweets in a sweet shop
* [[Michael Bloomberg]] is still working at [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], but as a journalist working on the latest edition of his paper
* [[Jimmy Wales]] stays true to the principles of [[Wikipedia]] whilst working as a [[librarian]], encouraging people to make edits to books

The film then returns to [[CERN]] to find [[Tim Berners Lee]] desperately looking for his research for creating the [[World Wide Web]]. As he becomes more and more distressed, his assistant walks through the door holding the papers stating that she had read them overnight. When [[Tim Berners Lee]] asks her if she thinks the research stands a chance in working, she ponders "50/50", much to his disappointment.

==Production==
The film was funded by [[YouTube]] and [[King (company)|King]], with [[Jimmy Wales]] as [[executive producer]]. The script was written by filmmaker Adam Townsend of Cavalier, at the time with [[Freud Communications]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pixelvulture.com/2015/06/stephen-fry-contemplates-the-world-without-the-internet/ |title=Stephen Fry Contemplates the World without the Internet |publisher=PixelVulture |date= |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the initial concept was developed by [[Jimmy Wales]] and Founders Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Liat |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-06/19/founders-forum-comedy-video |title=Watch the world's biggest entrepreneurs live an internet-free dystopia (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=2015-06-19 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes were filmed in [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Suffolk]]. The scenes that took place in America were directed by Declan Masterson.
