Honduran President [[Manuel Zelaya]] planned to hold a poll on a [[referendum]] on a [[constituent assembly]] to [[Honduran fourth ballot box referendum|change the constitution]]. A majority of the government, including the [[Supreme Court of Honduras|Supreme Court]] and prominent members of Zelaya’s own party, saw these plans as unconstitutional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8124154.stm

|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the constitutional process for dealing with this situation was unclear; there were no clear procedures for removing or prosecuting a sitting president. The crisis culminated in the removal and exile of Honduran president [[Manuel Zelaya]] by the [[Military of Honduras|Honduran military]] in a [[coup d’état]].

On the morning of 28 June 2009, approximately 100 soldiers stormed the president’s residence in [[Tegucigalpa]] and put him on a plane to [[San José, Costa Rica]]. Zelaya immediately called this a  “[[coup d'état|coup]]” upon his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8123126.stm "Honduran leader forced into exile"], BBC, 28 June 2009;&lt;br /&gt;One hundred soldiers: [http://www.alternet.org/world/141026/honduran_leader's_populism_is_what_provoked_military_violence/?page=entire "Honduran Leader's Populism is what Provoked Military Violence"], Benjamin Dangl, Alternet, 1 July 2009.&lt;br /&gt; Ten guards: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/honduras/5677026/Honduras-supreme-court-ordered-army-coup.html "Honduras supreme court 'ordered arm coup'"] Telegraph, 28 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later that day, the [[National Congress of Honduras|National Congress]] voted to remove Zelaya from office, having read without objection a purported letter of resignation. Zelaya said the letter was forged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Honduran Congress names provisional president| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/06/28/honduras.president.arrested/index.html | agency= CNN| date=28 June 2009| accessdate=1 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091226045834/http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/06/28/honduras.president.arrested/index.html| archivedate= 26 December 2009| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Micheletti]], the President of Congress and next in the presidential line of succession, was sworn in as interim president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/sports/soccer/22spaingame.html |title=Spain 2, Honduras 0 - Spain Impresses, but Still Has Work To Do |first=Jeré | last=Longman |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 June 2010 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/28/AR2009062800635.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Honduran Military Ousts President | first1=William | last1=Booth | first2=Juan | last2=Forero | date=29 June 2009| accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared a “state of exception” suspending civil liberties on 1 July&lt;ref name="laura_carlsen" &gt;[http://www.alternet.org/world/141097/high_noon_in_honduras/?page=entire "High noon in Honduras"], Laura Carlsen, Alternet, 4 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-2009-06-28"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8123126.stm|title= Honduran leader forced into exile|date=28 June 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090629193824/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8123126.stm| archivedate= 29 June 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various curfews were imposed, some nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2009/06/29/actualidad/1246226402_850215.html El nuevo presidente de Honduras decreta el toque de queda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/mundo/honduras-suspende-el-toque-de-queda-1276364711/ Honduras suspende el toque de queda]&lt;/ref&gt;

==State of emergency==

On 21 September 2009, Zelaya returned in secret to Honduras, after several attempts to return had been rebuffed. It was announced that he was in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8267775.stm |title=Ousted leader returns to Honduras |publisher=BBC News |date=21 September 2009|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the  Micheletti government declared a state of emergency and suspended five [[Constitution of Honduras|constitutional rights]] for 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Redacción BBC Mundo |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2009/09/090927_2313_honduras_oea_expulsa_rb.shtml |title=Honduras: estado de sitio durante 45 días |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically:

==Reaction==

[[International reaction to the 2009 Honduran crisis|These events]] garnered widespread condemnation as a coup d’état.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/world/americas/29venez.html|title=Rare Hemisphere Unity in Assailing Honduran Coup |work=The New York Times|date=28 June 2009|accessdate=29 June 2009| first=Simon | last=Romero}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS),&lt;ref name="WB-2009-06-29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=44074 |title=OAS condemns Honduras coup, demands return of Zelaya |last=Reuters |date=29 June 2009 |publisher=World Bulletin |accessdate=29 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702162722/http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=44074 |archivedate=2 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union]] condemned the removal of Zelaya as a military coup, and some of these condemnations may still remain unretracted.

==Background==

===Political and socioeconomic divide in Honduras===
Two-thirds of Honduras citizens live below the [[poverty]] line, and [[unemployment]] is estimated at 28%.&lt;ref name = "businessweek"/&gt; It has one of [[Latin America]]’s most unequal [[distribution of wealth]]: the poorest 10% of the [[population]] receives just 1.2% of the country’s wealth, while the richest 10% collect 42%.&lt;ref name = "businessweek"&gt;{{cite web

Zelaya pushed for a referendum, insisting that Honduras’ grinding poverty stemmed from a constitution written in 1982 at the height of that country’s brutal repression of leftists – that rigs the game for the most powerful families and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1907600,00.html | title = The Honduran Coup: How Should the U.S. Respond? |date =29 June 2009| publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author= Tim Padgett |accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zelaya supporters, largely from labour unions and the poor, claim conservative business leaders are actually concerned because Zelaya had sharply increased the [[minimum wage]]. Víctor Meza, formerly Zelaya’s interior minister, stated that:  “The impression that stuck with the traditional political class and with the most conservative business leaders of the country was that Zelaya had taken a dangerous turn to the left, and therefore that their interests were in jeopardy.” “We underestimated the conservatism of the Honduran political class and the military leadership.”&lt;ref name="NYT_businesselite_incharge"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/08/06/world/AP-LT-Honduras-Coup-Elite-Backlash.html |title=Honduran Coup Shows Business Elite Still in Charge |date=6 August 2009 |publisher=New York Times |author=Morgan Lee |author2=Alexandra Olson |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=9 August 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Donaghy of Caritas has said that the real conflict in Honduras is between the poor and wealthy: “It’s a system that has kept the poor down for years.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

To the working-class, it appeared Zelaya was ousted because the elite felt threatened by his efforts to improve their lives – most notably with a 60% increase in the [[minimum wage]] to about US$9.60 a day from about $6 a day. Some who protested in support of Zelaya had never voted for him.&lt;ref name="NYT_2009_08_08"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/world/americas/09honduras.html?pagewanted=1 | title = President's Ouster Highlights a Divide in Honduras |  first = Ginger | last = Thompson | date = 8 August 2009|  publisher = New York Times |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliance with ALBA===
[[File:Hugo Chavez in Brazil-1861.jpeg|thumb|[[Hugo Chávez]]]]
On 22 July 2008, Zelaya announced plans to incorporate the country into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the People of Our America]] (ALBA), an organisation founded by [[Hugo Chávez]], and that the country had been an “observer member” for “four or more months”.&lt;ref name=cidobzelaya&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/honduras/manuel_zelaya_rosales |title=Manuel Zelaya Rosales |publisher=Centro de Estudios Internacionales de Barcelona |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m39rQZhP?url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/honduras/manuel_zelaya_rosales |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press, citing Manuel Orozco of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]], said his “campaign for changing the constitution has energized his support base of labour groups, farmers and civil organisations who have long felt marginalized in a country where a wealthy elite controls the media and much of politics.”{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Honduran right opposed the ALBA alliance, and feared that Zelaya would move to eliminate the presidential [[term limit]] as other ALBA leaders had, whom they considered would-be dictators. According to National Party analyst Raúl Pineda Alvarado, Zelaya’s attempt to modify the constitution was a “carbon copy” of what had happened in Venezuela, Ecuador and Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Pa%C3%ADs/Ediciones/2009/06/19/Noticias/Cuarta-urna-una-idea-reciclada-de-Venezuela |title=Cuarta urna, una idea reciclada de Venezuela |publisher=El Heraldo |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m30GyLem?url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Pa%C3%ADs/Ediciones/2009/06/19/Noticias/Cuarta-urna-una-idea-reciclada-de-Venezuela |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all |access-date=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US Republican Newt Gingrich wrote in the Washington Examiner that Chávez had used ALBA to create “a tide of incipient dictatorship” flowing out of Venezuela into other countries in Latin America. He noted that Chávez had subverted democracy in Venezuela to ensure his rule would be uncontested for decades, and “one-by-one, each of the members of ALBA have followed Chavez’s lead and changed their constitutions to remove limits on the number of terms their presidents can serve.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/An-undemocratic-tide-in-the-Americas-8292299.html |title=An undemocratic tide in the Americas |publisher=Washington Examiner |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m3AWMFTL?url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/An-undemocratic-tide-in-the-Americas-8292299.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all |access-date=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the notion of extending term limits in Latin America is not unique to ALBA countries, as efforts in Colombia have been made towards allowing President [[Álvaro Uribe]] seek re-election.&lt;ref name="reutersUribeReelection"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60B5LX20100112|title=Colombia ruling backs Uribe reelection bid|publisher=Reuters|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=13 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100122120252/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60B5LX20100112| archivedate= 22 January 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional assembly plans==
{{Main article|Honduran fourth ballot box referendum}}

As early as August 2006, ''Central America Report'' stated that “liberal sectors” were proposing to reform “obsolete articles” in the constitution, including one against presidential re-election. The ''Report'' said that this was causing controversy.&lt;ref name="UCSD_constreform2006"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/collections/about/collections-of-distinction/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html | title=Latin American election statistics | at=2006: Central America report, 4 August 2006 | publisher=[[Geisel Library|University of California, San Diego Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate regarding the convening of a [[constituent assembly]] took place in Honduras, with support from many groups. "The constitution has since 1980 been tweaked in other areas around thirty times, to the point where politicians of all camps are convinced that the document is no longer adequate. This is where the formal change proposed by Manuel Zelaya comes in: that in the November 2009 election-round, the voters will be presented with four ballot-boxes – the fourth one being used for a referendum on the question: “Do you agree with convening a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution?”

On 11 November 2008, President Zelaya announced a non-binding referendum to see if the people wanted to have a [[Honduran fourth ballot box referendum|fourth ballot box]] (or “Cuarta Urna”) during the November 2009 election. The fourth ballot would ask voters whether they wanted to hold a National Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution.  Zelaya, whose presidential term was to expire on 27 January 2010, would be ineligible, under the term-limitations of the present constitution, to run in the 2009 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Murialdo, Hugo | url=http://www.argenpress.info/2009/08/america-latina-democracia-cristiana-y.html | title=América Latina, Democracia Cristiana y golpes de Estado | trans-title=Latin America, Democracia Cristiana and coups | language=Spanish | publisher=Argenpress | location=Argentina | date=31 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2008 Zelaya issued two emergency executive agreements (“acuerdos”), both numbered 46-A-2008, which each authorised transfer of {{currency|30 million|HNL}} of public money to advertising of his fourth ballot box.

On 17 February 2009, at a public showcasing of tractor equipment received from Venezuela, Manuel Zelaya stated that he would propose a fourth ballot box.&lt;ref name="laruta"&gt;{{cite news | author=Méndez, Marilyn | title=Honduras: La ruta ilegal de la Cuarta Urna | trans-title=Honduras: The legal route of the Fourth Ballot Box | work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]] | location=Honduras | date=26 June 2009 | url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Pa%C3%ADs/Ediciones/2009/06/27/Noticias/Honduras-La-ruta-ilegal-de-la-Cuarta-Urna | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630014429/http://www.laprensahn.com/Pa%C3%ADs/Ediciones/2009/06/27/Noticias/Honduras-La-ruta-ilegal-de-la-Cuarta-Urna | archivedate=30 June 2009 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 24 March 2009, Zelaya called for a preliminary poll to be held on 28 June 2009 to gauge popular support for including the Constituent Assembly question in the November 2009 election.&lt;ref name="BBC24March"&gt;{{cite news | title=Honduras: busca reforma constitucional | trans-title=Honduras: seeking constitutional reform | author=Staff | date=24 March 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7961000/7961441.stm | work=[[BBC Mundo]] | location=United Kingdom | language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutionality of referendum===
The President of the Congress, Micheletti, observed that Article 374 of the constitution states that no referendum can be used to alter the entrenched articles in the constitution that are specified in article 384.&lt;ref name="BBC24March" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that article 374 does not say that; and there is no article 384: the constitution has only 378 numbered articles. Apparently either the BBC, ''La Tribuna'' (the BBC’S source), or Micheletti are in error. The quote from Micheletti, copied and pasted from the BBC article, is: “El artículo 374 dice que no se podrá utilizar el plebiscito y el referendo para reformar los artículos pétreos que establece el artículo 384 y que se refiere a la forma de gobierno, al territorio nacional, al período presidencial, a la prohibición para ser nuevamente Presidente de la República al ciudadano que lo haya desempeñado bajo cualquier tipo y referente.” (BBC’S source was La Tribuna.)&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to insist that even to announce such a referendum privately is a crime (“ .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. ''porque eso, incluso, anunciarlo privadamente es un delito.''”)&lt;ref name="MichelettiAIACcite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensahn.com/index.php/content/view/full/162683 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127231709/http://www.laprensahn.com/index.php/content/view/full/162683 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 January 2013 |title="El presidente Zelaya está equivocado": Micheletti |trans-title="President Zelaya is wrong": Micheletti |date=23 March 2009 |accessdate=20 December 2009 |work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]] |location=Honduras }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 373 of the [[Constitution of Honduras]] states that the constitution can be modified by a two-thirds majority of the National Congress. However, Article 374 specifies that several articles are [[eternity clause|permanently entrenched]]; that is, they cannot be modified under any circumstances (Spanish: ''“en ningún caso”'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Artículos pétreos no pueden reformarse ni con plebiscito ni referendo | url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Pa%C3%ADs/Ediciones/2009/05/26/Noticias/Articulos-petreos-no-pueden-reformarse-ni-con-plebiscito-ni-referendo | date=26 May 2009 | work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]] | location=Honduras | language=Spanish | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530191336/http://www.laprensahn.com/Pa%C3%ADs/Ediciones/2009/05/26/Noticias/Articulos-petreos-no-pueden-reformarse-ni-con-plebiscito-ni-referendo | archivedate=30 May 2009 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entrenched clauses include those on the system of government that is permitted, and the presidential succession.&lt;ref&gt;Honduras Constitution: ''Titulo VII: De la Reforma y la Inviolabilabidad de la Constitución, Capitulo I De la Reforma de la Constitución: Articulo 373. – La reforma de esta Constitución podrá decretarse por el Congreso Nacional, en sesiones ordinarias, con dos tercios de votos de la totalidad de sus miembros.

===Court ruling===
On 25 March, the Attorney General’s office formally notified President Zelaya that he would face criminal charges of abusing power if he proceeded with the referendum.

In late May, the court of contentious administration ruled the poll illegal. Honduras’ Supreme Electoral Tribunal also ruled that such a poll would be illegal.&lt;ref name="CNN20090627" /&gt;  The lower court’s injunction, against the poll, was upheld by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="wsj20090626"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124597369604957305 | title=Honduras Lurches Toward Crisis Over Election | last=De Cordoba | first=José | date=26 June 2009 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | location=United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late June, the intended consultative poll was also rejected by Congress.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-26"&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8120161.stm | work=[[BBC Online]] | location=United Kingdom | title=Honduran leader defies top court | date=26 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June, Congress passed a resolution warning Zelaya to correct his administrative conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2009/06/04/diputados-imprueban-la-conducta-del-ejecutivo-y-le-recomiendan-que-rectifique/ | title=Diputados imprueban la conducta del Ejecutivo y le recomiendan que rectifique | language=Spanish | date=4 June 2009 | work=[[La Tribuna]] | location=Honduras | access-date=22 November 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122021733/http://www.latribuna.hn/2009/06/04/diputados-imprueban-la-conducta-del-ejecutivo-y-le-recomiendan-que-rectifique/ | archive-date=22 November 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June, the Bar Association of Honduras unanimously agreed that Zelaya was violating the law.&lt;ref name="latribune20090610"&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2009/06/10/juridicamente-imposible-convocatoria-a-constituyente/ | title=Jurídicamente imposible convocatoria a Constituyente | language=Spanish | trans-title=Legally impossible to call Constituent | date=10 June 2009 | work=[[La Tribuna]] | location=Honduras | access-date=22 November 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122022238/http://www.latribuna.hn/2009/06/10/juridicamente-imposible-convocatoria-a-constituyente/ | archive-date=22 November 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It asked Zelaya to stop the illegalities and recommended officials not follow his illegal orders.&lt;ref name="latribune20090610" /&gt;

On 23 June 2009, Congress passed a law forbidding holding official polls or referenda less than 180 days before the next general election, which would have made 28 June poll illegal.
Since this bill was passed after the poll was scheduled, Zelaya rejected its applicability to this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Palencia, Gustavo | editor=García, Hernán | url=http://lta.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idLTASIE55N06G20090624 | title=Congreso de Honduras aprueba ley de referendo contra Zelaya | trans-title=Honduras Congress approves referendum law against Zelaya | agency=Reuters | language=Spanish | date=28 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military is in charge of security and logistics in elections in Honduras. Zelaya asked them to perform their election role for the poll, but the head of the military command, General [[Romeo Vásquez Velásquez]], refused the order to pass out the poll materials because the Supreme Court had ruled the poll to be illegal. On 24 June, Zelaya fired him.&lt;ref name="BBC-2009-06-28" /&gt;  Later that day, the defence minister and heads of the army, navy and air force resigned.&lt;ref name="WSJ20090725"&gt;{{cite news | date=25 July 2009 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124847775316780293 | title=Behind the Honduran Mutiny | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | location=United States | first=Jose | last=De Cordoba }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 June, the Supreme Court ruled 5–0 that General Velásquez be reinstated.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;  Tribunal member David Matamoros affirmed the Electoral Tribunal’s support for the military’s actions.&lt;ref name="CNN20090627"&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/06/27/honduras.zelaya/index.html | work=[[CNN.com]] | location=United States | title=Honduras president: Nation calm before controversial vote | date=27 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June, surveillance cameras captured how about {{currency|2 million}} in cash was withdrawn from the [[Central Bank of Honduras]] and allegedly driven to the office of [[Enrique Flores Lanza]], Zelaya’s chief of staff. The suspicious money was possibly used to finance the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | date=22 July 2009 | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/22/zelaya-accused-of-cash-withdrawal/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Ousted Honduran leader accused of theft | work=[[The Washington Times]] | location=United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsjbehindmutiny"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124847775316780293 | title=Behind the Honduran Mutiny |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | location=United States | date=25 July 2009 | first=Jose | last=De Cordoba }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | date=7 August 2009 | url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Apertura/Ediciones/2009/07/09/Noticias/Mas-evidencia-de-millonaria-malversacion-por-cuarta-urna  |title=Más evidencia de millonaria malversación por cuarta urna | language=Spanish | trans-title=More evidence of embezzlement of millions fourth ballot | work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]] | location=Honduras | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801011249/http://www.laprensahn.com/Apertura/Ediciones/2009/07/09/Noticias/Mas-evidencia-de-millonaria-malversacion-por-cuarta-urna | archivedate=1 August 2009 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | date=7 July 2009 | url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Sucesos/Ediciones/2009/07/08/Noticias/En-maletas-sacaron-L40-millones-del-Banco-Central | title=En maletas sacaron L40 millones del Banco Centra | trans-title=In L40 million bags were removed from the Central Bank | work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]] | location=Honduras | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711121834/http://www.laprensahn.com/Sucesos/Ediciones/2009/07/08/Noticias/En-maletas-sacaron-L40-millones-del-Banco-Central | archivedate=11 July 2009 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just days before the referendum, Zelaya published executive decree PCM-019-2009, which revoked the earlier decree PCM-05-2009. Zelaya issued a new executive decree PCM-020-2009, another attempt to legalise the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2009/06/28/cambio-de-reglas-a-ultima-hora/ | title=Cambio de reglas a última hora | language=Spanish | trans-title=Changing the rules at the last minute | work=[[La Tribuna]] | location=Honduras | date=28 June 2009 | access-date=22 November 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122031310/http://www.latribuna.hn/2009/06/28/cambio-de-reglas-a-ultima-hora/ | archive-date=22 November 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=http://www.laprensa.hn/csp/mediapool/sites/LaPrensa/Honduras/story.csp?cid=532815&amp;sid=265&amp;fid=97 |title=Fiscalía notifica an Interpol captura contra Mel | trans-title=Prosecutor notifies Interpol arrest Mel | date=29 June 2009 | work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]] | location=Honduras }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a legal analysis by former Supreme Court President Vilma Morales, Zelaya stopped being President of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | date=7 July 2009 | url=http://www.laprensa.hn/Sucesos/Ediciones/2009/07/07/Noticias/Ya-no-era-presidente-cuando-fue-detenido | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824110829/http://www.laprensa.hn/Sucesos/Ediciones/2009/07/07/Noticias/Ya-no-era-presidente-cuando-fue-detenido | trans-title=He was not president when he was arrested | archivedate=24 August 2009 | title=Ya no era presidente cuando fue detenido | work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]] | location=Honduras }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizure of ballots===
Ballots arrived from Venezuela on a plane and the ballot boxes were kept at the [[Tegucigalpa airport]]. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal ordered the illegal ballots to be confiscated.

Zelaya led several hundred people to an [[Honduran Air Force|air force]] base and took possession of the disputed poll ballots, which were then kept in the presidential palace to avoid their destruction.&lt;ref name="CNN20090627" /&gt;

===Supreme court detention order===
On 27 May 2009, the Administrative Law Tribunal issued an injunction against holding the poll at the request of Honduran Attorney General [[Luis Alberto Rubi]]. On 16 June the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the 27 May injunction. On 18 June, the Administrative Law Tribunal ordered Zelaya to comply with the ruling in writing within five days. On 26 June the Supreme Court unanimously found that the president had not complied with 18 June order.

===Zelaya’s detention and first exile===
Soldiers stormed the president’s residence in [[Tegucigalpa]] early in the morning of 28 June, disarming the presidential guard, waking Zelaya and putting him on a plane to [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="NYT_courtorder" /&gt;  In San José, Costa Rica, Zelaya told [[TeleSUR]] that he had been awakened by gunshots. Masked soldiers took his cell phone, shoved him into a van and took him to an air force base, where he was put on a plane. He said he did not know that he was being taken to Costa Rica until he landed at the airport in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;  To the media, he described the events as “a coup” and “a kidnapping.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=[[New York Post]] | url=https://nypost.com/2009/06/28/honduran-president-calls-arrest-a-kidnapping/ | title=Honduran president calls arrest a 'kidnapping' | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=28 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanks patrolled the streets and military planes flew overhead. Soldiers guarded the main government buildings. The government television station and a television station that supported the president were taken off the air. Television and radio stations broadcast no news.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;  The electrical power, phone lines, and international cable TV were cut or blocked throughout Honduras.&lt;ref name="christian_sci_mon_jun_29" /&gt;  Public transportation was suspended.&lt;ref name="elpais_gobierno"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2009/06/28/actualidad/1246140011_850215.html | author=Ordaz, Pablo | title=El nuevo Goierno de Honduras decreta el toque de queda | language=Spanish | trans-title=The new Government of Honduras decrees curfew | work=[[El País]] | location=Spain | date=29 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, the Supreme Court issued a statement that it had ordered the army to arrest Zelaya.&lt;ref name="BBC-2009-06-28" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/honduras/5677026/Honduras-supreme-court-ordered-army-coup.html | title=Honduras supreme court 'ordered army coup' | work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=United Kingdom | date=28 June 2009 | first=Jeremy | last=McDermott }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 30 June, the military’s chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Inestroza, showed Judge Arita’s arrest order.&lt;ref name="NYT_courtorder" /&gt;  Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order, but that military leadership had decided to do so to avoid violence in Honduras, asking “What was more beneficial, remove this gentleman from Honduras or present him to prosecutors and have a mob assault and burn and destroy and for us to have to shoot?”.&lt;ref name="MH-03-07-2009"&gt;English summary of interview with the legal counsel of the Honduras armed forces, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza, {{cite news|first=Frances |last=Robles |title=Top Honduran military lawyer: We broke the law |date=3 July 2009 |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/1506/story/1125872.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jb00TM3J?url=http://www.miamiherald.com/1506/story/1125872.html |archivedate=6 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}; original {{cite web|last=Dada |first=Carlos |author2=José Luis Sanz |title=Cometimos un delito al sacar a Zelaya, pero había que hacerlo |language=Spanish |trans-title=We committed an offense to remove Zelaya, but had to do it |publisher=El Faro.net, El Salvador |date=2 July 2009 |url=http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/Noticias/20090629/noticias16_20090629.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jayZVstj?url=http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/Noticias/20090629/noticias16_20090629.asp |archivedate=6 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inestroza also stated that Zelaya’s allegiance to Chávez was hard to stomach and “It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That’s impossible. I personally would have retired, because my thinking, my principles, would not have allowed me to participate in that.”&lt;ref name="MH-03-07-2009" /&gt;

[[Ramón Custodio]], the head of the country’s human rights commission, said that Zelaya’s exile was a mistake and that the military made an “error” sending Zelaya into exile rather than holding him for trial. Honduras’s Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case brought by a group of lawyers and judges arguing that the military broke the law taking Zelaya out of the country.&lt;ref name="BLOOM_2009_08_13"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=ahdMZG1IyU2s|title=Zelaya's Exile an 'Error', Honduras Human Rights Chief Says |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|last=Schmidt|first=Blake|author2=Eric Sabo|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Micheletti himself said that a mistake was made when Zelaya was exiled.&lt;ref name="BLOOM_2009_08_17"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=azjI4deGp_Co |title=Honduras's Micheletti Says Zelaya Exile Was 'Error' (Update1) |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |last=Martinez |first=Andres |author2=Blake Schmidt |date=17 August 2009|accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged impeachment and presidential succession===

A document purporting to be a resignation letter written by President Zelaya, dated 25 June, was read to congress.&lt;ref name="noticias24.com"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.noticias24.com/actualidad/noticia/61455/esta-es-la-supuesta-renuncia-de-zelaya/ | title = Esta es la supuesta renuncia de Zelaya |date = 28 June 2009|accessdate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Zelaya has said he did not write the letter. Later that day, in an extraordinary session Congress voted to remove Zelaya for manifest irregular conduct and putting in present danger the state of law.

The President of the National Congress was the next on the presidential line of succession because the
Vice-President had earlier quit to run in the 2009 elections. The President of the National Congress was [[Roberto Micheletti]], a member of Zelaya’s party.
By a show of hands, the National Congress – the majority of whom belonged to Zelaya’s own Liberal party&lt;ref name="listadodiputados"&gt;{{cite web|title=listadodiputados |url=http://www.congreso.gob.hn/Diputados.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iY4AcdlT?url=http://www.congreso.gob.hn/Diputados.htm |archivedate=26 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=23 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; – named Micheletti to complete the remaining months of the presidential term.&lt;ref name="AP-2009-06-28"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/657949|title=Honduran military ousts president ahead of vote|first=Will |last=Weissert |first2=Freddy |last2=Cuevas|date=28 June 2009|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=28 June 2009| location=Toronto | work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2009}}

** Disapprove Zelaya’s repeated violations of the constitution, laws and court orders.
** Remove Zelaya from office.
* Name the current President of Congress to complete the presidential term that ends on 27 January 2010.

Honduran institutions, including the [[National Congress of Honduras|National Congress]], the [[Supreme Court of Honduras|Supreme Court]], and the interim government, maintain Zelaya was replaced constitutionally. Arguments that Zelaya’s ouster was illegal because the proper legal procedures were not used has been advanced by several lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=44411 |title=Inconstitucionalidad de la llamada "sucesión constitucional" |first=Efrain |last=Moncada Silva |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 |publisher=La Tribuna (Honduras) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kAsyq2T5?url=http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=44411 |archivedate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=42800 |title=¿Sucesión presidencial? |first=Edmundo |last=Orellana |publisher=La Tribuna (Honduras) |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115002451/http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=42800 |archivedate=15 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASIL_Insight"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asil.org/insights090729.cfm |title=Honduras: Coup d’Etat in Constitutional Clothing? |first=Doug |last=Cassel |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=9 October 2009 |publisher=[[American Society of International Law]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902064902/http://www.asil.org/insights090729.cfm |archivedate=2 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/2680|title=Caudillos Can Be Already Removed from Office in Honduras—Just Not the Way It Was Done with President Zelaya|publisher=''[[Americas Quarterly]]''|author=Javier El-Hage|author-link=Javier El-Hage|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting Honduran President Roberto Micheletti said forcing deposed President Manuel Zelaya to leave the country, instead of arresting him, was a mistake.&lt;ref name="BLOOM_2009_08_17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gutierrez_2009"&gt;{{cite web | title = Honduras: Constitutional Law Issues | url = http://blog.erlingsson.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Schock_CRS_Report_Honduras.pdf | publisher = the Law Library of Congress, USA | date = August 2009 |page=5| accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clarin_micheletti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/09/30/um/m-02009386.htm |title=Sacamos a Zelaya porque se fue a la izquierda, puso a comunistas |first=Néstor |last=Restivo |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009 |publisher=El Clarin (Argentina) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kHjrsO2b?url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/09/30/um/m-02009386.htm |archivedate=5 October 2009 |df=dmy }}.  4 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests against the coup began almost immediately, as several thousand Zelaya supporters gathered near the Presidential Palace, confronting the guarding soldiers and lit tires on fire.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; In response to daily pro-Zelaya protests, Congress approved a decree on 1 July that applied an overnight curfew and allowed security forces to arrest people at home and hold them for more than 24 hours.&lt;ref name="NYT-07-01-09"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/world/americas/02honduras.html|title=Compromise Is Sought to Honduras Standoff|date=1 July 2009|accessdate=4 July 2009| first1=Marc | last1=Lacey | first2=Ginger | last2=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] unanimously adopted a resolution which called for the reinstatement of Zelaya as the President of Honduras.

Roberto Micheletti made an appearance and said that the [[Honduran general election, 2009|November general elections]] will be held as scheduled and that a new president will be sworn in on 27 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/01/content_11630171.htm |title=Honduras' Micheletti joins anti-Zelaya rally in central Tegucigalpa |publisher=Xinhua |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=30 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iY45BOXz?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/01/content_11630171.htm |archivedate=26 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Romeo Vásquez Velásquez]] also attended and spoke at the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/88764295/AFP|title=Honduran top military chief General Rome|publisher=Getty Images|date=30 June 2009|accessdate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honduras was formally suspended from the [[Organization of American States]] on 4 July, after the Micheletti government ignored an ultimatum by the OAS to re-instate Zelaya as president.&lt;ref name="Reuters-2009-07-05"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0211965120090705|title=Ousted Honduran leader mulls return after OAS ruling|date=5 July 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; OAS Secretary General [[José Miguel Insulza]] had arrived in Honduras the previous day to negotiate Zelaya’s return.&lt;ref name="BBC-2009-07-04"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8133981.stm|title=Honduran court defiant on Zelaya|date=4 July 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090704011800/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8133981.stm| archivedate= 4 July 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zelaya met with US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] in Washington on 7 July. At this meeting, Zelaya agreed to a US-backed proposal for negotiation talks with Micheletti government representatives in Costa Rica set for 9 July.&lt;ref name=ReutersJuly7&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE56424C20090707?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=Honduras' Zelaya says to meet coup backers on Thursday|publisher=Reuters|date=7 July 2009|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks, with Costa Rican President [[Óscar Arias]] serving as mediator, proved unsuccessful, as both sides remained far apart according to regional leaders. The participants only agreed to meet again sometime in the future, as Zelaya left Costa Rica to gather more international support.&lt;ref name=CostaRicatalks1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8145667.stm|title=Honduras talks end without accord |publisher=BBC News|date=11 July 2009|accessdate=12 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090712012007/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8145667.stm| archivedate= 12 July 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Micheletti announced that he accepted the resignation of his Foreign Minister [[Enrique Ortez]], who, in a TV interview, had called US President [[Barack Obama]] ''“[un] negrito que no sabe nada de nada”'' (“a little black man who knows nothing about nothing”). The US Embassy in Honduras strongly condemned the comments, which Micheletti described as “a scandalous epithet”.&lt;ref name=CostaRicatalks1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP_obama_honduras&gt;Enrique Ortez Colindres calls Obama negrito [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090708/pl_afp/honduraspoliticsmilitarycoupus_20090708145552 ''US envoy blasts Honduran minister for racist comments''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715044702/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090708/pl_afp/honduraspoliticsmilitarycoupus_20090708145552 |date=15 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=338754&amp;CategoryId=23558|title=Honduran Foreign Minister Apologizes for Comments on Obama|publisher=Latin American Herald Tribune|date=8 July 2009|accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Micheletti immediately reinstated Ortez as Minister of Government and Justice.

In mid-July Honduran Roman Catholic Cardinal [[Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga]] said that he supported Zelaya’s removal from office, saying that Zelaya now “doesn’t have any authority, moral or legal”, while opposing his expulsion from the country.&lt;ref name="Reuters20090715"&gt;{{cite news | title = Honduran Catholic hierarchy opposes Zelaya, Chavez | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE56E7ZH20090715 | date = 16 July 2007|accessdate=16 July 2009| publisher = Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 July 2009, interim president Roberto Micheletti stated he would be prepared to step down “if at some point that decision is needed to bring peace and tranquility to the country, but without the return, and I stress this, of former President Zelaya.”&lt;ref name="AP_2009_07_16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jAkMGKIUDg_ngUiZboxQbYj5_DPwD99F8FS00 |title=Honduran interim leader: I'm willing to step down |agency=Associated Press |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=16 July 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_2009_07_16"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8153128.stm|title=Honduran leader 'could step down'|publisher=BBC|date=16 July 2009|accessdate=16 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090716100852/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8153128.stm| archivedate= 16 July 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 16 July interview President Óscar Arias said that he had a mandate from 34 world governments to restore constitutional order in Honduras, by which he meant restore President Zelaya. He rejected Micheletti’s proposal to step down if Zelaya did not return to power. He said, “we will see if we can talk of an amnesty, and for whom, over political crimes (veremos si se puede hablar de una amnistía, y para quiénes, sobre delitos políticos)”.  “Zelaya must abandon his goal of installing a fourth ballot box”, he continued. Arias indicated he intended to propose a reconciliation government headed by Zelaya combined with political amnesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiempo.hn/secciones/crisis-politica/713-arias-propondra-gobierno-de-reconciliacion- |title=Arias propondrá Gobierno de reconciliación |publisher=Diario El Tiempo |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719095514/http://www.tiempo.hn/secciones/crisis-politica/713-arias-propondra-gobierno-de-reconciliacion- |archivedate=19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, both pro- and anti-Zelaya demonstrations continued on an almost daily basis throughout the deeply polarised country.

===Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba===
After Zelaya’s exile, Chavez alleged that the Venezuelan ambassador was assaulted by Honduran soldiers; Chavez said that if the ambassador were killed or the Venezuelan Embassy were violated, this would constitute an act of war requiring a military response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/honduras/5681368/Hugo-Chavez-threatens-military-action-in-Honduras.html |title=Hugo Chavez threatens military action in Honduras | work=[[The Telegraph (website)|The Telegraph]] | location=United Kingdom | date=29 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to the interim government===

{{Main article|Frente Nacional contra el Golpe de Estado en Honduras}}
Much of the opposition to the ''de facto'' Micheletti government and its actions were coördinated through a wide coalition of [[grassroots]] organisations and political parties and movements formerly known as [[Frente Nacional contra el Golpe de Estado en Honduras]] (FNGE), now Frente Nacional de Resistencia Popular.&lt;ref name="militante_frente_alegria"&gt;{{cite web |last=Santibáñez |first=Samuel |title=Honduras: La disyuntiva de la revolución no es democracia o dictadura, sino capitalismo o socialismo |publisher=Militante |date=2 August 2009 |url=http://www.militante.org/honduras-la-disyuntiva-es-capitalismo-o-socialismo |accessdate=10 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ivm7Jyy1?url=http://www.militante.org/honduras-la-disyuntiva-es-capitalismo-o-socialismo |archivedate=10 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FNGE aimed to restore elected President [[Manuel Zelaya]] in replacement of the ''de facto'' [[Roberto Micheletti]] government,&lt;ref name="CEAL_DLCA_frente_about"&gt;{{cite web |title=Llamamiento del Frente Nacional contra el Golpe de Estado en Honduras a la Clase Obrera Mundial |publisher=Centro de Estudios y Apoyo Laboral (CEAL) – Derechos Laborales en Centroamerica |date=3 August 2009 |url=http://www.ceal-dlca.org/2009/08/llamamiento-del-frente-nacional-contra.html |accessdate=10 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ivkETfGT?url=http://www.ceal-dlca.org/2009/08/llamamiento-del-frente-nacional-contra.html |archivedate=10 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pidhdd_frente"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frente Nacional Contra el Golpe de Estado en Honduras |language=Es |publisher=Plataforma Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, Democracia y Desarrollo |date=12 July 2009 |url=http://www.pidhdd.org/content/view/680/165/ |accessdate=10 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ivW4Xv0e?url=http://www.pidhdd.org/content/view/680/165/ |archivedate=10 August 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is perceived by the participating organisations as a dictatorship, considering the documented human rights violations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=4 October 2009 @ 3:15 pm |url=http://www.tvpts.tv/enhondurasnopasaran/?p=664 |title=16 de Agosto: MUERTOS 101 HONDURAS GOLPE MILITAR.

The Paris-based press freedom group [[Reporters Without Borders]] released a statement on 29 June stating that, “The suspension or closure of local and international broadcast media indicates that the coup leaders want to hide what is happening.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN29399379 | accessdate =1 July 2009| work=Reuters | first=Mica | last=Rosenberg | title=Honduran army smothers media after coup | date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carlos Lauría of the New York-based [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] said: “The de facto government clearly used the security forces to restrict the news... Hondurans did not know what was going on. They clearly acted to create an information vacuum to keep people unaware of what was actually happening.” However, in an interview published on 9 July 2009 in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[Ramón Custodio López]], Honduras’s human rights ombudsman, said he had received no official complaints from journalists: “This is the first I have heard about an occupation or military raid of a station,” he said. “I try to do the best job I can, but there are things that escape my knowledge.”&lt;ref name="WAPOST_2009_07_09"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/09/AR2009070902820.html|title= In Honduras, One-Sided News of Crisis|date=9 July 2009|work=Washington Post|first=Juan|last=Forero|accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2009, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) dispatched a six-member delegation which reported accusations it received. The delegation was told of alleged violent confrontations and arbitrary arrests. Someone even accused police of rape. Some alleged that judges were threatened “at gunpoint”. According to the received allegations, 3,500 and 4,000 people had been arrested. The IACHR also received accusations that the government has threatened, detained and beaten members of the media. Based on the statements it received, the delegation concluded that there was “an atmosphere of intimidation that inhibits the free exercise of freedom of expression.”&lt;ref name="IACHR_2009_08_21"/&gt; On the same day, 93 academics and authors, mostly from United States universities, criticised [[criticism of Human Rights Watch#Honduras|Human Rights Watch]]’s lack of statements and reports on Honduras between 8 July and 21 August.&lt;ref name="commond_90experts_HRW_hn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grandin |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Grandin |author2=Adrienne Pine |title=Over 90 Experts Call on Human Rights Watch to Speak Out on Honduras Abuses |publisher=[[Common Dreams]] |date=22 August 2009 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2009/08/21 |accessdate=22 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jE3pnzk8?url=http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2009/08/21 |archivedate=22 August 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, [[Human Rights Watch]] published a summary of the IACHR report and stated that it had published reports up to 8 July and that human rights supporters had encouraged the IACHR to “directly [intervene]”.&lt;ref name="hrw_indirectly_responds_to_93 academics"/&gt; [[ABC News|ABC News (United States)]] claimed that HRW had “commissioned” the IACHR report.&lt;ref name="ABC_IACHR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hurtado |first=Viviana |title=Honduran Government Wages Campaign of Fear and Intimidation, Human Rights Group Alleges |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=26 August 2009 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=8419368 |accessdate=26 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jc6hkAL3?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=8419368 |archivedate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent confrontations with media continued from both Zelaya supporters and opponents during the week of 12 August 2009.&lt;ref name="RSF_2009_08_17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsf.org/In-new-wave-of-violence-against.html |title=In new wave of violence against media, de facto regime “reaps what it sowed” |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930184154/http://www.rsf.org/In-new-wave-of-violence-against.html |archive-date=30 September 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zelaya’s secret return to Honduras ===

Zelaya made two initial, open attempts to return to his country, which were rebuffed. On 5 July he attempted to return by air, and the Micheletti government responded by closing [[Toncontín International Airport]] and sending the military to guard the runways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/noticias/secciones/nota/53467-NN/miles-de-personas-se-preparan-para-recibir-a-zelaya-en-su-regreso-a-honduras/ |title=Miles de personas se preparan para recibir a Zelaya en su regreso a Honduras |publisher=TeleSUR TV |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709101249/http://www.telesurtv.net/noticias/secciones/nota/53467-NN/miles-de-personas-se-preparan-para-recibir-a-zelaya-en-su-regreso-a-honduras/ |archivedate=9 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As thousands of Zelaya supporters gathered at the airport to meet him, one was confirmed dead and scores injured,&lt;ref name=Airport&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8135358.stm|title=Zelaya's jet blocked in Honduras |publisher=BBC News|date=6 July 2009|accessdate=5 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090706011713/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8135358.stm| archivedate= 6 July 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; when “several soldiers walked through [the crowd] and began firing indiscriminately”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6652940.ece|title=Teenager killed in Honduras as soldiers fire on Zelaya supporters at airport|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd.|date=7 July 2009| location=London | first=Hannah | last=Strange| accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July, Zelaya briefly entered into Honduran territory, at a border crossing between Honduras and Nicaragua near [[Las Manos, El Paraíso|Las Manos]] in [[El Paraíso Department]].&lt;ref name="LasManos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8168326.stm|title=Ousted Zelaya makes brief return |publisher=BBC News|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2009, Zelaya and his wife arrived at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. Zelaya stated that to reach the embassy he travelled through mountains for fifteen hours, and took back roads to avoid checkpoints, but he did not state from which country he entered Honduras. He stated to [[Canal 36]] that “I am here in Tegucigalpa. I am here for the restoration of democracy, to call for dialogue”.

Michelletti initially denied that Zelaya had returned. After admitting the return, he issued a curfew and asked the Brazilian government to put Zelaya in Honduran custody to be put on trial. Brazilian foreign minister [[Celso Amorim]] stated that Brazil did not aid Zelaya’s return.

Thousands of Zelaya supporters soon congregated around the embassy. Security Vice-Minister Mario Perdomo ordered checkpoints to be placed on highways leading to Tegucigalpa, to “stop those people coming to start trouble.” Defense Minister Lionel Sevilla suspended all air flights to Tegucigalpa. Late that day, Honduran security forces used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowds outside the Brazilian embassy. The interim government also surrounded the area with military and several agencies reported that ‘hooded men’ had stormed the building next to the embassy. About 50 pro-Zelaya supporters have been reported wounded by police.

Electricity was cut off to the embassy area and Canal 36 TV; however, Radio Globo sent out a broadcast that included a call for generators and a pledge by the head of the electrical workers union to send technicians which shortly led to power being restored to the immediate area. The curfew was then extended until 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm the following day, a drastic measure because it means that all workplaces will be closed during daylight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera English – Americas – Tensions rise in Honduran standoff |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/200992315544655365.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5cmuoKx?url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/200992315544655365.html |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8267982.stm |work=BBC News | title=Zelaya 'will rebuild democracy' | date=21 September 2009| accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ycoup&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090922/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup Honduras coup] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925014907/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090922/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |date=25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GHost&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) – 21 September 2009 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j0_WWFY5CACq0zLIHY03N12ZVZlQ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104000335/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j0_WWFY5CACq0zLIHY03N12ZVZlQ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2013 |title=Google hosted news |publisher=Google |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT22&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/world/americas/22honduras.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=a1 | work=The New York Times | first=Elisabeth | last=Malkin | title=Ousted Leader Returns to Honduras | date=22 September 2009| accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ousted President Outwits Foes With Secret Journey to Brazilian Embassy in the Capital, Guardian News &amp; Media |url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/310478.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5cmXn0E?url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/310478.html |archivedate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=25 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2009, the de facto Micheletti government signed an [[Guaymuras accord|agreement]] with Zelaya’s negotiators that would allow the Honduran Congress to vote on whether the ousted president would be restored and allowed to serve out the few remaining months of his term.&lt;ref name="NYT_2009_10_30"&gt;{{cite news| last =Malkin| first=Elisabeth| title =Deal Reached in Honduras to Restore Ousted President|work=New York Times| date =30 October 2009| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/world/americas/31honduras.html?hp | accessdate =30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zelaya chose not to give a list of candidates for the unity government to Micheletti, arguing that the Congress was unacceptably delaying the agreed-upon vote on his restoration.&lt;ref name="Zelaya: US-brokered pact for Honduran crisis fails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zelaya atrasa integración de gobierno de unidad"/&gt;

===Zelaya-reinstatement proposal rejected by Congress===
On 2 December, the National Congress debated regarding the possible reinstatement of Zelaya to the presidency. A vast majority of the lawmakers voted against Zelaya’s reinstatement. The 128 member Congress voted 111 to 14 against reinstating Zelaya, affirming its 28 June decision.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20091203&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/world/americas/03honduras.html | title =  Honduran Congress Votes Down Return by Zelaya |work=New York Times | date = 3 December 2009| first=Elisabeth | last=Malkin| accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was made as part of the Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord, and called on the International Community to respect the decision. Almost all congressmen from Zelaya’s own political party as well as the opposition National Party voted against the reinstatement, and supported the victory of Porfirio Lobo Sosa as the new president of Honduras in the November 2009 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091202/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |title=Honduran lawmakers debate ousted leader's future |date=2 December 2009 |publisher=AP via [[Yahoo News]] |accessdate=2 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205200631/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091202/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |archivedate=5 December 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zelaya criticised the vote and urged governments not to restore ties with the incoming administration of Porfirio Lobo. “Today, the lawmakers at the service of the dominant classes ratified the coup d’état in Honduras,” Zelaya said in a statement released shortly after the vote. “They have condemned Honduran to exist outside the rule of law.”.&lt;ref name="Honduran Congress votes against restoring Zelaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091203/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |title=Honduran Congress votes against restoring Zelaya |date=3 December 2009 |publisher=AP via [[Yahoo News]] |accessdate=3 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207015627/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091203/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |archivedate=7 December 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December, Juan Barahona-led activists ended five months of daily protests demanding the reinstatement of Zelaya, saying they are moving on now that Congress has voted to keep Manuel Zelaya out of office. Juan Barahona, who had been leading protests since late June when Zelaya was forced out of the country, said that his supporters are “closing that chapter” of their struggle. Barahona said it’s time for Hondurans who support policies in favour of the poor and other themes that Zelaya espoused to shift their focus to the 2014 elections.&lt;ref name="Zelaya supporters say it's time to move on"/&gt;

===Second exile===
On 20 January 2010, the [[Dominican Republic]] and President-elect [[Porfirio Lobo]] agreed to a deal that would allow Zelaya to be transported safely from the Brazilian embassy in [[Tegucigalpa]] where he had been, to the Dominican Republic upon Lobo taking office on 27 January.

The '''Administrative Law, Process and Procedure Project''' (the Project) is a bipartisan undertaking of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]] of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] of the [[United States Congress]].  It consists of a comprehensive study of the state of administrative law, process and procedure in the [[United States]].  A description of the Project was included in the Judiciary Committee's Oversight Plan for the [[109th Congress]], as approved by the Committee on January 26, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/printers/109th/109th%20Oversight%20Plan.pdf "Oversight Plan for the 109th Congress, Committee on the Judiciary"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060802140335/http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/printers/109th/109th%20Oversight%20Plan.pdf |date=August 2, 2006 }} at 5, (January 26, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Project will culminate with the preparation of a detailed report with recommendations for legislative proposals and suggested areas for further research and analysis to be considered by the [[Administrative Conference of the United States]] (ACUS).  House Judiciary Committee Chairman [[F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.]] (R-WI) and Ranking Member [[John Conyers]] (D-MI) requested the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) to assist Representative [[Chris Cannon]] (R-UT), the Chairman of the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law|Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law]] (CAL), in conducting the Project.

== Relationship between the project and ACUS ==

{{main|Administrative Conference of the United States}}

One of the principal goals of the Project is to substantiate further the need to reactivate the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), a nonpartisan "private-public think tank"&lt;ref&gt;''Reauthorization of the Administrative Conference of the United States Before the Subcomm. on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Comm. on the Judiciary'', 104th Cong. 31 (1995) (Statement of C. Boyden Gray).&lt;/ref&gt; that proposed valuable recommendations which improved administrative aspects of regulatory law and practice.  Over its 28-year existence, ACUS served as an independent agency charged with studying "the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedure used by administrative agencies in carrying out administrative programs."&lt;ref&gt;5 U.S.C. Section 594(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of its approximately 200 recommendations were implemented,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/admin/acus/acustoc.html American Bar Ass'n Administrative Procedure Database Site Specific Digital Texts:  Recommendations of the Administrative Conference of the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904070634/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/admin/acus/acustoc.html |date=2006-09-04 }};''see'' Toni Fine, ''A Legislative Analysis of the Demise of the Administrative Conference of the United States'', 30 ARIZONA ST. L. J. 19, 46 n. 102 (1998) (noting that "it has been estimated that 75% of ACUS' legislative proposals were adopted in whole or in part).&lt;/ref&gt; and they, in turn, helped save taxpayers many millions of dollars.  ACUS was considered to be "an invaluable mechanism set into place by Congress to improve federal administrative law."&lt;ref&gt;''ABA Section of Administrative Law &amp; Regulatory Practice Program: The Administrative Conference of the U.S. - Where Do We Go From Here?'', 8 THOMAS M. COOLEY L. REV. 147, 148 (1991) (quoting Michael P. Cox, Dean and Professor of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School).&lt;/ref&gt;  A commentator observed that "[a]s long as there is a need for regulatory reform, there is a need for something like the Administrative Conference."&lt;ref&gt;''Reauthorization of the Administrative Conference of the United States: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary'', 104th Cong. 31 (1995) (statement of C. Boyden Gray).&lt;/ref&gt;  ACUS is credited with playing an important role in improving the nation's legal system by issuing recommendations designed "to eliminate excessive litigation costs and long delays."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 44 (statement of Richard E. Wiley).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Congress, in response to an ACUS recommendation, passed the [[Administrative Dispute Resolution Act]] in 1990, which established a framework for agencies to resolve administrative litigation through alternative dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 101-552, 104 Stat. 2736 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Among its "most influential government-wide recommendations" were ACUS's proposals facilitating judicial review of agency decisions and eliminating various technical impediments to such review.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Edles, ''Lessons from the Administrative Conference of the United States'', 2 EUROPEAN PUB. L. 571, 584 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  It also issued proposals leading to the enactment of the [[Negotiated Rulemaking Act]],&lt;ref&gt;5 U.S.C. Sections 561-70.&lt;/ref&gt; which encourages consensual resolution through a process that takes into account the needs of various affected interests.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Gary J. Edles, ''Lessons from the Administrative Conference of the United States'', 2 EUROPEAN PUB.L. 584, 590-591 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  ACUS, in addition, recommended a model administrative civil penalty statute that has served as the basis for "numerous pieces of legislation."&lt;ref&gt;ACUS Recommendation 72-6 and defunct webpage http://acus.gov/org_mission/acus_org_mission.cfm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a systemic perspective, ACUS also helped to focus attention on the need for the federal government to be made more efficient, less big, and more accountable.  It was viewed as one of the leading federal proponents of encouraging practical ways to reduce administrative litigation.  In this regard, ACUS actively promoted information-technology initiatives, such as developing methods by which the public could participate electronically in agency rulemaking proceedings to increase public access to government information and foster greater openness in government operations.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', 305.69-3 Publication of a "Guide to Federal Reporting Requirements" (Recommendation No. 69-3); 305.69-6 Compilation of Statistics on Administrative Proceedings by Federal Departments and Agencies (Recommendation No. 69-6); 305.71-6 Public Participation in Administrative Hearings (Recommendation No. 71-6); 305.74-4 Preenforcement Judicial Review of Rules of General Applicability (Recommendation No. 74-4); 305.76-2 Strengthening the Informational and Notice-Giving Functions of the "Federal Register" (Recommendation No. 76-2); 305.76-3 Procedures in Addition to Notice and the Opportunity for Comment in Informal Rulemaking (Recommendation No. 76-3); 305.78-4 Federal agency interaction with private standard-setting organizations in health and safety regulation (Recommendation No. 78-4); 305.79-4 Public Disclosure Concerning the use of Cost-Benefit and Similar Analyses in Regulation (Recommendation No. 79-4); 305.80-6 Intragovernmental Communications in Informal Rulemaking Proceedings (Recommendation No. 80-6); 305.82-4 Procedures for Negotiating Proposed Regulations (Recommendation No. 82-4); 305.82-7 Judicial Review of Rules in Enforcement Proceedings (Recommendation No. 82-7); 305.84-5 Preemption of State Regulation by Federal Agencies (Recommendation No. 84-5); 305.85-1 Legislative Preclusion of cost/benefit analysis (Recommendation No. 85-1); 305.85-2 Agency procedures for performing regulatory analysis of rules (Recommendation No. 85-2); 305.88-7 Valuation of Human Life in Regulatory Decisionmaking (Recommendation No. 88-7); 305.90-2 The Ombudsman in Federal Agencies (Recommendation No. 90-2); 305.93-4 Improving the Environment for Agency Rulemaking (Recommendation No. 93-4); 305.94-1 Use of Audited Self-Regulation as a Regulatory Technique (Recommendation No. 94-1); 305.95-4 Procedures for Noncontroversial and Expedited Rulemaking (Recommendation 95-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of his testimony on the reauthorization of ACUS in 2004, U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], a former ACUS Chair, described ACUS as “a worthwhile organization” that offered “a unique combination of talents from the academic world, from within the executive branch . . . and, thirdly, from the private bar, especially lawyers particularly familiar with administrative law.”&lt;ref&gt;''Reauthorization of the Administrative Conference of the United States Before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary'', 108th Cong.  15-16 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  He observed, “I did not know another organization that so effectively combined the best talent from each of those areas.”  In addition, he said that the Conference was “an enormous bargain.”&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] cited the “huge” savings to the public as a result of ACUS’s recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 38.&lt;/ref&gt;   Noting that ACUS was “a matter of good Government,” he stated, “I very much hope you reauthorize the Administrative Conference.”&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;   Both Justices agreed that there were various matters that a reauthorized ACUS could examine.  These included assessing the value of having agencies use teleconferencing facilities and the need to create a regulatory process that promotes sound science.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 46.&lt;/ref&gt;   Through Representative Cannon's leadership, ACUS was reauthorized in the [[108th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Federal Regulatory Improvement Act of 2004, Pub.L.No. 108-401 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status of the project ==

=== Hearings ===

To date{{as of?|date=November 2013}}, the CAL Subcommittee has held a series of hearings in anticipation of and as part of the Project.  Following its May 20, 2004 oversight hearing on the reauthorization of the ACUS at which Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer testified,&lt;ref&gt;''Reauthorization of the Administrative Conference of the United States: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary'', 108th Cong.  15-16 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; the Subcommittee conducted a second hearing on ACUS that examined further the reasons why there is a need to reauthorize ACUS.&lt;ref name="Id."&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2005, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the status of the Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/printers/109th/24282.pdf ''Administrative Law, Process, and Procedure Project: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727224134/http://www.judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/printers/109th/24282.pdf |date=July 27, 2006 }} 109th Cong.(2005)&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2006, the Subcommittee held a hearing that focused on the [[Congressional Review Act]] in light of that Act’s tenth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/printers/109th/26770.pdf ''Tenth Anniversary of the Congressional Review Act: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727210517/http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/printers/109th/26770.pdf |date=July 27, 2006 }}, 109th Cong. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   Also in 2006, Subcommittee held a hearing&lt;ref&gt;''The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act: Hearing on H.R. 682 Before the Subcomm. on Commercial and Administrative Law of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary'', 109th Cong. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; on how the [[Regulatory Flexibility Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (1980) (codified at 5 U.S.C. Sections 601-612).&lt;/ref&gt; has been implemented since its enactment in 1980 and whether proposed legislation, such as H.R. 682, the “[[Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act]]” would adequately address certain perceived weaknesses in the RFA.&lt;ref&gt;The GAO has on numerous occasions cited various deficiencies with the RFA. ''See, e.g., SBBEFA Compliance - Is It the Same Old Story?:  Hearing Before the House Committee on Small Business'', 107th Cong. 51 (2002) (statement of Victor Rezendes, Managing Director - Strategic Issues Team, U.S. Government Accountability Office); ''Regulatory Flexibility Act - Status of Agencies’ Compliance:  Hearing Before the Senate Committee on Small Business'', 104th Cong. 51 (1995) (statement of Johnny C. Finch, Assistant Comptroller General - General Government Division, U.S. Government Accountability Office); U.S. Government Accountability Office, Regulatory Flexibility Act:  Status of Agencies’ Compliance, GAO/GGD-94-105 (Apr. 27, 1994); U.S. Government Accountability Office, Regulatory Flexibility Act:  Inherent Weaknesses May Limit Its Usefulness for Small Governments, GAO/HRD-91-16 (Jan. 11, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 2006, the CAL Subcommittee held a hearing on the 60th anniversary of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]]&lt;ref&gt;u.s.c. section 551 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; discussing the question as to if the Act is still effective in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;''60th Anniversary of the Administrative Procedure Act: Where do we go from Here?: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary'', 109th Cong. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symposia ===

In addition to conducting hearings, the CAL Subcommittee to date has cosponsored two symposia as part of the Project.  The first symposium, held in December 2005, was on Federal E-Government Initiatives.  This program, chaired by Professor [[Cary Coglianese]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]], examined the Executive Branch’s efforts to implement e-rulemaking across the federal government.  A particular focus of this program was on the ongoing development of a government-wide Federal Docket Management System (FDMS).  Presentations at the symposium were given by government managers involved in the development of the FDMS as well as by academic researchers studying e-rulemaking.  Representatives from various agencies, including the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB), the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and the Government Accountability Office ([[GAO]]), discussed the current progress of e-rulemaking.  In addition, academics reported on current and prospective research endeavors dealing with certain aspects of e-rulemaking. The program offered a structured dialogue that addressed the challenges and opportunities for implementing e-rulemaking, the outcomes achieved by e-rulemaking to date, and strategies that could be used in the future to improve the rulemaking process through application of information technology.   

The [http://www.american.edu/rulemaking/news/index.htm second symposium], held at [[American University]], examined the role of science in the rulemaking process.  The symposium consisted of four panels:  OMB’s recent initiatives on regulatory science, science and the judicial review of rulemaking, science advisory panels and rulemaking, and government agencies’ science capabilities.

=== Ongoing studies ===

==== ''Study on how Proposed Rules are Developed'' ====

As part of the Project, several studies are also being conducted.  One study, by Professor William West of Texas A&amp;M University, examines the role of public participation before notice and comment.&lt;ref&gt;The East West Research Group, Outside Participation in the Development of Proposed Rules - Exploratory Research of Rule Proposal Development in Government Agencies, at 4 (July 11, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  The APA generally requires agencies to involve the public in the rulemaking process by publishing notices of proposed rulemaking to which the public can submit comments.  Agencies, after considering these comments, publish final rules.  Although critical decisions regarding proposed rules are often made in the months (and sometimes years) before rules are published, little is known about how agencies actually develop these rules.  In light of the possibility that the impact of the notice and comment requirement may be “limited by the fact that some of the most critical decisions in rulemaking are often made before a proposal appears in the Federal Register," the study will cover how proposed rules are developed as a policy-making process.&lt;ref name="Id." /&gt;

==== ''Judicial Review Study'' ====
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2015}}
According to an informal review by CRS, approximately fifty percent of court challenges to agency rulemakings are successful.  To confirm this estimate, CRS arranged to have an independent analysis of every case involving administrative agencies that were appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for all 12 circuits over a ten-year period. Professor Jody Freeman of Harvard University is conducting the study under supervision of CRS. The study is examining a database of 3,075 cases supplied by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.  The text of each case will be analyzed to determine its outcome (e.g., reversed or affirmed), the reasons for the court's decision, and the judges involved in the decision.  In addition, trends in the data such as whether certain agencies or types of rules are more likely to be reversed, will also be examined.  The results of this study will be summarized in a written report to be completed by September.

==== ''Science Advisory Committees Study'' ====

A study on science advisory committees is being conducted by the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38277">[[Image:1956 Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act.JPG|right|thumb|First page of Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act.]]

The '''Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act''' of 1956 ([[Act of Congress|Public Law]] 84-830) was an [[Act of Congress]] passed to improve [[mental health]] care in the United States [[Alaska Territory|territory]] of [[Alaska]]. It became the focus of a major political controversy&lt;ref&gt;"One of the most controversial pieces of legislation tackled by Congress in 1956" – ''Congressional Quarterly Almanac'', 1957; quoted in Felicetti, Daniel A., ''Mental health and retardation politics: the mind lobbies in Congress'', p. 27. Praeger, 1975. {{ISBN|0-275-09930-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; after opponents nicknamed it the "[[Siberia]] Bill" and denounced it as being part of a [[communism|communist]] plot to hospitalize and [[brainwashing|brainwash]] Americans. Campaigners asserted that it was part of an international [[Jew]]ish, [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] conspiracy intended to establish [[United Nations]]-run [[concentration camp]]s in the United States.

The legislation in its original form was sponsored by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]]. Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[Anticommunism|anti-Communist]] and fringe religious groups was passed by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref name="nickerson"&gt;Nickerson, Michelle M. "The Lunatic Fringe Strikes Back: Conservative Opposition to the Alaska Mental Health Bill of 1956", in ''The Politics of Healing: histories of alternative medicine in twentieth-century North America'', ed. Robert D. Johnston, pp. 117–152. Routledge, 2004. {{ISBN|0-415-93338-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy still plays a prominent role in the [[Church of Scientology]]'s account of its [[Scientology and psychiatry|campaign against psychiatry]].

The Act succeeded in its initial aim of establishing a mental health care system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a mental health trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The [[asset stripping]] was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted mental health trust was established in the mid-1980s.

==Background to the act==
[[Image:Edward Lewis Bartlett.jpg|right|thumb|Alaska Delegate (and later Senator) [[Bob Bartlett]], the author of the original Alaska Mental Health Bill]]
Alaska possessed no mental health treatment facilities prior to the passage of the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a [[U.S. state]], being constituted instead as a [[United States territory|territory of the United States]]. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of [[Oregon]] dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the [[United States Congress]] enacted a law permitting the government of the then [[District of Alaska]] to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with [[Morningside Hospital (Oregon)|Morningside Hospital]], privately owned and operated by [[Henry Waldo Coe]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name="boyvey"&gt;Boyvey, Roger. "Mental Health and the Ultra-Concerned", ''Social Service Review'', 38:3 (1964:Sept.) p. 281-293.&lt;/ref&gt; A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a [[jury]] of six people, who would rule him sane or [[Insanity|insane]]. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.&lt;ref name="kominsky"&gt;[[Morris Kominsky|Kominsky, Morris]]. ''The hoaxers: plain liars, fancy liars, and damned liars'', p. 111-116. Branden Press, 1970. {{ISBN|0-8283-1288-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s it was recognized that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The [[American Medical Association]] conducted a series of studies in 1948, followed by a [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).&lt;ref name="boyvey" /&gt;

The studies recommended a comprehensive overhaul of the system, with the development of an in-territory mental health program for Alaska. This proposal was widely supported by the public and politicians. At the start of 1956, in the second session of the [[84th United States Congress|84th Congress]], Representative [[Edith Green]] (D-Oregon) introduced the Alaska Mental Health Bill (H.R. 6376) in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The bill had been written by Bob Bartlett, the [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Congressional Delegate]] from the Alaska Territory who later became a U.S. Senator.&lt;ref name="nickerson" /&gt; Senator [[Richard L. Neuberger]] (D-Oregon) sponsored an equivalent bill, S. 2518, in the Senate.

==Details of the bill==
The Alaska Mental Health Bill's stated purpose was to "transfer from the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] to the Territory of Alaska basic responsibility for the hospitalization, care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska." In connection with this goal, it aimed:

* to modernize procedures for such hospitalization (including commitment), care, and treatment and to authorize the Territory to modify or supersede such procedures;
* to assist in providing for the Territory necessary facilities for a comprehensive mental-health program in Alaska, including [[Patient#outpatient|inpatient and outpatient]] facilities;
* to provide for a land grant to the Territory to assist in placing the program on a firm long-term basis; and
* to provide for a ten-year program, of grants-in-aid to the Territory to enable the Territory gradually to assume the full operating costs of the program.&lt;ref name="hr6376"&gt;''Alaska Mental Health Bill'', H.R. 6376, January 16, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill provided for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan government in a number of phases, to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a [[grant-in-aid]]—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then be able to use the assets of the transferred land (principally [[mineral rights|mineral]] and [[forestry]] rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.&lt;ref name="kominsky" /&gt;

In addition, the bill granted the [[Governor of Alaska]] authority to enter into reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors of other states. Alaskans who became mentally ill in the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]] would be properly treated locally until they could be returned to Alaska; likewise, citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care there, before being returned to their home states.&lt;ref name="kominsky" /&gt;

The bill was seen as entirely innocuous when it was introduced on January 16, 1956. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20.&lt;ref name="kominsky" /&gt;

==Controversy==

===Initial opposition===
[[Image:Unholy three.png|right|thumb|Anti-mental hygiene flier issued in May 1955 by the Keep America Committee]]
In December 1955, a small [[Anticommunism|anti-communist]] women's group in [[Southern California]], the [[American Public Relations Forum]] (APRF), issued an urgent call to arms in its monthly bulletin. It highlighted the proposed text of the Alaska Mental Health Bill, calling it "one that tops all of them". The bulletin writers commented: "We could not help remembering that [[Siberia]] is very near Alaska and since it is obvious no one needs such a large land grant, we were wondering if it could be an American Siberia." They said that the bill "takes away all of the rights of the American citizen to ask for a jury trial and protect him[self] from being railroaded to an asylum by a greedy relative or 'friend' or, as the Alaska bill states, 'an interested party'."&lt;ref name="nickerson" /&gt;

The APRF had a history of opposing mental health legislation; earlier in 1955, it had played a key role in stalling the passage of three mental health bills in the [[California State Assembly|California Assembly]]. It was part of a wider network of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] organizations which opposed psychiatry and [[psychology]] as being pro-communist, [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]], [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] and pro-Jewish.&lt;ref name="nickerson" /&gt; The [[Keep America Committee]], another Californian "superpatriot" group, summed up the anti-mental health mood on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955. Calling "mental hygiene" part of the "unholy three" of the "Communistic World Government", it declared: "Mental Hygiene is a subtle and diabolical plan of the enemy to transform a free and intelligent people into a cringing horde of zombies".&lt;ref name="marmor"&gt;Marmor, Judd. "Psychodynamics of Group Opposition to Mental Health Programs", in ''Psychiatry in Transition''. Butterworth, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The APRF's membership overlapped with that of the much larger [[Minute Women of the U.S.A.]], a nationwide organization of militant anti-communist housewives which claimed up to 50,000 members across the United States. In mid-January 1956, Minute Woman Leigh F. Burkeland of [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys, California]] issued a bulletin protesting against the bill. It was [[mimeograph]]ed by the California State Chapter of the Minute Women and mailed across the nation. On January 24, 1956, the strongly anti-[[Statism|statist]] ''[[Orange County Register|Santa Ana Register]]'' newspaper reprinted Burkeland's statement under the headline, "Now — Siberia, U.S.A." Burkeland issued a lurid warning of what the future might hold if the Alaska Mental Health Bill was passed by the Senate:

{{quote|Is it the purpose of H.R. 6376 to establish a concentration camp for [[political prisoner]]s under the guise of treatment of mental cases? The answer, based on a study of the bill, indicates that it is entirely within the realm of possibility that we may be establishing in Alaska our own version of the Siberia slave camps run by the [[Soviet Union|Russian government]]. …

This legislation, say its opponents, will place every resident of the United States at the mercy of the whims and fancies of any person with whom they might have a disagreement, causing a charge of 'mental illness' to be placed against them, with immediate deportation to SIBERIA, U.S.A!&lt;ref&gt;"Now — Siberia, U.S.A.", ''Santa Ana Register'' (California), January 24, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Further opposition===
After the ''Santa Ana Register'' published its article, a nationwide network of activists began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill. The campaigners included, among other groups and individuals, the [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] Rev. [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]; [[Women for God and Country]]; the [[For America League]]; the Minute Women of the U.S.A.; the right-wing agitator [[Dan Smoot]]; the anti-Catholic former [[United States Army|US Army]] Brigadier General [[Herbert C. Holdridge]]; and [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Church of Scientology]], which had been founded only two years earlier.

Increasingly strong statements were made by the bill's opponents through the course of the spring and summer of 1956. In his February 17 bulletin, Dan Smoot told his subscribers: "I do not doubt that the Alaska Mental Health Act was written by sincere, well-intentioned men. Nonetheless, it fits into a sinister pattern which has been forming ever since the [[United Nations]] was organized."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin R. Epstein, Arnold Forster, ''Danger on the Right'', p. 141. Random House, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. George A. Snyder of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] sent a letter to all members of Congress in which he demanded an investigation of the Alaska Mental Health Bill's proponents for "elements of [[treason]] against the American people behind the front of the mental health program". The Keep America Committee of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] similarly called the proponents of the bill a "conspiratorial gang" that ought to be "investigated, impeached, or at least removed from office" for treason.&lt;ref name="nickerson" /&gt; Retired brigadier general [[Herbert C. Holdridge]] sent a public letter to President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] on March 12, in which he called the bill "a dastardly attempt to establish a concentration camp in the Alaskan wastes". He went on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This bill establishes a weapon of violence against our citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — far worse than the Siberian prison camps of the [[Tsar|Czar]]s or the Communists, or the violence of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] … The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who dominate the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and, through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.&lt;ref name="boyvey" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For their part, America's professional health associations (notably the American Medical Association and [[American Psychiatric Association]]) came out in favor of the bill. There was some initial opposition from the [[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]], a small and extremely conservative body which opposed [[socialized medicine]]; Dr. L. S. Sprague of [[Tucson, Arizona]] said in its March 1956 newsletter that the bill widened the definition of mental health to cover "everything from falling hair to ingrown toenails". However, the association modified its position after it became clear that the AMA took the opposite view.&lt;ref name="boyvey" /&gt;

By March 1956, it was being said in Washington, D.C. that the amount of correspondence on the bill exceeded anything seen since the previous high-water mark of public controversy, the [[Lend-Lease Act]] of 1941.&lt;ref name="nickerson" /&gt; Numerous letter-writers protested to their Congressional representatives that the bill was "[[antireligion|anti-religious]]" or that the land to be transferred to the Alaska Mental Health Trust would be fenced off and used as a concentration camp for the political enemies of various state governors.&lt;ref name="empire200256"&gt;"State Mental Health Bill Hearing Opens Proposal Criticized as 'Anti-Religious'". ''Daily Alaska Empire'', February 20, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known broadcaster [[Fulton Lewis]] described how he had "received, literally, hundreds of letters protesting bitterly against the bill. I have had telephone calls to the same effect from California, Texas and other parts of the country. Members of Congress report identical reactions."&lt;ref&gt;Fulton Lewis, Jr., "Criticize Alaska Health Bill", ''Chronicle-Telegram'' ([[Elyria, Ohio]]), March 15, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; A letter printed in the ''Daily Oklahoman'' newspaper in May 1956 summed up many of the arguments made by opponents of the bill:

{{quote|The advocates of [[world government]], who regard patriotism as the symptom of a diseased mind, took a step closer to their goal of compulsory asylum 'cure' for opponents of [[UNESCO]], when, on January 18, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Alaska Mental Health Act.

The Act was prepared by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], Department of the Interior and the socialist-oriented [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]]. It closely follows the Model Code, drafted by the American Psychiatric association, which has been working with the [[World Health Organization]], a specialized agency of the United Nations …

All of you who don't want members of your family railroaded to an asylum had better start writing your senator, now.&lt;ref&gt;"The People Speak", ''Daily Oklahoman'', March 13, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During February and March 1956, hearings were held before the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs]]. Proponents and opponents of the bill faced off in a series of tense exchanges, with strong accusations being made against the people and groups involved in the bill's introduction. Stephanie Williams of the American Public Relations Forum said that the bill would enable Russia to reclaim its former Alaskan territory: "[It] contains nothing to prevent Russia from buying the entire million acres — they already say Alaska belongs to them." &lt;ref name="empire210256"&gt;"Woman Sees 'Political Siberia' in Alaska Mental Health Bill". ''Daily Alaska Empire'', February 21, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the [[Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense]] castigated the slackness of Congress for not picking up on the bill's perceived dangers: "Those of us who have been in the study and research work of the United Nations, we feel that we are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all these things." John Kaspar, a [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Council]] organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in [[Clinton, Tennessee]], declared that "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing." He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to "usurp American nationality".&lt;ref name="kominsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marmor" /&gt;

===Passing the bill===
[[Image:BarryGoldwater.jpg|right|thumb|Senator Barry Goldwater, the sponsor of the final version of the Alaska Mental Health Bill]]
The arguments of the bill's opponents attracted little support in the Senate. The [[Presidency of Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]], the Alaska territorial government and mainstream religious groups were all in favor of the bill. The Alaska [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] gave the bill its unanimous support, issuing a statement declaring: "As Christian citizens of Alaska we believe this is a progressive measure for the care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska. We deplore the present antiquated methods of handling our mentally ill." It also urged the [[National Council of Churches]] to mobilize support for the bill.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://yukonpresbytery.com/YukonPresbytery/SpecialMinistries/HealthCare.htm Alaska Presbyterians And Health Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821083414/http://www.yukonpresbytery.com/YukonPresbytery/SpecialMinistries/HealthCare.htm |date=2006-08-21 }}", Yukon Presbytery. Retrieved 2007-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; An overwhelming majority of senators of both parties were also supportive. The bill's original author, Alaska Delegate Bob Bartlett, spoke for many of the bill's proponents when he expressed his bafflement at the response that it had received:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am completely at a loss in attempting to fathom the reasons why certain individuals and certain groups have now started a letter-writing campaign … to defeat the act. I am sure that if the letter writers would consult the facts, they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law but in working for its speedy passage and approval.&lt;ref name="nickerson" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other senators expressed similar mystification at the agitation against the bill. Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] stated that he was "at a loss" to see how the bill affected religion, as its opponents said.&lt;ref name="empire200256" /&gt; Senator [[Alan Bible]] of [[Nevada]], the acting chairman of the Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs, told the bill's opponents that nothing in the proposed legislation would permit the removal of any non-Alaskan to the territory for confinement.&lt;ref name="empire210256" /&gt;

Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of [[Arizona]] proposed an amended bill that removed the commitment procedures in Title I of the House bill and stated that "Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska, pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, of any mentally ill person who is not a resident of Alaska." In effect, this eliminated the bill's most controversial element—the provision for the transfer of mental patients from the lower 48 states to Alaska.&lt;ref name="kominsky" /&gt; The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater's lead that the bill be amended to strike all the controversial "detailed provisions for commitment, hospitalization, and care of the mentally ill of Alaska" included in Title I of the original House bill.  This amended proposal left only the transfer of responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the establishment of land grants to support this care. The committee stressed that they were not invalidating the Title I provisions of the original bill but that they had been misunderstood, a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill:&lt;blockquote&gt;However, the proposed provisions were misunderstood by many persons in parts of the country other than Alaska. Partly as a result of this misunderstanding, but more because the members of the committee are convinced that the people of Alaska are fully capable of drafting their own laws for a mental health program for Alaska, the committee concluded that authority should be vested in them in this field comparable to that of the States and other Territories.&lt;ref name="leghist"&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1956_Alaska_Mental_Health_Enabling_Act_legislative_history.pdf Legislative History, Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus amended, the Senate bill (S. 2973) was passed unanimously by the Senate on July 20, after only ten minutes of debate.&lt;ref name="nickerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boyvey" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the passage of the act, an Alaska Mental Health Trust was set up to administer the land and grants appropriated to fund the Alaskan mental health program. During the 1970s, the issue of the trust's land became increasingly controversial, with the state coming under increasing pressure to develop the land for private and recreational use. In 1978, the [[Alaska Legislature]] passed a law to abolish the trust and transfer the most valuable parcels of lands to private individuals and the government.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://touchngo.com/lglcntr/spclint/mht.htm Mental Health Trusts Land Litigation]", The Law Offices of James B. Gottstein and The Law Offices of David T. Walker, 2004. Accessed 2007-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, {{convert|40000|acre|km2|-1|}} had been conveyed to municipalities, {{convert|50000|acre|km2|-1}} transferred to individuals, and slightly over {{convert|350000|acre|km2|-2|}} designated as forests, parks or wildlife areas. Around 35 percent of the land trust remained unencumbered and in state ownership.&lt;ref name="about_trust"&gt;"[http://www.mhtrust.org/index.cfm/About-Us/Trust-History About the Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017171204/http://www.mhtrust.org/index.cfm/About-Us/Trust-History |date=2014-10-17 }}", Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, 2005. Accessed 2007-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Alaska resident Vern Weiss filed a lawsuit on behalf of his son, who required mental health services that were not available in Alaska. The case of ''Weiss v State of Alaska'' eventually became a [[class action]] lawsuit involving a range of mental health care groups. The [[Alaska Supreme Court]] ruled in 1985 that the abolition of the trust had been illegal and ordered it to be reconstituted. However, as much of the original land had been transferred away, the parties had to undergo a long and complex series of negotiations to resolve the situation. A final settlement was reached in 1994 in which the trust was reconstituted with {{convert|500000|acre|km2}} of original trust land, {{convert|500000|acre|km2|-2|}} of replacement land, and $200 million to replace lost income and assets.&lt;ref name="about_trust" /&gt;

==Scientology and the Alaska Mental Health Bill==

The Alaska Mental Health Bill plays a major part in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry. The Church participated in the campaign against the Bill and still refers to it as the "Siberia Bill". Scientology may also have provided an important piece of the "evidence" which the anti-bill campaigners used — a booklet titled ''Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics'', which has been widely attributed to the anonymous authorship of L. Ron Hubbard (''see [[Brainwashing Manual]]'').

===Scientology position===
The church's official website asserts that the bill was "psychiatry's attempt to establish a million-acre (4,000 km²) Siberia-type camp for mental health patients in Alaska, far from the prying eyes of civil libertarians"&lt;ref name="socialreform"&gt;"[http://www.scientology.org/world/worldeng/corp/rights.htm Standing Up for Human Rights: Social Reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103144259/http://www.scientology.org/world/worldeng/corp/rights.htm |date=2007-01-03 }}", Church of Scientology International. Retrieved 2007-02-19&lt;/ref&gt; which "presumably ... was far enough away from the well-traveled roads of the world to allow psychiatrists to conduct their mind control and other experiments on a captive population, unhindered by the glare of publicity."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientology.org/wis/WISENG/31/31-battl.HTM The Battle Mounts]", Church of Scientology International. Retrieved 2007-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; It would give psychiatrists the power to ensure that "Any man, woman or child could be seized and sent without trial to Alaska, deprived of human and civil rights and detained forever, all without trial or examination."&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, "[http://www.lronhubbard.org.mx/eng/fightrae/page084.htm A Reason Psychiatric Front Groups Attack Scientology]", February 27, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Church's ''[[Freedom (magazine)|Freedom Magazine]]'':

{{quote|the bill came to the attention of Scientologists in 1956, only two years after the Church of Scientology had been established. … Scientologists responded with a campaign to inform the public of the very real threat to personal liberties and freedom of speech posed by the measure. If passed, it would have created a potential "[[gulag]]" where political undesirables could be dumped and simply forgotten.

The hope of creating this psychiatric slave state was shattered by Scientologists. Refusing to allow vested interests to destroy the right of every citizen to freely speak his opinions without fear of retaliation they instituted a huge grassroots letter campaign. This alerted the Senate to public opposition and testimony was presented at Senate Committee hearings on the bill. Ultimately, except for granting a small amount of money for Alaska to continue "treating" its few existing mental patients, the Senate rejected the Siberia bill and it was never heard of again.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wieland, " Maintaining our Freedoms", ''Freedom'', Volume 28, Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Church officials have stated their belief that the American Psychiatric Association intensified its "interest in destroying [[Dianetics]] and Scientology organizations ... when the Church of Scientology actively opposed a bill whose introduction in Congress had been secure by the APA. ... The APA was well aware of who was behind the massive response that defeated the legislation, and they never forgot, as can be seen from some of the attacks its members generated."&lt;ref&gt;[[Heber C. Jentzsch]], "Scientology", p. 141 in ''New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America'', ed. Barry Hankins, Derek Davis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscavige on ''Nightline''===
Similarly, [[David Miscavige]], the church's leader, in 1992 told [[Ted Koppel]] in an interview on the ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' program:

{{quote|I don't know if you're aware that there was a plan in 1955 in this country, Ted, to repeat what was done in Russia. There was going to be a Siberia, U.S.A. set up on a million acres (4,000 km²) in Alaska to send mental patients. They were going to lessen the commitment laws, you could basically get into an argument with somebody and be sent up there. This sounds very odd. Nobody's ever heard about it. That's in no small part thanks to the Church of Scientology. I must say, though, that when that bill was killed in Congress, the war was on with psychiatry where they declared war on us …

It was a major, major, major flap for the psychiatrists when it got voted down, because then the slogan around the country began, 'Siberia U.S.A.,' and it was really the first time that psychiatry had been denigrated publicly, that they weren't the science that they had been promoting themselves to be. And they took it upon themselves then to start dealing with anybody who would oppose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Koppel | first = Ted | title = Scientology Leader Gave ABC First-Ever Interview | work = Nightline | publisher = ABCNews Internet Ventures | date = 1992-02-14 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=2664713 | accessdate = 2007-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Conspiracy theories===
In ''Ron's Journal 67'', Hubbard identified "the people behind the Siberia Bill", who he asserted were

:less than twelve men. They are members of the [[Bank of England]] and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains, and they are, oddly enough, directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have sprung up. Now these chaps are very interesting fellows: They have fantastically corrupt backgrounds; illegitimate children; government graft; a very unsavory lot. And they apparently, sometime in the rather distant past, had determined on a course of action. Being in control of most of the gold supplies of the planet, they entered upon a program of bringing every government to bankruptcy and under their thumb, so that no government would be able to act politically without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Ron's Journal 67'', lecture of September 20, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Miscavige, the bill was the product of a conspiracy by the American Psychiatric Association. In a public address in 1995, he told Scientologists that it was "in 1955 that the agents for the American Psychiatric Association met on Capitol Hill to ram home the infamous Siberia Bill, calling for a secret concentration camp in the wastes of Alaska." It was "here that Mr. Hubbard, as the leader of a new and dynamic religious movement, knocked that Siberia Bill right out of the ring — inflicting a blow they would never forget." &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientology-washingtondc.org/en_US/history/opening/pg001.html David Miscavige's Address from the Grand Opening of The Church of Scientology, D.C.]", October 21, 1995. Church of Scientology Washington, D.C. Retrieved 2007-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion that Scientologists defeated the bill is made frequently in Scientology literature.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. 1) "[http://www.dianetics.org/html/en_US/istore/section/index.html?minisite=10041&amp;section=10370 Dianetics Services and Books by L.

A less-than-alert Congress passed the bill unanimously in January 1956, but a massive campaign by SCIENTOLOGISTS and civil rights groups ultimately stopped it cold." Retrieved 2007-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the original version of the bill with the offending Title I commitment provisions only passed the House of Representatives; it was subsequently amended in conference to strike the commitment portion and retain the transfer of responsibility for mental health care. The revised bill passed easily without further changes.&lt;ref name="leghist" /&gt;

=== Contemporary publications ===
Contemporary Church publications suggest that although Hubbard was tracking progress of the bill at least as early as February 1956, Scientology did not become involved in the controversy until the start of March 1956, over two months after the American Public Relations Forum had first publicized the bill. A March "Professional Auditor's Bulletin" issued by Hubbard, who was staying in [[Dublin]] at the time, includes a telegram from his Washington-based son [[Ronald DeWolf|L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.]] and two other Scientologists alerting him to the upcoming February Senate hearings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;small&gt;HOUSE BILL 6376 PASSED JANUARY 18TH STOP GOES SENATE NEXT WEEK STOP BILL PERMITS ADMISSION OF PERSON TO MENTAL INSTITUTION BY WRITTEN APPLICATION OF INTERESTED PERSON BEFORE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS ARE HELD STOP DISPENSES WITH REQUIREMENT THAT PATIENT BE PRESENT AT HEARING STOP ANYONE CAN BE EXCLUDED FROM HEARING STOP BILL PERTAINS TO ALASKA AT MOMENT STOP BILL SETS UP ONE MILLION ACRES SIBERIAL{{Sic}} IN ALASKA FOR INSTITUTIONS STOP LETTER AND BILL FOLLOW STOP WHAT ACTION YOU WANT TAKEN.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Hubbard, in Professional Auditor's Bulletin No. 74, March 6, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the church says that Scientologists led the opposition to the bill, the ''[[Congressional Record]]'''s account of the Senate hearings into the bill does not mention the church. A contemporary review of the opposition to the bill likewise attributes the lead role elsewhere and to right-wing groups, rather than the "civil liberties" organizations cited by the church:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only a few organized groups got behind the hue and cry. Most influential was the libertarian Association of Physicians and Surgeons, and Dan Smoot's newsletter. Right-wing groups bombarded Congress with protests and demands for hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Herbert, "Alaska Mental Health Bill Fight Recounted", ''Lima News'' ([[Lima, Ohio]]), October 29, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Roman government}}

'''''Auctoritas''''' is a [[Latin]] word which is the origin of English "[[authority]]". While historically its use in English was restricted to discussions of the political [[history of Rome]], the beginning of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] philosophy in the 20th century expanded the use of the word.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

In [[ancient Rome]], ''Auctoritas'' referred to the general level of prestige a person had in Roman society, and, as a consequence, his clout, influence, and ability to rally support around his will. ''Auctoritas'' was not merely political, however; it had a [[numinous]] content and symbolized the mysterious "power of command" of heroic Roman figures.

Noble women could also achieve a degree of Auctoritas. For example, the wives, sisters, and mothers of the Julio-Claudians had immense influence on society, the masses, and the political apparatus. Their Auctoritas was exercised less overtly than their male counterparts due to Roman societal norms, but they were powerful nonetheless.

==Etymology and origin==
According to French linguist [[Emile Benveniste]], ''auctor'' (which also gives us English "[[author]]") is derived from Latin ''[[Wikt:augeo|augeō]]'' ("to augment", "to enlarge", "to enrich"). The ''auctor'' is "''is qui auget''", the one who augments the act or the [[juridical]] situation of another.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bradstreet Greenough|J. B. Greenough]] disputes this etymology of ''auctor'' - but not the sense of foundation and augmentation - in "Latin Etymologies", ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', Vol. 4, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Auctor'' in the sense of "author", comes from ''auctor'' as founder or, one might say, "planter-cultivator". Similarly, ''auctoritas'' refers to rightful [[ownership]], based on one's having "produced" or [[homestead principle|homesteaded]] the article of property in question - more in the sense of "sponsored" or "acquired" than "manufactured". This ''auctoritas'' would, for example, persist through an ''[[usucapio]]'' of ill-gotten or abandoned property.

==Political meaning in Ancient Rome==
Politically, ''auctoritas'' was connected to the [[Roman Senate|Roman Senate's]] authority (''auctoritas patrum''), not to be confused with [[potestas]] or [[imperium]] ([[political power|power]]), which were held by the [[magistratus|magistrates]] or the [[plebs|people]]. In this context, ''Auctoritas'' could be defined as the juridical power to authorize some other act.

The 19th-century [[classicist]] [[Theodor Mommsen]] describes the "force" of ''auctoritas'' as "more than advice and less than command, an advice which one may not safely ignore." [[Cicero]] says of power and authority, ''"Cum potestas in populo auctoritas in senatu sit."'' ("While power resides in the people, authority rests with the Senate.")&lt;ref&gt;De leg. 3. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private domain, those under tutelage (guardianship), such as women and minors, were similarly obliged to seek the sanction of their ''tutors'' ("protectors") for certain actions. Thus, ''auctoritas'' characterizes the ''auctor'': The [[pater familias]] ''authorizes'' – that is, validates and legitimates – his son's wedding ''in prostate''. In this way, ''auctoritas'' might function as a kind of "passive counsel", much as, for example, a scholarly authority.

===Auctoritas principis===
After the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], during the days of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] had the title of [[princeps]] ("first citizen" of Rome) and held the ''auctoritas principis'' – the supreme [[moral authority]] – in conjunction with the imperium and potestas – the military, judiciary and administrative powers.

==Middle Ages==
The notion of auctoritas was often invoked by the papacy during the Middle Ages, in order to secure the [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] of the Pope. [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] most famously invoked auctoritas in order to depose kings and emperors and to try to establish a papal [[theocracy]].

== Hannah Arendt ==&lt;!--Linked from 'Hannah Arendt'--&gt;
[[Hannah Arendt]] considered ''auctoritas'' a reference to founding acts as the source of political authority in Ancient Rome. She took foundation to include (as ''augeō'' suggests), the continuous conservation and increase of principles handed down from "the beginning" (see also [[pietas (virtue)|pietas]]). According to Arendt, this source of authority was rediscovered in the course of the 18th-century [[American Revolution]] (see "United States of America" under [[Founding Fathers]]), as an alternative to an intervening [[Western culture|Western tradition]] of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], claiming absolute authority, as from [[God]] (see [[Divine Right of Kings]]), and later from [[Natural law|Nature]], [[Nous|Reason]], [[Historical Materialism|History]], and even, as in the [[French Revolution]], [[Revolution]] itself (see [[Reign of Terror|La Terreur]]). Arendt views a crisis of authority as common to both the American and French Revolutions, and the response to that crisis a key factor in the relative success of the former and failure of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, On Revolution, Chapter 5, Section 2. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arendt further considered the sense of ''auctor'' and ''auctoritas'' in various Latin [[idiom]]s, and the fact that ''auctor'' was used in contradistinction to – and (at least by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]) held in higher esteem than – ''artifices'', the [[artisan]]s to whom it might fall to "merely" build up or implement the author-founder's vision and design.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, Between Past and Future, Chapter 3, Section IV. (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">An '''automatic faucet''' or '''tap''' (also '''hands-free faucet''', '''touchless faucet''', '''electronic faucet''', '''motion sensing faucet''', '''sensor faucet''', or '''infrared faucet''') is a [[faucet]] equipped with a [[proximity sensor]] and mechanism that opens its [[valve]] to allow water to flow in response to the presence of a hand or hands in close proximity. The faucet closes its valve again after a few seconds or when it no longer detects the presence of hands. Most automatic faucets are battery powered and incorporate an [[active infrared sensor]] to detect hand motion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Automatic Faucet|url = http://www.byoh.com/automaticfaucets.htm|website = www.byoh.com|accessdate = 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Automatic faucets are common in [[public toilet|public washrooms]], particularly in airports and hotels, where they are supposed to reduce water consumption&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (however, some evidence to the contrary&lt;ref name=savings&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Sensor-Activated Commercial Faucets Save Water?|url=http://www.allianceforwaterefficiency.org/Faucet_Fixtures_Introduction.aspx|website=Alliance for Water Efficiency|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been published) and reduce the transmission of [[pathogen|disease causing microbes]].&lt;ref name=Guide2Faucets&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guide2faucets.com/faucet-types/specialized/sensor-automatic.aspx |title=Automatic faucets is a water conservation faucet |publisher=Guide2faucets |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501151042/http://www.guide2faucets.com/faucet-types/specialized/sensor-automatic.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be found in some [[kitchen]]s and in the washrooms of some private residences. Other uses include providing drinking water to pets or [[livestock]], whereby the presence of an animal allows water to flow into a [[watering trough]] or dish.

==History==
Automatic faucets were first developed in the 1950s but were not produced for [[commerce|commercial]] use until the late 1980s when they first appeared to the general public at airport lavatories. They have gradually become commonplace in [[Developed country|more developed countries]].
Because of their assistive [[Quality (business)|qualities]], automatic faucets are often found at assistive living establishments and places where the elderly and handicapped individuals call home. Automatic faucets are water saving devices, helping save 70% of the water that would otherwise swirl down the drain unused and conserve as much as 3-5% of the water used by a standard [[household]]. Other benefits of automatic faucets are found in inhibiting the spread of germs which are known to thrive on faucet handles, as well as help prevent or mitigate scalding incidents caused by [[hot water]] flowing out of the faucet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MAC FAUCETS Background on Sensor Faucet History |url=http://www.macfaucets.com/education.htm |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007121913/http://www.macfaucets.com/education.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Automatic faucets have the advantage of shutting off automatically after [[hand washing]], thereby reducing [[water waste]]. When installed in a home, sensor faucets alleviate the need for parents to ensure that children have turned off the faucet. They can also benefit the elderly and those suffering from [[arthritis]] or other mobility limiting conditions since there are no [[Handle (grip)|handles]] to twist or pull. Their automatic shutoff mechanism also greatly reduces the risk of sink overflow due to a faucet being left on either inadvertently or deliberately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ronn|first1=Julian|title=Guidelines and Comprehensive Explanation of the system of Kitchen Faucet|url=http://www.faucetmag.com/|website=Faucet Magazine|accessdate=26 June 2016|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cellana, Inc.''' is a Hawaii- and San Diego-based developer of [[algae]]-based [[bioproducts]] for high-value [[nutrition]], [[ink]], and [[bioenergy]] applications, including [[Omega-3]] nutraceutical applications, sustainable [[ink]], [[aquaculture]] and [[animal feeds]], human [[food]] ingredients, [[pigments]], specialty [[chemicals]], and [[biofuels]].  Cellana has received (or has been a member of consortia that have received) multiple multimillion-dollar grants from the [[United States Department of Energy]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture]].  In 2018, Cellana and POS Bio-Sciences announced the signing of a letter of intent for the joint development and commercialization of high-value EPA Omega-3 oils from Cellana’s algae biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-pos-bio-sciences-sign-letter-of-intent-for-the-joint-development-and-commercialization-of-high-value-algae-biomass-for-epa-omega-3s/&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, the [[United States Department of Energy]] published a funding opportunity announcement in which Cellana's lead commercial algae strains KA32 and CO46, and the biomass yields demonstrated from these strains as part of the DOE-funded Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership (ATP3), were designated as DOE's "State of Technology" for the photosynthetic algae sector in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Available at Page 7 of the FOA, which can be found at https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx?Search=PEAK&amp;SearchType=#FoaId7e516e41-db54-4c51-a274-48604245e917/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Cellana and Living Ink Technologies announced the signing of a letter of intent for the joint development and commercialization of inks containing Cellana’s renewable algae biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-living-ink-enter-into-a-joint-development-and-offtake-agreement-for-sustainable-algae-inks//&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Cellana and [[Neste Oil]], the world's largest refiner of [[renewable diesel]], announced the signing of a multi-year, commercial-scale off-take agreement for algae-based biocrude oil.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-neste-oil-enter-into-multi-year-commercial-scale-off-take-agreement-for-algae-oil-feedstock-for-biofuels/&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellana, Inc. was founded in 2004 as HR BioPetroleum, Inc. and changed its name to Cellana, Inc. in May 2011. On January 31, 2011, Cellana LLC, a joint venture company formed by Royal Dutch Shell and HR BioPetroleum in 2007, became a wholly owned subsidiary of HR BioPetroleum, Inc./Cellana, Inc. Shell had previously announced on December 11, 2007 that it entered into a joint venture with HR BioPetroleum to, among other things, build and operate a demonstration facility in Hawaii for growing [[algae fuel|algae as a source of biofuels]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=54866&lt;/ref&gt;  This 2.5-hectare facility, known as the [[Kona Demonstration Facility]] (KDF), was completed and commissioned in 2009.

The original goal of the facility was to cultivate algae in [[photobioreactor]]s and [[raceway pond|open raceway ponds]] filled with seawater using a proprietary process, then harvest the algae and extract oil for conversion into fuels such as biodiesel and utilize the residual high protein algae meal for additional co-products.

KDF is located on a 2.5-hectare (6-acre) parcel of land leased from the [[Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority]] (NELHA), which is located on the west shore of the island of Hawaii.  NELHA pipes in a constant supply of fresh ocean water. NELHA was originally built to support a DOE project for ocean thermal energy conversion, and it continues to employ the project's seawater supply pipes to support a variety of research projects and commercial enterprises, including facilities that currently grow and harvest [[microalgae]] for pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements.

Cellana's facility grows only non-genetically modified, marine [[microalgae]] species using proprietary technology.

In the USA, a '''chartered mark''' is a [[trademark]] or [[service mark]] which is given special statutory protection separate from the usual registration of trade marks and service marks.  A chartered mark, in effect, is a type of trademark/servicemark in which the organization is granted the mark "by [[charter]]", i.e. by express grant of the [[legislature]].  When an organization is granted a chartered mark, no one else may use the same mark at all for any purpose.  (There are possible exceptions for organizations using the same or a similar mark before it was chartered.)

Examples of chartered marks in the [[United States]] include '''FDIC''' for the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]; '''Boy Scouts''' and '''Girl Scouts''' for the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], respectively; and '''Olympic''' for the [[United States Olympic Committee]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8717">The '''child-saving movement''' emerged in the United States during the nineteenth century and influenced the development of the [[juvenile justice system]]. Child savers stressed the value of redemption and prevention through early identification of deviance and intervention in the form of education and training.

[[Humanitarianism]] and [[altruism]] were not the only motivating factors for the child-savers. There are suggestions that an additional and perhaps overriding aim was to expand control over poor and immigrant children.

The child savers were 20th-century progressive era reformers whose intent was to mitigate the roots of child delinquency and to change the treatment of juveniles under the justice system.&lt;ref name="Child or Adult. PBS Frontline"&gt;Child or Adult. PBS Frontline&lt;/ref&gt; These women reformers organized in 1909 to stem the tide of 10,000 young offenders who passed annually through the city's court system. The greatest accomplishment of the child savers was the creation of the first [[juvenile court]] which appeared in Cook County, Illinois in 1899. This court was founded on two principles both highly advocated by the Child Savers.  These two principles were formed on the basis that "juveniles were not ready to be held accountable for their actions" and "that they were not fully developed and could rehabilitate easier than adults".&lt;ref name="Child or Adult. PBS Frontline"/&gt; This issue of [[juvenile delinquency]] was a big issue between the 19th and the 20th centuries, therefore the contributions of the child savers, both good and bad are evident in their history. Also the establishment of juvenile courts in cities across the United States was one of the earliest social welfare reforms of the Progressive Era, and represented a major change in the way in which the law dealt with wayward children.&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, J. Elizabeth. The Chicago Juvenile Court Movement&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of the juvenile court idea, and of the juvenile court movement, is the recognition of the obligation of the great mother state to her neglected and errant children, and her obligation to deal with them as children and wards, rather than to class them as criminals and drive them by harsh measures into the ranks of vice and crime.&lt;ref&gt;

==Results of the child savers ==
The child savers received both positive and negative feedback for their activism. On the one hand they were heavily criticised for being too radical, while on the other they were praised for their revolutionary efforts.  Nonetheless, the child savers brought about a new realization of [[humanism]] throughout this time period. Within Hull House that Jane Addams formed went forth with a commanding reform movement, thus defying middle class standards of appropriate behavior for women. America responded to the terrible ills of juvenile delinquency largely because of Jane Addams push to change their social construction. The Juvenile Protective Association, the first juvenile court in the United States, and a Juvenile [[Psychopathic]] Clinic. By the twenties, the leading edge of [[child protection]] had shifted from the [[Youth Justice Court]] to welfare agencies, and the JPA moved with it and now located on the North Side, the JPA continues to serve as a vital center of social work and advocacy on behalf of child and family welfare in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;

==Positive outcomes==
A major activist among the child savers was [[Jane Addams]]. She put forth many contributions from her work with the child savers including the first [[Hull House]] which was one of the first settlement houses as well as a woman's sociological institution.  Another contribution is the invention of the [[Juvenile Protective Association]] (JPA).  This institution was also established by Jane Addams which functions as a social welfare agency. Thus the understanding gained by the Hull House residents in acting as probation officers further persuaded that the existing system as regards children was inadequate and inconsistent. Followed by Jane Addams, Elizabeth Clapp established Chicago Woman's Club, in 1876 as traditional materialists. She describes their efforts as volunteer matrons in the city jail and police stations and as volunteer probation officers or social workers in court, their creation of a jail school and a charitable boarding school for neglected children.&lt;ref&gt;Clapp J. Elizabeth. ''Mothers of All Children: Women Reformers and the Rise of Juvenile Courts in Progressive-Era America''&lt;/ref&gt; Clapp's work is valuable for demonstrating the formative, if informal, role women have played in advocacy for children.

==Negative effects==
Although there were many positive outcomes to result from the child savers movement, there were also many misfortunes. Many scholars believe that the child savers promoted altruism and guidance but then others say: "the child savers should in no sense be considered libertarians or humanists".&lt;ref&gt;Platt, Anthony. ''The Child Savers: The Invention of Delinquency''&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the research that the indiscriminate arrest, indeterminate sentencing, military drill, and hard labor were the concrete results of their reforms.&lt;ref name="Hefner, Keith. The Child Savers"&gt;Hefner, Keith. ''The Child Savers''&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was that the child savers tried to promote liberating the 'delinquent' children from the capitalism movement that wished to stem the "militant" wave through a new political economy,&lt;ref name="Anthony Platt 1977"&gt;Anthony Platt 1977&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in tighter supervision and control from adults.&lt;ref name="Hefner, Keith. The Child Savers"/&gt; According to Anthony Platt,&lt;ref name="Anthony Platt 1977"/&gt; the child-saving movement came from the upper and middle classes who were instrumental in incorporating new methods of social control on a largely immigrant class—the immigrant class was seen as inferior to the typical Protestant white ethic that comprised most of the US.

{{US Constitution article series}}
The '''Citizenship Clause''' is the first sentence of Section 1 in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which was adopted on July 9, 1868. It states that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." This clause represented [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s reversal of a portion of the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision which had declared that [[African American]]s were not and could not become citizens of the United States or enjoy any of the privileges and immunities of citizenship.

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] had already granted U.S. citizenship to all persons born in the United States "not subject to any foreign power". The [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]] proposed the principle underlying the Citizenship Clause due to concerns expressed about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act during floor debates in Congress.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=070/llcg070.db&amp;recNum=702 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howard3&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=16 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2896.&lt;/ref&gt; The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment sought to entrench the principle in the Constitution in order to prevent its being struck down by the Supreme Court or repealed by a future Congress.&lt;ref name=howard3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'', {{Ussc|169|649|1898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
Section 1, Clause 1, of the Fourteenth Amendment, reads: 
{{quote|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.}}

==Naturalization==
The reference to [[naturalization]] in the Citizenship Clause is to the process by which immigrants are granted [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizenship]]. Congress has power in relation to naturalization under the ''[[United States nationality law|Naturalization Clause]]'' in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Enumerated powers|Article I, Section 8, Clause 4]] of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, Carla. "Naturalization Law, Immigration Flow, and Policy" in ''Transforming America: Perspectives on U.S. Immigration'', Volume 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2HvAHGE4n-EC&amp;pg=PA149 p. 149] (Michael LeMay ed., ABC-CLIO, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrett Epps|Epps, Garrett]]. ''The Citizenship Clause: A "Legislative History"''. 60 American University Law Review 331, 352 (2010). "This language [in the Civil Rights Act of 1866] is significant but does not directly demonstrate anything about the 'clear intent' of the Citizenship Clause. First, it is a statute, enacted under the authority of some combination of the Naturalization Clause and the Thirteenth Amendment; the Fourteenth Amendment is a change to the Constitution, creating entirely new rights and providing government with new powers."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', 387 U.S. 253, 258 (1967).  "Therefore, a bill was introduced [in 1818] to provide that a person could voluntarily relinquish his citizenship by declaring such relinquishment in writing before a district court and then departing from the country.  The opponents of the bill argued that Congress had no constitutional authority, either express or implied, under either the Naturalization Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause, to provide that a certain act would constitute expatriation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha]]'', 462 U.S. 919, 940 (1983).  "It is also argued that these cases present a nonjusticiable political question, because Chadha is merely challenging Congress' authority under the Naturalization Clause, U.S.Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, and the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S.Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 18."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In contrast to the aforementioned sources, ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines "Naturalization Clause" as being equivalent to the Citizenship Clause.  See {{cite encyclopedia | title=Naturalization Clause | encyclopedia=Black's Law Dictionary | editor-last = Epps | editor-first = Garrett | editor-link=Garrett Epps | edition=9th | year=2009 | publisher=[[West Publishing]] | location=[[St. Paul, Minnesota]] | isbn=978-0-314-19949-2 | page=1126 | quote='''Naturalization Clause.''' The constitutional provision stating that every person born or naturalized in the United States is a citizen of the United States and of the state of residence.  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  See jus soli.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate debate==
The text of the Citizenship Clause was first offered in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] as an amendment to Section 1 of the [[joint resolution]] as passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House]].

There are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment.&lt;ref name=nyt96&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/07/us/citizenship-proposal-faces-obstacle-in-the-constitution.html |journal=New York Times |title=Citizenship Proposal Faces Obstacle in the Constitution |last=Robert |first=Pear |date=1996-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Citizenship Clause was intended to define as citizens exactly those so defined in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Act]],&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe],'' 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]] said in the debate: "Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign Power{{mdash}}for that, no doubt, is the meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before us{{mdash}}shall be considered as citizens of the United States ... If there are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time were subject to the authority of the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; which had been debated and passed in the same session of Congress only several months earlier, the clause's author, Senator [[Jacob M. Howard]] of Michigan, phrased it a little differently. In particular, the two exceptions to citizenship by birth for everyone born in the United States mentioned in the Act, namely, that they had to be "not subject to any foreign power" and not "Indians not taxed", were combined into a single qualification, that they be "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States, and while Howard and others, such as [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman]] [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois, the author of the Civil Rights Act, believed that the formulations were equivalent, others, such as Senator [[James R. Doolittle]] from Wisconsin, disagreed, and pushed for an alternative wording.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2890, 2892-3, 2896.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no recorded debate over who was encompassed by the expression "not subject to any foreign power" or whether these same people were excluded by the wording of the Citizenship Clause. Howard, when introducing the addition to the Amendment, stated that it was "the law of the land already" and that it excluded only "persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers".&lt;ref name=howard&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2890.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2897.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trumbull&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=070/llcg070.db&amp;recNum=702 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 572. During the debate on the Civil Rights Act, Trumbull stated, "The Senator from Missouri and myself desire to arrive at the same point precisely, and that is to make citizens of everybody born in the United States who owe allegiance to the United States. We cannot make a citizen of a child of a foreign minister who is temporarily residing here. There is a difficulty in framing the amendment [to the Act] so as to make citizens of all people born in the United States who owe allegiance to it. I thought that might perhaps be the best form in which to put the amendment at one time, 'That all persons born in the United States and owing allegiance thereto are hereby declared to be citizens'; but upon investigation it was found that a sort of allegiance was due to the country from persons temporarily resident in it whom we would have no right to make citizens, and that that form would not answer."&lt;/ref&gt; However, concerning the children born in the United States to parents who are not U.S. citizens (and not foreign diplomats), three senators, including Trumbull, as well as [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Citizenship Clause would confer citizenship on them at birth,&lt;ref name=trumbullcowan&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 498. The debate on the Civil Rights Act contained the following exchange:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Mr. Cowan: I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?
Mr. Trumbull: Undoubtedly.
...
Mr. Trumbull: I should like to inquire of my friend from Pennsylvania, if the children of Chinese now born in this country are not citizens?
Mr. Cowan: I think not.
Mr. Trumbull: I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens.
Mr. Cowan: The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument.
Mr. Trumbull: If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European.&lt;/poem&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1944 See veto message] by President Andrew Johnson.&lt;/ref&gt; and no senator offered a contrary opinion. Trumbull even went so far as to assert that this was already true prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act, although Senator [[Edgar Cowan]] of Pennsylvania, disagreed, arguing that this was only true for the children of European immigrants.&lt;ref name=trumbullcowan /&gt; Senator [[John Conness]] of California expressed support for the Amendment for giving a constitutional basis for birthright citizenship to all children born in the United States to any parentage (including Chinese noncitizen residents who do not intend to reside permanently in the United States), even though he (and others) thought it had already been guaranteed by the Act,&lt;ref name=conness&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2891. During the debate on the Amendment, Conness declared, "The proposition before us, I will say, Mr. President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law [the Civil Rights Act]; now it is proposed to incorporate that same provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage, whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal Civil Rights with other citizens." He further added that "they [the Chinese] all return to their own country at some time or other".&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Cowan opposed the Amendment (and Act), arguing that it would have the undesirable outcome of extending citizenship to the children of Chinese and [[Romani people|Romani]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891-2. Cowan expressed concern over the prospect of a state not being able to determine its own citizens. In particular, he identified two groups that he felt were unsuitable for citizenship but would have such bestowed upon their children by the Amendment: Chinese and Gypsies, the latter of which he described thus, "who owe to her [Pennsylvania] no allegiance; who pretend to owe none; who recognized no authority in her government; who have a distinct, independent government of their own&amp;nbsp;...; who pay no taxes; who never perform military service; who do nothing, in fact, which becomes the citizen, and perform none of the duties which devolve upon him, but, on the other hand, have no homes, pretend to own no land, live nowhere, settle as trespassers where ever they go." He subsequently cautioned against adopting the proposed Amendment, "Are these people, by a constitutional amendment, to be put out of the reach of the State in which they live? ... If the mere fact of being born in a country confers that right then they will have it. ... Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be a citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less pestiferous to society than I look upon Gypsies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the debate on this section of the Amendment centered on whether the wording in the Civil Rights Act or Howard's proposal more effectively excluded Indians on reservations and in U.S. territories from citizenship. Doolittle asserted, and Senators [[Reverdy Johnson]] of Maryland and [[Thomas A. Hendricks]] of Indiana concurred, that all Indians were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, so that the phrase "Indians not taxed" would be preferable,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2893-4.&lt;/ref&gt; but Trumbull and Howard disputed this, arguing that the U.S. government did not have full jurisdiction over Indian tribes, which governed themselves and made treaties with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=14 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman]] [[Lyman Trumbull]], participating in the debate, stated the following: "What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means." He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by "complete jurisdiction": "Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in court? ... We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction. ... If we want to control the Navajoes, or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense?. ... Would he [Sen. Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations? Does the Government of the United States pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and other crimes committed by one Indian upon another? ... It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howard2&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=16 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2895. Howard additionally stated the word jurisdiction meant "the same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of the United States now" and that the United States possessed a "full and complete jurisdiction" over the person described in the amendment.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they objected to the phrase "Indians not taxed" on the basis that it could be construed as making citizenship dependent on wealth and also that it would allow states to manipulate who is a citizen in their state through tax policy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2894-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birthright citizenship==
{{Main article|Birthright citizenship in the United States}}
The provisions in Section 1 have been interpreted to the effect that children born on United States soil, with very few exceptions, are U.S. citizens. This type of guarantee&amp;mdash;legally termed ''[[jus soli]]'', or "right of the territory"&amp;mdash;does not exist in most of Europe, Asia or the Middle East, although it is part of English [[common law]]&lt;ref&gt;Today [[British nationality law|British nationality]] is defined in statute, which supersedes the common law.&lt;/ref&gt; and is common in the Americas.

Two Supreme Court precedents were set by the cases of ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', {{Ussc|112|94|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]''.&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; ''Elk v. Wilkins'' established that Indian tribes represented independent political powers with no allegiance to the United States, and that their peoples were under a special jurisdiction of the United States. Children born to these Indian tribes therefore did not automatically receive citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment if they voluntarily left their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urofsky |first=Melvin I. |author2=Finkelman, Paul |title=A March of Liberty: A Constitutional History of the United States |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York, NY |year=2002 |volume=1 |isbn=0-19-512635-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQVDZ9jg8m0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian tribes that paid taxes were exempt from this ruling; their peoples were already citizens by an earlier act of Congress, and all non-citizen Indians were subsequently made citizens by the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]].

In ''Wong Kim Ark'' the Supreme Court held that, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a man born within the United States to foreigners (in that case, Chinese citizens) who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States&lt;ref name="Wong"/&gt; and who were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power, was a citizen of the United States. More broadly, the court characterized the statement, ''All persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States'' as "the broad and clear words of the Constitution", ruling that Wong's U.S. citizenship had been acquired by birth and had not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|169|649|1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 [[Congressional Research Service]] report observed that, though it could be argued that Congress has no power to define "subject to the jurisdiction" and the terms of citizenship in a manner contrary to the Supreme Court's understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment as expressed in ''Wong Kim Ark'' and ''Elk'', since Congress does have broad power to pass necessary and proper legislation to regulate naturalization under the Constitution, Art. I, § 8, cls. 4 &amp; 18 of the constitution Congress arguably has the power to define "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" for the purpose of regulating immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/147254.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203090537/https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/147254.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-03|title=Birthright Citizenship Under the 14th Amendment of Persons Born in the United States to Alien Parents|date=August 12, 2010|publisher=Congressional Research Service|page=15 (page 18 of the PDF)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Eric Foner]] has explored the question of birthright citizenship and argues that "birthright citizenship stands as an example of the much-abused idea of American exceptionalism...birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. No European nation recognizes the principle."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner,
[http://www.thenation.com/article/birthright-citizenship-is-the-good-kind-of-american-exceptionalism/ "Birthright Citizenship Is the Good Kind of American Exceptionalism," ''The Nation'' Aug. 27, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of citizenship==
The Fourteenth Amendment does not provide any procedure for revocation of United States citizenship. Under the Supreme Court precedent of ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', loss of 14th-Amendment-based U.S. citizenship is possible only under the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' {{Ussc|387|253|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fraud in the naturalization process. Technically this is not loss of citizenship, but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant ''never was'' a U.S. citizen.
* Voluntary relinquishment of citizenship. This may be accomplished either through renunciation procedures specially established by the [[State Department]] or through other actions (''e.g.'', [[treason]]) which demonstrate an intention to give up U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Department, ''[https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Dual Nationality]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416013437/http://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html |date=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an act of [[expatriate|expatriation]] ''must'' be accompanied by an intent to terminate United States citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=444&amp;invol=252 444 U.S. 252] (1980): "As we have said, Afroyim requires that the record support a finding that the expatriating act was accompanied by an intent to terminate United States citizenship."&lt;/ref&gt;
For [[jus sanguinis]] U.S. citizenship, i.e., citizenship for the children born abroad of U.S. citizen parents, which is established only by congressional statute and not the U.S. Constitution (including its amendments), these restrictions do not apply (e.g., cf. ''[[Rogers v. Bellei]]'', 401 U.S. 815 (1971)).

==Right to travel==

In ''[[Saenz v. Roe]]'', the Supreme Court held that this clause protects an aspect of the [[right to travel]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saenz v. Roe]]'', {{Ussc|526|489|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the ''Saenz'' Court said that the Citizenship Clause protects a citizen's right to resettle in other states and then be treated equally:

{{quote|[T]he Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment expressly equates citizenship with residence: "That Clause does not provide for, and does not allow for, degrees of citizenship based on length of residence." ''Zobel'', 457 U. S., at 69. It is equally clear that the Clause does not tolerate a hierarchy of 45 subclasses of similarly situated citizens based on the location of their prior residence. … [T]he protection afforded to the citizen by the Citizenship Clause of that Amendment is a limitation on the powers of the National Government as well as the States.}}

The ''Saenz'' Court also mentioned the majority opinion in the ''[[Slaughterhouse Cases]]'', which had stated that "a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Slaughterhouse Cases]]'', {{Ussc|83|36|1873}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural-born citizens==
{{Main article|Natural born citizen}}

The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (OED) at "natural-born" defines it as a person who becomes a citizen at birth (as opposed to becoming one later).  It lists this definition as going back to the 16th century. OED cites a law of 1695 (Act 7 &amp; 8 Will. III (1696) 478) that states, "A Natural born Subject of this Realm...Who shall be willing to Enter and Register himself for the Service of His Majesty."  It also quotes Thomas Jefferson 1776 (in T. Jefferson Public Papers 344): "All persons who..propose to reside..and who shall subscribe the fundamental laws, shall be considered as residents and entitled to all the rights of persons natural born." ''Blacks Law Dictionary'' (10th Edition) defines 'Natural Born Citizen' as "A person born within the jurisdiction of a national government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = citizen | encyclopedia = Black's Law Dictionary | publisher = Thompson Reuters | date = 2009 | edition = 10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Webster's International Dictionary'' (3rd edition, 2000) defines "natural-born" as " especially: having the legal status of citizen or subject."
 
Section 1 of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]] requires that a candidate for [[President of the United States]] be a "natural-born citizen." According to a former edition of the [[US Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual]]: "the fact that someone is a natural born citizen pursuant to a statute does not necessarily imply that he or she is such a citizen for Constitutional purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220081206/https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1130.html |title=7 FAM 1131.6-2 Eligibility for Presidency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority opinion by Justice [[Horace Gray]] in ''United States v. Wong Kim Ark'' observed that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The constitution nowhere defines the meaning of these words ["citizen" and "natural born citizen"], either by way of inclusion or of exclusion, except in so far as this is done by the affirmative declaration that 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.'&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  This observation by Gray about the term "natural-born citizen" was ''[[obiter dicta]]'', since the case did not involve any controversy about presidential eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sen Hu and Jlellin Dong, eds.|title=The Rocky Road to Liberty: A Documented History of Chinese Immigration and Exclusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xku7xvAMDowC&amp;pg=PA189|year=2010|publisher=Javvin |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes between consumers and businesses that are [[arbitration|arbitrated]] are resolved by an independent neutral arbitrator rather than in court.  Although parties can agree to arbitrate a particular dispute after it arises or may agree that the award is [[non-binding arbitration|non-binding]], most consumer arbitrations occur pursuant to a pre-dispute [[arbitration clause]] where the arbitrator's award is binding.&lt;ref name=rutledge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rutledge|first=Peter B.|authorlink=Peter B.

In the United States, there is an ongoing debate over the use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts.  Differences between arbitration and litigation include the costs of resolving a case, the speed of resolution, and the procedure of resolving a case, including how and where the arbitration is conducted and the availability of [[discovery (law)|discovery]].  Critics of '''consumer arbitration''' say that arbitrators and arbitration administrators can be biased (in part due to the [[repeat-player effect]]), arbitration clauses are not conspicuous, and for many classes of consumer goods and services, nearly all providers require arbitration.  Proponents of consumer arbitration cite "consumer-friendly" terms that lower the dispute resolution costs of consumers and provide incentives for consumers to bring claims in arbitration.  Most arbitration clauses require parties to waive their right to proceed on a [[class action]] basis in either court or arbitration,&lt;ref name=lazarus&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazarus|first=David|authorlink=David Lazarus|title=Bill aims to restore consumers' right to sue|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/18/business/la-fi-lazarus-20111018|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Although parties may agree to class arbitration, most consumer arbitration clauses expressly forbid class arbitration (see [[#Class action waivers|the "Class action waivers" section of this article]]).

In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]'' that state laws that in effect require the availability of class actions to resolve consumer disputes are preempted by the [[Federal Arbitration Act]].&lt;ref name="concepcion"&gt;''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v.

The support given to consumer arbitration under United States law (particularly the [[Federal Arbitration Act]]) has been compared to other countries, whose laws restrict or ban consumer arbitration.

==Background==
{{See also|arbitration}}
In arbitration, a claimant submits a claim to a neutral arbitrator, and the opposing party (the respondent) responds to the claim.  A neutral arbitrator collects evidence and hears arguments from both parties, and then issues an award.  Pre-hearing conferences determine procedural matters for the arbitration hearing (such as whether the arbitration is to be confidential).  Hearings, which can be held in a conference center or at an office, involve the parties presenting opening statements, evidence such as documents and tangible objects, and witnesses who [[testimony|testify]] and are [[cross-examination|cross-examined]].  Closing arguments may be presented at the hearing, or submitted afterwards in the form of a post-hearing brief.  The arbitrator's award consists of a written decision, which may simply consist of a statement of the relief awarded to each party, or it may include a written explanation.  Appeal of an arbitration decision is very limited; under the Federal Arbitration Act, an awarded may be vacated only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
*"the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means"&lt;ref name=faa-section-10a1&gt;9 U.S.C. §10(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them"&lt;ref name=faa-section-10a2&gt;9 U.S.C. §10(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced"&lt;ref name=faa-section-10a3&gt;9 U.S.C. §10(a)(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
*"the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made"&lt;ref name=faa-section-10a4&gt;9 U.S.C. §10(a)(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The FAA and the Supreme Court's "liberal federal policy favoring arbitration"===
Congress passed the [[Federal Arbitration Act]] (FAA) in 1925 to require courts to enforce valid arbitration agreements.&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Rob|title=Binding Pre-Dispute Agreements: Arbitration's Gordian Knot|journal=Arizona State Law Journal|year=2011|volume=43|pages=263–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|266}}  Before then, courts routinely refused to enforce arbitration agreements, making such clauses ineffective.&lt;ref name=gordon /&gt;{{rp|266}}

According to §2 of the FAA (codified at 9 U.S.C. §2):
{{Quotation|A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.}}

In the 1970s, due to growing court dockets, courts enforced arbitration agreements more often.&lt;ref name=gordon /&gt;{{rp|267}}  In the 1983 case ''[[Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Co.]]'',&lt;ref name=moses-h-cone &gt;460 U.S. 1 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court stated that by enacting §2 of the FAA, Congress made a "declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements".&lt;ref name=gordon /&gt;{{rp|268}}  Later decisions by the Supreme Court in the 1990s established that the FAA preempts state laws regulating arbitration agreements and that statutory claims may be arbitrated pursuant to an arbitration agreement.&lt;ref name=gordon /&gt;{{rp|268}}

===First consumer arbitration clauses===
In a 1996 article in the ''[[Franchise Law Journal]]'', Edward Wood Dunham described "The Arbitration Clause as Class Action Shield."  Dunham suggested that franchisors should add arbitration clauses to their franchise agreements to minimize exposure to class actions and large jury awards.&lt;ref name=dunham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunham|first=Edward Wood|title=The Arbitration Clause as Class Action Shield|journal=Franchise Law Journal|year=1996–97|volume=16|pages=141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s, the [[National Arbitration Forum]] advertised its services to corporate lawyers, suggesting that the only way for companies to avoid being liable in a class action lawsuit was to insert arbitration clauses with class action waivers into their contracts.&lt;ref name=gilles-2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilles|first=Myriam|title=Opting Out of Liability: The Forthcoming, Near-Total Demise of the Modern Class Action|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=December 2005|volume=104|pages=373–430 [397]|url=http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/104/3/Gilles.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|397}}  The ''[[Ross v. Bank of America]]'' class action alleged that major credit card companies illegally colluded during the late 1990s to support enforcement of arbitration clauses via [[amicus curiae]] briefs and to include materially identical arbitration clauses in their cardholder agreements.&lt;ref name=gilles-2005/&gt;{{rp|398–99}}  In August 1999, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' wrote that over the previous three years, the number of consumer arbitration clauses has "increased manyfold", according to the [[National Arbitration Forum]].&lt;ref name=arbitration-trap-consumer-reports&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Arbitration Trap|journal=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=August 1999|volume=64|issue=8|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramona L. Lampley, the first generation of consumer arbitration clauses was characterized by drafters including not only class action waivers but also damages limitations, bars on recovery of attorney fees, requirements that consumers pay half or all of the arbitration fees, confidentiality requirements on the parties to an arbitration, or allowing the business to unilaterally select the arbitrator, all of which were found unenforceable by some court.&lt;ref name=lampley&gt;{{cite web|last=Lampley|first=Ramona L.|title=Is Arbitration Under Attack?: Exploring the Recent Judicial Skepticism of the Class Arbitration Waiver and Innovative Solutions to the Unsettled Legal Landscape|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ramona_lampley|publisher=Bepress|accessdate=2 March 2013|page=25|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1999, ''Consumer Reports'' cited a then-superseded arbitration clause by [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] where a consumer would have to pay $2,000 to file a claim, would have to mail the claim to a Paris address, and would have to travel to Chicago for arbitration hearings.&lt;ref name=arbitration-trap-consumer-reports /&gt;  However, in 2001, Christopher R. Drahozal wrote that "unfair arbitration clauses" are less prevalent than thought, and that even unfair terms could be beneficial to the contracting parties.&lt;ref name=drahozal-2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drahozal|first=Christopher R.|title=Unfair Arbitration Clauses|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|year=2001|volume=2001|pages=695}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, Stephen Ware suggested that requiring consumer protections in arbitration (requiring the availability of class proceedings, applying a universal cap on consumer fees without a case-by-case determination of whether the consumer can afford those fees, "requiring substantial discovery", or requiring businesses and consumers to arbitrate the same types of claims) would increase the costs of dispute resolution for the business, which would raise prices.&lt;ref name=ware&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ware|first=Stephen J.|title=Paying the Price of Process: Judicial Regulation of Consumer Arbitration Agreements|journal=Journal of Dispute Resolution|year=2001|volume=2001|issue=1|pages=89–101|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=stephen_ware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Julia A. Scarpino wrote that "many consumer contracts ... contain an arbitration clause" but consumers are generally unaware of the existence of arbitration clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scarpino|first=Julia A.|title=Mandatory Arbitration of Consumer Disputes: A Proposal to Ease the Financial Burden on Low-Income Customers|journal=Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law|year=2002|volume=10|issue=3|pages=679–710|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1455&amp;context=jgspl}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|679–80}}

===Unconscionability as a defense===
[[Unconscionability]] is a defense to the enforcement of a contract.  Most jurisdictions in the United States determine unconscionability based on two prongs: procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability.&lt;ref name=horton-2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=David|title=Unconscionability Wars|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=2012|volume=106|issue=1|pages=387–408|url=https://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v106/n1/387/LR106n1Horton.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|393}}  Procedural unconscionability arises from "contract formation" issues such as inconspicuous terms or terms offered on a "take-it-or-leave-it basis", while substantive unconscionability arises from "overly-harsh" or "one-sided" terms.&lt;ref name=horton-2012 /&gt;{{rp|393}}

In 1998, Richard E. Speidel discussed the possibility the unconscionability could be a defense to the enforcement of a consumer arbitration agreement, but he concluded that such a defense would be unlikely to succeed (even in a [[standard form contract]]) when the arbitration clause is not hidden or there are competitors that offer similar products or services without requiring arbitration.&lt;ref name=speidel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Speidel|first=Richard E.|title=Consumer Arbitration of Statutory Claims: Has Pre-Dispute [Mandatory] Arbitration Outlived Its Welcome|journal=Arizona Law Review|year=1998|volume=40|pages=1069–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1080}}  Alan Kaplinsky and Mark Levin wrote in a May 1999 article that "relatively few consumer arbitration provisions have actually been struck down by courts as 'unfair' or 'unconscionable'".&lt;ref name=kaplinsky-levin-1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplinsky|first=Alan S.|last2=Levin|first2=Mark J.|title=Consumer Financial Services Arbitration: Last Year's Trend Has Become this Year's Mainstay|journal=[[The Business Lawyer]]|date=May 1999|volume=54|issue=3|pages=1405–1418}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1408}}  Charles L. Knapp, in a 2009 article, noted that Speidel only cited one case where an arbitration clause was unconscionable, and, in that case, it was based on what the Court described as "unique facts".&lt;ref name=knapp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knapp|first=Charles L.|title=Blowing the Whistle on Mandatory Arbitration: Unconscionability as a Signaling Device|journal=San Diego Law Review|year=2009|volume=46|pages=609–628}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|616}}  Aaron-Andrew P. Bruhl wrote that courts are not allowed to refuse to enforce an arbitration clause because of the nature of arbitration, but courts have considered whether specific arbitration terms are unconscionable.&lt;ref name=bruhl&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruhl|first=Aaron-Andrew P.|title=The Unconscionability Game: Strategic Judging and the Evolution of Federal Arbitration Law|journal=New York University Law Review|year=2008|volume=83|pages=1420–1490}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1437–39}}  Knapp wrote that since Speidel's 1998 paper, more cases have arisen where a party successfully asserted unconscionability as a defense to the enforcement of an arbitration agreement.&lt;ref name=knapp /&gt;{{rp|617}}  According to Bruhl, unconscionability was an issue in about 15 to 20 percent of cases in the mid 2000s, up from 1 percent a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=bruhl /&gt;{{rp|1440–41}}  Bruhl posited that the rise in unconscionability defenses may have arisen from the Supreme Court's arbitration jurisprudence striking down other defenses to the enforcement of arbitration agreements.&lt;ref name=bruhl /&gt;{{rp|1441}}  Bruhl wrote that some unconscionability challenges to arbitration terms (such as punitive damages limitations) do not fit in the mold of classical unconscionability cases.&lt;ref name=bruhl /&gt;{{rp|1442}}  According to Bruhl, scholars have seen the unconscionability doctrine as a check against the Supreme Court's pro-arbitration jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=bruhl /&gt;{{rp|1442–43}}  Bruhl suggested that courts opposing arbitration turned to fact-specific unconscionability inquiries as opposed to categorical rules to make their decisions more likely to stand after appeal.&lt;ref name=bruhl /&gt;{{rp|1449–55}}  Overall, Bruhl concluded that "[u]nconscionability might operate as a sort of safety valve that makes arbitration politically sustainable" since courts can use unconscionability to strike egregiously unfair terms, while the threat that an arbitration provision may be found unconscionable can encourage businesses not to include unfair arbitration terms.&lt;ref name=bruhl /&gt;{{rp|1488}}

Proponents of consumer arbitration have cited courts' usage of the unconscionability doctrine to say that current arbitration law sufficiently protects consumers from unfair terms.&lt;ref name=parasharami&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/12-17-13ParasharamiTestimony.pdf |title=Statement of Archis A.

[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|United States Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote the majority opinion in ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]'']]
In March 2006, Vincent and Liza Concepcion filed a putative class action in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]], alleging that AT&amp;T improperly advertised its phones as free when purchasers had to pay sales tax on them.&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1744}}  In March 2008, AT&amp;T moved to compel individual arbitration on the basis of its agreement with the Concepcions.&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1744–45}}  The District Court denied AT&amp;T's motion, stating that although AT&amp;T's arbitration provision was likely to grant the Concepcions at least full relief, it was unconscionable and could not be enforced "because AT&amp;T had not shown that bilateral arbitration adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class actions".&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1745}}  The District Court relied on the [[California Supreme Court]]'s holding in ''[[Discover Bank v. Superior Court]]'' (2005),&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1745}} which held that arbitration agreements prohibiting class actions were exculpatory and unconscionable when they appear as part of an adhesion contract where an individual consumer's damages would be "predictably small" and the consumer has alleged a scheme where the business has "deliberately cheat[ed] large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money".&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1746}}  California courts regularly refused enforcement of class action waivers in arbitration prior to ''Concepcion''.&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1746}}&lt;ref name=sternlight-tsunami&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternlight|first=Jean|title=Tsunami: ''AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v.

In a 5–4 decision published on April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court reversed.  Justice Scalia, writing for the Court, first described how the savings clause of 9 U.S.C. §2 affects state law applied to invalidate arbitration agreements:&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1746}}
{{Quotation|This saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by "generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability," but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.}}
Scalia then stated that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts not only state law that "prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim", but also "generally applicable" doctrines "applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration".&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1747}}  Scalia discussed particular examples, such as law requiring arbitrations to allow for judicially monitored discovery, application of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], or decision by a [[jury]].&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1747}}  The majority opinion further discussed how "classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA".&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1748}}  The majority opinion described the ''Discover Bank'' rule as one that essentially applies to require consumers to be able to demand class arbitration to resolve all consumer disputes.&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1750}} Scalia focused on the result of the "Discover Bank" rule - since its application was invalidating a large number of arbitration agreements, it must violate the policy in favor of arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tracey|first=Ann Marie|author2=McGill, Shelley|title=Seeking a Rational Lawyer for Consumer Claims After the Supreme Court Disconnects Consumers in AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v.

Justice Thomas concurred.  Thomas stated that only challenges to the formation of an arbitration agreement could be used to refuse to enforce arbitration clauses, and that states could not refuse enforcement of arbitration clauses on public policy grounds.&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1753}}  Justice Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1756}}  Breyer's dissent stated that ''Discover Bank'' was not inconsistent with the FAA since it applies to both arbitration and litigation, and that requiring individual arbitration would lead to individual consumers dropping their claims.&lt;ref name=concepcion /&gt;{{rp|1760–61}}

===Developments following ''Concepcion''===
{{Main|AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion#Subsequent developments}}

Following ''Concepcion'', many businesses introduced or renewed motions to move pending lawsuits to arbitration; by April 2012, there were at least 76 decisions where a court cited ''Concepcion'' in granting a motion to compel individual arbitration of a putative class action.&lt;ref name=weise&gt;{{cite web|last=Weise|first=Karen|title=Consumer Protection Faces a 'Tsunami' in Court|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-27/consumer-protection-faces-a-tsunami-in-court|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=7 November 2013|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=justice-denied&gt;{{cite web|last=Public Citizen|title=Justice Denied: One Year Later: The Harms to Consumers from the Supreme Court's ''Concepcion'' Decision Are Plainly Evident|url=http://www.citizen.org/documents/concepcion-anniversary-justice-denied-report.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2013|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

The ''Concepcion'' decision also impacted the usage of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts, including the usage of [[#"Consumer-friendly" arbitration terms|"consumer-friendly" arbitration terms]] like the ones in AT&amp;T's agreement.&lt;ref name=gilles-2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilles|first=Myriam|title=Killing Them with Kindness: Examining "Consumer-Friendly" Arbitration Clauses after ''AT&amp;T Mobility v.

==Aspects of consumer arbitration==
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS:  Consumer arbitration has significantly changed within the past decade.  Therefore, articles written before 2004 should generally not be cited in this section.  To do so gives WP:UNDUE weight to historical arbitration practices.  The history of consumer arbitration is already covered in the previous section, so historical sources may be added there.  Thanks, ~~~ --&gt;

[[Arbitration]] has significant differences from litigation.  Additional issues pertaining specifically to the nature of consumer arbitration have been discussed.  Commentators have considered all these issues and their effect on consumers' and businesses' handling of legal claims and the enforcement of laws in determining whether and under what circumstances pre-dispute consumer arbitration agreements should be enforced.

===Arbitrators and arbitration administrators===
Consumer arbitration clauses typically name one or more third-party arbitration administrators that may conduct a dispute.  These organizations assist in the arbitration process by maintaining a roster of neutrals, managing the arbitrator selection process, and maintaining rules for arbitrations they conduct.&lt;ref name=rutledge-drahozal-contract&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rutledge|first=Peter B.|last2=Drahozal|first2=Christopher R.|title=Contract and Choice|journal=BYU Law Review|year=2013|volume=2013|issue=1|pages=1–63|url=http://www.debtorboards.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=10980.0;attach=3742|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}  The arbitrator is typically selected by the arbitration administrator or through the participation of both parties.{{#tag:ref|Under the American Arbitration Association Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, the AAA appoints the arbitrator, and each party has the right to submit "factual objections" to the arbitrator handling the case.&lt;ref name=aaa-consumer-supplementary-procedures&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer-Related Disputes: Supplementary Procedures|url=https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2009997&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased|accessdate=19 December 2013|author=American Arbitration Association|authorlink=American Arbitration Association|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|C-4}}  AAA Senior Vice President Richard Naimark stated that when there is an objection to an arbitrator, the AAA attempts to find another arbitrator both sides find acceptable.&lt;ref name=waiving-your-right-to-sue&gt;{{cite web|title=Waiving Your Right to Sue|url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-03-08/waiving-your-right-sue/transcript|work=The Diane Rehm Show|publisher=[[WAMU-FM]] (NPR)|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10:31:31}}  Under the JAMS rules, if the parties do not agree on an arbitrator, JAMS provides the parties with the names of five arbitrators, and each party may strike up to two names and rank the remainder; of the arbitrators not struck, the one with the "highest composite ranking" is selected.&lt;ref name=jams-comprehensive-arbitration-rules&gt;{{cite web|title=JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures|url=http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/|accessdate=19 December 2013|author=JAMS|authorlink=JAMS (alternative dispute resolution)|date=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}|name=arbitration-selection-note|group=nb}}

Most credit card issuers name the [[American Arbitration Association]] (AAA) and/or [[JAMS (alternative dispute resolution)|JAMS]] as an arbitration administrator.  Before the [[National Arbitration Forum]] ceased administering new consumer arbitrations in 2009, many credit card issuers also included it.&lt;ref name=rutledge-drahozal-contract /&gt;{{rp|30}}  A 2014 article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' stated that about 95% of consumer arbitrations in California are administered by AAA, JAMS, or "Kaiser's independent administrator", according to "a lobbyist for the California arbitration industry".&lt;ref name=said&gt;{{cite news|last=Said|first=Carolyn|title=Consumer advocates seek details from arbitration firms|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Consumer-advocates-seek-details-from-arbitration-5136722.php|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AAA and JAMS primarily hear disputes between businesses and employment disputes.&lt;ref name=berner-grow /&gt;  Consumer cases make up less than 1% of the AAA's overall caseload.&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Chris|title=CFPB’s Proposed Rule Unlikely to Hurt Arbitrators’ Business|url=https://bol.bna.com/cfpbs-proposed-rule-unlikely-to-hurt-arbitrators-business/|website=bna.com|accessdate=30 October 2015|date=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impartiality of arbitrators and arbitration organizations===

====Business selection of arbitration administrator====
In a consumer arbitration agreement, the business typically lists one or more third-party arbitration administrators that may conduct the arbitration.  Critics of consumer arbitration say that this selection is done to select a forum that favors the business.  Critics also argue (as detailed below) that businesses can place undue pressure on arbitration administrators to act in favor of the business by threatening to remove them as an allowed arbitration forum.

Jean Sternlight wrote that some businesses named arbitration administrators with neutral-sounding names that, in fact, were "alter ego[s]" of the business.&lt;ref name=sternlight-2006 /&gt;{{rp|144}}

====Business influence on arbitration administrators' policies====
Some commentators have written that businesses removed arbitration administrators or threatened to do so in order to influence those administrators' policies.

In 2004 JAMS promulgated a policy that required the availability of class arbitration in consumer arbitration, even if the arbitration agreement barred class arbitration.&lt;ref name=gilles-2005 /&gt;{{rp|411}}  Under the policy, JAMS would accept filed arbitration cases but would then refuse to enforce class action waivers.&lt;ref name=kaplinsky-levin-jams /&gt;{{rp|925}}  Subsequently, JAMS stated that the arbitrator would have the authority to determine whether class arbitration would be permitted.&lt;ref name=kaplinsky-levin-jams /&gt;{{rp|926–27}}  Following JAMS's adoption of this policy, several businesses, including Discover and Citibank, removed JAMS as an arbitration administrator.&lt;ref name=gilles-2005 /&gt;{{rp|411–12}}  JAMS rescinded the policy in March 2005, which Gilles suggests was the result of influence by businesses.&lt;ref name=gilles-2005 /&gt;{{rp|412}}

====Repeat-player effect====

====Allegations of impropriety by administrators====
In an August 2001 article in ''The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel'', NAF Managing Director Edward Anderson described the NAF's rule barring arbitrators from awarding more than the stated amount of the claim as an advantage for corporations to implement arbitration, as compared to court where plaintiffs need not state an amount demanded and can persuade a jury to award a large amount of punitive damages.  Anderson added that the NAF has a rule allowing the arbitrator to award the winning party its arbitration costs and attorney's fees, which he said eliminates "'no risk' arbitration" and prevents "'extortion' actions".&lt;ref name=do-an-lra&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do An LRA: Implement Your Own Civil Justice Reform Program NOW|journal=The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel|date=August 2001|volume=9|issue=8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In its 2007 article "The Arbitration Trap", Public Citizen criticized this marketing by the NAF to corporations.&lt;ref name=arbitration-trap&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arbitration Trap: How Credit Card Companies Ensnare Consumers|url=http://www.citizen.org/documents/ArbitrationTrap.pdf|author=Public Citizen|authorlink=Public Citizen|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}}  Stephanie Mencimer of ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' criticized an advertisement by the NAF to businesses describing NAF arbitration as an "alternative to the 'million-dollar lawsuit.'"&lt;ref name=mencimer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mencimer|first1=Stephanie|title=Suckers Wanted: How Car Dealers and Other Businesses are Taking Away Your Right to Sue|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/11/suckers-wanted-how-car-dealers-and-other-businesses-are-taking-away-your-right-sue|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2008 article in ''BusinessWeek'' described confidential presentations by the NAF to corporations which stated that NAF arbitration has a "marked increase in recovery rates over existing collection methods", highlighted a rule allowing the claimant to stay or dismiss an arbitration proceeding without charge, and stated that 93.7% of consumers do not respond to arbitration demands, and only 0.3% request a participatory hearing.&lt;ref name=berner-grow&gt;{{cite web|last=Berner|first=Robert|last2=Grow|first2=Brian|title=Banks vs. Consumers (Guess Who Wins)|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-06-04/banks-vs-dot-consumers-guess-who-wins|work=Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=17 January 2014|date=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a complaint filed by [[Lori Swanson]] in 2009, one presentation by the NAF to a financial services company included a slide of quotes from unnamed customer service representatives suggesting that arbitration is more advantageous to creditors than litigation because creditors "have all the leverage" and consumers are unfamiliar with the arbitration process.&lt;ref name=swanson-naf-complaint&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint: State of Minnesota v.

[[Minnesota Attorney General]] [[Lori Swanson]] filed a complaint on July 14, 2009 alleging that the National Arbitration Forum engaged in several deceptive practices.&lt;ref name=businessweek-naf&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota Sues a Credit Arbitrator, Citing Bias|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jul2009/db20090714_952766.htm|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=8 October 2013|date=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Swanson alleged that the NAF was partially owned by Accretive, a firm with ties to major debt collection law firms; Swanson alleged that the NAF covered up those ties while representing itself as an impartial forum.&lt;ref name=businessweek-naf /&gt;  According to the complaint, Accretive and the NAF worked to promote arbitration and oppose the Arbitration Fairness Act in Congress.&lt;ref name=businessweek-naf /&gt;  Swanson also alleged that the NAF improperly assisted credit card companies by drafting arbitration clauses and claims against consumers.&lt;ref name=businessweek-naf /&gt;  Further, according to the complaint, the NAF also advertised its services to creditors by suggesting that arbitration is more favorable to them than litigation.&lt;ref name=businessweek-naf /&gt;  On July 17, the NAF settled the Minnesota case by agreeing not to conduct any new consumer arbitrations.&lt;ref name=naf-consent-judgment&gt;{{cite web|title=Consent Judgment|url=http://pubcit.typepad.com/files/nafconsentdecree.pdf|accessdate=11 January 2014|pages=3–6|format=PDF|date=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abate&gt;{{cite news|last=Abate|first=Tom|title=Arbitration firm calling it quits|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Arbitration-firm-calling-it-quits-3291482.php|accessdate=11 January 2014|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs of arbitration===

====Arbitrator and administrative fees====
The American Arbitration Association charges two types of fees to parties in an arbitration: administrative fees to the AAA for its case management services and arbitrator fees to pay for the services of the arbitrator.  Prior to March 1, 2013, the AAA had a tiered fee structure that capped the fees charged to a consumer claiming only monetary damages of up to $75,000 and required the business to pay the remaining fees (see below).  Under the pre-2013 rules, unless the parties agreed otherwise, the arbitrator had the authority to reallocate the fees in the award.&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|46}}

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;AAA fees assessed in consumer claims (before March 1, 2013)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|26}}

In 2004, Mark Budnitz criticized the exclusion of claims for injunctive relief from the caps on consumer fees, saying that the laws pertaining to injunctive relief are straightforward for an arbitrator to apply and that the added fees for requesting injunctive relief would discourage consumers who most deserve injunctive relief from seeking it.&lt;ref name=budnitz /&gt;{{rp|136}}  The AAA changed its consumer fee schedule effective March 1, 2013.&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbitration Study Preliminary Results: Section 1028(a) Study Results To Date|url=http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201312_cfpb_arbitration-study-preliminary-results.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2013|author=[[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]|date=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|110}}   Under the current schedule, the AAA charges consumers a maximum fee of $200 (which is used to pay the AAA administrative fee), regardless of the type or amount of the consumer's claim; the business is responsible for the arbitrator fee, the hearing fee, and an AAA administrative fee.&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|110}}&lt;ref name=aaa-consumer-fees-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)|url=https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2009593&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased|accessdate=21 April 2014|author=American Arbitration Association|date=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, the arbitrator is not allowed to reallocate the fees unless it is done "pursuant to applicable law" or if the arbitrator finds that "a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous".&lt;ref name=aaa-consumer-fees-2013 /&gt;

In March 2009, the Searle Civil Justice Institute published an analysis of consumer cases in AAA resulting in an award from April to December 2007.&lt;ref name=searle&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Arbitration Before the American Arbitration Association|url=http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTG_010205&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased|publisher=American Arbitration Association|accessdate=6 May 2013|author=Searle Civil Justice Institute|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the analysis, consumer claimants seeking less than $10,000 paid an average of $1 in administrative fees and $95 in arbitrator fees, while consumer claimants seeking at least $10,000 but less than or equal to $75,000 paid an average of $15 in administrative fees and $204 in arbitrator fees.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|58}}  Consumer claimants seeking more than $75,000 paid an average of $1,448 in administrative fees and $1,256 in arbitrator fees.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|58}}  However, the report also says that because only awarded cases were considered, there may be a [[selection bias]] in that awarded cases are those where arbitration fees did not prevent consumers from pursuing their claims in arbitration.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|59}}

The National Arbitration Forum assessed fees based on the size of the claim, according to a published fee schedule.  According to the 2008 fee schedule, consumers claiming less than $75,000 were charged filing fees of $19 (for a claim of $1,500 or less) to $242 (for claims valued from $55,000 to $74,999), plus a $20 fee for each objection, a $100 fee to submit a post-hearing memorandum or a request for an explained decision, and up to $250 for a participatory hearing.&lt;ref name=naf-fee-schedule&gt;{{cite web|title=Fee Schedule to Code of Procedure|url=http://www.adrforum.com/users/naf/resources/2008FeeSchedule-FinalPrint1.pdf|publisher=National Arbitration Forum|accessdate=21 April 2014|author=[[National Arbitration Forum]]|date=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For larger claims, the NAF charged higher fees, including fees for making requests to the arbitrator or the NAF.&lt;ref name=naf-fee-schedule /&gt;  Sarah R.

====Other arbitration expenses====
Like in litigation, each party in an arbitration is responsible for the costs it incurs in presenting its case, such as attorneys' fees, witness fees, and [[discovery (law)|discovery]] costs.&lt;ref name=bingham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bingham|first=Lisa B.|title=Control over Dispute-System Design and Mandatory Commercial Arbitration|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Winter–Spring 2004|volume=67|pages=221–51|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1322&amp;context=lcp|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|234}}&lt;ref name=stipanowich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stipanowich|first=Thomas J.|title=Arbitration: The 'New Litigation'|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|year=2010|volume=2010|issue=1|pages=1–60|url=http://microlib.cc.utexas.edu/law/centers/cppdr/portfolio/2010%20Symposium/Stipanowich%20New%20Litigation%20Final.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} The amount of these costs has been compared between arbitration and litigation in two manners.

These costs tend to be lower for individual arbitration as compared to individual litigation.  Because discovery is traditionally more limited in arbitration, discovery expenses (which make up the bulk of litigation expenses) tend to be lower in arbitration.&lt;ref name=stipanowich /&gt;{{rp|12}}  Depending on the specific terms of the arbitration clause, a consumer plaintiff may be entitled to recover attorney's fees and/or expert witness fees that are not otherwise available in court.&lt;ref name=nagareda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nagareda|first=Richard A.|title=The Litigation-Arbitration Dichotomy Meets the Class Action|journal=Notre Dame Law Review|year=2011|volume=86|issue=3|pages=1069–1130|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~ndlrev/archive_public/86ndlr3/Nagareda.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1116}} However, the increase in the prevalence of litigation-style discovery and the tendency for [[summary judgment]] and other dispositive motions to be unavailable or denied in arbitration may increase these costs such that they are no longer cheaper in arbitration than in litigation.&lt;ref name=stipanowich /&gt;{{rp|12–15}} To reinforce the viability of the consumer arbitration system, many companies commit to reimburse the cost of filing an arbitration even for consumers who do not ultimately win further compensation.&lt;ref name=Radvocate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myradvocate.com/about-arbitration|title=About Arbitration|website=Radvocate|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When individual arbitration is compared to a class action in litigation, though, these costs may be more disproportionate to the individual amount of relief to which an individual is entitled.  In the antitrust case ''[[American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant]]'', the plaintiffs, who were small businesses who agreed to accept American Express cards, estimated that they would have to spend $300,000 to $1 million for an economic expert necessary to present their case, which far exceeded the damages an individual plaintiff could recover.&lt;ref name=harris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Matthew|title=Riding the Waiver: ''In re American Express Merchants' Litigation'' and the Future of the Vindication of Statutory Rights|journal=Boston College Law Review|date=2013-02-05|volume=54|issue=6 Electronic Supplement|pages=15–28|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3282&amp;context=bclr|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

====Scholarly opinion====
Commentators have criticized reliance on arbitration fees to suggest unfairness towards the consumer.  Edward A. Dauer said that the lowered costs of arbitration as compared to litigation may be more beneficial to businesses who tend to hire counsel at an hourly rate rather than consumers whose legal representation is subject to [[contingent fee]] agreements.&lt;ref name=dauer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dauer|first=Edward A.|title=Judicial Policing of Consumer Arbitration|journal=Pepperdine Dispute Resolution Law Journal|year=2001|volume=1|issue=1|pages=91–106|url=http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1198&amp;context=drlj|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}  Christopher R. Drahozal said that upfront arbitration costs should not affect the ability for consumers represented by lawyers on a contingent fee basis to bring claims in arbitration.&lt;ref name=drahozal-2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drahozal|first=Christopher R.|title=Arbitration Costs and Contingent Fee Contracts|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|year=2006|volume=59|pages=727–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen Ware said that it is erroneous to only compare arbitration forum fees with court fees because, he says, the entire cost of pursuing a claim in arbitration will likely be lower than the entire cost of pursuing a claim in litigation.&lt;ref name=ware-2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ware|first=Stephen J.|title=The Case for Enforcing Adhesive Arbitration Agreements - With Particular Consideration of Class Actions and Arbitration Fees|journal=The Journal of American Arbitration|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=251–293|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=stephen_ware}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|287}}  Peter Rutledge criticized making a distinction between attorney's fees and arbitration fees, saying that, overall, they both represent out-of-pocket expenses for a consumer.&lt;ref name=rutledge-2009 /&gt;{{rp|582}}

===Speed of resolution===
Arbitration is generally faster than litigation, in part due to the limited amount of discovery available in arbitration, the reduced motion practice in arbitration, and the backlog of court cases that delays judicial resolution of cases.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|8}}

According to a 2009 paper by the Searle Civil Justice Institute, in a sample of 301 cases by the American Arbitration Association that resulted in an award in 2007, the median length of time from the filing of a case to an award was 207 days.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|63}}  Only seven of those cases took more than one and a half years to resolve.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|63}}  Cases resolved on the basis of document submissions only were resolved in an average (mean) of 139 days.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|64}}

In a 2012 article, Miles B. Farmer wrote that one of the greatest advantages of arbitration is that cases are resolved faster than in litigation.&lt;ref name=farmer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Miles B.|title=Mandatory and Fair?

===Legal representation===
According to a 2009 report by the Searle Civil Justice Institute, in a sample of 301 consumer cases where the AAA issued an award from April to December 2007, consumers were represented by counsel in 151 cases (50.2%).&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|72}}  In arbitration, consumers represented by counsel generally won some relief and won a higher average amount than consumers appearing ''pro se''.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|74}}  According to the Searle Civil Justice Institute, this difference could be either due to the enhanced advocacy of an attorney or due to attorneys screening cases for ones that are likely to succeed.&lt;ref name=searle /&gt;{{rp|74}}  According to the preliminary results of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration study, which examined consumer financial services cases from 2010 through 2012 filed with the American Arbitration Association, in the 522 debt collection cases studied, consumers were represented in 220 cases (42.1%) and businesses were represented in 518 cases (99.2%).  In the 719 non-debt collection cases, consumers were represented in 435 cases (60.5%) and businesses were represented in 637 cases (88.6%).&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|71}}  The CFPB stated that the high proportion of cases where a business is represented by an attorney may be due to state laws regarding the [[unauthorized practice of law]], which prohibit corporations from self-representing in arbitration.&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|73}}  Jean Sternlight wrote that in mandatory arbitration, one side may be represented while the other side is not, which may pressure both parties to retain an attorney to avoid the situation where only the opposing party is represented.&lt;ref name=sternlight-lawyerless&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternlight|first=Jean R.|title=Lawyerless Dispute Resolution: Rethinking a Paradigm|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=2010|volume=37|pages=381–418|url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=facpub|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|392–93}}  Kristen M.

Matt Webb, Senior Vice President of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]]'s [[Institute for Legal Reform]], stated that a fair arbitration clause could allow consumers to effectively pursue small claims without attorney representation.&lt;ref name=segal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segal|first1=David|title=A Rising Tide Against Class-Action Suits|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/your-money/class-actions-face-hurdle-in-2011-supreme-court-ruling.html?_r=0|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=The New York Times|date=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jason Scott Johnston and [[Todd Zywicki]] described consumer arbitration as "a process set up so that hiring an attorney offers little value to a consumer and is often unnecessary" and said that the CFPB's arbitration study's results were consistent with this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=johnston-zywicki&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Jason Scott|last2=Zywicki|first2=Todd|authorlink2=Todd Zywicki|title=The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Arbitration Study: A Summary and Critique|url=http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/Johnston-CFPB-Arbitration.pdf|publisher=[[Mercatus Center]]|accessdate=4 November 2015|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25–26}}  Travis Crabtree said unrepresented consumers are "less likely to be tripped up in a procedural trap" in arbitration than in litigation.&lt;ref name="mcmanus"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McManus|first1=Brian|title=We Asked A Lawyer What to Do if You've Been Screwed by an Arbitration Clause|url=https://www.vice.com/read/ask-an-expert-arbitration|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice.com]]|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Satz, though, wrote that the rules of procedure established by arbitration administrators are not likely to be understood by nonlawyers.&lt;ref name=satz /&gt;{{rp|44}}  Stephan Landsman wrote that, under the [[Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], arbitrators are prohibited from assisting unrepresented parties in arbitration,&lt;ref name=landsman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landsman|first=Stephan|title=Nothing for Something?

===Discovery===

===Disclosure of arbitration clauses===

===Class action waivers===
Most consumer arbitration agreements contain clauses that disallow arbitration on a classwide basis.  These clauses, which have the effect of preventing parties from seeking relief on a classwide basis in either court or arbitration, are commonly referred to as "class action waivers".&lt;ref name=eisenberg-miller-sherwin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Theodore|last2=Miller|first2=Geoffrey P.|last3=Sherwin|first3=Emily|title=Arbitration's Summer Soldiers: An Empirical Study of Arbitration Clauses in Consumer and Nonconsumer Contracts|journal=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|date=Summer 2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=871–896}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|873–74}}&lt;ref name=glover&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glover|first=J.

Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey P. Miller, and Emily Sherwin said that none of the contracts they researched had standalone waivers of class actions without arbitration clauses because, outside of arbitration clauses, class action waivers "are legally vulnerable and also politically controversial".&lt;ref name=eisenberg-miller-sherwin /&gt;{{rp|890}}

In 2004, Demaine and Hensler wrote that 16 of 52 arbitration clauses examined contained class action waivers, and none expressly permitted class arbitration.&lt;ref name=demaine-hensler /&gt;{{rp|65}}  [[Ballard Spahr]] attorneys Alan Kaplinsky and Mark Levin wrote in a 2006 article that "[o]nce rare, class action waivers are today included in millions of credit card and other financial services agreements nationwide".&lt;ref name=kaplinsky-levin-jams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplinsky|first=Alan S.|last2=Levin|first2=Mark J.|title=Is JAMS in a Jam Over Its Policy Regarding Class Action Waivers in Consumer Arbitration Agreements?|journal=The Business Lawyer|date=February 2006|volume=61|issue=2|pages=923–929}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|923}}  According to the preliminary results of the CFPB's arbitration study, released in 2013, 93.9% of unique credit card contracts that contained arbitration clauses, representing 99.9% of the credit card market where contracts contain arbitration clauses, had explicit class action waivers.&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|37}}

Commentators have viewed the ability to prevent consumers from obtaining relief on a classwide basis as a principal reason for businesses to add arbitration provisions to their consumer contracts.  Lisa Renee Pomerantz wrote that there was speculation that large businesses would abandon arbitration if pre-dispute class action waivers could not be enforced because they believe arbitration is "more readily accessible to and provid[es] greater protections to consumers".&lt;ref name="pomerantz" /&gt;  Jeff {{proper name|Sovern}} said that the financial industry's argument that the CFPB's proposed ban on class action waivers would lead to the industry abandoning arbitration suggested that its "love of arbitration is about barring class actions".&lt;ref name=sovern-cfpb-arbitration-plan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sovern|first1=Jeff|title=CFPB Arbitration Plan Provokes Dubious Industry Claims|url=http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/cfpb-arbitration-plan-provokes-dubious-industry-claims-1077814-1.html|website=[[American Banker]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|date=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  F.

===Availability of relief otherwise available in court===
In 2004, Linda J. Demaine and Deborah R. Hensler wrote that "[t]he vast majority of [consumer arbitration] clauses place no limits on substantive remedies."&lt;ref name=demaine-hensler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demaine|first=Linda J.|last2=Hensler|first2=Deborah R.|title='Volunteering' to Arbitrate Through Predispute Arbitration Clauses: The Average Consumer's Experience|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Winter–Spring 2004|volume=67|issue=1/2|pages=55–74|jstor=27592034}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

===Location and venue===
The location of consumer arbitration proceedings (including whether they are conducted without the appearance of the parties or their attorneys) can be set by the arbitration organization's rules or by terms in the arbitration clause.

Commentators have discussed whether businesses select arbitration locations that are inconvenient for consumers to discourage consumer claims.  Jean Sternlight wrote that consumer arbitration could be held in locations inconvenient for the consumer that would contravene state law, citing the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] case ''Bradley v. Harris Research'' (2001),&lt;ref name="bradley-harris"&gt;''Bradley v. Harris Research'', 275 F.3d 884 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which held that a California law setting venue in California for franchise disputes involving California franchisees was preempted as applied to arbitration clauses requiring venue elsewhere.&lt;ref name=sternlight-2006 /&gt;{{rp|171}}

Philippe Gillieron wrote that online dispute resolution (ODR) could facilitate the pursuit of small claims for transactions conducted on the Internet; the alternative would be to obtain a court judgment in a foreign country or have a judgment enforced there.&lt;ref name=gillieron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillieron|first=Philippe|title=From Face-to-Face to Screen-to-Screen: Real Hope or True Fallacy|journal=Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution|year=2008|volume=23|issue=2|pages=301–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|313}}  Amy Schmitz proposed online arbitration as a means for consumers to obtain relief for claims pertaining to online transactions, saying that online arbitration is superior than other online dispute resolution methods since both parties are required to participate in the process.&lt;ref name=schmitz-2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Amy J.|title='Drive-Thru' Arbitration in the Digital Age: Empowering Consumers Through Binding ODR|journal=Baylor Law Review|year=2010|volume=62|issue=1|pages=178–244|url=http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/116799.pdf|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184–85}}  Schmitz added that conducting arbitration online may free consumers from having to travel a great distance to pursue arbitration or litigation.&lt;ref name=schmitz-2010 /&gt;{{rp|200–01}}  Peter Rutledge wrote that one advantage for consumer defendants in arbitration is that they do not have to make a personal appearance, in contrast with small claims court.&lt;ref name=rutledge-2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rutledge|first=Peter B.|title=Arbitration Reform: What We Know and What We Need to Know|journal=Cardozo Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=2009|volume=10|issue=2|pages=579–586|url=http://cardozojcr.com/vol10no2/579-586.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|581}}  Jill Gross wrote that simplified arbitration procedures that resolve small claims on the basis of written submissions are inadequate for ''pro se'' parties who may not be able to effectively make written legal arguments, citing the Supreme Court case ''[[Goldberg v.

==="Consumer-friendly" arbitration terms===
In response to court decisions ruling arbitration agreements unconscionable, some businesses began adding "consumer-friendly" provisions to their arbitration clauses.&lt;ref name=lampley/&gt;{{rp|6}}  For example, after court decisions striking down their arbitration clauses, PayPal and [[Second Life]] changed their terms to allow the claimant to choose optional non-appearance-based arbitration for small claims or to go to court under the terms of a [[forum selection clause]].&lt;ref name=ponte&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponte|first=Lucille M.|title=Getting a Bad Rap - Unconscionability in Clickwrap Dispute Resolution Clauses and a Proposal for Improving the Quality of These Online Consumer Products|journal=Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution|date=2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=119–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152–153}}{{#tag:ref|For PayPal, the required court venue was [[Santa Clara County, California]] or [[Omaha, Nebraska]]; for Second Life, [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name=ponte /&gt;{{rp|152–153}}|group=nb|name=paypal-second-life-forum-selection}}  According to David Horton, following court decisions striking class action waivers, some businesses unilaterally added "elaborate schemes" that would provide an incentive for consumers to bring low-value claims in arbitration, such as paying all arbitration costs and automatically awarding successful plaintiffs attorney's fees.&lt;ref name=horton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=David|title=The Shadow Terms: Contract Procedure and Unilateral Amendments|journal=UCLA Law Review|year=2010|volume=57|issue=3|pages=605–667|url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-3-1.pdf|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|654}}  Horton wrote that such provisions were designed primarily to convince courts that arbitration provisions were not unconscionable, rather than to attract customers from competitors on the basis of such arbitration terms.&lt;ref name=horton /&gt;{{rp|655}}  Horton also suggested, though, that decisions upholding a class action waiver would cause businesses to remove consumer-friendly clauses to reduce the incentive for consumers to bring claims.&lt;ref name=horton /&gt;{{rp|656}}  Myriam Gilles said that businesses' usage of consumer-friendly arbitration provisions could avoid outright bans on consumer arbitration by the federal government.&lt;ref name=gilles-2012 /&gt;{{rp|849–50}}

To avoid a ruling of procedural unconscionability, some businesses began allowing consumers to reject ("opt out" of) arbitration agreements at the time of entering into a contract without penalty.&lt;ref name=lampley/&gt;{{rp|31}}  F. Paul Bland and Claire Prestel wrote that more consumers will fail to exercise an opt-out option (which may be inconspicuously placed in a contract and difficult to understand) than would affirmatively agree to arbitrate, citing consumer optimism that disputes will not arise and transaction costs.&lt;ref name=bland-prestel /&gt;{{rp|387}}  They added that having an opt-out option would only affect procedural unconscionability and would not apply to other defenses, nor would it prevent a ruling of unconscionability in jurisdictions where substantive unconscionability alone can make a contract term unenforceable.&lt;ref name=bland-prestel /&gt;{{rp|386}} [[Deepak Gupta (attorney)|Deepak Gupta]], who argued on behalf of the consumer respondents in ''Concepcion'', said that those opt-out provisions are illusory since consumers would not likely opt out before a dispute arises.&lt;ref name=gupta&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.law.gwu.edu/News/2010-2011Events/Documents/Gupta%20Submission.pdf |title=Why and How We Should Ban Class-Action Bans |first=Deepak |last=Gupta |author= |authorlink= |date=2011-03-17 |conference=The Future of Arbitration |conferenceurl=http://www.law.gwu.edu/News/2010-2011Events/Pages/Arbitration.aspx |editor= |others= |volume= |edition= |booktitle= |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014081421/http://www.law.gwu.edu/News/2010-2011Events/Documents/Gupta%20Submission.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-14|location= |pages= |format= |id= |isbn= |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=12 October 2013 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= |language= |page= |at= |dead-url=yes |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}  Plaintiffs and lawyers attributed the lack of opt-outs to consumers not being aware of the existence of the arbitration clause or not understanding the ramifications of not opting out.&lt;ref name=silver-greenberg-gebeloff /&gt;  Charles Gibbs wrote that consumers who opt out would only be able to join in a class action with other consumers who also opted out, and therefore such a class action would have less of a deterrent effect against the business.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbs|first=Charles|title=Consumer Class Actions after ''AT&amp;T v.

AT&amp;T Mobility (formerly known as Cingular Wireless) made numerous changes to its arbitration clause during the 2000s.&lt;ref name=laster-brief&gt;Brief of AT&amp;T Mobility LLC as ''Amicus Curiae'' in Support of Neither Party in ''T-Mobile USA, Inc. v. Laster'', 07-976, filed February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cingular Wireless agreement at issue in the 2006 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] case ''[[Kinkel v. Cingular Wireless]]'' imposed a confidentiality requirement on the parties, generally barred punitive damages awards, and required payment of a $125 fee to arbitrate a claim of $150.&lt;ref name=laster-brief/&gt;{{rp|10–11}}  AT&amp;T Mobility removed those provisions&lt;ref name=laster-brief /&gt;{{rp|15}} and ultimately developed, in consultation with [[Vanderbilt University Law School]] professor [[Richard A. Nagareda]], a new arbitration clause similar to the one in ''Concepcion''.&lt;ref name=laster-brief/&gt;{{rp|15–17}}

Justice Scalia identified the following provisions in the AT&amp;T Mobility agreement that was before the Supreme Court in ''Concepcion'':&lt;ref name=concepcion/&gt;{{rp|1744}}
*the forms to begin the arbitration process were short and available on AT&amp;T's web site;
*AT&amp;T was required to pay all the arbitration costs, unless a claim was frivolous;
*the arbitration proceedings would take place in the county of the customer's billing address;
*the customer had the option of an in-person hearing, a telephonic hearing, or a decision based on written submissions, if the claim is under $10,000;
*the customer could pursue a claim in [[small claims court]] instead of arbitration;
*the arbitrator was not limited in the type of individual relief that could be awarded;
*AT&amp;T agreed not to ask for reimbursement of its attorney's fees;
*if the customer recovered an award greater than AT&amp;T's last written settlement offer before the selection of an arbitrator, the customer's award would be increased to $7,500 and the customer would be entitled to double attorney's fees.
Scalia endorsed the lower courts' analysis that, under these terms, the Concepcions were in a much better position pursuing their claim in arbitration rather than as a class action, and that they were "'essentially guarantee[d]' to be made whole".&lt;ref name=concepcion/&gt;{{rp|1753}}  In an article in ''Metropolitan Corporate Counsel'', Kevin B. Leblang and Robert N. Holtzman wrote that although the Supreme Court did not base the ''Concepcion'' decision on the consumer-friendly terms in AT&amp;T's agreement, those terms were likely a factor in the Supreme Court's ruling.&lt;ref name=leblang-holtzman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leblang|first=Kevin B.|last2=Holtzman|first2=Robert N.|title=Break Out Those Arbitration Agreements: United States Supreme Court Issues Another Pro-Arbitration Decision|journal=The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel|date=2011-10-05|url=http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/articles/15962/break-out-those-arbitration-agreements-united-states-supreme-court-issues-another-pro|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators, though, have criticized whether or not these terms would guarantee consumers relief.  Myriam Gilles and Gary Friedman wrote that because the settlement would only be the amount of the claim, the attorney would have a difficult case in justifying a relatively large amount of attorney's fees for winning such a small settlement.&lt;ref name=gilles-friedman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilles|first=Myriam|last2=Friedman|first2=Gary|title=After Class: Aggregate Litigation in the Wake of ''AT&amp;T Mobility v Concepcion''|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|year=2012|volume=79|pages=623–675|url=https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/79_2/03%20Gilles%20Friedman%20ART.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|646–47}}  The authors added that filing a complaint ''pro se'' would not alleviate this issue, as a settlement offer could be made just prior to arbitration.&lt;ref name=gilles-friedman /&gt;{{rp|647}}
Gibbs wrote that AT&amp;T's alternative payment would not have the same deterrence effect as a class action, and that it would be highly unlikely to ever occur, given that AT&amp;T could offer the face value of the complaint if "a beneficial result in arbitration" for the consumer was possible.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;{{rp|1363–64}}  Gibbs also considered AT&amp;T's agreement to pay all of the consumer's arbitration costs as an acknowledgment that few consumers would bring cases in arbitration.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;{{rp|1367}}  David Korn and David Rosenberg suggested that the alternative payment provision would have a "perverse" effect of increasing the motivation for the business to spend more for a better chance of winning at arbitration and reducing its total liability to all its customers.&lt;ref name=korn-rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korn|first=David|last2=Rosenberg|first2=David|title=''Concepcion''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Pro-defendant Biasing of the Arbitration Process: The Class Counsel Solution|journal=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|date=Summer 2013|volume=46|issue=4|pages=1151–1201|url=http://prospectusmjlr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/korn-rosenberg.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1165}}

===Number of arbitrations filed by consumers===
Commentators have cited statistics about the number of arbitrations filed by consumers in answering the question of whether consumers can effectively pursue claims in arbitration.  Jean Sternlight wrote in a 2012 article that, according to JAMS Executive Vice President Jay Welsh, JAMS handles a "few hundred" consumer cases each year, most of which are preemptive arbitrations by alleged credit card debtors seeking to avoid debt collection litigation, and that AAA conducted about a thousand consumer arbitrations a year.&lt;ref name=sternlight-2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternlight|first=Jean R.|title=Mandatory Binding Arbitration Clauses Prevent Consumers from Presenting Procedurally Difficult Claims|journal=Southwestern Law Review|year=2012|volume=42|pages=87–129|url=http://www.swlaw.edu/pdfs/lr/42_1sternlight.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}}  Sternlight said that this was a very small number of arbitrations compared to the number of consumers required to arbitrate disputes.&lt;ref name=sternlight-2012 /&gt;{{rp|98–99}}  According to the preliminary results of the CFPB's arbitration study, 1,241 cases were filed with the AAA from 2010 to 2012 concerning "credit cards, checking account[s], and payday loans",&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|62}} compared to an estimated 80 million credit card holders subject to arbitration clauses.&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|63}}  Of the 326 AAA cases where a debt was not in dispute, consumers pursued claims for $1,000 or less in arbitration only 23 times.&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|80–81}}  According to ''The New York Times''{{'}}s analysis of data from multiple arbitration firms, from 2010 through 2014, there were 505 arbitration cases where a consumer brought a dispute for no more than $2,500.&lt;ref name=silver-greenberg-gebeloff&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silver-Greenberg|first1=Jessica|last2=Gebeloff|first2=Robert|title=Arbitration Everywhere, Stacking the Deck of Justice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=31 October 2015|date=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2017, AT&amp;T stated that 412 arbitration cases had been filed against it since the beginning of 2015.&lt;ref name="att-response"&gt;[https://www.franken.senate.gov/files/letter/170630ATTResponseLetter.pdf June 30, 2017 letter from AT&amp;T to Sen.

In the 2008 case ''Tillman v. Commercial Credit Loans, Inc.'', the [[Supreme Court of North Carolina]] noted the lower court's finding of fact that the defendant made 68,000 loans in North Carolina and commenced court actions against over 3,700, yet never had a consumer file arbitration against it.&lt;ref name=tillman&gt;''Tillman v. Commercial Credit Loans, Inc.'', 655 S.E.2d 362 (N. C. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|367}}  The ''Tillman'' court ultimately found the arbitration clause to be unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt;{{rp|373}}  According to ''The New York Times''{{'}}s analysis of data from multiple arbitration firms, from 2010 through 2014, there were 65 arbitration cases involving [[Verizon Wireless]], a business with over 125 million customers, and 7 cases involving [[Time Warner Cable]], which had 15 million customers.&lt;ref name=silver-greenberg-gebeloff /&gt;

Alan Kaplinsky wrote that the small number of consumer arbitration cases resulted from fifteen years of "negative publicity about arbitration generated by plaintiffs' class action lawyers and consumer advocates".&lt;ref name=kaplinsky-industrys-preference&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaplinsky|first1=Alan|title=Industry's Preference for Arbitration Is a Reality|url=http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/industrys-preference-for-arbitration-is-a-reality-1077919-1.html|website=American Banker|accessdate=22 November 2015|date=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precedent and publicity===
Arbitration decisions are not [[precedent]]ial.

Richard M. Alderman criticized consumer arbitration for allowing businesses to avoid unfavorable precedents rather than working within the legal system to change them.  Alderman also predicted that the [[common law]] with respect to consumers would cease to evolve due to arbitration clauses promulgated by businesses.&lt;ref name=alderman&gt;{{cite web|last=Alderman|first=Richard M.|title=What's Really Wrong with Forced Consumer Arbitration|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/business_law_today/buslaw_blt_content_2010_11_article_alderman.authcheckdam.pdf|work=Business Law Today|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitrators ordinarily do not provide a written award in commercial arbitrations.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Kenneth R.|title=The End of an Error: Replacing 'Manifest Disregard' with a New Framework for Reviewing Arbitration Awards|journal=Cleveland State Law Review|year=2012|volume=60|pages=87–131|url=http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=clevstlrev|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|90}}

Arbitrations are also generally private: unlike in court trials, members of the public cannot generally attend an arbitration hearing or obtain a copy of the award.  The CFPB's preliminary report on arbitration states that "[a]rbitration rules typically do not impose express confidentiality or nondisclosure obligations on parties to the dispute, although arbitrator ethics rules do impose confidentiality obligations on the arbitrator."&lt;ref name=cfpb-arbitration-preliminary /&gt;{{rp|41–42}}   Arbitration agreements may also contain a confidentiality clause barring the parties from disclosing a dispute or the arbitration proceedings.&lt;ref name=satz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Satz|first=Michael A.|title=Mandatory Binding Arbitration: Our Legal History Demands Balanced Reform|journal=Idaho Law Review|year=2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=19–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–34}}  Satz wrote that the private nature of arbitration eliminates the incentive for businesses not to engage in practices jeopardizing goodwill.&lt;ref name=satz /&gt;{{rp|36}}

===Viability of post-dispute arbitration agreements===
Commentators have discussed whether post-dispute arbitration agreements are a viable alternative to pre-dispute arbitration agreements, especially in the debate on the [[#Arbitration Fairness Act|Arbitration Fairness Act]], which would make pre-dispute consumer arbitration agreements unenforceable.

In a 2003 article, Lewis L. Maltby discussed the feasibility of post-dispute arbitration, where both parties agree to arbitrate a specific dispute that has already arisen, in the context of employment relationships.  Arbitrations conducted pursuant to a post-dispute agreement made up only 6% of the AAA's 2001 caseload and only 2.6% of its 2002 caseload.&lt;ref name=maltby /&gt;{{rp|319}}  Maltby wrote that employers have an incentive not to agree to post-dispute arbitration of small claims since they know that employees would not be able to pursue those claims in litigation due to the costs of retaining counsel.&lt;ref name=maltby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maltby|first=Lewis L.|title=Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire: The Feasibility of Post-Dispute Employment Arbitration Agreements|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|pages=313–330|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=wmlr|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|317–18}}  A survey of attorneys representing employers showed that 11 out of 20 employment attorneys would consider the financial status of a represented employee plaintiff in deciding whether to agree to post-dispute arbitration, and 13 out of 20 would do so for ''pro se'' employees.&lt;ref name=maltby /&gt;{{rp|325}}  Other attorneys, though, did not consider this to be a factor since a "determined employee" would be likely to find representation or receive help from the court in pursuing their case ''pro se''.&lt;ref name=maltby /&gt;{{rp|325}}  The survey also indicated that 19 out of 20 employer attorneys would refuse to agree to post-dispute arbitration of a dispute they felt "could be won on a pre-trial motion".&lt;ref name=maltby /&gt;{{rp|324}}

Other commentators disagree with the argument that post-dispute arbitration agreements would be rare.  Thomas E. Carbonneau wrote that businesses could offer incentives to entice consumers to arbitrate a dispute after it arises; such incentives may include paying all of the arbitration fees, automatically awarding the consumer party a fraction of its attorney's fees, and having an award for the business reduced by a set proportion.&lt;ref name=carbonneau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carbonneau|first=Thomas E.|title=Arguments in Favor of the Triumph of Arbitration|journal=Cardozo Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=2009|volume=10|issue=2|pages=395–423|url=http://cardozojcr.com/vol10no2/395-424.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|416}}

==Consumer due process standards==
Both the [[American Arbitration Association]] (AAA) and [[JAMS (alternative dispute resolution)|JAMS]] have criteria that a pre-dispute consumer arbitration agreement must satisfy as a condition of the organization agreeing to administer the arbitration.&lt;ref name=jams-consumer-minimum-standards&gt;{{cite web|title=JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses: Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness|url=http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-consumer-minimum-standards/|publisher=JAMS|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa-due-process-protocol&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Due Process Protocol: Statement of Principles of the National Consumer Disputes Advisory Committee|url=http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTG_005014&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased|date=1998-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drahozal-zyontz&gt;{{cite web|last=Drahozal|first=Christopher|title=Private Regulation of Consumer Arbitration|ssrn=1904545|publisher=SSRN|last2=Zyontz|first2=Samantha|date=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include the right for the consumer to be represented by an attorney, the right for a consumer to pursue a claim in small claims court, caps on the arbitration fees charged to a consumer, requirements that arbitration hearings take place at a location convenient for the consumer, and the right to demand a written explanation of the arbitrator's award.{{#tag:ref|For specific references to the applicable rules, see below:

The AAA requires businesses with consumer arbitration clauses inconsistent with the Consumer Due Process Protocol to waive the offending provisions for all disputes or remove the AAA from their clause.&lt;ref name=drahozal-zyontz /&gt;  Christopher R. Drahozal and Samantha Zyontz wrote that, in a sample of 299 cases before the AAA in which an award was issued between April and December 2007, 76.6% of the cases had arbitration agreements that fully complied with the Consumer Due Process Protocol, and only five cases were conducted despite "unwaived protocol violations."&lt;ref name=drahozal-zyontz /&gt;  In addition, over 150 businesses modified their arbitration clauses in response to a request by the AAA to conform to the Consumer Due Process Protocol.&lt;ref name=drahozal-zyontz /&gt;  Michael L.

Some commentators have raised concerns over the limitations of private self-regulation by arbitration forums in the form of consumer standards.  In 2004, Mark E. Budnitz expressed concern that businesses can circumvent consumer protection policies of arbitration organizations by naming alternative arbitration administrators.&lt;ref name=budnitz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budnitz|first=Mark E.|title=The High Cost of Mandatory Consumer Arbitration|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Winter–Spring 2004|volume=67|issue=1/2|pages=133–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, Martin H. Malin wrote in the context of pre-dispute employment arbitration agreements that the concern that "rogue arbitration agencies" could "place competitive pressure on AAA and JAMS to deviate from their rules and policies" was "not a widespread problem," in part due to the reputations of AAA and JAMS.&lt;ref name=malin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malin|first=Martin H.|title=Due Process in Employment Arbitration: The State of the Law and the Need for Self-Regulation|journal=Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal|year=2007|volume=11|pages=363–403|url=http://works.bepress.com/martin_malin/57}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|399}}  Although Malin in 2012 commended the AAA and JAMS employment protocols as positive examples of self-regulation, he criticized the decision of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in ''Brady v. Williams Capital Group'' (2010), which held that the American Arbitration Association's rules requiring the employer to pay all the arbitrator's fees could not override an express contractual provision requiring the arbitrator's fees to be split equally.

==Proposed modifications to consumer arbitration law==
===Carve-outs===
Bills have been proposed that would carve out some disputes from the applicability of the FAA, nullifying arbitration clauses as applied to those disputes.  The first example of such a carve-out was the Motor Vehicle Franchise Arbitration Act, signed into law in 2002, which nullified arbitration clauses in [[car dealership]] [[franchising|franchise]] contracts.&lt;ref name="jost"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jost|first1=Timothy|authorlink1=Timothy Jost|title=Arbitrating Disputes|journal=CQ Researcher|date=2016-03-11|volume=26|issue=11|pages=243–63|publisher=[[CQ Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|248}}  Subsequent legislation carved-out disputes involving high-interest loans to military members, poultry and livestock farmers, and defense contractors bringing claims about civil rights or alleged sexual assault.&lt;ref name=jost /&gt;{{rp|253–54}}  In 2014 Barack Obama issued an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from enforcing arbitration clauses against employees bringing civil rights claims or alleging sexual assault.&lt;ref name=jost /&gt;{{rp|254}}

====Restoring Statutory Rights Act====

In February 2016, Senators [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) and [[Al Franken]] (D- MN) introduced the "Restoring Statutory Rights Act." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-114s2506is/pdf/BILLS-114s2506is.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If enacted, the legislation "would prevent companies from imposing forced arbitration in cases covered by consumer protection laws, as well as in employment discrimination and other civil rights matters." &lt;ref name=ConsumerReports2506&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker |first=Mandy |title=Proposed Law Would Roll Back Mandatory Arbitration |newspaper= Consumer Reports |date= 2016-02-09|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/consumer-protection/proposed-law-will-supersede-mandatory-arbitration}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the primary sponsors, several other Senators agreed to cosponsor the legislation in honor of [[Equal Pay Day]] 2016, including Senators [[Barbara Mikulski]] (D-Md.), [[Patty Murray]] (D-Wash.), [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-Wis.), [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] (D-N.Y.), [[Heidi Heitkamp]] (D-N.D.), [[Barbara Boxer]] (D-Calif.), [[Mazie Hirono]] (D-Hawaii), [[Maria Cantwell]] (D-Wash.), [[Judy Chu]] (D-CA)&lt;ref&gt;http://chu.house.gov/press-release/equal-pay-day-rep-chu-calls-end-forced-arbitration&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeanne Shaheen]] (D-N.H.).

Representatives [[Hank Johnson]] and [[John Conyers]] introduced parallel legislation into the U.S. House of Representatives on April 12, 2016, [[Equal Pay Day]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/276019-house-unveils-bill-to-protect-consumers-right-to-sue&lt;/ref&gt; They explain, "Forced arbitration has created a rigged system that blocks women from enforcing their legal rights against unaccountable and unlawful corporations for wage violations in the workplace.” &lt;ref&gt;http://hankjohnson.house.gov/press-release/johnson-conyers-introduce-legislation-protect-women’s-rights-end-forced-arbitration&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Hill'',&lt;ref name="Hill RSRA introduction"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheeler |first= Lydia |title=Dems introduce bill to restore consumers' right to sue  |newspaper= The Hill |date= 2016-02-04|url=http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/268300-dems-introduce-bill-to-restore-consumers-right-to-sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The legislation is [Senator] Leahy’s response to a ''New York Times'' investigation that found companies are circumventing the courts by forcing consumers in fine print to settle disputes privately with an arbitrator chosen by the company.

====Arbitration Fairness Act====

A bill with the title "Arbitration Fairness Act" has been introduced in Congress several times.  In May 2011, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Al Franken]] and [[Richard Blumenthal]] and Democratic Representative [[Hank Johnson]] introduced the Arbitration Fairness Act, which would have the effect of barring pre-dispute agreements requiring arbitration of consumer, employee, or "civil rights" disputes.&lt;ref name=bennett /&gt;{{rp|34}}  It would also require courts, rather than arbitrators, to determine the applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act to a dispute.&lt;ref name=bennett /&gt;{{rp|34}}

Commentators have criticized the Arbitration Fairness Act on several fronts.  According to Mauricio Gomm-Santos and Quinn Smith, because the Arbitration Fairness Act uses the new terms "consumer dispute", "employment dispute", and "civil rights dispute", litigation would be needed to develop [[case law]] interpreting those terms, and additionally, even outside those areas, a party seeking to avoid or delay arbitration could cast the dispute as a consumer, employment, or civil rights dispute, forcing a court to issue a decision on the applicability of the FAA.&lt;ref name=gomm-santos-smith&gt;{{cite web|last=Gomm-Santos|first=Mauricio|title=The Changing Landscape of Arbitration in the United States and Its Effects on International Arbitration|ssrn=1654354|publisher=SSRN|accessdate=6 September 2013|author2=Quinn Smith|date=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}  Gomm-Santos and Smith also write that the Arbitration Fairness Act would conflict with the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]] and the [[Panama Convention]], which allow for courts to assist in arbitration and confirm arbitration awards, and may affect the ability of businesses in the United States to arbitrate outside of the United States disputes covered by the Arbitration Fairness Act.&lt;ref name=gomm-santos-smith /&gt;{{rp|15–18}}

Reception of the proposed rules was mixed.

The CFPB has not announced a date for publishing a final rule.  Alan Kaplinsky attributes the delay to the fear of a Congressional override of the final rule under the [[Congressional Review Act]], which would "preclude[]" the CFPB "from ever issuing a similar rule in the future."&lt;ref name="kaplinsky-will-he-or-will-he-not"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaplinsky|first1=Alan|authorlink1=Alan Kaplinsky|title=Will he or will he not issue the arbitration rule?|url=https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2017/06/23/will-he-or-will-he-not-issue-the-arbitration-rule/|website=Consumer Finance Monitor|accessdate=3 July 2017|date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an ''[[American Banker]]'' article, the banking industry believes that the CFPB will issue rules restricting consumer arbitration in financial services contracts.&lt;ref name=witkowski-cfpb-likely&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witkowski|first=Rachel|title=CFPB Likely to Crack Down on Arbitration Clauses|journal=[[American Banker]]|date=2013-12-12|volume=178|issue=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ballard Spahr]] attorney [[Alan Kaplinsky]] said, "The CFPB seems to be setting the stage for a rulemaking which will likely not be favorable to the industry", citing the choice of data the CFPB included in its preliminary report.&lt;ref name=witkowski-cfpb-mind-made-up /&gt;  In an article in ''American Banker'', Michael Harmon and Larry Childs suggested that any CFPB regulations limiting the ability for banks to include arbitration provisions in their consumer contracts could result in "a big showdown over the power of the CFPB".&lt;ref name=harmon-childs&gt;{{cite web|last=Harmon|first=Michael|title=What Banks Should Know About Arbitration|url=http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/what-banks-should-know-about-arbitration-1061665-1.html|work=American Banker|accessdate=5 September 2013|last2=Childs|first2=Larry|date=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janet Cooper Alexander wrote that if the CFPB issues regulations that have the effect of reversing ''Concepcion'', the Supreme Court may well strike those regulations, especially if the findings from the arbitration study are deemed insufficient to justify the regulations.&lt;ref name=alexander&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Janet Cooper|title=To Skin a Cat: ''Qui Tam'' Actions as a State Legislative Response to ''Concepcion''|journal=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|year=2013|volume=46|issue=4|pages=101–146|url=http://www.impactlitigation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Alexander-Article.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114–15}}  In October 2015, Matt Adler, the chair of [[Pepper Hamilton]]'s arbitration practice, said that the Supreme Court would find the proposed CFPB rule banning class action waivers in arbitration agreements to be invalid since, he argued, the Dodd-Frank Act did not explicitly amend the FAA and the CFPB lacks expertise to make rules about arbitration.  F. Paul Bland responded that the express delegation of arbitration rulemaking authority to the CFPB was consistent with other laws authorizing executive agencies to make rules.&lt;ref name=sullivan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Bob|title=The CFPB’s Arbitration Ban Could Be the Next Supreme Court Showdown|url=http://blog.credit.com/2015/10/the-cfpbs-arbitration-ban-could-be-the-next-supreme-court-showdown-127505/|website=credit.com|accessdate=30 October 2015|date=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer arbitration outside the United States==
According to Amy J. Schmitz, consumer arbitration agreements are not as regularly enforced in Europe and other countries as they are in the United States.&lt;ref name=schmitz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Amy J.|title=American Exceptionalism in Consumer Arbitration|journal=Loyola University Chicago International Law Review|date=2013-02-05|volume=10|issue=1|pages=80–103|url=http://blogs.law.stanford.edu/codr2013/files/2013/03/Schmitz_AmericanExceptionalism.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}}  [[European Union]] directives classify pre-dispute consumer arbitration clauses as "unfair" terms.&lt;ref name=schmitz /&gt;{{rp|95}}  Under [[France|French law]], pre-dispute arbitration agreements in consumer contracts where the consumer has little bargaining power are "unfair" and therefore not enforceable under the [[French Civil Code]].&lt;ref name=schmitz /&gt;{{rp|95}}  In [[Germany]], consumer arbitration agreements "must be written in an 'intelligible and transparent manner'" and must have the form of a separate document signed by both parties.&lt;ref name=schmitz /&gt;{{rp|96–97}}  In the [[United Kingdom]], agreements to arbitrate monetary claims of less than [[Pound sterling|₤]]5000 are unenforceable (whether pre- or post-dispute), and pre-dispute consumer arbitration agreements are only enforceable if the business "individually negotiated" the clause and "made [it] in good faith" and the clause is not significantly one-sided against the consumer.&lt;ref name=schmitz /&gt;{{rp|98}}

In [[Japan]], consumer arbitration agreements are revocable by the consumer at any time up to the arbitration hearing.&lt;ref name=mcgill&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGill|first=Shelley|title=Consumer Arbitration Clause Enforcement: A Balanced Legislative Response|journal=American Business Law Journal|date=Fall 2010|volume=47|issue=3|pages=361–413|url=http://www.quartetfest.ca/documents/42438/ABLJ_Final_pdf.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1744-1714.2010.01099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|391}}
In Canada, consumer arbitration is a matter of provincial jurisdiction and three provinces (Ontario, Quebec and Alberta) have passed legislation expressly preserving consumer access to the courts.  Ontario and Quebec consumer protection statutes limit enforcement of consumer arbitration clauses and class action waivers.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Protection Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 30, Sch. A, ss. 7 &amp; 8; Consumer Protection Act, R.S.Q. c. P-40.1, s. 11.1&lt;/ref&gt;  In Alberta, only arbitration clauses approved by the government will be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;The Fair Trading Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. F-2, s. 16&lt;/ref&gt;   In the remaining provinces and territories consumer arbitration clauses will block court access for all claims except some statutory “public interest” causes of action. In the 2011 case of Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;2011 SCC 15, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 531&lt;/ref&gt;  the Supreme Court of Canada held that where the text, context or purpose of a statute reveals a legislative intention to preserve court access for a statutory cause of action, access to the courts will be retained notwithstanding a mandatory arbitration clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGill|first=Shelley|title=Consumer Arbitration After Seidel v.

The '''Council of State''' ({{lang-nl|{{Audio|Nl-Raad van State.ogg|Raad van State}}}}) is a [[constitution]]ally established advisory body in the [[Netherlands]] to the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|government]] and [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] that officially consists of members of the royal family and Crown-appointed members generally having political, commercial, diplomatic or military experience. It was founded in 1531, making it one the world's oldest still-functioning state organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raadvanstate.nl/the_council_of_state/|title=The Council of State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of State must be consulted by the cabinet on proposed legislation before a [[law]] is submitted to parliament. The Council of State Administrative Law division also serves as one of the four highest courts of appeal in administrative matters. The [[King of the Netherlands|King]] is president of the Council of State but he seldom chairs meetings. The [[Vice-President of the Council of State]] chairs meetings in his absence and is the ''de facto'' major personality of the institution. Under Dutch constitutional law, the Vice-President of the Council is acting head of state when there is no monarch such as if the royal family were to become extinct.

==History==
{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
===Habsburg Netherlands===
[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] founded a Council of State on 1 October 1531 as one of three ''Collateral Councils'' (the other two were the [[Brussels Privy Council|''Secret'' or ''Privy Council'']] and the ''Council of Finances'') to advise his sister [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]], his regent in the Habsburg Netherlands, and her successors, on ''les grandz et principaulx affaires et ceux qui concernent l'état conduycte et gouvernement des pais, securite et deffense desdits pays de pardeca'',&lt;ref&gt;Geschiedenis, 1531&lt;/ref&gt; in other words the main questions of government, foreign affairs and defense. Members of the council were the great nobles of the realm and a few of the great prelates.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel, pp. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;

After the accession of [[Philip II of Spain]] to the throne and his departure to Spain in 1559 the Council became the forum for the strife between the Spanish representatives in the Council, led by [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle]] and the Netherlandish grandees like [[William the Silent|the Prince of Orange]] and the Counts of [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn|Horne]] and [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont|Egmont]]. The latter faction felt themselves pushed aside and resigned in 1567, leaving the field to a Spanish-dominated Council at the start of the [[Dutch Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel, pp. 139-141&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga]], then governor-general of the Habsburg Netherlands,in 1576, the Council of State temporarily assumed his authority as representative of king Philip, awaiting the arrival of the new governor-general, [[John of Austria|Don Juan]]. Before he could arrive the members of the Council were arrested in a coup by the [[Brussels]] garrison. Soon afterwards the [[Pacification of Ghent]] was concluded pitting the [[States-General of the Netherlands]] against the Spanish crown, represented by Don Juan. When the latter retreated to [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]] in early 1577 the Council of State split in two rumps, one joining Don Juan (and forming the nucleus of what would become the Council of State of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and later the [[Austrian Netherlands]]) the other remaining close to the rebellious States-General. These members were discharged by king Philip in 1578, formally ending the Council as a Habsburg institution in what was to become the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Anjou and Leicester===
When the [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]] came to be temporarily recognized as the new sovereign of the rebellious provinces in 1581, a new Council of State was appointed to advise him and to perform certain executive duties, pertaining to defense and finances. This Council soon split in two regional councils, one for the area West of the river [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], the other for the area East of that river. The first, residing in [[Antwerp]] where the States-General also convened, played the main role up to the departure of the Duke.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel, pp. 212-214&lt;/ref&gt; After his departure the (again unified) Council followed the States-General to [[Middelburg]], [[Delft]], and [[The Hague]]. After the assassination of the Prince of Orange in 1584 the Council was given new executive powers and temporarily assumed full executive authority in the place of the Prince.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel,p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The States-General meanwhile took the lead in the search for another protecting sovereign. This resulted in the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] of 1585 with [[Elizabeth I of England]] that explicitly assumed a leading role of the Council in the evolving constitution of the provinces of the [[Union of Utrecht]]. Article XIV of the treaty authorised Elizabeth to appoint two English representatives on the Council, besides the Governor-General, who would preside the council. The next articles gave far-reaching authority to the Governor-General, acting with the council, in matters of defense, finance and government. For instance, the [[Stadtholder]]s of the provinces would henceforth be appointed by the Governor-General and the Council (art. XXIV), though the [[States of Holland and West Friesland]] preempted this by appointing [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]] stadtholder before [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|the Earl of Leicester]], who would accept the Governor-Generalship, conferred on him by the States-General against the wish of Elizabeth, arrived in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was the first instance of the way the mighty province of Holland frustrated the policies of Leicester. His attempt to found a new Council of Finances (the old one had been dissolved in 1580), which was supposed to take a number of the financial powers of the Council of State, was quietly thwarted. On the instigation of the [[Land's Advocate of Holland]], [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who was a member of the Council, more and more executive tasks of the Council were taken over by the States-General, to dilute English influence on the Dutch affairs of state. These tasks and this influence of the Council did not return after Leicester had left the Netherlands at the end of 1587.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel, pp.223-240&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the Dutch Republic===
By 1588 the Council had therefore reached the structure and functions it would possess during the entire existence of the Dutch Republic. The Council was henceforth made up of members appointed by the States-General on the nomination of the Provincial States (usually about 12), with two members (between 1598 and 1625 one&lt;ref&gt;The Treaty of Nonsuch was renewed and amended by the Treaty of Westminster of 1598; one of the changes was that the number of English councilors was reduced to one; Cf. F.G. Davenport and C.O Paulin, ''European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies'' (Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1917), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;) appointed by the English government.&lt;ref&gt;See for the English members [[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the Netherlands]]; the last English member was [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester]] who left in 1625.&lt;/ref&gt; The stadtholders of the provinces were ''ex officio'' members, at least outside the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] and [[Second Stadtholderless Period]]. The executive powers of the Council were limited to military policy (both on land and sea); administering the [[Dutch States Army]]'s financial aspects (naval affairs were administered by the five ''Admiralties'', founded by Leicester); and formulating and executing tax policy for the [[Generality Lands]].

The Council usually played a self-effacing role, as laid down in its Instruction of 1651, at the beginning of the first Stadtholderless Period. However, the secretary of the Council, [[Simon van Slingelandt]] played a leading role in an attempt at constitutional reform (which would have greatly increased the executive powers of the Council, as intended in the time of Leicester) in 1717. This attempt came to nothing, however.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Israel, pp. 987-988&lt;/ref&gt;

After the overthrow of the regime of stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange]] and the founding of the [[Batavian Republic]] in 1795, the Council was dissolved, together with the States-General.

===Under the Kingdom of the Netherlands===
Though an advisory council with the nostalgic name Council of State was again instituted in the waning days of the Batavian Republic in 1805, and also the successor [[Kingdom of Holland]] had an institution with that name (modeled on the contemporary French Council of State), these councils disappeared again during the years of the annexation by France (1810-1813).&lt;ref&gt;Geschiedenis, Franse tijd&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the restoration of Dutch independence in 1813 a new Council of State was founded as laid down in the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Constitutions]] of 1814 and 1815. These constitutions explicitly stated that all "Acts of Sovereign Dignity" by the Sovereign Prince and later the King, would only be enacted after the advice of the Council was heard. These included both Acts of the States-General and Royal Decrees, important, because the first king, [[William I of the Netherlands]] liked to rule by decree. The King presided over the new Council, and the Crown-Prince would be a member ''ex officio'' after reaching the age of majority. In practice, however, a vice-president presided over the deliberations of the Council, the King only taking over on ceremonial occasions. Members were appointed from all provinces, both "Dutch" and "Belgian". After the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830 the Belgian members left. The new [[Kingdom of Belgium]] did not institute its own [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]] until 1946 as an administrative court.&lt;ref&gt;Geschiedenis, 1814&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raad van State vergaderzaal.jpg|thumb|The Council of State's meeting room in the [[Binnenhof]]; the King's chair (left) is empty]]
Under the new constitution of 1848 the Council of State was reformed in the sense that its structure and functions were delegated to an Organic Law. The first such law (the Council of State Act) was enacted in 1861. The most important innovation of this law was that besides the advisory task of the Council in matters of law giving the Council would also advise in cases in which conflicts between administrative organs (like provinces and municipalities) were put before the Crown (king and ministers) for resolution. For this type of advice a new subdivision of the Council was formed that came to act like an administrative court (though the formal decision rested with the Crown). This function of high administrative court was enlarged in the succeeding century. Finally, the 1861 law made the Council the institution that would exercise royal authority in the absence of the king or a regent.&lt;ref&gt;Geschiedenis, 1848&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 the revised constitution opened the way for making the Council a formal administrative court. This did not actually happen before 1963 when the ''Wet Beroep Administratieve Beschikkingen'' (BAB, Administrative Decisions Review Act) was enacted, replaced in 1976 by the ''Wet Administratief Beroep Overheidsbeschikkingen'' (AROB, Administrative Decisions Appeals Act). This setup had to be changed after 1988, because the [[European Court of Human Rights]] deemed the fact that the Council of State was not an independent institution contrary to the provisions of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. To remedy this defect the "judicial" part of the Council was in 1994 made formally independent from the part that advised on legislative matters. This split in two separate parts was confirmed in the most recent revision (2010) of the Council of State Act.&lt;ref&gt;Geschiedenis, 1962-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dangerous Dogs Act 1991''' (c. 65) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that was introduced in response to various incidents of serious injury or death resulting from attacks by aggressive and uncontrolled [[dog]]s, particularly on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/whatever-happened-to-dangerous-dogs-1360126.html|title=Whatever happened to Dangerous dogs?|date=26 October 1996|work=The Independent|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has attracted criticism as an example of poorly-drafted legislation hastily enacted in response to a short-lived media storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36033778/a-short-history-of-the-dangerous-dog-and-why-certain-breeds-are-banned|title=A short history of the 'dangerous dog' and why certain breeds are banned - BBC Newsbeat|first=Del|last=Crookes|date=13 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/18/dangerous-dogs-act-in-spotlight|title=Bark but no bite: Dangerous Dogs Act in spotlight as attacks rise|first1=Patrick|last1=Barkham|first2=Simon|last2=Murphy|date=18 January 2012|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluecross.org.uk/if-looks-couldnt-kill|title=If looks couldn't kill|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The effect of the act==
Under the 1991 act, introduced by MP [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Ken Baker]] (and as amended in 1997) it is illegal to own any Specially Controlled Dogs  without specific exemption from a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/dangerous-dogs-act-has-never-worked-says-rspca-6229252.html|title=Dangerous Dogs Act has never worked, says RSPCA|date=13 January 2007|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dogs have to be [[Muzzle (device)|muzzle]]d and kept on a lead in public, they must be registered and insured, neutered, tattooed and receive [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchip implants]]. The Act also bans the [[dog breeding|breeding]], sale and exchange of these dogs, even if they are on the Index of Exempted Dogs.&lt;ref name="DEFRA leaflet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of dogs prohibited in Great Britain : Guidance on the recognition of prohibited dogs in Great Britain |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/domestic/ddogsleaflet.pdf |publisher=Defra |accessdate=7 February 2013 |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309200431/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/domestic/ddogsleaflet.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2007 }} via Internet Archive Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;

Four types in particular were identified by the Act:

* [[Pit Bull Terrier]]
* [[Tosa (dog)|Japanese Tosa]]
* [[Dogo Argentino]]
* [[Fila Brasileiro]]

The Act also covers cross-breeds of the above four types of dog. Dangerous dogs are classified by "type", not by breed label. This means that whether a dog is prohibited under the Act will depend on a judgement about its physical characteristics, and whether they match the description of a prohibited "type". This assessment of the physical characteristics is made by a court.

The Act applies in England, Wales and Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=dangerous+dogs&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1540398&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1540384&amp;showAllAttributes=0&amp;showProsp=0&amp;suppressWarning=0&amp;hideCommentary=1|title=Dangerous Dogs Act 1991|website=www.statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with The Dangerous Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 having a similar effect in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=dangerous+dogs&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1009700&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1009700&amp;filesize=31262|title=The Dangerous Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1991|website=www.statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Index of Exempted Dogs==
The Index of Exempted Dogs is maintained by the Animal Welfare section of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], which administers the registration of specially-controlled dogs in England and Wales.

In 1991 and 1992, details of all Specially Controlled Dogs and their owners and keepers had to be added to the Index of Exempted Dogs. From early 1992 to 1997, no dogs were allowed to be added to the Index. In 1997, The Dangerous Dogs (Amendment) Act 1997 was passed which made some changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04348/SN04348.pdf |title=Research briefing |website=researchbriefings.files.parliament |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69263/dogs-guide-enforcers.pdf |title=Dangerous Dogs Law - Guidance for Enforcers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case law==
There have been several test cases of the act, including [[Dempsey (dog)|Dempsey]], a pit bull terrier which in 1995 was finally reprieved from a destruction order, to widespread media attention.{{fact|date=September 2016}}  The definition of the word "type" in the legislation was of particular controversy, as was the lack of discretion that the Act gives magistrates.

In the case of ''R (Sandhu) v. Isleworth Crown Court'', the claimant Sandhu was in prison and sought to nominate a temporary keeper to have his dog.  The judicial review held that a person does have the right to nominate a person to temporarily keep the dog.  This decision has more recently been more regulated to only allow for temporary keepership in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexisweb.co.uk/cases/2012/may/r-on-the-application-of-sandhu-v-isleworth-crown-court|title=R (on the application of Sandhu) v Isleworth Crown Court - LexisWeb|website=lexisweb.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the act==
The act has been described as a piece of rushed legislation which was an overreaction to a transient public mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6222689.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dog control laws and pit bulls | date=11 September 2007 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/04/13/dl1301.xml&amp;sSheet=/opinion/2004/04/13/ixoplead.html&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=15826 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=The Lords is the more democratic house | date=13 April 2004 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is sometimes cited as an unfavourable example of such legislation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/press_office/news_latest_all.asp?pressid=395|title=fabians.org.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/05/animalwelfare.world|title=Whatever happened to dangerous dogs?|first=Iain|last=Hollingshead|date=5 November 2005|work=The Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2007, the act was included in public responses to a [[BBC Radio 4]] poll of unpopular UK legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6222247.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hunting ban tops 'unpopular' poll | date=1 January 2007 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act has also been criticised as ineffectual because its mandate is limited to the four banned breeds; it has been suggested that the act be amended to expand it remit to deal with dangerous dogs of any kind, irrespective of the breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37141437|title=Dangerous Dogs Act has never worked - Andrew Rosindell MP|work=BBC News|date=20 August 2016|access-date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50#Legal proceedings against the government|Brexit litigation about Article 50 in the supreme court]], the Dangerous Dogs Act was used as an example that even such a law cannot be cancelled by the royal prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/government-accused-treating-eu-legislation-contempt-supreme-court-article-50|title=Government accused of treating Britain's EU laws with contempt|work=The Guardian|date=6 December 2016|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparable legislation elsewhere==
{{mainarticle|Breed-specific legislation}}
Many other countries also have laws pertaining to dangerous dogs. These vary in severity. In some jurisdictions in [[Australia]], dogs which have been declared dangerous are required to wear a collar of red and yellow stripes; under the legislation of some municipalities of [[Queensland]], such dogs are seized and killed. In some local government areas, restrictions are very carefully spelt out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockingham.wa.gov.au/Resident_Services/ranger-pages/restricted-dog-breeds.php|title=Restricted Dog Breeds in Rockingham, Western Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Economic substance''' is a [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] in the [[tax law]] of the [[Taxation in the United States|United States]] under which a transaction must have both a substantial purpose aside from reduction of tax liability and an economic effect aside from the tax effect in order to be considered valid.

[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement européen Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|450px|The EU has a population of 510 million people, the largest combined economy in the world, and a very high rate of [[human development (humanity)|human development]]. A recipient of the [[2012 Nobel Peace Prize]], the EU is committed to "[[human dignity]], [[freedom]], [[democracy]], [[Social equality|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for [[human rights]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty on European Union]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_2 art 2]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''European Union law''' is the system of laws operating within the member states of the [[European Union]]. The EU has political institutions and social and economic policies. According to its [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]], the EU represents "a new legal order of [[international law]]".&lt;ref name="Case 26/62"&gt;''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]'' (1963) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61962CJ0026 Case 26/62]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's legal foundations are the [[Treaty on European Union]] and the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], unanimously agreed by the governments of 28 member states. New states may join the EU, if they agree to operate by the rules of the organisation, and existing members may leave according to their "own constitutional requirements".&lt;ref name="art 50"&gt;TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_VI:_Final_Provisions#Article_50 art 50]. On the most sophisticated discussion of [[constitutional law]] and human rights principles for secession, see ''[[Reference Re Secession of Quebec]]'' [1998] [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii793/1998canlii793.html 2 SCR 217], particularly [67] "The [[consent of the governed]] is a value that is basic to our understanding of a free and democratic society.  Yet democracy in any real sense of the word cannot exist without the rule of law". And [149] "Democracy, however, means more than simple majority rule".&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens are able to vote directly in [[Elections to the European Parliament|elections]] to the [[European Parliament|Parliament]], while their national governments operate on behalf of them in the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Council]]. The [[European Commission|Commission]] is the executive branch. The Council of the European Union represents member state governments, while the Court of Justice is meant to uphold the [[rule of law]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;See TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_III:_Provisions_on_the_Institutions#Article_13 arts 13–19]&lt;/ref&gt; As the Court of Justice said, the EU is "not merely an economic union" but is intended to "ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples".&lt;ref name="Case 43/75" /&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of the European Union|Ideas of European unity before 1945|Enlargement of the European Union}}
[[File:Europa Blaue.png|thumb|left|400px|The idea of European Union for [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] and [[peace]] goes back to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Distinct from the idea of conquest or empire, examples include [[Pierre Dubois]] proposing a standing committee of princes in 1306, Quaker [[William Penn]] proposing a Parliament in 1693, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Henri Saint-Simon]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willem Blaeu]]'s map shows Europe in 1644 as the [[Thirty Years' War]] ended, before the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648.]]
Democratic ideals of integration for international and European nations are as old as the modern [[nation-state]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''The Evolution of EU Law'' (2011) and P Craig, 'The Development of the EU' in C Barnard and S Peers (eds), ''European Union Law'' (2014) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient concepts of European unity were generally undemocratic, and founded on domination, like the Empire of [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Roman Empire]], or the [[History of the Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] controlled by the [[History of the papacy|Pope]] in Rome. In the [[Renaissance]], medieval trade flourished in organisations like the [[Hanseatic League]], stretching from English towns like [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] and [[London]], to [[Frankfurt]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Riga]]. These traders developed the ''[[lex mercatoria]]'', spreading basic norms of [[good faith]] and fair dealing through their business. In 1517, the [[Protestant Reformation]] triggered a hundred years of crisis and instability. [[Martin Luther]] nailed a list of demands to the church door of [[Wittenberg]], [[King Henry VIII]] declared a unilateral split from Rome with the [[Act of Supremacy 1534]], and conflicts flared across the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the [[Peace of Augsburg 1555]] guaranteed each principality the right to its chosen religion (''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''). This unstable settlement unravelled in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), killing around a quarter of the population in central Europe. The [[Treaty of Westphalia 1648]], which brought peace according to a system of [[international law]] inspired by [[Hugo Grotius]], is generally acknowledged as the beginning of the nation-state system. Even then, the [[English Civil War]] broke out and the tensions did not fully end until the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, by Parliament inviting [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] from Holland to the throne, and passing the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]. In 1693 [[William Penn]], a [[Quaker]] from London who founded [[Pennsylvania]] in North America, argued that to prevent ongoing wars in Europe a "European dyet, or parliament" was needed.&lt;ref&gt;W Penn, ''An ESSAY towards the Present and Future Peace of Europe by the Establishment of an European Dyet, Parliament, or Estates'' ([http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/893/77004 1693]) in AR Murphy, ''The Political Writings of William Penn'' (2002) See D Urwin, ''The Community of Europe: A History of European Integration'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The French diplomat, [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre]], who worked negotiating the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] at the end of the [[War of Spanish Succession]] proposed, through "[[Perpetual Union]]", "an everlasting peace in Europe",&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre|C de Saint-Pierre]], ''A Project for Settling an Everlasting Peace in Europe'' (1713)&lt;/ref&gt; a project taken up by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]],&lt;ref&gt;[[JJ Rousseau]], ''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/rousseau-a-lasting-peace-through-the-federation-of-europe-and-the-state-of-war A lasting peace through the federation of Europe; and, The state of war]'' (1756)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Immanuel Kant]] after him.&lt;ref&gt;[[I Kant]], ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' or ''Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf'' ([https://archive.org/stream/perpetualpeaceph00kantuoft/#page/n9/mode/2up 1795])&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in the 19th century, [[Victor Hugo]] at the [[International Peace Congress]] in 1849 envisioned a day when there would be a "United States of America and the [[United States of Europe]] face to face, reaching out for each other across the seas".&lt;ref&gt;[[V Hugo]], ''Opening Address to the Peace Congress'' (21 August 1849). Afterwards, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] joined [[Victor Hugo]] at the Congress of the League of Peace and Freedom in Geneva 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; [[World War I]] devastated Europe's society and economy, and the [[Versailles Treaty]] failed to establish a workable international system in the [[League of Nations]], any European integration, and imposed punishing terms of [[World War I reparations|reparation payments]] for the losing countries.&lt;ref&gt;See [[JM Keynes]], ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'' (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; After another economic collapse and the rise of fascism led to a Second World War, European [[civil society]] was determined to create a lasting union to guarantee [[world peace]] through economic, social and political integration.

[[File:EU Roma Musei Capitolini hall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Treaty of Rome 1957]], signed in ''[[Musei Capitolini]]'' was the first [[international treaty]] that envisaged social, economic and political integration, within limited fields, for nation-states.]]
To "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice.. brought untold [[Sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]] to mankind",&lt;ref&gt;See the [[UN Charter 1945]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations#Preamble Preamble]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations Charter]] was passed in 1945, and the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] set up a new system of integrated world [[World Bank|bank]]ing and [[International Monetary Fund|finance]], and proposed a new system of integrated world [[International Trade Organization|trade]]. Also, the [[Council of Europe]], formed by the [[Treaty of London 1949]], adopted a [[European Convention on Human Rights]], overseen by a new transnational [[European Court of Human Rights|court]] in [[Strasbourg]] in 1950. Already in 1946 [[Winston Churchill]], who had been recently defeated as [[UK Prime Minister]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]], had called for a "[[United States of Europe]]" with the UK "at the centre".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. 'Speech to the 69th Annual Conservative Party Conference at Llandudno' ([https://www.biblio.com/book/winston-churchills-9-october-1948-speech/d/472181237 9 October 1948]). See J Danzig 'Winston Churchill: A founder of the European Union' (10 November 2013) [https://eu-rope.ideasoneurope.eu/2013/11/10/winston-churchill-a-founder-of-the-european-union/ EU ROPE]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the French Foreign Minister [[Robert Schuman]] proposed that, beginning with integration of French and German coal and steel production, there should be "an organisation open to the participation of the other countries of Europe", where "solidarity in production" would make war "not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible".&lt;ref&gt;[[R Schuman]], ''Speech to the French National Assembly'' ([http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration/index_en.htm 9 May 1950])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Paris 1951]] created the first [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), signed by France, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy, with [[Jean Monnet]] as its president. Its theory was simply that war would be impossibly costly if ownership and production of every country's economy was mixed together. It established an Assembly (now the [[European Parliament]]) to represent the people, a [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] for the member states, a [[European Commission|Commission]] as the executive, and a [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] to interpret the law. In the East, the [[Soviet Union]] had installed dictatorial governments, controlling East Germany, and the rest of Eastern Europe. Although [[Stalin]] died in 1953 and the new [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had denounced him in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;[[N Khrushchev]], ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]'' (25 February 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet [[tanks]] crushed a democratic [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], and repressed every other attempt of its people to win democracy and human rights.

[[File:EC-EU-enlargement animation.gif|thumb|250px|left|The EU evolved from the [[Coal and Steel Community]] of 6 member states, to a union of 28 member states in 2013. A [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum in the UK]] of 51.89% to leave, 48.11% to remain, on a 72.21% turnout in June 2016 led the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] to resign, and left the UK's membership uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;See Bloomberg, [https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-referendum/ EU Referendum: Final Results] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the West, the decision was made through [[Treaty of Rome 1957]] to launch the first [[European Economic Community]]. It shared the Assembly and Court with the Coal and Steel Community, but set up parallel bodies for the Council and Commission. Based on the [[Spaak Report]] of 1956, it sought to break down all barriers to trade in a [[common market]] for goods, services, labour and capital, and prevent distortion of competition and regulate areas of common interest like agriculture, energy and transport.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Comite Intergouvernemental créé par la conference de Messine. Rapport des chefs de delegation aux ministres des affaires etrangeres'' ([http://www.unizar.es/euroconstitucion/library/historic%20documents/Rome/preparation/Spaak%20report%20fr.pdf 21 April 1956]) text in French.&lt;/ref&gt; A separate treaty was signed for a [[European Atomic Energy Community]] to manage nuclear production. In 1961 the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland and Norway applied for membership only to be vetoed in 1963 by France's [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Spain also applied and was rejected as it was still led by the [[Franco dictatorship]]. The same year, the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] proclaimed that the Community constituted a "new legal order of international law".&lt;ref name="Case 26/62"/&gt; The [[Merger Treaty 1965]] finally placed the ECSC and [[Euratom]] within the [[EEC]]. Shortly after, [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] boycotted the Commission, which he believed was pressing supranationalism too far. The [[Luxembourg compromise]] in 1966 agreed that France (or other countries) could veto issues of "very important national interest", particularly relating to the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], instead of making decisions by "[[qualified majority]]". But after the [[May 1968 events in France]] and [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s resignation, the way was free for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to join in 1973. [[Norway–European Union relations|Norway]] had rejected joining in a [[Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972|1972 referendum]], while the UK confirmed its membership in a [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the [[European Economic Community]] itself, the European continent underwent a profound transition towards democracy. The dictators of Greece and Portugal were deposed in 1974, and Spain's dictator died in 1975, enabling their accession in 1981 and 1986. In 1979, the [[European Parliament]] had its first direct elections, reflecting a growing consensus that the EEC should be less a union of member states, and more a union of peoples. The [[Single European Act 1986]] increased the number of treaty issues in which [[qualified majority]] voting (rather than consensus) would be used to legislate, as a way to accelerate trade integration. The [[Schengen Agreement]] of 1985 (not initially signed by Italy, the UK, Ireland, Denmark or Greece) allowed movement of people without any border checks. Meanwhile, in 1987, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced policies of "transparency" and "restructuring" (''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]''). This revealed the depths of corruption and waste. In April 1989, the [[People's Republic of Poland]] legalised the Solidarity organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June elections. These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the fall of communism. In November 1989, protestors in [[Berlin]] began taking down the [[Berlin Wall]], which became a symbol of the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]], with most of Eastern Europe declaring independence and moving to hold democratic elections by 1991.

[[File:Anti-austerity protest (Athens) June 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Since 2011, [[anti-austerity]] protests have flared across Europe, particularly in [[Athens]], Greece, demanding the [[European Central Bank]] and [[European Commission|Commission]] upholds [[social and economic rights]].]]
The [[Treaty of Maastricht 1992]] renamed the EEC as the "[[European Union]]", and expanded its powers to include a [[European labour law|social chapter]], set up a [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], and limit government spending. The UK initially opted out of the social provisions, and then monetary union after the [[Black Wednesday]] crisis where speculators bet against the [[Pound Sterling|pound]]. Sweden, Finland and Austria joined in 1995, but Norway again chose not to after a [[Norwegian European Union membership referendum, 1994|1994 referendum]], instead remaining part of the [[European Economic Area]], abiding by most EU law, but without any voting rights. At the [[Treaty of Amsterdam 1997]], with a new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, the UK joined the social chapter. A newly confident EU then sought to expand. First, the [[Treaty of Nice 2001]] made voting weight more proportionate to population (two Irish referenda rejected, but then accepted this). Second, the [[Euro]] currency went into circulation in 2002. Third came the accession of Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Fourth, in 2005 a [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] was proposed. This "Constitution" was largely symbolic, but was rejected by referenda in France and the Netherlands. Most of its technical provisions were inserted into the [[Treaty of Lisbon 2007]], without the emotive symbols of federalism or the word "constitution". Also in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania joined. Over 2007 to 2008, because of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in the United States, and the developing [[global financial crisis]] European banks that had invested in [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] were put under severe pressure. British, French, German and other governments were forced to nationalise or guarantee their banks' debts. In turn, the [[Eurozone crisis]] developed when international investment withdrew and Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland saw international bond markets charge unsustainably high [[interest rates]] on government debt. Eurozone governments and staff of the [[European Central Bank]] believed that it was necessary to save their banks by taking over Greek debt, and impose "[[austerity]]" and "[[structural adjustment]]" measures on debtor countries. This exacerbated further contraction in the economies. In 2011 two new treaties, the [[European Fiscal Compact]] and [[European Stability Mechanism]] were signed among [[Eurozone]] countries. In 2013, Croatia entered the EU. However a further crisis was triggered after the UK's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government chose to hold a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum]] in 2016, and campaigners for "leave" (or "Brexit") won 51.89 per cent of votes on a 72.2 per cent turnout.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/36/contents c 36]) on the campaign rules for the poll.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hémycicle du Parlement européen (Bruxelles).JPG|thumb|right|400px|The [[European Parliament]], elected by EU citizens, makes new laws with the [[European Commission|Commission]] and [[European Council|Council]].&lt;ref&gt;TEU arts and [[TFEU]] arts 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; To address the EU's "[[democratic deficit]]",&lt;ref&gt;e.g. J Weiler, ''The Constitution of Europe'' (1999), C Hoskyns and M Newman, ''Democratizing the European Union'' (2000), A Moravcsik, 'In Defence of the "Democratic Deficit": Reassessing Legitimacy in the European Union' (2002) 40 JCMS 603, [[P Craig]] and G de Burca, ''The Evolution of EU Law'' (2nd edn 2011) ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament increasingly assumed more rights in the legislative process. Proposals have not yet been adopted to allow it to initiate legislation, require the Commission to be from the Parliament, and reduce the power of the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[J Habermas]], 'Democracy in Europe: Why the Development of the EU into a Transnational Democracy Is Necessary and How It Is Possible' (2015) 21(4) European Law Journal 546. See also [[HLA Hart]], ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' (1961) ch 4, on the danger of a static system and "rules of change".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although the European Union does not have a [[Uncodified constitution|codified constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;In 2005, a [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] was rejected by [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|referenda in France]] and the [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|Netherlands]].&lt;/ref&gt; like every political body it has laws which "constitute" its basic governance structure.&lt;ref&gt;This is similar to the [[UK constitutional law|United Kingdom]]. See AW Bradley and [[KD Ewing]], ''Constitutional and Administrative Law'' (2012) ch 1 and W Bagehot, ''[[The English Constitution]]'' (1867)&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's primary constitutional sources are the [[Treaty on European Union]] and the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], which have been agreed or [[Contract of adhesion|adhered]] to among the governments of all 28 member states. The Treaties establish the EU's institutions, list their powers and responsibilities, and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]] or [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulations]]. The [[European Commission]] has the initiative to propose legislation.&lt;ref&gt;TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_III:_Provisions_on_the_Institutions#Article_17 art 17]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[European Union legislative procedure|ordinary legislative procedure]], the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] (which are ministers from member state governments) and the [[European Parliament]] (elected by citizens) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass.&lt;ref&gt;TFEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Chapter_2:_Legal_acts_of_the_Union,_adoption_procedures_and_other_provisions#SECTION_2:_PROCEDURES_FOR_THE_ADOPTION_OF_ACTS_AND_OTHER_PROVISIONS art 294]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission|Commission]] oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law. The "[[European Council]]" (rather than the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], made up of different government Ministers) is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive presidents of the member states. It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the [[European Central Bank]]. The [[European Court of Justice]] is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU law, and develops it through precedent. The Court can review the legality of the EU institutions' actions, in compliance with the Treaties. It can also decide upon claims for breach of EU laws from member states and citizens.

===Treaties===
{{main article|Treaties of the European Union}}
{{Clist eu treaties}}
The [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU) and the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU) are the two main sources of EU law. Representing agreements between all member states, the TEU focuses more on principles of democracy, human rights, and summarises the [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]], while the [[TFEU]] expands on all principles and fields of policy in which the EU can legislate. In principle, the EU treaties are like any other international agreement, which will usually be interpreted according to principles codified by the [[Vienna Convention 1969]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Convention 1969]] art 5, on application to constituent instruments of international organisations.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be amended by unanimous agreement at any time, but TEU itself, in article 48, sets out an amendment procedure through proposals via the Council and a Convention of national Parliament representatives.&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 48. This is the "ordinary" procedure, and a further "simplified" procedure for amending internal EU policy, but not increasing policy competence, can work through unanimous member state approval without a Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; Under TEU article 5(2), the "principle of conferral" says the EU can do nothing except the things which it has express authority to do. The limits of its competence are governed by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]], and the courts and Parliaments of member states.&lt;ref&gt;See further T Arnull, 'Does the Court of Justice Have Inherent Jurisdiction?' (1990) 27 CMLRev 683&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eurozone map left}}
As the European Union has grown from 6 to 28 member states, a clear procedure for accession of members is set out in TEU article 49. The [[European Union]] is only open to a "European" state which respects the principles of "[[human dignity]], [[freedom]], democracy, [[Social equality|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group|minorities]]". Countries whose territory is wholly outside the European continent cannot therefore apply.&lt;ref&gt;Island territories geographically outside the EU, but politically within include [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[overseas departments|French overseas departments]]. The [[Faroe Islands]] are expressly excluded from EU law. Specific provisions can be made for others, like [[Gibraltar]] the [[Åland islands]], and [[Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nor can any country without fully democratic political institutions which ensure standards of "[[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], non-discrimination, [[toleration|tolerance]], justice, [[solidarity]] and equality between women and men prevail".&lt;ref&gt;TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions art 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 50 says any member state can withdraw in accord "with its own constitutional requirements", by negotiated "arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union". This indicates that the EU is not entitled to demand a withdrawal, and that member states should follow constitutional procedures, for example, through Parliament or a codified constitutional document.&lt;ref name="art 50"/&gt; Once article 50 is triggered, there is a two-year time limit to complete negotiations, a procedure which would leave a seceding member without any [[Inequality of bargaining power|bargaining power]] in negotiations, because the costs of having no trade treaty would be proportionally greater to the individual state than the remaining EU bloc.&lt;ref&gt;cf S Lechner and R Ohr, 'The right of withdrawal in the treaty of Lisbon: a game theoretic reflection on different decision processes in the EU' (2011) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-009-9139-1 32 European Journal of Law and Economics 357]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 7 allows member states to be suspended for a "clear risk of a serious breach" of values in article 2 (for example, democracy, equality, human rights) with a four-fifths vote of the [[Council of the European Union]], and the consent of the [[European Parliament|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_7 art 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the treaties' framework, sub-groups of member states may make further rules that only apply to those member states who want them. For example, the [[Schengen Agreements]] of 1985 and 1990 allow people to move without any passport or ID checks anywhere in the EU, but did not apply to the UK or Ireland. More recently, during the [[Eurozone crisis]], the [[Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism 2012]] and the [[Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance 2012]] (the "Fiscal Compact") were adopted only for member states who had the [[Euro]] (i.e. not Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania or Bulgaria). This required, among other things, a pledge to balance the government budget and limit structural deficits to 0.5 per cent of GDP, with fines for non-compliance. The jurisdiction for these rules remains with the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 273, for a 'special agreement' of the parties, and ''[[Pringle v Ireland]]'' (2012) C-370/12 held the 'special agreement' could be given in advance with reference to a whole class of pre-defined disputes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive institutions===
{{main article|European Commission|European Civil Service|European Central Bank}}
{{Clist eu executive}}
The [[European Commission]] is the main executive body of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) ch 2, 31–40&lt;/ref&gt; Article 17(1) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] states the Commission should "promote the general interest of the Union" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be "completely independent" and not "take instructions from any Government". Under Article 17(2), "Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise". This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council or Parliament are the "''de facto'' catalysts of many legislative initiatives".&lt;ref&gt;[[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) 36&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's president (currently an ex-Luxembourg prime minister, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]]) sets the agenda for its work.&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 17(6)&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote,&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 250&lt;/ref&gt; often through a "written procedure" of circulating the proposal and adopting it if there are no objections.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In response to Ireland's initial rejection of the [[Treaty of Lisbon 2007]], it was agreed to keep the system of one Commissioner from each of the member states, including the [[President of the European Commission|President]] and the [[High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy]] (currently [[Federica Mogherini]])&lt;ref&gt;, despite TEU art 17(5) allowing this figure to be reduced to two-thirds of the number of member states. It is now unclear whether this will happen.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commissioner President is elected by the European Parliament by an absolute majority of its members, following the parliamentary elections every five years, on the basis of a proposal by the European Council.  The latter must take account of the results of the European elections, in which European political parties announce the name of their candidate for this post. Hence, in 2014, Juncker, the candidate of the [[European People's Party]] which won the most seats in Parliament, was proposed and elected. The remaining commissioners are appointed by agreement between the president-elect and each national government, and are then, as a block, subject to a [[qualified majority vote]] of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 17(7)&lt;/ref&gt;   The Parliament can only approve or reject the whole commission, not individual commissioners but conducts public hearings with each of them prior to its vote, which in practice often triggers changes to individual appointments or portfolios. TFEU art 248 says the president may reshuffle commissioners, though this is uncommon, without member state approval. A proposal that the commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], though in practice several Commissioners are from the Parliament, but relinquish their seat in order to serve.

[[File:Blockupy 2015 (16237761803).jpg|right|thumb|The [[European Central Bank]], whose [[Frankfurt]] headquarters opened in 2015, exercises executive control within its monetary policy powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Chapter_1:_The_Institutions#SECTION_6:_THE_EUROPEAN_CENTRAL_BANK 282–287]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been targeted by [[Blockupy movement|protests]] for its role in the [[Eurozone crisis]].]]
Commissioners have various privileges, such as being exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Humblet v Belgium]]'' (1960) Case 6/60&lt;/ref&gt; and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sayag v Leduc (No 1)|Sayag v Leduc]]'' (1968) Case 5/68, [1968] ECR 395 and ''[[Weddel &amp; Co BV v Commission]]'' (1992) C-54/90, [1992] ECR I-871, on immunity waivers.&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the [[Santer Commission]] was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, ''[[Commission v Edith Cresson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2006) C-432/04, [2006] ECR I-6387&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[European Court of Justice]] held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the [[ECJ]]'s relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had 'even the slightest sense of responsibility'.&lt;ref&gt;Committee of Independent Experts, ''First Report on Allegations of Fraud, Mismanagement and Nepotism in the European Commission'' (15 March 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of the [[European Anti-fraud Office]]. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, [[John Dalli]], who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a [[Tobacco Products Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobacco Products Directive]] [http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/dir_201440_en.pdf 2014/40/EU]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the commission, the [[European Central Bank]] has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of [[monetary policy]] for the purpose of managing the [[euro]].&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 282–287&lt;/ref&gt; It has a six-person board appointed by the [[European Council]], on the [[Council of Ministers|Council]]'s recommendation. The president of the council and a commissioner can sit in on [[European Central Bank|ECB]] meetings, but do not have voting rights.

===Legislature===
{{main article|Legislature of the European Union|European Parliament|Council of the European Union|European Council}}
{{Clist eu legislature}}
[[File:European Parliament as of June 2015.svg|thumb|left|The [[European Parliament|Parliament]] is elected each five years, aspiring to the "principle of equality of its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;cf. TEU art [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_II:_Provisions_on_Democratic_Principles 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Its power is limited compared to the [[European Commission|Commission]] and [[Council of the European Union|Council]].]] 
While the [[European Commission|Commission]] has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union]] have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process.&lt;ref&gt;[[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) chs 2 and 5, 40–56 and 124–160&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Treaty on European Union]] articles 9 and 10, the EU observes "the principle of equality of its citizens" and is meant to be founded on "representative democracy". In practice, [[equality before the law|equality]] and democracy are still in development because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes,&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 225(2) and 294(2)&lt;/ref&gt; citizens of smallest countries have greater voting weight in Parliament than citizens of the largest countries,&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 14(2) and Council Decision 2002/772&lt;/ref&gt; and "qualified majorities" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate.&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 16(3) and [[TFEU]] art 238(3)&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[democratic deficit]]" has encouraged numerous proposals for reform, and is usually perceived as a hangover from earlier days of integration led by member states. Over time, the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process.&lt;ref&gt;See [[P Craig]] and G de Burca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials'' (2015) ch 2(6) 50–51. See the EP Resolution of 30 March 1962. Recognised in SEA art 3(1). TEEC art 190(4) required proposals for elections&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the [[European Commission|Commission]] with one million signatures. [[TFEU]] article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them.&lt;ref&gt;See Marias, 'The Right to Petition the European Parliament after Maastricht' (1994) 19 ELR 169&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elections to the European Parliament|Parliament elections]], take place every five years, and votes for [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEP) in member states must be organised by [[proportional representation]] or a [[single transferable vote]].&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 14(3) and Decision 2002/772. [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU) art 223(1) requires the Parliament to eventually propose a uniform voting system, adopted by the Council, but it is unclear when this may happen.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are "degressively proportional" according to member state size.&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 14(2) reduced from 765 in 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This means – although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states – in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states.&lt;ref&gt;Germany 96. France 74. UK and Italy 73. Spain 54. Poland 51. Romania 31. Netherlands 26. Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal 21. Sweden 20. Austria 18. Bulgaria 17. Denmark, Slovakia, Finland 13. Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania 11. Latvia, Slovenia 8. Estonia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta 6.&lt;/ref&gt; MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative [[European People's Party]] is currently the largest, and the [[Party of European Socialists]] leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held in ''[[Parti écologiste "Les Verts" v Parliament]]'' that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states.&lt;ref&gt;(1986) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61983CJ0294 Case 294/83], [1986] ECR 1339. The Greens challenged funding, contending its distribution was unfair against smaller parties, and it was held all funding was ''ultra vires''. See Joliet and Keeling, 'The Reimbursement of Election Expenses: A Forgotten Dispute’ (1994) 19 ELR 243&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 226 and 228&lt;/ref&gt; It can require the [[European Commission|Commission]] respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the [[Santer Commission]] in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 230 and 234&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Roquette v Council]]'' (1980) Case 138/79, [1980] ECR 3333 and ''[[European Parliament v Council]]'' (1995) C-65/93, [1995] ECR I-643, Parliament held not to have done everything it could have done within a sufficient time to give an opinion, so it could not complain the Council had gone ahead. See Boyron, 'The Consultation Procedure: Has the Court of Justice Turned against the European Parliament?’ (1996) 21 ELR 145&lt;/ref&gt; However its participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the [[European Commission|Commission]] and [[Council]], meaning power ("kratia") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ("demos"): in the EU it is not yet true that "the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' (ca 411 BC) Book 2, para 37, where [[Pericles]] said, 'Our government does not copy our neighbors, but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few'.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EU flags next to national art gallery, Vilnius, Lithuania presidency.jpg|thumb|right|[[Member state of the European Union|Member states]] are represented by Ministers in the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] during the [[European Union legislative procedure|legislative procedures]]. In addition the "[[European Council]]", which is the heads of member state governments, is meant to guide the EU's general political direction.]]
The second main legislative body is the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], which is composed of different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a "[[European Council]]" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]]) is meant to 'drive forward its work',&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 15(3) and (6)&lt;/ref&gt; but it does not itself exercise 'legislative functions'.&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 15(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bind the member states in decisions.&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 16(2)&lt;/ref&gt; When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states.&lt;ref&gt;The numbers are currently Germany, France, Italy, and UK: 29 votes each. Spain and Poland: 27. Romania: 14. Netherlands: 13. Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal: 12. Bulgaria, Austria, Sweden: 10. Denmark, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Finland: 7. Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovenia: 4. Malta: 3. This was set by the 2014 Protocol No 36 on Transitional Provisions, art 3(3) amended by art 20 for Croatia Accession Treaty 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a [[qualified majority vote]], if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and [[TFEU]] article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes. This is critical during the legislative process.&lt;ref&gt;TFEU art 288 outlines the main legislative acts as Directives, Regulations, and Decisions. ''[[Commission v Council]]'' (1971) Case 22/70, [1971] ECR 263 acknowledged that the list was not exhaustive, relating to a Council 'resolution' on the European Road Transport Agreement. Atypical acts include communications and recommendations, and white and green papers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:European Parliament Strasbourg Hemicycle - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg|Strasbourg seat]] of the [[European Parliament]], which [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] attend alongside the [[Espace Léopold|Brussels seats]], has been criticised for its expense. The [[French President]] has previously refused to let it be shut down.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. M Banks, 'Sarkozy slated over Strasbourg seat' (24 May 2007) [http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200705/8216d9d5-0c44-46e2-a6d8-6166c30e812f.htm EU Politix]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
To make new legislation, [[TFEU]] article 294 defines the "[[European Union legislative procedure|ordinary legislative procedure]]" that applies for most EU acts.&lt;ref&gt;This does not extend to foreign and security policy, where there must be consensus.&lt;/ref&gt; The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 294&lt;/ref&gt; Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a "[[Conciliation]] Committee" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try to get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets.&lt;ref&gt;TFEU art 313–319&lt;/ref&gt; For "enhanced cooperation" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the [[Council]].&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 20 and TFEU arts 326 and 334&lt;/ref&gt; Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Protocol No 1 to the Treaty of Lisbon&lt;/ref&gt; The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the ''Kompetenz-Kompetenz'' question: who ultimately has the "competence" to define the EU's "competence". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state [[Parliaments]] believe they decide, while within the EU, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] believes it has the final say.

===Judiciary===
{{Clist eu judiciary}}
{{main article|Court of Justice of the European Union|European Court of Auditors}}
The judiciary of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law. It interprets the [[treaties]], and has accelerated economic and political integration.&lt;ref&gt;[[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) ch 2, 57–67&lt;/ref&gt; Today the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] ([[CJEU]]) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] that deals with issues of detail but without general importance, and then a separate [[Court of Auditors]]. Under the [[Treaty on European Union]] article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state in the Court of Justice and General Court (28 on each at present&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute of the Court]] [http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2008-09/statut_2008-09-25_17-29-58_783.pdf art 48]&lt;/ref&gt;). Judges should "possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices" (or for the General Court, the "ability required for appointment to high judicial office").&lt;ref&gt;TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_III:_Provisions_on_the_Institutions#Article_19 art 19(2)] and [[TFEU]] arts [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Chapter_1:_The_Institutions#Article_253 253–254]&lt;/ref&gt; A president is elected by the judges for three years. While TEU article 19(3) says the Court of Justice is the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law, in practice, most EU law is applied by member state courts (e.g. the English [[Court of Appeal]], the German [[Bundesgerichtshof]], the Belgian [[Cour du travail]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_8|title=Neue Wohnungsgemeinnützigkeit|last=Kuhnert|first=Jan|last2=Leps|first2=Olof|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658175696|pages=213–258|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member state courts can refer questions to the [[CJEU]] for a [[preliminary ruling]]. The [[CJEU]]'s duty is to "ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it develops consistently with democratic values. Examples of landmark, and frequently controversial judgments, include ''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen|Van Gend en Loos]]'' (holding EU law to created a new legal order, and citizens could sue for treaty rights),&lt;ref name="1963 Case 26/62"&gt;(1963) Case 26/62&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' (establishing equality as a general principle of EU law),&lt;ref&gt;(2005) C-144/04&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kadi v Commission]]'' (confirming [[international law]] had to conform with basic principles of EU law).&lt;ref&gt;(2008) C-402&lt;/ref&gt; Internally, the [[European Union Civil Service Tribunal]] deals with EU staff issues.

The [[Statute of the Court]] and [[TFEU]] require judges are appointed only if they have no political occupation, with independence "beyond doubt".&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute of the Court]] art 4 and [[TFEU]] art 253&lt;/ref&gt; They are selected for renewable six-year terms by "common accord" of governments, with the advice of seven EU or member state judges that the Council and Parliament selects.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] arts 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice]], article 11, says the court is usually organised into chambers of 3 or 5 judges each. A "grand chamber" of 15 more senior judges sit on questions of "difficulty or importance", or those requested by member states.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice]] [http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-10/rp_en.pdf arts 28 and 60] and [[Statute of the Court]] [http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2008-09/statut_2008-09-25_17-29-58_783.pdf art 16(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; The court's President and Vice-President are elected by other judges for renewable 3-year terms by secret ballot. Judges can only be dismissed if all other judges and [[Advocate Generals]] unanimously agree. Advocate Generals are appointed by the court to give reasoned submissions on cases, especially involving new points of law. Unlike judges on the Court, they write opinions as themselves, rather than collectively, and often with a command of prose and reason, and while not binding are often followed in practice.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Statute of the Court]] art 20 and Craig and de Burca (2015) 61&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, each judge has secretaries or ''referendaires'' who research and write. Unlike the UK where judges always write their own opinions, ''referendaires'' often assist drafting the judgments in the Court of Justice. The Court's Translation Directorate will translate every final judgment into the 24 official [[languages of the European Union]]. The three main kinds of judgments the Court of Justice gives following (1) preliminary rulings, requested by the courts of member states,&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 267&lt;/ref&gt; (2) enforcement actions, brought by the Commission or Member States, against the EU, a member state, or any other party that is alleged to violate EU law,&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Chapter_1:_The_Institutions#Article_258 arts 258–259]&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) other direct actions, where the EU or member state is involved as a party to the dispute, and gives final rulings.&lt;ref&gt;See [[TFEU]] arts 256, 263, 265, 268, 270, 272&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice]], modelled on the [[International Court of Justice]], begin with submission of written cases to the court, followed by a short oral hearing. In each case a judge is designated to actively manage the hearing (called a ''[[rapporteur]]'') and draft the judgment (probably with help from ''referendaires''). The court always deliberates and votes before the final opinion is written and published. Cases in the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice on points of law. While there is no formal appeal procedure from the Court of Justice, in practice its actions are subject to scrutiny by both the supreme courts of member states and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], even if the final balance of power is unresolved.

===Conflict of laws===
{{Clist eusupreme}}
{{main article|Primacy of European Union law|Conflict of laws}}
Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing [[Legal pluralism|plurality]] of national and [[Globalisation|globalising]] legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) chs 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; This has meant both the [[European Court of Justice]] and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve [[conflicts of laws]] between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has [[Primacy of European Union law|primacy]]. In the first major case in 1964, ''[[Costa v ENEL]]'', a [[Milanese]] lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to [[Enel]], as a protest against the [[nationalisation]] of the Italian energy corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ente nazionale per l'energia elettrica]] was privatised once again in 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the [[Treaty of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;This included [[TEEC]] arts 102 (on consulting with the Commission on distortions to the common market), art 93 (on state aids), art 53 (right of establishment), and art 37 (national monopolies of a commercial character should treat all EC nationals equally). See now [[TFEU]].&lt;/ref&gt; and requested a reference be made to both the [[Italian Constitutional Court]] and the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] under [[TFEU]] article 267.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, [[TEEC]] art 177&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the [[International Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]], repeating its view in ''[[Van Gend en Loos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]'' (1963) Case 26/62&lt;/ref&gt; said member states "have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61964CJ0006|title=EUR-Lex - 61964CJ0006 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the "basis of reciprocity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; EU law would not "be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question". This meant any "subsequent unilateral act" of the member state inapplicable.&lt;ref&gt;(1964) Case 6/64, [1964] ECR 585&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA]]'', a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulations]] from 1964 and 1968. In "accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law", said the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]], the "directly applicable measures of the institutions" (such as the Regulations in the case) "render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law". This was necessary to prevent a "corresponding denial" of Treaty "obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states", that could "imperil the very foundations of the" EU.&lt;ref&gt;(1978) Case 106/77, [1978] ECR 629, [17]-[18]&lt;/ref&gt; But despite the views of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]], the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.

[[File:Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Court 1 Interior, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Most member state courts, such as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;See Lord Neuberger, ''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' [2014] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/3.html UKSC 3], [207]&lt;/ref&gt; accept that EU law has primacy over national law in limited fields, unless it would compromise constitutional principles of democracy and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Solange II]]'' or ''[[Re Wünsche Handelsgesellschaft]]'' (22 October 1986) BVerfGE, [1987] 3 CMLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Macarthys v Smith]]'' [1979] 3 All ER 325, per [[Lord Denning MR]]&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in ''[[R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' that "whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary" and so "it has always been clear" that UK courts have a duty "to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law".&lt;ref&gt;[1990] UKHL 7, (1990) C-213/89&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the [[UK Supreme Court]] noted that in ''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'',&lt;ref name="2014 UKSC 3"&gt;[2014] UKSC 3&lt;/ref&gt; although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be "fundamental principles" of common law, and Parliament "did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation" of those principles when it enacted the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]. The view of the [[German Constitutional Court]] from the ''[[Solange I]]'' and ''[[Solange II]]'' decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the [[rule of law]] and the [[social state]] principles&lt;ref&gt;See [[Grundgesetz]] arts 20 and 79(3). Note that "[[rule of law]]" may not be a perfect translation of the German concept of "[[Rechtsstaat]]".&lt;/ref&gt;) then it cannot override German law.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Solange I]]'' or ''[[Internationale Handelsgesellschaft mbH v Einfuhr- und Vorratsstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel]]'' (1970) Case 11/70&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, "so long as" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Solange II]]'' or ''[[Re Wünsche Handelsgesellschaft]]'' (22 October 1986) BVerfGE, [1987] 3 CMLR 225&lt;/ref&gt; Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.

[[File:UN Sécherheetsrot.jpg|thumb|right|The EU complies with [[international law]], and is subject to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], so long as international law institutions, like the United Nations themselves comply with basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kadi v Commission]]'' (2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62005CJ0402 C-402 and 415/05]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As opposed to the member states, the relation of EU law and [[international law]] is debated, particularly relating to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the United Nations. All EU member states are party to both organisations through international treaties. The [[Treaty on European Union]] article 6(2) required the EU to accede to the [[ECHR]], but would "not affect the Union's competences as defined in the Treaties". This was thought necessary before the [[Treaty of Lisbon 2007]] to ensure that the EU gave adequate protection to human rights, overseen by the external [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]]. However, in ''[[Opinion 2/13]]'', after a request by the Commission to review their plan to accede, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] (in [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]]) produced a five main reasons why it felt that the accession agreement as it stood was incompatible with the treaties.&lt;ref&gt;([http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=160882&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=40247 2014]). In summary, these were it (1) undermined the CJEU's autonomy (2) allowed for a parallel dispute resolution mechanism among member states, when the treaties said the CJEU should be the sole arbiter (3) the "co-respondent" system, allowing the EU and member states to be sued together, allowed the ECtHR to illegitimately interpret EU law and allocate responsibility between the EU and member states, (4) did not allow the Court of Justice to decide if an issue of law was already dealt with, before the ECHR heard a case, and (5) the ECtHR was illegitimately being given power of judicial review over [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning was regarded by a majority of commentators as thinly veiled attempt of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] to clutch onto its own power,&lt;ref&gt;cf P Eeckhout, 'Opinion 2/13 on EU Accession to the ECHR and Judicial Dialogue: Autonomy or Autarky' (2015) 38 Fordham International Law Journal 955 and A Lasowski and RA Wessel, 'When Caveats Turn into Locks: Opinion 2/13 on Accession of the European Union to the ECHR' (2015) 16 German Law Journal 179&lt;/ref&gt; but it has meant the Commission is redrafting a new accession agreement. Under TEU articles 3(5), 21, 34 and 42, the EU must also respect the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center in New York City]], the [[UN Security Council]] adopted a resolution to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists, linked to [[Osama Bin Laden]]. This included a [[Saudi]] national, Mr Kadi. Sweden froze his assets pursuant to an EU Regulation, which gave effect to the [[UN Security Council resolution]]. In ''[[Kadi v Commission]]'', Mr Kadi claimed there was no evidence that he was connected to terrorism, and he had not had a [[fair trial]]: a fundamental human right.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Magna Carta]], [[ECHR]] art 6 and [[CFREU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union#Article_47_.E2.80.93_Right_to_an_effective_remedy_and_to_a_fair_trial art 47]&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of [[AG Maduro]] recalled [[Aharon Barak]], of the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], that it "is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws". The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that even UN member cannot contravene 'the principles that form part of the very community legal order'.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission]]'' (2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62005CJ0402 C-402 and 415/05], [2008] ECR I-6351&lt;/ref&gt; In effect the EU has developed a rule that within the boundaries of certain [[jus cogens]] principles, other courts may take primacy. The content of those core principles remains open to ongoing judicial [[dialogue]] among the senior courts in Europe.

==Administrative law==
{{see also|Administrative law|United States administrative law}}
[[File:Courtroom European Court of Human Rights 04.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Though both use the [[Flag of Europe]], the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] is not part of the EU, but is the continent's highest human rights authority. All EU member states have signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention]], and the treaties require the EU to join.&lt;ref&gt;TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_6 art 6(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the EU's [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has delayed formal accession.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Opinion 2/13]]'' ([http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=160882&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=40247 2014])&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While constitutional law concerns the [[European Union]]'s governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. Both member states and the [[European Commission|Commission]] have a general legal right or "standing" (''[[locus standi]]'') to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulations]], if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under [[Directive (European Union)|Directives]], citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marshall v Southampton Health Authority]]'' (1986) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61984CJ0152 Case 152/84]&lt;/ref&gt; This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on "[[direct effect]]" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to [[judicial review]], and judged by standards of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require [[specific performance]] or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.

===Direct effect===
{{Clist directeffect}}
{{main article|Direct effect|Locus standi}}
Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have "[[direct effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;P Craig and G de Burca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1963) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61962CJ0026 Case 26/62]&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that the provisions of the [[Treaties]] (and [[EU Regulations]]) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. [[Van Gend en Loos]], a postal company, claimed that what is now [[TFEU]] article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs,&lt;ref&gt;Formerly [[TEEC]] art 12&lt;/ref&gt; when it imported [[urea-formaldehyde]] plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that even though the Treaties did not "expressly" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] proclaimed "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. [[EU Regulations]] are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as [[TFEU]] article 288 states, they are 'directly applicable in all Member States'. Member states come under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in ''[[Commission v Italy (1972)|Commission v Italy]]'' the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter [[cows]] (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. "Regulations", held the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]], "come into force solely by virtue of their publication" and implementation could have the effect of "jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union".&lt;ref&gt;(1972) Case 39/72, [1973] ECR 101&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Commission v United Kingdom (1979)|Commission v United Kingdom]]'' (1979) Case 128/78, [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held the UK had failed to implement art 21 of the Tachograph Regulation 1463/70, art 4 (now repealed) on time. This said in commercial vehicles use of [[tachograph]]s (recording devices) was compulsory from a certain date. Art 21(1) then said MSs should, after consulting with the Comm, adopt implementing regulations, and penalties for breach. Potentially it could also not have imposed a criminal offence, as it was far too vague.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Gend en Loos advert.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Van Gend en Loos]]'' case first allowed EU citizens to claim rights based on EU law. However, despite the influential opinions of three [[Advocate Generals]],&lt;ref&gt;[[AG van Gerven]], in ''Marshall (No 2)'' (1993) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61991CJ0271 C-271/91], [1993] ECR I-4367 ([http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/3b1a72bb-41b6-47d0-a817-5cb86e2c1748.0002.02/DOC_1 Opinion]), [[AG Jacobs]], in ''[[Vaneetveld]]'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61993CC0316 C-316/93], [1994] ECR I-763, [[AG Lenz]], in ''[[Faccini Dori]]'' (1994) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61992CC0091 C-91/92], [1994] ECR I-3325&lt;/ref&gt; and major exceptions, [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]]s are still thought not to create direct rights among private parties.]]
While the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate), [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]]s do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens. In theory, this is because [[TFEU]] article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually "leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods" to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards,&lt;ref&gt;n.b. under [[TFEU]] art 288 there is no reason why a Regulation cannot do the same.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the [[Working Time Directive]] requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks [[paid holidays]] each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Working Time Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML 2003/88/EC] art 7. A contract of employment can also require more. cf [[JM Keynes]], ''The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren'' ([http://www.aspeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/content/upload/Intro_Session1.pdf 1930]) arguing that as society became wealthier, increasing production would allow everyone to work less. See also the [[European Social Charter 1961]] article 3. Oddly, the UK chose to express 28 days as 5.6 weeks in its own regulations (assuming a week is 5 working days).&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the current position adopted by the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]], citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves.&lt;ref&gt;First held in ''[[Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority]]'' (1986) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61984CJ0152 Case 152/84], [1986] ECR 723, following the Opinion of [[AG Slynn]], the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that Ms Marshall, who was made to retire at 60 as a woman, unlike the men at 65, was unlawful sex discrimination, but only on the basis that the employer (the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]]) was the state. ''Obiter'', at [48] the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] suggested she would not have succeeded if it were a 'private' party.&lt;/ref&gt; Directives do not have so called "horizontal" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties).&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[[Shelley v Kraemer]]'', {{ussc|334|1|1948}} per Vinson CJ at 19, 'These are not cases, as has been suggested, in which the States have merely abstained from action, leaving private individuals free to impose such discriminations as they see fit. Rather, these are cases in which the States have made available to such individuals the full coercive power of government to deny to petitioners, on the grounds of race or color, the enjoyment of property rights in premises which petitioners are willing and financially able to acquire and which the grantors are willing to sell'.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three [[Advocate Generals]] persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[[AG van Gerven]], in ''Marshall (No 2)'' (1993) C-271/91, [1993] ECR I-4367, [[AG Jacobs]], in ''Vaneetveld'', C-316/93, [1994] ECR I-763, [[AG Lenz]], in ''[[Faccini Dori]]'' (1994) Case C-91/92, [1994] ECR I-3325&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] refused, but there are five large exceptions.

First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called "vertical" direct effect). So, in ''[[Pubblico Ministero v Ratti]]'' because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling [[solvents]] by the deadline, it was [[estopped]] from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and [[varnish]] business.&lt;ref&gt;(1979) Case 148/78, [1979] ECR 1629&lt;/ref&gt; A member state could "not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails".&lt;ref&gt;(1979) Case 148/78, [22]. See further in ''[[Barber]]'' (1990) C-262/88, AG van Gerven referred to the principle of ''[[nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans]]'', a civil law analogue of [[estoppel]].&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a citizen or company can also invoke a Directive as a defence in a dispute with another citizen or company (not just a public authority) which is attempting to enforce a national law that conflicts with a Directive. So, in ''[[CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel]]'' the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about [[alarm]] systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required.&lt;ref&gt;(1996) C-194/94, [1996] ECR I-2201, regarding Directive 83/189 which said various 'technical regulations' on alarm systems requiring approval from government.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, if a Directive gives expression to a "general principle" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from ''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]'' where the [[German Civil Code]] §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful [[age discrimination]] under the [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]]. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because [[equality before the law|equality]] was also a [[general principle of EU law]].&lt;ref&gt;(2010) C-555/07, [2010] IRLR 346. This revised the position in ''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' (2005) C-144/04, [2005] ECR I-9981, which suggested that Directives would have horizontal direct effect. See also ''[[Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz, Kreisverband Waldshut eV]]'' (2005) C-397/01, which found there could be no "horizontal" direct effect to claim against an employer that was a private ambulance service.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In ''[[Foster v British Gas plc]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a [[sex discrimination]] claim against her employer, [[British Gas plc]], which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.&lt;ref&gt;(1990) C-188/89, [1989] ECR 1839&lt;/ref&gt; This could also be true if the enterprise is [[privatised]], as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Griffin v South West Water Services]]'' [1995] IRLR 15. This was not true for ''[[Doughty v Rolls-Royce]]'' [1991] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1991/15.html EWCA Civ 15], but was for ''[[NUT v St Mary's School]]'' [1997] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2004/905_93_0211.html 3 CMLR 638].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth, national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law "as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Paolo Faccini Dori v Recreb Srl]]'' (1994) Case C-91/92, [1994] ECR I-3325, holding Miss Dori could not rely on the Consumer Long Distance Contracts Directive 85/577/EEC, to cancel her English language course subscription in 7 days, but the Italian court had to interpret the law in her favour if it could.&lt;/ref&gt; Textbooks (though not the Court itself) often called this "[[indirect effect]]". In ''[[Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA]]'' the Court of Justice held that a Spanish Court had to interpret its general [[Civil Code]] provisions, on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors, to conform with the [[European corporate law|First Company Law Directive]] article 11,&lt;ref&gt;[[First Company Law Directive]] 68/151/EEC&lt;/ref&gt; that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;(1990) C-106/89. See also ''[[Von Colson v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen]]'' (1984) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61983CJ0014 Case 14/83], [1984] ECR 1891, which held that because the member state had a choice of remedy, the Equal Treatment Directive did not allow Ms Van Colson to have a job as a prison worker.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute. But, if a member state has failed to implement a Directive, a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other non-state parties. It must instead sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law.&lt;ref&gt;Also, ''[[Grimaldi v Fonds des Maladies Professionnelles]]'' (1989) C-322/88, [1989] ECR 4407, [18] requires member state courts take account of Recommendations.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]]'s position on direct effect means that governments and taxpayers must bear the cost of private parties, mostly corporations, for refusing to follow the law.

===References and remedies===
{{Clist preliminary reference}}
{{main article|Preliminary ruling|Certiorari}}
Litigation often begins and is resolved by member state courts. They interpret and apply EU law, and award remedies of [[damages|compensation]] and [[restitution]] (remedying loss or stripping gains), [[injunctions]] and [[specific performance]] (making somebody stop or do something). If, however, the position in EU law appears unclear, member state courts can refer questions to the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] for a "[[preliminary ruling]]" on EU law's proper interpretation. [[TFEU]] article 267 says court "may" refer "if it considers" this "is necessary to enable it to give judgment", and "shall bring the matter before the Court" if there is no possibility for further appeal and remedy. Any "court or tribunal of a Member State" can refer. This is widely interpreted. It obviously includes bodies like the [[UK Supreme Court]], a [[High Court]], or an [[Employment Tribunal]]. In ''[[Vaassen v Beambtenfonds Mijnbedrijf]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1966) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61965CJ0061 Case 61/65]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] also held that a mining worker pension [[arbitration]] tribunal could make a reference. By contrast, and oddly, in ''[[Miles v European Schools]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2011) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62009CJ0196&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-196/09]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that a Complaints Board of European Schools, set up under the international agreement, the European Schools Convention, could not refer because though it was a court, it was not "of a member state" (even though all member states had signed that Convention).

[[File:Reichsgerichtsgebäude (3452722046).jpg|thumb|left|Courts around the EU, like the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]], may refer questions of interpretation to the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] at any time. Some member states are more active than others in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;See Court of Justice of the European Union, ''Annual Report 2015: Judicial Activity'' ([http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-04/en_ap_jur15_provisoire2.pdf 2016])&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On the other side, courts and tribunals are theoretically under a duty to refer questions. In the UK, for example, [[Lord Denning MR]] considered it appropriate to refer if the outcome of a case depended on a correct answer,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bulmer v Bollinger]]'' [1974] Ch 401&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Civil Procedure Rules]] entitle the [[High Court]] to refer at any stage of proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;CPR 68.2(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; The view of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] in the leading case, ''[[CILFIT v Ministry of Health]]'' is that a national court has no duty to refer if the law is an ''[[acte clair]]'' (a clear rule), or "so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt as to the manner in which the question raised is to be resolved".&lt;ref&gt;(1982) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61981CJ0283&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case 283/81], [1982] ECR 3415, [16]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kenny Roland Lyckeskog]]'' the Court of Justice held that the duty to refer existed for the Swedish Court of Appeal, the ''hovrätt'', since Sweden's Supreme Court (''Högsta domstol'') had to give permission for appeals to continue.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0099&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-99/00]&lt;/ref&gt; The practical difficulty is that judges differ on their views of whether or not the law is clear. In a significant case, ''[[Three Rivers DC v Governor of the Bank of England]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] 3 CMLR 205&lt;/ref&gt; the UK House of Lords felt confident that it was clear under the First Banking Directive that depositors did not have direct rights to sue the Bank of England for alleged failure to carry out adequate prudential regulation. Their Lordships highlighted that while some uncertainty might exist, the costs of delay in making a reference outweighed the benefits from total certainty. By contrast, in ''[[ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis]]'', a majority of the Supreme Court apparently felt able to declare that the law under [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive]] was ''acte clair'', and decline to make a reference, even though a senior Law Lord delivered a powerfully reasoned dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[2015] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/67.html UKSC 67], Mr Beavis received an £85 charge for parking too long in a carpark. [[Lord Toulson]] dissenting, would have held this charge, contrary to the requirement of good faith, created a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and duties. He pointed out that £85 was two-thirds of a state pension, and criticised the majority for wrongly applying the Court of Justice's case law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in addition to a reluctance to make references, a general scepticism has grown among senior member state judiciaries of the mode of reasoning used by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]]. The [[UK Supreme Court]] in ''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' devoted large parts of its judgment to criticism, in its view, an unpredictable 'teleological' mode of reasoning which, could decrease confidence in maintaining a dialogue within a plural and transnational judicial system.&lt;ref name="2014 UKSC 3"/&gt; It added that it might not interpret the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] to abridge basic principles and understanding of constitutional functioning – in effect implying that it might decline to follow unreasonable Court of Justice judgments on important issues. Similarly, the [[German Constitutional Court]] in the ''[[Outright Monetary Transactions case]]'' referred a question for preliminary ruling on whether the [[European Central Bank]]'s plan to buy Greek and other government bonds on secondary markets, despite the Treaty prohibition on buying them directly, was unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Outright Monetary Transactions case]]'' (14 January 2014) [http://openjur.de/u/675554.html BVerfGE 134, 366], 2 BvR 2728/13&lt;/ref&gt; In a highly unusual move, the two most senior judges dissented that the ECB's plan could be lawful, while the majority closely guided the Court of Justice on the appropriate mode of reasoning.

If references are made, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] will give a preliminary ruling, in order for the member state court to conclude the case and award a remedy. The right to an effective remedy is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]] article 47. Most of the time Regulations and Directives will set out the relevant remedies to be awarded, or they will be construed from the legislation according to the practices of the member state.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Wilson v St Helens BC]]'' [1998] UKHL 37, [1999] 2 AC 52, per Lord Slynn on specific performance.&lt;/ref&gt; It could also be that the government is responsible for failure to properly implement a Directive or Regulation, and must therefore pay damages. In ''[[Francovich v Italy]]'', the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the [[Insolvency Protection Directive]] required.&lt;ref&gt;(1991) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990CJ0006:EN:HTML C-6/90] and C-9/90, [1991] ECR I-5357&lt;/ref&gt; Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid. The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brasserie du Pecheur v Germany]]'' and ''[[R (Factortame) v SS for Transport (No 3)]]'' (1996) C-46/93 and C-48/93, [1996] ECR I-1029&lt;/ref&gt; So, in ''[[Factortame (No 3)|Factortame]]'' it was irrelevant that Parliament had legislated to require a quota of British ownership of fishing vessels in primary legislation. Similarly, in was ''[[Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany]]'' the German government was liable to a French beer company for damages from prohibiting its imports, which did not comply with the fabled [[beer purity law]]. It was not decisive that the German Parliament had not acted willfully or negligently.&lt;ref&gt;(1996) C-46/93 and C-48/93, [1996] ECR I-1029&lt;/ref&gt; It was merely necessary that there was (1) a rule intended to confer rights, (2) that a breach was sufficiently serious, and (3) there was a causal link between the breach and damage. The Court of Justice advised a breach is to be regarded as 'sufficiently serious' by weighing a range of factors, such as whether it was voluntary, or persistent.&lt;ref&gt;(1996) C-46/93, [56]-[59]. Curiously, the German High Court, the Bundesgerichtshof, BGH, EuZW 1996, 761, eventually decided that the breach was not serious enough, though one might have read the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] to have believed otherwise.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Köbler v Republik Österreich]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] added that member state liability could also flow from judges failing to adequately implement the law.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-224/01, [2003] ECR I-10239&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is also clear that EU institutions, such as the Commission, may be liable according to the same principles for failure to follow the law.&lt;ref&gt;''[[P Laboratoires Pharmaceutiques Bergaderm and Goupil v Commission]]'' Case C-352/98, [2000] ECR I-5291&lt;/ref&gt; The only institution whose decisions appear incapable of generating a damages claim is the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] itself.

===Judicial review===
{{Clist eu judicial review}}
{{main article|Judicial review|Preliminary ruling}}
As well as preliminary rulings on the proper interpretation of EU law, an essential function of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] is [[judicial review]] of the acts of the EU itself. Under [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU) article 263(1) the Court can review the legality of any EU legislative of other "act" against the Treaties or general principles, such as those in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. This includes legislation, and most other acts that have legal consequences for people. For example, in ''[[Société anonyme Cimenteries CBR Cementsbedrijven NV v Commission]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1967) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61966CJ0008 Case 8/66]&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission made a decision to withdraw an assurance to a Dutch cement company that it would be immune from [[competition law]] fines, for vertical agreements. The cement company challenged the decision, and the Commission argued this was not really an "act", and so could not be challenged. The Court of Justice held a challenge could be made, and it was an act, because it "deprived [the cement company] of the advantages of a legal situation... and exposed them to a grave financial risk".&lt;ref&gt;(1967) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61966CJ0008 Case 8/66], [91]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in ''[[Deutsche Post v Commission]]'' the Commission demanded information on [[state aid]] given by Germany to [[Deutsche Post]] within 20 days. When both challenged this, the Commission argued that the demand for information could not be an act as there was no sanction. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] disagreed, and held judicial review could proceed because the request produced "binding legal effects" since the information supplied or not could be relied upon as evidence in a final decision.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0463&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-463/10P], [38] and [55]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in ''[[IBM v Commission]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1981) Case 60/81&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Justice held that a letter from the Commission to IBM that it would sue IBM for abusing a dominant position contrary to competition was not a reviewable act, but just a preliminary statement of intent to act. In any case, if a reviewable act of an EU institution is not found compatible with the law, under article 264, it will be declared void.

[[File:Haan - Friedrichstraße 03 ies.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Plaumann &amp; Co v Commission]]'' required that claimants must be individually and directly concerned by an EU law to request [[judicial review]]. Being adversely affected by rising [[clementine]] duties was not enough.&lt;ref name="Case 25/62"&gt;(1963) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61962CJ0025&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case 25/62]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
However, only a limited number of people can bring claims for judicial review. Under TFEU article 263(2), a member state, the Parliament, Council or Commission have automatic rights to seek judicial review. But under article 263(4) a "natural or legal person" must have a "direct and individual concern" about the regulatory act. "Direct" concern means that someone is affected by an EU act without "the interposition of an autonomous will between the decision and its effect", for instance by a national government body.&lt;ref&gt;See T Hartley, ''The Foundations of European Union Law'' (2014) 387&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Piraiki-Patraiki v Commission]]'', a group of Greek textile businesses, who exported cotton products to France, challenged a Commission decision allow France to limit exports. The Commission argued that the exporters were not directly concerned, because France might decide not to limit exports, but the Court of Justice held this possibility was "entirely theoretical".&lt;ref&gt;(1985) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61982CJ0011 Case 11/82], [9]&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge could be brought. By contrast in ''[[Municipality of Differdange v Commission]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1984) Case 222/83&lt;/ref&gt; a municipality wanted to challenge the Commissions decision to aid steel firms which reduced production: this would probably reduce its tax collections. But the Court of Justice held that because Luxembourg had discretion, and its decision to reduce capacity was not inevitable, the municipality had no "direct" concern (its complaint was with the Luxembourg government instead). "Individual" concern requires that someone is affected specifically, not as a member of a group. In ''[[Plaumann &amp; Co v Commission]]''&lt;ref name="Case 25/62"/&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that a [[clementine]] importer was not individually concerned when the [[European Commission|Commission]] refused permission to Germany to stop import custom duties. This kept it more expensive for Mr Plaumann to import clementines, but it was equally expensive for everyone else. This decision heavily restricted the number of people who could claim for judicial review. In ''[[Unión de Pequeños Agricultores]]'', [[Advocate General Jacobs]] propose a broader test of allowing anyone to claim if there was a "substantial adverse effect" on the claimant's interests.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CC0050&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-50/00 P, AG Opinion], [60] and [103]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, a group of Spanish [[olive oil]] producers challenged Council Regulation No 1638/98, which withdrew subsidies. Because Regulations are not implemented in national law, but have direct effect, they argued the requirement for individual concern would deny them effective judicial protection. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that direct actions were still not allowed: if this was unsatisfactory the member states would have to change the treaties.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62000CJ0050&amp;from=EN C-50/00 P], [38]-[45]&lt;/ref&gt; Individual concern is not needed, however under article 263(4), if an act is not legislation, but just a "regulatory act". In ''[[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami v Parliament and Council]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] affirmed that a Regulation does not count as a "regulatory act" within the Treaty's meaning: it is only meant for acts of lesser importance. Here, a Canadian group representing the [[Inuit]] people wished to challenge a Regulation on [[Pinniped|seal]] products, but were not allowed. They would have to show both direct and individual concern as normal.&lt;ref&gt;(2013) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62011CJ0583&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-583/11]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, without a treaty change, EU administrative law remains one of the most restrictive in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for example, the German Constitutional Court Act (''Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz'') [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bverfgg/BJNR002430951.html#BJNR002430951BJNG001802305 §90], which requires the probability that a claimant's human rights are infringed, or the Administrative Court Order (''Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung'') §42, which requires a probable infringement of a subjective right.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights and principles===
{{Clist eu human rights}}
{{main article|General principles of European Union law|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|European Convention on Human Rights}}
Although access to judicial review is restricted for ordinary questions of law, the Court of Justice has gradually developed a more open approach to standing for human rights. Human rights have also become essential in the proper interpretation and construction of all EU law. If there are two or more plausible interpretations of a rule, the one which is most consistent with human rights should be chosen. The [[Treaty of Lisbon 2007]] made rights underpin the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]]'s competence, and required the EU's accession to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], overseen by the external [[Strasbourg Court]].&lt;ref&gt;TEU art 6(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, reflecting its primitive economic nature, the treaties made no reference to rights. However, in 1969 particularly after concern from Germany, the Court of Justice declared in ''[[Stauder v City of Ulm]]'' that 'fundamental human rights' were 'enshrined in the general principles of Community law'. This meant that Mr Stauder, who received subsidised butter under an EU welfare scheme only by showing a coupon with his name and address, was entitled to claim that this violated his dignity: he was entitled not to have to go through the [[humiliation]] of proving his identity to get food. While those 'general principles' were not written down in EU law, and simply declared to exist by the court, it accords with a majority philosophical view that 'black letter' rules, or [[positive law]], necessarily exist for reasons that the society which made them wants: these give rise to principles, which inform the law's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in this vast philosophical debate, see on the one hand [[O Gierke]], ''The Social Role of Private Law'' (1889), [[F Kessler]], 'Natural Law, Justice and Democracy—Some Reflections on Three Types of Thinking About Law and Justice' (1944) [http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=11601&amp;context=journal_articles 19 Tulane Law Review 32], 52, R Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'' (1985). For well known minority positions advocating 'legal positivism' (the view that the concept of law and morality should be intellectually segregated) see [[HLA Hart]], ''The Concept of Law'' (1961). For the work that is widely seen as having resolved the positivism debate in philosophy, see [[L Wittgenstein]], '’[[Philosophical Investigations]]'’ (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has clarified that its recognition of rights was 'inspired' by member states' own 'constitutional traditions',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Internationale Handelsgesellschaft]]'' (1970) Case 11/70, [1970] ECR 1125&lt;/ref&gt; and international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nold v Commission]]'' (1974) Case 4/73, [1974] ECR 491&lt;/ref&gt; These include rights found in member state constitutions, bills of rights, foundational Acts of Parliament, landmark court cases, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[European Social Charter 1961]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948]], or the [[International Labour Organization]]'s Conventions. The EU itself must accede to the [[ECHR]], although in '’[[Opinion 2/13]]'’ the Court of Justice delayed, because of perceived difficulties in retaining an appropriate balance of competences.&lt;ref&gt;See above.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schweinebraten &amp; Wein.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[Deutsches Weintor eG v Land Rheinland-Pfalz|Deutsches Weintor eG]]'', wine growers wanted to market their wine as "easily digestible", but the food regulators thought this would mislead consumers. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] applied the [[right to health]] in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter]], in support of good consumer information.&lt;ref&gt;(2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=126435&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=104747 C-544/10]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many of the most important rights were codified in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] in 2000. While the UK has opted out of direct application of the Charter, this has little practical relevance since the Charter merely reflected pre-existing principles and the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] uses the Charter to interpret all EU law. For example, in ''[[Test-Achats ASBL v Conseil des ministres]]'', the Court of Justice held that [[Equal Treatment in Goods and Services Directive 2004]] article 5(2), which purported to allow a derogation from equal treatment, so men and women could be charged different car insurance rates, was unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) C-236/09&lt;/ref&gt; It contravened the principle of equality in [[CFREU 2000]] articles 21 and 23, and had to be regarded as ineffective after a transition period. By contrast, in ''[[Deutsches Weintor eG v Land Rheinland-Pfalz]]'' wine producers claimed that a direction to stop marketing their brands as 'easily digestible' (''bekömmlich'') by the state food regulator (acting under EU law&lt;ref&gt;Regulation No 1924/2006 art 2(2)(5)&lt;/ref&gt;) contravened their right to occupational and business freedom under [[CFREU 2000]] articles 15 and 16.&lt;ref&gt;(2012) C-544/10&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Justice held that in fact, the right to health for consumers in article 35 has also to be taken into account, and was to be given greater weight, particularly given the health effects of alcohol. Some rights in the [[CFREU|Charter]], however, are not expressed with sufficient clarity to be regarded as directly binding. In ''[[AMS v Union locale des syndicats CGT]]'' a French trade union claimed that the [[French Labour Code]] should not exclude casual workers from counting toward the right to set up a [[work council]] that an employing entity must inform and consult.&lt;ref&gt;(2014) C-176/12&lt;/ref&gt; They said this contravened the [[Information and Consultation of Employees Directive]] and also [[CFREU]] article 27. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] agreed that the French Labour Code was incompatible with the Directive, but held that article 27 was expressed too generally to create direct rights. On this view, legislation was necessary to make abstract human rights principles concrete, and legally enforceable.

Beyond human rights, the Court of Justice has recognised at least five further 'general principles' of EU law. First, [[legal certainty]] requires that judgments should be prospective, open and clear. Second, when reviewing any discretionary act of a government or powerful body, decision-making must be "[[proportionality (law)|proportionate]]" toward a legitimate aim. For example, if a government wishes to change an employment law in a neutral way, yet this could have disproportionate negative impact on women rather than men, the government must show a legitimate aim, and that its measures are (1) appropriate or suitable for achieving it, (2) do no more than necessary, and (3) reasonable in balancing the conflicting rights of different parties.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''[[R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment]]'' [2000] UKHL 12 and (1999) C-167/97&lt;/ref&gt; Third, [[Social equality|equality]] is regarded as a fundamental principle: this matters particularly for labour rights, political rights, and access to public or private services.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' (2005) C-144/04 and ''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]'' (2010) C-555/07&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, the right to a fair hearing was declared a general principle, though admittedly this is amply reflected in most human rights instruments. Fifth, there is a general principle of professional privilege between lawyers and clients. The categories of general principle are not closed, and may develop according to the social expectations of people living in Europe.

While the "[[social market economy]]" concept was only put into EU law in [[Treaty of Lisbon|2007]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty on European Union]] article 3(3), introduced by the [[Treaty of Lisbon 2007]]. But see previously, ''[[Deutsche Post v Sievers]]'' (2000) C-270/97, 'the economic aim pursued by Article [157 TFEU] ..., namely the elimination of distortions of competition between undertakings established in different Member States, is secondary to the social aim pursued by the same provision, which constitutes the expression of a fundamental human right'. ''[[Defrenne v Sabena (No 2)|Defrenne v Sabena]]'' (1976) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&amp;uri=CELEX:61975CJ0043 Case 43/75], [10] 'this provision forms part of the social objectives of the community, which is not merely an economic union, but is at the same time intended, by common action, to ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples'.&lt;/ref&gt; free movement and trade were central to European development since the [[Treaty of Rome 1957]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) ch 17. C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms'' (4th edn 2013) ch 1, 3–30&lt;/ref&gt; The standard theory of [[comparative advantage]] says two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects.&lt;ref&gt;[[D Ricardo]], ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' (3rd 1821) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[North American Free Trade Association]], or the [[World Trade Organization]], EU law breaks down barriers to trade, by creating rights to free movement of goods, services, [[Manual labour|labour]] and [[capital (economics)|capital]]. This is meant to reduce consumer [[prices]] and raise living standards. Early theorists argued a free trade area would give way to a [[customs union]], which led to a [[common market]], then [[monetary union]], then union of monetary and fiscal policy, and eventually a full union characteristic of a [[federal state]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[EB Haas]], ''The Uniting of Europe: Political, social and economic forces 1950–1957'' (1958) and [[B Balassa]], ''The Theory of Economic Integration'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; But in Europe those stages were mixed, and it is unclear whether the "[[Chess endgame|endgame]]" should be the same as a state. [[Free trade]], without rights to ensure [[fair trade]], can benefit some groups within countries (particularly big business) more than others, and disadvantages people who [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack bargaining power]] in an expanding market, particularly [[workers]], consumers, [[small business]], developing industries, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;See generally P Krugman and M Obstfeld, ''International Economics: Theory and Policy'' (4th edn Addison-Wesley 1997) and HJ Chang, ‘Kicking Away the Ladder: Infant Industry Promotion in Historical Perspective’ (2003) 31(1) Oxford Development Studies 21.

===Goods===
{{Clist goods movement}}
{{main article|Internal Market (European Union)}}
Free movement of goods within the [[European Union]] is achieved by a [[customs union]], and the principle of non-discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) chs 18–19. C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms'' (4th edn 2013) chs 2–6&lt;/ref&gt; The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] arts 28–30&lt;/ref&gt; In addition under the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] article 34, 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and all [[measures having equivalent effect]] shall be prohibited between Member States'. In ''[[Procureur du Roi v Dassonville]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1974) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61974CJ0008 Case 8/74], [1974] ECR 837&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that this rule meant all "trading rules" that are "enacted by Member States" which could hinder trade "directly or indirectly, actually or potentially" would be caught by article 34.&lt;ref&gt;Previously [[TEEC]] article 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that a [[Belgian]] law requiring [[Scotch whisky]] imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]]. This "wide test",&lt;ref&gt;See D Chalmers et al, ''European Union Law'' (1st edn 2006) 662, 'This is a ridiculously wide test.'&lt;/ref&gt; to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former "[[Buy Irish]]" company that had government appointees.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commission v Ireland (1982)|Commission v Ireland]]'' (1982) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61981CJ0249 Case 249/81]&lt;/ref&gt; It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in ''[[Commission v France (1997)|Commission v France]]'' French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish [[strawberries]], and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities 'manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commission v France (1997)|Commission v France]]'' (1997) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61995CJ0265 C-265/95]. See further K Muylle, 'Angry famers and passive policemen' (1998) 23 European Law Review 467&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under [[TFEU]] article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public [[morality]], policy or security, "protection of health and life of [[humans]], animals or plants", "national treasures" of "artistic, historic or archaeological value" and "industrial and commercial property." In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from [[TFEU]] article 11.&lt;ref&gt;''[[PreussenElektra AG v Schleswag AG]]'' (2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61998CJ0379&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-379/98], [2001] ECR I-2099, [75]-[76]&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in ''[[Schmidberger v Austria]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0112&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-112/00], [2003] ECR I-5659&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, [[Brenner Autobahn]], en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] reasoned that [[freedom of association]] is one of the 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society', against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced,&lt;ref&gt;(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0112&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-112/00], [79]-[81]&lt;/ref&gt; and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied [[Proportionality (law)|proportionately]]. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be [[suitable]] to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be [[reasonable]] in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[[Leppik]]'' (2006) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62004CJ0434&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-434/04], [2006] ECR I‑9171, [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62004CC0434&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Opinion] of [[AG Maduro]], [23]-[25]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europabrücke-a.JPG|thumb|left|In ''[[Schmidberger v Austria]]'', protests blocked trucks for goods through the [[Austrian Alps]] on the [[Brenner Autobahn]]. The Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights take priority over free trade.&lt;ref&gt;(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0112&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-112/00], [2003] ECR I-5659, [77]. See [[ECHR]] articles 10 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as [[consumer protection]], improving [[labour standards]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oebel]]'' (1981) Case 155/80&lt;/ref&gt; protecting the environment,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mickelsson and Roos]]'' (2009) C-142/05&lt;/ref&gt; press diversity,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vereinigte Familiapresse v Heinrich Bauer]]'' (1997) C-368/95&lt;/ref&gt; fairness in commerce,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dansk Supermarked A/S]]'' (1981) Case 58/80&lt;/ref&gt; and more: the categories are not closed.&lt;ref&gt;See C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms'' (4th edn 2013) 172–173, listing the present state.&lt;/ref&gt; In the most famous case ''[[Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61978CJ0120 Case 170/78]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to [[TFEU]] article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but [[Cassis de Dijon]], which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under [[TFEU]] article 36,&lt;ref&gt;At the time, [[TEEC]] article 30&lt;/ref&gt; because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought.&lt;ref&gt;(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61978CJ0120 Case 170/78], [13]-[14]&lt;/ref&gt; This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In ''[[Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1983) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61981CJ0261 Case 261/81]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] found that a Belgian law requiring all [[margarine]] to be in [[cube]] shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!|would believe it was butter]] if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively".&lt;ref&gt;(1983) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61981CJ0261 Case 261/81], [17]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 case, ''[[Commission v Italy (2003)|Commission v Italy]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0014&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-14/00], [88]-[89]&lt;/ref&gt; Italian law required that cocoa products that included other [[vegetable fat]]s could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from [[cocoa butter]] alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A 'neutral and objective statement' was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, ''[[Commission v Italy (2009)|Commission v Italy]]'', the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.&lt;ref&gt;(2009) C-110/05, [2009] ECR I-519&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the [[Market access|access of that product to the market]]".&lt;ref&gt;(2009) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62005CJ0110&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-110/05], [2009] ECR I-519, [56]. See also ''[[Mickelsson and Roos]]'' (2009) C-142/05, on prohibiting jet skis, but justified if proportionate towards the aim of safeguarding health and the environment.&lt;/ref&gt; It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.

[[File:Union-europea segun rem-koolhaas.svg|thumb|right|In 2002, [[Rem Koolhaas]]' proposed "barcode" [[Flag of Europe]], caused uproar as it symbolised the EU becoming no more than a [[market economy]] for endless competitive consumption, devoid of [[social values]] and rights. It was not adopted.]]
In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder [[market access]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] developed a presumption that "selling arrangements" would be presumed to not fall into [[TFEU]] article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In ''[[Keck and Mithouard]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1993) C-267/91&lt;/ref&gt; two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French [[competition law]], which prevented them selling [[Picon beer]] under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent [[cut throat competition]], not to hinder trade.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Torfaen BC v B&amp;Q plc]]'' (1989) C-145/88, holding the UK Sunday trading laws in the former [[Shops Act 1950]] were probably outside the scope of article 34 (but not clearly reasoned). The "rules reflect certain political and economic choices" that "accord with national or regional socio-cultural characteristics".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held, as "in law and in fact" it was an equally applicable "selling arrangement" (not something that alters a product's content&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Vereinigte Familiapresse v Heinrich Bauer]]'' (1997) C-368/95&lt;/ref&gt;) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect "in fact" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In ''[[Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1997) C-34/95, [1997] ECR I-3843&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were "the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate" the market. In ''[[Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2001) C-405/98, [2001] ECR I-1795&lt;/ref&gt; the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' "traditional social practices and to local habits and customs" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF 2005/29/EC]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, states have to give [[mutual recognition]] to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory "[[race to the bottom]]", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.

===Workers===
{{Clist worker movement}}
{{main article|Freedom of movement for workers}}
Since its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) ch 21. C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms'' (4th edn 2013) chs 8–9 and 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the [[European Community]] originally focused upon free movement of [[workers]]: as a "[[factor of production]]".&lt;ref&gt;See [[P Craig]] and G de Burca, ''European Union Law'' (2003) 701, there is a tension 'between the image of the Community worker as a mobile unit of production, contributing to the creation of a single market and to the economic prosperity of Europe' and the 'image of the worker as a human being, exercising a personal right to live in another state and to take up employment there without discrimination, to improve the standard of living of his or her family'.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more "social" Europe.&lt;ref name="Case 43/75"&gt;''[[Defrenne v Sabena (No 2)|Defrenne v Sabena]]'' (1976) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&amp;uri=CELEX:61975CJ0043 Case 43/75], [10]&lt;/ref&gt; Free movement was increasingly based on "[[Citizenship of the European Union|citizenship]]", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic "worker" rights in [[TFEU]] article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in [[TFEU]] articles 18 to 21. According to the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]], a "worker" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, "under the direction of another person" for "remuneration".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Württemberg]]'' (1986) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61985CJ0066 Case 66/85], [1986] ECR 2121&lt;/ref&gt; A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in ''[[Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie]]'', a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the [[Bhagwan]] community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;(1988) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61985CJ0066 Case 196/87], [1988] ECR 6159&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an "indirect quid pro quo" for the work he did. Having "worker" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and [[social security]] rights. By contrast a citizen, who is "any person having the nationality of a Member State" ([[TFEU]] article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim [[social security]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig]]'' (2014) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62013CJ0333&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C‑333/13]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically "all available research finds little impact" of "labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers".&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, 'The impact of free movement of workers in the context of EU enlargement' COM(2008) 765, 12, 'Practically of post-enlargement labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers and no indication of serious labour market imbalances through intra-EU mobility, even in those Member States with the biggest inflows'.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bozen Waltherplatz.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA|Angonese]]'' the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] gave "horizontal [[direct effect]]" to free movement, so a bank could not refuse employment to a worker who lacked a [[Bolzano]] language certificate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA]]'' (2000) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61998CJ0281 C-281/98], [2000] ECR I-4139&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Free Movement of Workers Regulation]] articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Free Movement of Workers Regulation]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32011R0492 492/2011] arts 1–4&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous case, the ''[[Belgian Football Association v Bosman]]'', a Belgian footballer named [[Jean-Marc Bosman]] claimed that he should be able to transfer from [[R.F.C. de Liège]] to [[USL Dunkerque]] when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees.&lt;ref&gt;(1995) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61993CJ0415 C-415/93]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Justice held "the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In ''[[Groener v Minister for Education]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1989) Case 379/87, [1989] ECR 3967&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] to teach in a [[Dublin]] design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in ''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2000) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61998CJ0281 C-281/98], [2000] ECR I-4139, [36]-[44]&lt;/ref&gt; a bank in [[Bolzano]], Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in [[Bolzano]]. The Court of Justice, giving "horizontal" direct effect to [[TFEU]] article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was "impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In ''[[Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1995) C-279/93&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Justice held that it contravened [[TFEU]] art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in ''[[Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg]]'' the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was "likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62001CJ0387&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-387/01], [54]-[55]&lt;/ref&gt; Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding "social advantages", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In ''[[Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute]]'' the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was "closely linked to the socio-economic situation" of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;(2007) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62005CJ0287 C-287/05], [55]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in ''[[Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen]]'' the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits,&lt;ref&gt;(2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=62748&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=66471 C-213/05]&lt;/ref&gt; even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hartmann v Freistaat Bayern]]'' (2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=62747&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=70077 C-212/05]. Discussed in C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the European Union'' (2013) ch 9, 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; The general justifications for limiting free movement in [[TFEU]] article 45(3) are "public policy, public security or public health",&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Van Duyn v Home Office]]'' Case 41/74, [1974] ECR 1337&lt;/ref&gt; and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for "employment in the public service".

===Citizens===
{{Clist citizen rights}}
{{see also|Citizenship of the European Union}}
Beyond the right of free movement to work, the EU has increasingly sought to guarantee rights of citizens, and rights simply be being a [[Human rights|human being]].&lt;ref&gt;See NN Shuibhne, 'The Resilience of EU Market Citizenship' (2010) 47 CMLR 1597 and HP Ipsen, ''Europäisches Gemeinschaftsrecht'' (1972) on the concept of a 'market citizen' (''Marktbürger'').&lt;/ref&gt; But although the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] stated that 'Citizenship is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grzelczyk v Centre Public d'Aide Sociale d'Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve]]'' (2001) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61999CJ0184 C-184/99], [2001] ECR I-6193&lt;/ref&gt; political debate remains on who should have access to public services and welfare systems funded by taxation.&lt;ref&gt;See T Marshall, ''Citizenship and Social Class'' (1950) 28-9, positing that 'citizenship' passed from civil rights, political rights, to social rights, and [[JHH Weiler]], 'The European Union belongs to its citizens: Three immodest proposals’ (1997) [http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415458511/parts/part-2/students/articles/weiler-article.rtf 22 European Law Review 150]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, just 8 million people from 500&amp;nbsp;million EU citizens (1.7 per cent) had in fact exercised rights of free movement, the vast majority workers.&lt;ref&gt;''5th Report on Citizenship of the Union'' COM(2008) 85. The '’First Annual Report on Migration and Integration'’ COM(2004) 508, found by 2004, 18.5m third country nationals were resident in the EU.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TFEU]] article 20, citizenship of the EU derives from nationality of a member state. Article 21 confers general rights to free movement in the EU and to reside freely within limits set by legislation. This applies for citizens and their immediate family members.&lt;ref&gt;[[CRD 2004]] art 2(2) defines 'family member' as a spouse, long term partner, descendant under 21 or depednant elderly relative that is accompanying the citizen. See also ''[[Metock v Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform]]'' (2008) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62008CJ0127&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-127/08], holding that four asylum seekers from outside the EU, although they did not lawfully enter Ireland (because their asylum claims were ultimately rejected) were entitled to remain because they had lawfully married EU citizens. See also, ''[[R (Secretary of State for the Home Department) v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Surinder Singh]]'' [1992] 3 CMLR 358&lt;/ref&gt; This triggers four main groups of rights: (1) to enter, depart and return, without undue restrictions, (2) to reside, without becoming an unreasonable burden on social assistance, (3) to vote in local and European elections, and (4) the right to equal treatment with nationals of the host state, but for social assistance only after 3 months of residence.

[[File:Sanctuary - Berlin Wall.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] (1961–1989) symbolised a bordered globe, where citizens of the [[Soviet Union]] had no right to leave, and few could enter. The EU has progressively dismantled barriers to free movement, consistent with economic development.]]
First, the [[Citizens Rights Directive 2004]] article 4 says every citizen has the right to depart a member state with a valid passport. This has historical importance for central and eastern Europe, when the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Berlin Wall]] denied its citizens the freedom to leave.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Communist Manifesto]]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 5 gives every citizen a right of entry, subject to national border controls. [[Schengen Area]] countries (not the UK and Ireland) abolished the need to show documents, and police searches at borders, altogether. These reflect the general principle of free movement in [[TFEU]] article 21. Second, article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state, whether economically active or not. Article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of "sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system". Articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions. Third, TEU article 10(3) requires the right to vote in the local constituencies for the [[European Parliament]] wherever a citizen lives.

[[File:Children in a Primary Education School.JPG|thumb|right|All EU citizens have the right to [[child support]], education, [[social security]] and other assistance in EU member states. To ensure people contribute fairly to the communities they live in, there can be qualifying periods of residence and work up to five years.]]
Fourth, and more debated, article 24 requires that the longer an EU citizen stays in a host state, the more rights they have to access public and welfare services, on the basis of [[equal treatment]]. This reflects general principles of equal treatment and citizenship in [[TFEU]] articles 18 and 20. In a simple case, in ''[[Sala v Freistaat Bayern]]'' the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that a Spanish lady who had lived in Germany for 25 years and had a baby was entitled to [[child support]], without the need for a residence permit, because Germans did not need one.&lt;ref&gt;(1998) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61996CJ0085 C-85/96], [1998] ECR I-2691&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Trojani v Centre public d'aide sociale de Bruxelles]]'', a French man who lived in Belgium for two years was entitled to the "minimex" allowance from the state for a minimum living wage.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) C-456/02, [2004] ECR I-07573&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Grzelczyk v Centre Public d'Aide Sociale d'Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2001) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61999CJ0184 C-184/99], [2001] ECR I-6193&lt;/ref&gt; a French student, who had lived in Belgium for three years, was entitled to receive the "minimex" income support for his fourth year of study. Similarly, in ''[[R (Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that it was lawful to require a French [[University College London|UCL]] economics student lived in the UK for three years before receiving a student loan, but not that he had to have additional "settled status".&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62003CJ0209&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-209/03], [2005] ECR I-2119&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Commission v Austria]]'', Austria was not entitled to restrict its university places to Austrian students to avoid "structural, staffing and financial problems" if (mainly German) foreign students applied, unless it proved there was an actual problem.&lt;ref&gt;(2005) C-147/03&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig]]'', the Court of Justice held that the German government was entitled to deny [[child support]] to a Romanian mother who had lived in Germany for 3 years, but had never worked. Because she lived in Germany for over 3 months, but under 5 years, she had to show evidence of "sufficient resources", since the Court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on lawful residence under article 7.&lt;ref&gt;(2014) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62013CJ0333&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C‑333/13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment and services===
{{Clist establishment}}
{{main article|Internal Market (European Union)|European company law|European labour law}}
As well as creating rights for "workers" who generally [[Inequality of bargaining power|lack bargaining power]] in the market,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Asscher v Staatssecretaris van Financiën]]'' (1996) C-107/94, [1996] ECR I-3089, holding a director and sole shareholder of a company was not regarded as a "worker" with "a relationship of subordination".&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] also protects the "freedom of establishment" in article 49, and "freedom to provide services" in article 56.&lt;ref&gt;See [[P Craig]] and G de Búrca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases, and Materials'' (6th edn 2015) ch 22. C Barnard, ''The Substantive Law of the EU: The Four Freedoms'' (4th edn 2013) chs 10–11 and 13&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1995) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61994CJ0055 C-55/94], [1995] ECR I-4165&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that to be "established" means to participate in economic life "on a stable and continuous basis", while providing "services" meant pursuing activity more "on a temporary basis". This meant that a lawyer from [[Stuttgart]], who had set up chambers in [[Milan]] and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, should claim for breach of establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, "justified by imperative requirements in the general interest" and proportionately applied.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano|Gebhard]]'' (1995) C-55/94, [37]&lt;/ref&gt; All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or "undertakings" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 54 treats natural and legal persons in the same way under this chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment,&lt;ref&gt;''[[ITWF and Finnish Seamen's Union v Viking Line ABP and OÜ Viking Line Eesti]]'' (2007) C-438/05, [2007] I-10779, [34]&lt;/ref&gt; so article 49 has both "vertical" and "horizontal" direct effect. In ''[[Reyners v Belgium]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1974) Case 2/74, [1974] ECR 631&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked [[Belgian nationality law|Belgian nationality]] was unjustified. [[TFEU]] article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise "official authority". But regulation of an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Klopp]]'' (1984) Case 107/83, holding a Paris avocat requirement to have one office in Paris, though "indistinctly" applicable to everyone, was an unjustified restriction because the aim of keeping advisers in touch with clients and courts could be achieved by 'modern methods of transport and telecommunications' and without living in the locality.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast in ''[[Commission v Italy (2011)|Commission v Italy]]'' the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) C-565/08&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Justice|Grand Chamber]] of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=80812&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=57408 C-565/08], [52]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there was no ''prima facie'' infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.

[[File:London MMB »2M0 City of London.jpg|left|thumb|The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] in ''[[Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen|Centros Ltd]]'' held that people can establish a [[UK company law|UK company]] or any other, to do business EU-wide, but must comply with proportionate requirements in the public interest,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd]]'' (2003) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62001J0167:EN:HTML C-167/01]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the basic labour right to a [[voice at work]].&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Employee Involvement Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0086:EN:HTML 2001/86/EC]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In regard to companies, the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held in ''[[R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury]]'' that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing [[TFEU]] article 49.&lt;ref&gt;(1988) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&amp;uri=CELEX:61987CJ0081 Case 81/87], [1988] ECR 5483&lt;/ref&gt; This meant the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper's [[Daily Mail and General Trust|parent company]] could not [[evade tax]] by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in ''[[Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen]]'' the Court of Justice found that a UK [[limited company]] operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's [[Minimum capital|minimum share capital]] rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 [[Danish krone]] (around €27,000) to protect [[creditors]] if the company failed and went [[Insolvency (law)|insolvent]]. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection.&lt;ref&gt;(1999) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&amp;uri=CELEX:61997CJ0212 C-212/97], [1999] ECR I-1459. See also ''[[Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH]]'' (2002) C-208/00, on Dutch minimum capital laws.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified [[regulatory competition]], and a [[race to the bottom]] in legal standards, like the US state of [[Delaware]], which is argued to attract companies with the worst standards of accountability, and unreasonably low corporate tax.&lt;ref&gt;The classic arguments are found in WZ Ripley, ''[https://archive.org/stream/mainstreetandwal00riplrich#page/n5/mode/2up Main Street and Wall Street]'' (Little, Brown &amp; Co 1927), ''[[Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee]]'', {{ussc|288|517|1933}} per [[Brandeis J]] and W Cary, 'Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections on Delaware' (1974) 83(4) Yale Law Journal 663. See further S Deakin, 'Two Types of Regulatory Competition: Competitive Federalism versus Reflexive Harmonisation. A Law and Economics Perspective on Centros' (1999) 2 CYELS 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing to meet the concern, in ''[[Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH]]'' the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany, simply because it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes. But in this case denial of capacity went too far: it was an "outright negation" of the right of establishment.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&amp;uri=CELEX:62000CJ0208 C-208/00], [92]-[93]&lt;/ref&gt; Setting a further limit, in ''[[Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt]]'' the Court of Justice held that because corporations are created by law, they must be subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy, while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&amp;uri=CELEX:62006CJ0210 C-210/06]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory,&lt;ref&gt;See further ''[[National Grid Indus]]'' (2011) C-371/10 (an exit tax for a Dutch company required justification, not justified here because it could be collected at the time of transfer) and ''[[VALE Epitesi]]'' (2012) C-378/10 (Hungary did not need to allow an Italian company to register)&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not entirely clear why.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[P Craig]] and G de Burca, ''EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials'' (2015) 815, "it seems that the CJEU's rulings, lacking any deep understanding of [[business law]] policies, have brought about other corporate law changes in Europe that were neither intended by the Court nor by policy-makers".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clist eu services}}
The "freedom to provide services" under [[TFEU]] article 56 applies to people who give services "for remuneration", especially commercial or professional activity.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] arts 56 and 57&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid]]'' a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a [[social security]] case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;(1974) Case 33/74&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[Debauve]]'' (1980) Case 52/79, art 56 does not apply to 'wholly internal situations' where an activity are all in one member state.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 because usually the state funds it,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Belgium v Humbel]]'' (1988) Case 263/86, but contrast ''[[Schwarz and Gootjes-Schwarz v Finanzamt Bergisch Gladbach]]'' (2007) C-76/05&lt;/ref&gt; but higher education does not.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wirth v Landeshauptstadt Hannover]]'' (1993) C-109/92&lt;/ref&gt; Health care generally counts as a service. In ''[[Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds]]'' Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;(2001) C-157/99, [2001] ECR I-5473&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held health was a "service" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service.&lt;ref&gt;(2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61999CJ0157&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-157/99], [48]-[55]&lt;/ref&gt; National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed "international medical science" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;(2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61999CJ0157&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-157/99], [94] and [104]-[106]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's [[National Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Watts v Bedford Primary Care Trust]]'' (2006) C-372/04 and ''[[Commission v Spain]]'' (2010) C-211/08&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. ''[[Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht]]'' held that the Netherlands' regulation of [[cannabis]] consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]],&lt;ref&gt;(2010) C‑137/09, [2010] I-13019&lt;/ref&gt; fell outside article 56 altogether. The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction.

If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52, or by overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In ''[[Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1995) C-384/93, [1995] ECR I-1141&lt;/ref&gt; a business that sold [[commodities]] [[futures contract|futures]] (with [[Merrill Lynch]] and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting [[cold calling]] customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent "undesirable developments in securities trading" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In ''[[Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2004) C-36/02, [2004] ECR I-9609&lt;/ref&gt; a "laserdrome" business was banned by the [[Bonn]] council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against "playing at killing" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of [[human dignity]], which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In ''[[Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa]]'' the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a [[Gibraltar]] firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent.&lt;ref&gt;(2009) C‑42/07, [2007] ECR I-7633&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the [[Services Directive]] a group of justifications were codified in article 16, which the case law has developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32006L0123 2006/123/EC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital===
{{main article|Capital control|Single Euro Payments Area|Economic and Monetary Union of the EU}}
[[File:London MMB »2L8 Royal Exchange.jpg|thumb|left|The [[European System of Central Banks]], including the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and member state banks like the [[Bank of England]], has been criticised for harming the prospect of [[full employment]]. It interpreted the requirement for [[price stability]] as requiring wage suppression in its dealings on the [[Eurozone crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;cf [[J Stiglitz]], ''[[The Price of Inequality]]'' (2011) ch 9 and 349&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Free movement of [[capital (economics)|capital]] was traditionally seen as the fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original [[Treaty of Rome]] required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed to the extent necessary for the common market. From the [[Treaty of Maastricht]], now in [[TFEU]] article 63, "all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means [[capital controls]] of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying [[company shares]] or financial assets, or government approval requirements for [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. By contrast, taxation of capital, including [[corporate tax]], [[capital gains tax]] and [[Financial transaction tax]] are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the [[Capital Movement Directive 1988]], Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Capital Movement Directive 1988]] ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31988L0361&amp;from=EN 88/361/EEC]) Annex I, including (i) investment in companies, (ii) real estate, (iii) securities, (iv) collective investment funds, (v) money market securities, (vi) bonds, (vii) service credit, (viii) loans, (ix) sureties and guarantees (x) insurance rights, (xi) inheritance and personal loans, (xii) physical financial assets (xiii) other capital movements.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a "definite influence" through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor.&lt;ref&gt;(2000) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61998CJ0251&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-251/98], [22]&lt;/ref&gt; That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, [[TFEU]] article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Commission v Belgium]]'' (2000) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61998CJ0478&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-478/98], holding that a law forbidding Belgian residents getting securities of loans on the [[Eurobond]] was unjustified discrimination. It was disproportionate in preserving, as Belgium argued, fiscal coherence or supervision.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from tax cases, largely following from cases originating in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Commission v United Kingdom'' (2001) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62001CJ0098&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-98/01] and ''[[Commission v Netherlands]]'' (2006) C‑282/04, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62004CC0282 AG Maduro's Opinion] on golden shares in KPN NV and TPG NV.&lt;/ref&gt; a series of cases held that government owned [[golden shares]] were unlawful. In ''[[Commission v Germany (2007)|Commission v Germany]]'' the Commission claimed the German [[Volkswagen Act 1960]] violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the [[Lower Saxony]] government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]]'s Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;(2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62005CJ0112&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-112/05]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Commission v Portugal]]'' the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in [[Portugal Telecom]] that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" and reduing "the attractiveness of an investment".&lt;ref&gt;(2010) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62008CJ0171&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-171/08]&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with [[TFEU]] article 345.&lt;ref name="art 345"&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Part_Seven:_General_and_Final_Provisions#Article_345 art 345]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clist capital movement}}
The final stage of completely free movement of capital was thought to require a [[single currency]] and [[monetary policy]], eliminating the [[transaction cost]]s and fluctuations of currency exchange. Following a Report of the [[Delors Commission]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;See Delors Report, ''Report on Economic and Monetary Union in the EC'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] made [[Economic and Monetary Union of the EU|economic and monetary union]] an objective, first by completing the internal market, second by creating a [[European System of Central Banks]] to coordinate common monetary policy, and third by locking exchange rates and introducing a single currency, the [[euro]]. Today, 19 member states have adopted the [[euro]], while 9 member states have either determined to opt-out or their accession has been delayed, particularly since the [[Eurozone crisis]]. According to [[TFEU]] articles 119 and 127, the objective of the [[European Central Bank]] and other central banks ought to be [[price stability]]. This has been criticised for apparently being superior to the objective of [[full employment]] in the [[Treaty on European Union]] article 3.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[J Stiglitz]], 'Too important for bankers' (11 June 2003) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/11/usa.comment The Guardian] and [[J Stiglitz]], ''[[The Price of Inequality]]'' (2011) ch 9 and 349&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and market regulations==
{{See also|Market economy|Stakeholder (corporate)}}
[[File:Crowds shopping at Borough market, south London - geograph.org.uk - 1522109.jpg|thumb|400px|All enterprises, including ones like [[Borough Market]], are governed through legal rights for consumers, employees, investors or the [[public]], in laws of [[property]], contract, competition and other [[social and economic rights]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[R Hale]], 'Coercion and Distribution in a Supposedly Non-Coercive State' (1923) 38 Political Science Quarterly 472 [[RB Reich]], ''Saving Capitalism: for the many not the few'' (2015) chs 2, 4–7 and 21&lt;/ref&gt; EU law harmonises a minimum floor of rights so that [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] can fully participate in social progress.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[S Deakin]] and F Wilkinson, 'Rights vs Efficiency? The Economic Case for Transnational Labour Standards' (1994) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/indlj23&amp;div=33&amp;id=&amp;page= 23(4) Industrial Law Journal 289]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While the [[European Economic Community]] originally focused on [[freedom of movement|free movement]], and dismantling barriers to trade, more EU law today concerns regulation of the "social market economy".&lt;ref&gt;See TEU [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_3 art 3(3)] and Directives and Regulations issued under [[TFEU]] arts 101–109 and 145–172.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] said in ''[[Defrenne v Sabena (No 2)|Defrenne v Sabena]]'' the goal was "not merely an economic union", but to "ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples".&lt;ref&gt;(1976) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&amp;uri=CELEX:61975CJ0043 Case 43/75], [10]&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in each member state might not have the capacity to take advantage of expanding trade in a [[Globalization|globalising economy]]. Groups with [[Inequality of bargaining power|greater bargaining power]] can exploit weaker legal rights in other member states. For example, a corporation could shift production to member states with a lower [[minimum wage]], to increase shareholder profit, even if production costs more and workers are paid less. This would mean an aggregate loss of social wealth, and a "[[race to the bottom]]" in [[human development (humanity)|human development]]. To make [[globalisation]] fair, the EU establishes a minimum floor of rights for the stakeholders in enterprise: for [[European consumer law|consumers]], [[European labour law|workers]], investors, [[European company law|shareholders]], [[creditors]], and the [[public]]. Each field of law is vast, so EU law is designed to be [[Subsidiarity|subsidiary]] to comprehensive rules in each member state. Member states go beyond the harmonised minimum, acting as "[[laboratories of democracy]]".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee]]'', {{ussc|288|517|1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU law makes basic standards of "exit" (where markets operate), rights (enforceable in court), and "voice" (especially through [[votes]]) in enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;See [[TFEU]] Part III, [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union arts 26-197]. further, [[AO Hirschmann]], ''[[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]]'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Rules of [[European competition law|competition law]] balance the interests of different groups, generally to favour consumers, for the larger purpose in the [[Treaty on European Union]] article 3(3) of a "highly competitive [[social market economy]]".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[British Airways plc v Commission]]'' (2007) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62004CJ0095&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C- 95/04], [106], stating [[TFEU article 102]] "is aimed not only at practices which may cause prejudice to consumers directly, but also at those which are detrimental to them through their impact on an effective competition structure".&lt;/ref&gt; The EU is bound by the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] article 345 to "in no way prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of [[property]] ownership".&lt;ref name="art 345"/&gt; This means the EU is bound to be neutral to member state's choice to take enterprises into [[public ownership]], or to [[Privatisation|privatise]] them. While there have been academic proposals for a [[European Civil Code]], and projects to frame non-binding principles of [[Principles of European Contract Law|contract]] and [[Principles of European Tort Law|tort]], harmonisation has only occurred for [[conflict of laws]] and intellectual property.

===Consumer protection===
{{Clist eu consumers}}
{{see also|European consumer law|Consumer protection}}
Protection of European consumers has been a central part of developing the EU internal market. The [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] article 169 enables the EU to follow the [[ordinary legislative procedure]] to protect consumers "health, safety and economic interests" and promote rights to "information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests".&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_XV:_Consumer_Protection art 169]&lt;/ref&gt; All member states may grant higher protection, and a "high level of consumer protection" is regarded as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 169(3) and the [[CFREU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union#Article_38_.E2.80.93_Consumer_protection art 38]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these general principles, and outside specific sectors, there are four main Directives: the [[Product Liability Directive 1985]], [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993]], [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005]] and the [[Consumer Rights Directive 2011]], requiring information and cancellation rights for consumers. As a whole, the law is designed to ensure that consumers in the EU are entitled to the same minimum rights wherever they shop, and largely follows inspiration from theories of consumer protection developed in California and the [[Consumer Bill of Rights]] proclaimed by [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] has continually affirmed that the need for more consumer rights (than in commercial contracts) both because consumers tend to [[information asymmetry|lack information]], and they have [[Inequality of bargaining power|less bargaining power]].&lt;ref name="Case C-618/10"&gt;See ''[[Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino]]'' (2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0618&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case C-618/10], [39] and ''[[Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores]]'' (2000) C-240/98 to C-244/98 and [2000] ECR I-4941, [25]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ehrwald - SPAR interior.jpg|thumb|left|Due to their [[Inequality of bargaining power|unequal bargaining power]],&lt;ref name="Case C-618/10"/&gt; consumers are entitled to a legislative "charter of rights" to safe and healthy products, fair terms, proper information free from misleading advertising and marketing, and rights of cancellation.]]
The [[Product Liability Directive 1985]] was the first consumer protection measure. It creates [[Strict liability|strict]] [[enterprise liability]] for all producers and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, as a way to promote basic standards of health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[Product Liability Directive 1985]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0374:en:HTML 85/374/EEC], recital 1 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is [[insolvent]], of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a defective product.&lt;ref&gt;PLD 1985 arts 1 and 3&lt;/ref&gt; A "defect" is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to [[Externality|externalise]] the risks of its activities.

The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993]] was the second main measure.&lt;ref&gt;[[UTCCD 1993]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993L0013:EN:HTML 93/13/EC] and see [[H Collins]], 'Good Faith in European Contract Law' (1994) 14 OJLS 229&lt;/ref&gt; Under article 3(1) a term is unfair, and not binding, if it is not "individually negotiated| and "if, contrary to the requirement of [[good faith]], it causes a [[Just price|significant imbalance]] in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer". The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has continually affirmed that the Directive, as recital 16 states, "is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his [[bargaining power]] and his [[Information asymmetry|level of knowledge]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino]]'' (2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0618&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case C-618/10]&lt;/ref&gt; Terms which are very skewed, are to be conclusively regarded as contrary to "[[good faith]]" and therefore unfair.&lt;ref&gt;See further, for the history behind the parallel in [[German contract law]], [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] §307 ''Münchener Kommentar zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch'' §307 Rn 32&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV]]'' clauses in gas supply contracts enabling corporation, [[RWE]], to unilaterally vary prices were advised by the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] to be not sufficiently transparent, and therefore unfair.&lt;ref&gt;''[[RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV]]'' (2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62011CA0092&amp;rid=3 C-92/11]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Brusse v Jahani BV]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62011CA0488&amp;qid=1413899840951&amp;from=EN C-488/11]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] advised that clauses in a tenancy contract requiring tenants pay €25 per day were likely unfair, and would have to be entirely void without replacement, if they were not substituted with more precise mandatory terms in national legislation. In ''[[Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya]]'', following the [[global financial crisis]], the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] advised that even terms regarding repossession of homes in Spain had to be assessed for fairness by national courts.&lt;ref&gt;(2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62011CJ0415:EN:HTML Case C-415/11]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kušionová v SMART Capital a.s.]]'', the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that consumer law was to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, including the [[right to housing]], in the event that a home could be repossessed.&lt;ref&gt;(2014) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62013CJ0034&amp;from=EN Case C-34/13]&lt;/ref&gt; Because consumer law operates through Directives, national courts have the final say on applying the general principles set out by the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]]'s case law.

===Labour rights===
{{Clist european labour}}
{{main article|European labour law|ILO Conventions|UK labour law|German labour law|French labour law|United States labor law}}
While [[free movement of workers]] was central to the first [[European Economic Community]] agreement, the development of [[European labour law]] has been a gradual process. Originally, the [[Ohlin Report]] of 1956 recommended that labour standards did not need to be harmonised, although a general principle of anti-discrimination between men and women was included in the early Treaties. Increasingly, the absence of labour rights was seen as inadequate given the capacity for a "[[race to the bottom]]" in [[international trade]] if corporations can shift jobs and production to countries with low wages. Today, the EU is required under [[TFEU]] article 147 to contribute to a "high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States".&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_IX:_Employment#Article_147 art 147]&lt;/ref&gt; This has not resulted in legislation, which usually requires taxation and fiscal stimulus for significant change, while the [[European Central Bank]]'s [[monetary policy]] has been acutely controversial during the [[Eurozone crisis]]. Under article 153(1), the EU is able to use the ordinary legislation procedure on a list of labour law fields. This notably excludes [[wage regulation]] and [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_X:_Social_Policy art 153(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, four main fields of EU regulation of labour rights touch (1) individual labour rights, (2) anti-discrimination regulations, (3) rights to information, consultation, and participation at work, and (4) rights to [[job security]]. In virtually all cases, the EU follows the principle that member states can always create rights more beneficial to workers. This is because the fundamental principle of [[labour law]] is that employees' [[unequal bargaining power]] justifies substitution of rules in property and contract with positive [[social rights]] so that people may earn a living to fully participate in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;See further [[O Kahn-Freund]], '[[Hugo Sinzheimer]]' in ''Labour Law and Politics in the Weimar Republic'' (1981) 103, 'The technique of bourgeois society and its law is to cover social facts and factors of social existence with abstractions: [[property]], contract, [[legal person]]. All these abstractions contain within them socially opposed and contradictory phenomena: property used for production and property used for [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], agreements between equal parties and agreements between [[Inequality of bargaining power|unequal parties]], capitalist and worker. Through [[abstraction]] it is possible to extend legal rules, which are appropriate to the social phenomenon for which they were originally developed, to other social phenomena, thereby concealing the exercise of social [[power (social and political)|power]] behind a veil of law'. A Supiot, ''Beyond Employment: Changes in Work and the Future of Labour Law in Europe'' (2001). [[S Deakin]] and F Wilkinson, ''The Law of the Labour Market'' (2005) 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's competences generally follow principles codified in the [[Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers 1989]],&lt;ref&gt;See the Charter's [http://www.eesc.europa.eu/resources/docs/community-charter--en.pdf text]&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in the "social chapter" of the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]. Initially the UK had opted-out, because of opposition by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], but was acceded to when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] in the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]].

[[File:Antipaxos vrika beach bgiu.jpg|thumb|left|The [[European Social Charter 1961]] art 2(1) requires "the working week to be progressively reduced" with "increase of productivity".&lt;ref&gt;[[European Social Charter 1961]] [http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168006b642 art 2(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Working Time Directive 2003]] requires 28 paid holidays a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] art 7, referring to "four weeks" and arts 5 and 6 referring to the concept of "weekly" as meaning a "seven-day period". The choice to phrase time off as "weeks" was interpreted by the UK Supreme Court to mean employees have the right to take weeks off at a time, rather than separate days in the UK context: ''[[Russell v Transocean International Resources Ltd]]'' [2011] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/57.html UKSC 57], [19]&lt;/ref&gt; With two-day [[weekends]], most people in the EU work two-thirds of the year or less.&lt;ref&gt;See further [[JM Keynes]], ''Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren'' (1930) arguing a 15-hour week was achievable by 2000 if gains in productivity increases were equitably shared.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first group of Directives create a range of individual rights in EU employment relationships. The [[Employment Information Directive 1991]] requires that every employee (however defined by member state law) has the right to a written statement of their employment contract. While there is no [[wage regulation]], the [[Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003]] requires that pension benefits are protected through a national insurance fund, that information is provided to beneficiaries, and minimum standards of governance are observed.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:02003L0041-20130620 arts 11–12, 17–18]&lt;/ref&gt; Most member states go far beyond these requirements, particularly by requiring a vote for employees in who manages their money.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Pensions Act 2004]] ss 241–243&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting basic standards in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and [[ILO Conventions]],&lt;ref&gt;[[UDHR]] art 24, [[Holidays with Pay Convention 1970]] (no 132) and see also the [[European Social Charter 1961]] art 2(1).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Working Time Directive 2003]] requires a minimum of 4 weeks (totalling 28 days) paid holidays each year,&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML art 7]. In the UK, the implementing [[Working Time Regulations 1998]] state "5.6 weeks" is needed, although this is also 28 days, as a "week" was originally taken to refer to a 5-day working week.&lt;/ref&gt; a minimum of 20-minute paid rest breaks for 6-hour work shifts, limits on night work or time spent on dangerous work,&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML arts 2–5 and 8–13]&lt;/ref&gt; and a maximum 48-hour working week unless a worker individually consents.&lt;ref&gt;[[WTD 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML arts 6 and 17] and ''[[Pfeiffer v Deutsches Kreuz, Kreisverband Waldshut eV]]'' (2005) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62001J0397:EN:HTML C-397/01]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parental Leave Directive 2010]] creates a bare minimum of 4 months of unpaid leave for parents (mothers, fathers, or legal guardians) to care for children before they turn 8 years old, and the [[Pregnant Workers Directive 1992]] creates a right for mothers to a minimum of 14 weeks' paid leave to care for children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Boyle v Equal Opportunities Commission]]'' (1998) C-411/96 requires pay be at least the same level as statutory sick pay.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the [[Safety and Health at Work Directive 1989]] requires basic requirements to prevent and insure against workplace risks, with employee consultation and participation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Safety and Health at Work Directive 1989]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31989L0391&amp;from=EN art 11]&lt;/ref&gt; and this is complemented by specialised Directives, ranging from work equipment to dangerous industries.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Health and Safety of Atypical Workers Directive 1991]] extends these protections to people who do not have typical, full-time or permanent employment contracts.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all cases, all member states go significantly beyond this minimum. The objective of transnational regulation is therefore to progressively raise the minimum floor in line with economic development. Second, [[Social equality|equality]] was affirmed by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] in ''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2010) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62007CJ0555 C-555/07]&lt;/ref&gt; to be a general principle of EU law. Further to this, the [[Part-time Work Directive 1997]], [[Fixed-term Work Directive 1999]] and [[Temporary Agency Work Directive 2008]] generally require that people who do not have ordinary full-time, permanent contracts are treated no less favourably than their colleagues. However, the scope of the protected worker is left to member state law, and the [[TAWD 2008]] only applies to "basic working conditions" (mostly pay, working hours and participation rights) and enabled member states to have a qualifying period. The [[Race Equality Directive 2000]], [[Equality Framework Directive 2000]] and [[Equal Treatment Directive 2006]] prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief, age, race and gender. As well as "direct discrimination", there is a prohibition on "indirect discrimination" where employers apply a neutral rule to everybody, but this has a disproportionate impact on the protected group. The rules are not consolidated, and on gender pay potentially limited in not enabling a hypothetical comparator, or comparators in outsourced business. Equality rules do not yet apply to child care rights, which only give women substantial time off, and consequently hinder equality in men and women caring for children after birth, and pursuing their careers.

[[File:Oxford University, Radcliffe Camera, a Reading room of Bodleian library.jpg|thumb|right|A majority of EU countries have legislation, such the [[Oxford University Act 1854]] or [[Codetermination Act 1976]], which protect employees' right to vote for a corporation's management. This is reflected in the [[Employee Involvement Directive 2001]] for [[European Companies]].]]
Third, the EU is formally not enabled to legislate on [[collective bargaining]], although the EU, with all member states, is bound by the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on [[freedom of association]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ECHR]] art 11. This codified traditions in democratic member states before [[World War Two]]. See for example ''[[Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch]]'' [1941] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1941/2.html UKHL 2]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2002] ECHR 552&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ECHR|Court]] held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in ''[[Demir and Baykara v Turkey]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2008] ECHR 1345&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ECHR|Court]] held "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, become one of the essential elements" of article 11.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Demir and Baykara v Turkey]]'' [2008] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/1345.html ECHR 1345]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental [[right to strike]] in all democratic member states,&lt;ref&gt;See further ''[[Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey]]'' (2009) Application No 68959/01&lt;/ref&gt; has been seen as lying in tension with some of the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]]'s previous case law, notably ''[[ITWF v Viking Line ABP]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2007) C-438/05&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(2007) C-319/05, and C-319/06&lt;/ref&gt; These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. The [[Rome I Regulation]]&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services. More positively, the [[Information and Consultation Directive 2002]] requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected [[work councils]] with a range of binding rights, the [[European Works Council Directive 2009]] enables [[work councils]] transnationally, and the [[Employee Involvement Directive 2001]] requires representation of workers on company boards in some [[European Companies]]. If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the [[European Company Regulation 2001]], employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing [[Codetermination|board participation]] laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards. Fourth, minimum [[job security]] rights are provided by three Directives. The [[Collective Redundancies Directive 1998]] specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The [[Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001]] require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the [[Insolvency Protection Directive 2008]] requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to ''[[Francovich v Italy]]'', where the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.&lt;ref&gt;(1991) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990CJ0006:EN:HTML C-6/90]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|European corporate law|UK company law|German corporate law|United States corporate law}}
Like labour regulation, [[European corporate law]] is not a complete system and there is no such thing as a self-standing European corporation. Instead, a series of Directives require minimum standards, usually protecting investors, to be implemented in national corporate laws. The largest in Europe remain member state incorporations, such as the [[UK company law|UK]] "[[Public limited company|plc]]", the German "[[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]" or the French "[[S.A. (corporation)|SA]]". There is however, a "[[European Company]]" (or ''[[Societas Europaea]]'', abbreviated to "[[Societas Europaea|SE]]") created by the [[Statute for a European Company Regulation 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute for a European Company Regulation 2001]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R2157:EN:HTML No 2157/2001]&lt;/ref&gt; This sets out basic provisions on the method of registration (e.g. by merger or reincorporation of an existing company) but then states that wherever the SE has its registered office, the law of that member state supplements the rules of the Statute.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statute for a European Company Regulation 2001]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R2157:EN:HTML art 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Employee Involvement Directive 2001]]
also adds that, when an [[Societas Europaea|SE]] is incorporated, employees have the default right to retain all existing representation on the board of directors that they have, unless the negotiate by [[collective agreement]] a different or better plan than is provided for in existing member state law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Employee Involvement Directive 2001]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0086:EN:HTML Annex]&lt;/ref&gt; Other than this, most important standards in a typical company law are left to member state law, so long as they comply with further minimum requirements in the company law directives. Duties owed by the board of directors to the company and its stakeholders,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''[[BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders]]'' [2008] [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc69/2008scc69.html 3 SCR 560]&lt;/ref&gt; or the right to bring [[derivative claim]]s to vindicate constitutional rights, are not generally regulated by EU law. Nor are rights of [[pre-emption right|pre-emption]] to buy shares, nor rights of any party regarding claims by [[tort]], contract or [[piercing the corporate veil]] to hold directors and shareholders accountable.&lt;ref&gt;Contrast ''[[Lubbe v Cape Plc]]'' [2000] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2000/41.html UKHL 41] and ''[[Chandler v Cape plc]]'' [2012] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/525.html EWCA Civ 525]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Directives do require minimum rights on company formation, capital maintenance, accounting and audit, market regulation, board neutrality in a [[takeover]] bid,&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Thirteenth Company Law Directive 2004]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0025:EN:NOT 2004/25/EC]&lt;/ref&gt; rules on mergers, and management of cross-border [[insolvency]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000]]&lt;/ref&gt; The omission of minimum standards is important since the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held in ''[[Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen|Centros]]'' that freedom of establishment requires companies operate in any member state they choose.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen]]'' (1999) C-212/97&lt;/ref&gt; This has been argued to risk a "[[race to the bottom]]" in standards, although the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] soon affirmed in ''[[Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd|Inspire Art]]'' that companies must still comply with proportionate requirements that are in the "public interest".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd]]'' (2003) C-167/01&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deutsche Bank, Sydney.jpeg|thumb|left|The [[Shareholder Rights Directive 2007]] requires proxy vote instructions are followed. There EU has not yet acted, as have the [[Swiss executive pay initiative, 2013|Swiss]], to prevent asset managers or banks like [[Deutsche Bank]] casting votes on company shares bought with [[Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It|other people's money]], and to empower the ultimate investors.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;See [[LD Brandeis]], ''[[Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It]]'' (1914) and E McGaughey, 'Does Corporate Governance Exclude the Ultimate Investor?' (2016) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2666955 16(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 221]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Among the most important governance standards are rights [[vote]] for who is on the board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A [[Draft Fifth Company Law Directive]] proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require [[Supervisory board|two-tier board]] structures,&lt;ref&gt;See M Gold, 'Worker directors in the UK and the limits of policy transfer from Europe since the 1970s' (2005) 20 Historical Studies in Industrial Relations 29, 35&lt;/ref&gt; although most EU member states have [[codetermination]] today with unified boards. The [[Shareholder Rights Directive 2007]] requires [[shareholders]] be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by [[institutional investors]] (primarily [[asset managers]] or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding "other people's money".&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a [[Swiss executive pay initiative, 2013|2013 people's initiative]], or the U.S. [[Dodd-Frank Act 2010]] in relation to brokers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 2010]] §957, inserting [[Securities Exchange Act 1934]] §6(b)(10)&lt;/ref&gt; the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with [[Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It|other people's money]]. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the [[Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003]]. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency,&lt;ref&gt;[[Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:02003L0041-20130620 2003/41/EC]&lt;/ref&gt; but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the [[Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009]] does suggest that investors in a [[mutual fund]] or ("[[collective investment scheme]]") should control the voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;[[UCITS Directive 2009]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0065 art 19(3)(o)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UCITS Directive 2009]] is primarily concerned with creating a "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the [[banking crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref&gt;See N Moloney, ''EU Securities and Financial Markets Regulation'' (3rd edn 2014). On the original conception of the need for securities market regulation, see [[AA Berle]] and [[GC Means]], ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932) Part III&lt;/ref&gt; Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[UCITS V Directive]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0091 2014/91/EU]&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004]] applies to other businesses selling [[financial instruments]]. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a "passport" to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] with clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0039:EN:HTML 2004/39/EC], art 18 on [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011]] applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100&amp;nbsp;million, essentially [[hedge fund]]s and [[private equity]] firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0061 2011/61/EU] art 3(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce "risk" or make pay "performance" related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], and specialised prohibitions on [[asset stripping]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0061 2011/61/EU] respectively arts 22–23, 13 and Annex II, 14 and 30&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solvency II Directive 2009]] is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32009L0138 2009/138/EC]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Capital Requirements Directives]] contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the [[European System of Financial Supervision]] was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]] in Paris, the [[European Banking Authority]] in London and the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] in Frankfurt.

===Competition law===
{{Clist monopoly abuse}}
{{main article|European competition law}}
Competition law has been perceived as an essential part of the "social market economy" since the [[Treaty of Rome]]. Its main aims are to prevent monopolies abusing a dominant position, by prohibiting exploitative practices and potentially by breaking them up, to prevent anti-competitive [[mergers]] and takeovers occurring, and to criminalise [[cartel]]s or collusive practices by independent firms. According to the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]], and the dominant view, the law aims to protect "an effective competition structure" to enhance consumer and social welfare, "aiming at [[full employment]] and [[social progress]], and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment".&lt;ref&gt;See TEU art 3(3) and ''[[British Airways plc v Commission]]'' (2007) C-95/04, [106], "[[TFEU article 102|Article 82 EC]] is aimed not only at practices which may cause prejudice to consumers directly, but also at those which are detrimental to them through their impact on an effective competition structure, such as is mentioned in Article 3(1)(g) EC". See previously ''[[Europemballage Corporation and Continental Can Company Inc v Commission]]''
(1973) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:61972CJ0006 Case 6–72], [26]&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of European competition law is limited in three main ways: first, by ensuring that only "undertakings" are regulated. This will include any profit-making business, but the Court of Justice suggests it is limited to entities "engaged in an economic activity".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Höfner and Elser v Macrotron GmbH]]'' (1991) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990J0041:EN:NOT C-41/90]&lt;/ref&gt; The "economic" criterion suggests that, in general, organisations based on a principle of solidarity and not for profit will be exempt from competition law.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Federación Española de Empresas de Tecnología Sanitaria (FENIN) v Commission]]'' (2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=61999TJ0319&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= T-319/99]&lt;/ref&gt; Employees and trade unions are completely outside the scope of competition law,&lt;ref&gt;See the [[ILO]] [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948]] ([http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312232:NO No 87]) which protects anyone, including self-employed, who works for a living, [[ECHR]] article 11, ''[[FNV Kunsten Informatie en Media v Staat der Nederlanden]]'' (2014) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?doclang=EN&amp;text=&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;part=1&amp;mode=lst&amp;docid=160305&amp;occ=first&amp;dir=&amp;cid=17180 C-413/13] and the Opinion of [[AG Jacobs]] in ''[[Albany International BV v Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds Textielindustrie''''' (1999)]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61996CJ0067 C-67/96]&lt;/ref&gt; on a long-standing consensus view, because [[labour is not a commodity]] and the sellers of labour have inherently [[unequal bargaining power]] compared to business and employers.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Clayton Act 1914]]&lt;/ref&gt; Second, trade between member states must be affected to at least an "appreciable" degree.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Societe Technique Miniere v Maschinenbau Ulm GmbH]]'' [1996] ECR 234, [249] and ''[[Javico International and Javico AG v Yves Saint Laurent Parfums SA]]'' [1998] ECR I-1983, [25]&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the law promotes fair competition, rather than unfair "cut-throat" competition. For example, in ''[[Meca Medina and Majcen v Commission]]'' the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that rules of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[International Swimming Federation]] which prohibited drugs were outside the scope of competition law altogether. Although drugs could increase competitiveness, the "integrity and objectivity of competitive sport" was more important.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) C-519/04 P, [2006] ECR I-6991. See also ''[[Wouters v Algemene Raad van de Nederlandsche Orde van Advocaten]]'' (2002) C-309/99, [2002] ECR I-1577&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the central task of competition law is to regulate the [[Inequality of bargaining power|unequal bargaining power]] of private, profit-making businesses,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Courage Ltd v Crehan]]'' (2001) C-453/99, "the matters to be taken into account... include the economic and legal context... and... the respective bargaining power and conduct of the two parties to the contract".&lt;/ref&gt; rather than to affect the delivery of public services, [[collective action]] by social groups, or sound regulation of the economy.

[[File:Microsoft buildings EU.jpg|thumb|left|The Commission has imposed substantial fines on [[Microsoft]] for abusing its monopoly position in the software market. Maximum fines can reach 10% of turnover.]]
The [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 102]] contains the prohibition on monopolies abusing a dominant position. As well as a general ban, it prohibits specific practices including [[price discrimination]] and [[exclusive dealing]]. It enables legislation to be adopted on mergers between firms (the current regulation is the [[European Union merger law|Regulation 139/2004/EC]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:NOT Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation)]&lt;/ref&gt; The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition.

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101(1), including [[price fixing]]. According to Article 101(2) any such agreements are automatically void. Article 101(3) establishes exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a "fair share" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere (or compliant with the [[general principle of European Union law]] of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]).

Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies. Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities, regional development objectives and in the event of a [[natural disaster]].

In 2006, a [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste spill|toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire]], from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. [[European Commissioner for the Environment|Environment Commissioner]] [[Stavros Dimas]] stated that "Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union". With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste, [[Franco Frattini]], the [[Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security|Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner]], proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for "[[ecological crime]]s". The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62003J0176:EN:NOT Case C-176/03 ''Commission v Council'']&lt;/ref&gt; That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law – something never done before.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2912">'''Executive Order 10925''', signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] on March 6, 1961, required government contractors to "take [[affirmative action]] to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Executive Order 10925|wikisource – Executive Order No. 10925]]&lt;/ref&gt; It established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (PCEEO), which was chaired by then Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]].&lt;ref name="lbjgold"&gt;http://shfg.org/shfg/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/4-MacLaury-design4-new_Layout-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Vice Chair and Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg was in charge of the Committee's operations.&lt;ref name="lbjgold" /&gt; This first implementation of affirmative action was intended to give equal opportunities in the workforce to all U.S. citizens, not to give special treatment to those discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Vertreace, W.

Following passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (which went into effect a year later on July 2, 1965) and President Johnson's [[Executive Order 11246]] (which was signed on September 24, 1965), the Committee's functions were divided between the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) and the [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs|Office of Federal Contract Compliance]] (which in 1975 was renamed the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs).&lt;ref&gt;Golland, David Hamilton, ''Constructing Affirmative Action: The Struggle for Equal Employment Opportunity'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the PCEEO and Executive Order 10925 included Senator [[J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4784">'''Frederick Gilmer Bonfils''' (December 21, 1860 – February 2, 1933), [[United States|U.S.]] [[publisher]] who made the ''[[Denver Post]]'' into one of the largest newspapers in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Staff report (February 3, 1933). F. G. BONFILS DEAD; VETERAN EDITOR; Built The Denver Post Into One of the Largest Newspapers in the Nation. HAD SPECTACULAR CAREER I Long a Circus Owner. Took Part in Rush Into Indian Territory. Important Teapot Dome Witness. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[Troy, Missouri]], he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1878 but resigned in 1881 and went into [[land speculation]] in the [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]] booms. He purchased the ''Post'' with [[Harry Heye Tammen]] in 1895. 

Bonfils had met Tammen at the Windsor Hotel in Denver, where Tammen was a bartender (and editor of the Great-Divide Weekly Newspaper, as well as a  worker in a [[wikt:curio|curio]] store).

In December 1899 Tammen and Bonfils were shot in their Denver Post office by W.W. Anderson, an attorney representing "maneater" [[Alfred Packer]] after a Post article had accused Anderson of taking Packer's life savings as a retainer.  In the scuffle in the office Bonfils was shot twice and Tammen three times.  Anderson was tried three times but never convicted while Tammen and Bonfils were convicted for jury tampering in the third trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.missouri.gov/shpo/nps-nr/84002568.pdf Bonfils Building, 1200 Grand, National Register Application - July 1982] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143207/http://www.dnr.missouri.gov/shpo/nps-nr/84002568.pdf |date=2008-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, both Bonfils and Tammen were [[Crop (implement)|horsewhipped]] and hospitalized by a lawyer who disliked their [[yellow journalism]]. Bonfils took $250,000 [[hush-money]] from [[Harry F. Sinclair]] in the [[Teapot Dome scandal]]. Bonfils and Tammen both justified their style of sensationalistic journalism (as well as crediting their success as newspapermen) with the quote "a dogfight on a Denver street is more important than a war in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0gEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=a+dogfight+on+a+Denver+street+is+more+important+than+a+war+in+Europe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0M36XK31aI&amp;sig=U2Z7AfevJW8EThhwMId4r38yIk0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y4YQT9e2FsKusQKp2OjIAw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20dogfight%20on%20a%20Denver%20street%20is%20more%20important%20than%20a%20war%20in%20Europe&amp;f=false The Continuing Task Of Updating America]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Bonfils and Tammen founded the Floto Dog &amp; Pony Show.  The show was named after Otto Floto, the famous sports editor of the Denver Post, who was involved in the publicity work for the show.  In 1906, when bareback rider Willie Sells joined the show, it was renamed the [[Sells-Floto Circus]].  Bonfils and Tammen owned the show until 1921, when it was one of a number of shows acquired by the American Circus Corporation.

In 1909 Bonfils and Tammen bought the [[Kansas City Journal-Post|Kansas City Post]] and owned it until selling it to [[Walter S. Dickey]] in 1922. [[J. Ogden Armour]] was a silent partner in the endeavor. The Post with its tabloid format, red headlines and [[yellow journalism]] was closely tied to the rise of the [[Tom Pendergast]] political machine in Kansas City. The Post was to fold shortly after the collapse of the machine.

==Death==
Bonfils died of [[encephalitis]] at his home in [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1933 and was interred in the [[Fairmount Mausoleum (Denver, Colorado)|Fairmount Mausoleum]] at [[Fairmount Cemetery (Denver, Colorado)|Fairmount Cemetery]], Denver. At the time if his death, he was pursuing a libel lawsuit against the ''Post'''s competitor, the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''.&lt;ref name="timeobit"&gt;Staff report (February 13, 1933). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745154,00.html Death in Denver.] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The life stories of Bonfils and Tammen were immortalized by their former employee, noted writer [[Gene Fowler]], in the book ''Timber Line: A Story of Bonfils and Tammen''.

'''Rohtak-Garhi Sampla Uddar Gagan Model Township land grab scam case''' pertains to illegal acquisition and licensing of 850.88 acres land under [[Bhupinder Singh Hooda]]'s rule as the [[Chief Minister of Haryana]].&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt;&lt;ref name=chor1/&gt;&lt;ref name=uddar1/&gt; Hooda acquired land from illiterate poor farmers at a throwaway prices in the name of ''"public interest"'' and later licensed this land to builders by granting them out-of-turn favors, which resulted in exponential increase in the land value, causing gains to big builders.&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt; [[Haryana Urban Development Authority|HUDA]] issued notification on 11 April 11, 2002 for acquiring 850.88 acres land for residential and commercial development in Sector 27-28 of Rohtak However, which was later reduced to acquire 441.11 acre on 8 April 2003.

[[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) inquiry against Hooda and others is currently underway.&lt;ref name=chor5/&gt; Earlier, [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] in March 2013 and the [[Supreme Court of India]] in May 2016 had already cancelled the government's decision to release land to the private colonizer.&lt;ref name=chor7&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/govt-was-alerted-about-rohtak-sonipat-land-acquisition-scams-15-months-ago/articleshow/63291742.cms Govt was alerted about Rohtak, Sonipat land acquisition scams 15 months ago], [[Times of India]], 14 Mar 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
===Modus of scam===
Builders coerce farmers to sell their land by getting the government to use the Section 4 of the land law to have a government notification issued to the farmer that their land is required for the ''"public purpose"''. Builders try to acquire this land by offering a small premium above the government's rate for the acquisition of the land. If landowners farmers still resist the sale, then Section 6 of land law is applied by declaring the government's intention to acquire land, which forces the reluctant farmers to sell the land to builders at small premium. Once the land is acquired by the builders, government cancels the acquisition process and releases the land to new build owners, along with the change in land use permission to build residential and industrial building on the farm land. This results in steep rise in the land prices, resulting in massive gains for the builders, opportunity cost loss to the farmers and land tax revenue loss to the government.&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt;

Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), now known as [[Haryana Urban Development Authority|Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran]], notified acquisition of 850 acres in 2002, but it acquired only 441 acres April 2003, and remaining land was released to private builders for developing a colony.&lt;ref name=chor7/&gt; 280 acres in Rohtak Garhi Sampla was released from acquisition in the same way as it was done in [[Gurugram-Manesar IMT land scam]] Manesar during Hooda's administration.&lt;ref name=uddar1&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/more-trouble-for-bhupinder-singh-hooda-rohtak-sonipat-land-takeover-cases-go-to-cbi-5096956/ More trouble for Bhupinder Singh Hooda: Rohtak, Sonipat land takeover cases go to CBI], [[Indian Express]], 14 Mar 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2015, builder Uddar Gagan Properties Limited acquired 280 acre land of farmers-owners at throwaway prices under the threat of acquisition at even lower prices. Uddar Gagan in the same month applied to the Haryana Town and Country Planning Department for grant of licence to develop a colony, which was granted in July 2016 and the land was released from the government acquisition process, and instead of returning to the farmers it was released to the builder based on execution of sale deeds favouring the builder through power of attorney.&lt;.&lt;ref name=uddar1/&gt;

|author=[[Punjab and Haryana High Court]]
|source=&lt;ref name=chor7/&gt;}}

===High court and Supreme court cases===
[[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] in March 2013 gave relief to farmers landowners by quashing the government's decision to release and license the land to private colonizers. This decision to quash the ''"illegal and deceptive"'' actions of Hooda administration were reconfirmed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] in May 2016. Two senior officers in the office of CM Hooda were indicted for allegedly favouring the developers.&lt;ref name=chor7/&gt;&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt; Supreme court ordered that the money paid by builders, such as Uddar Gagan, to land owners will not be returned.&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt; Money paid by builders to government, land owners and spent on land development will be repaid by the government.&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt; People who had bought the developed properties from the builders will either receive the property or the refund.&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt; Government/HUDA will own the land.&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt;

{{Quote
|text=
''"Here is a case where artificial reasons were created, the records were fudged with the aid of the Deputy Commissioner, Rohtak, to mislead the fact that the possession of acquired land was not taken while announcing the Award. The responsible officers of the State Government, in their anxiety to help out Uddar Gaggan, have completely overlooked the interest of landowners or of the General Public to whom thousands of plots could have been allotted at a fairly low price through the aegis of HUDA. This amounts to transfer of resources of poor for the benefit of the rich. It amounts to permitting profiteering at the cost of livelihood and existence of a farmer. This is against the philosophy of the Constitution and in violation of guaranteed fundamental rights of equality and right to property and to life.

'''India–Sri Lanka maritime boundary agreements''' were signed in 1974 and 1976 between [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] to [[boundary delimitation|define]] the international [[maritime boundary]] between the two states. [[Treaty|Treaties]] on maritime boundary were necessary to facilitate law enforcement and resource management, and to avoid conflict, in the waters since both countries located closely in the [[Indian ocean]], particularly in [[Palk Strait]].

The first agreement was regarding the maritime boundary in waters between [[Adam's Bridge]] and the [[Palk Strait]], and came into force on July 8, 1974.&lt;ref name="1974Agreement"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Historic water boundary: India Sri Lanka |journal=Limits in the sea |date=12 December 1975 |volume=66 |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/61460.pdf |accessdate=25 July 2018 |publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second agreement, which was signed on March 23 and entered into force on May 10, 1976, defined the maritime boundaries in the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].&lt;ref name="1976Agreement"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Maritime boundaries: India-Sri Lanka |journal=Limit in the seas |date=16 February 1978 |volume=77 |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/58833.pdf |accessdate=25 July 2018 |publisher=U.S. State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maritime" /&gt;

India, Sri Lanka and Maldives signed another agreement for determination of the tri-junction point in the Gulf of Mannar in July 1976. Later in November, India and Sri Lanka signed another agreement to extend the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Mannar.&lt;ref name="Maritime" /&gt;

{{Internet|expanded=General}}
'''Internet access''' is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect to the [[Internet]] using [[computer terminal]]s, [[computer]]s, and other devices; and to access services such as [[email]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Various technologies, at a [[data signaling rate|wide range of speeds]] have been used by [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to provide this service.

Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly. In 1995, only {{val|.04}} percent of the world's population had access, with well over half of those living in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=431|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer use was through [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]]. By the first decade of the 21st century, many consumers in developed nations used faster [[broadband]] technology, and by 2014, 41 percent of the world's population had access,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=431–432|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadband was almost ubiquitous worldwide, and global average connection speeds exceeded 1 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Akamai Releases Second Quarter 2014 ‘State of the Internet' Report |url=http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2014/press-093014.html |work=Akamai |date=30 September 2014 |accessdate=11 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020060839/http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2014/press-093014.html |archivedate=20 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
{{Main article |History of the Internet}}

The Internet developed from the [[ARPANET]], which was funded by the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] to support projects within the government and at universities and research laboratories in the US – but grew over time to include most of the world's large universities and the research arms of many technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ben Segal | title=A Short History of Internet Protocols at CERN | year=1995 | url=http://www.cern.ch/ben/TCPHIST.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[RIPE|Réseaux IP Européens]] (RIPE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Internet History in Asia | work=16th APAN Meetings/Advanced Network Conference in Busan | url=http://www.apan.net/meetings/busan03/cs-history.htm | accessdate=25 December 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060201035514/http://apan.net/meetings/busan03/cs-history.htm | archivedate=1 February 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.&lt;ref name=ConneXions-April1996&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/networkresearch/projecthistory/nsfnet/nsfnet_article.php "Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719235238/http://www.merit.edu/networkresearch/projecthistory/nsfnet/nsfnet_article.php |date=2011-07-19 }}, Susan R. Harris and Elise Gerich, ''ConneXions'', Vol. 10, No. 4, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early to mid-1980s, most Internet access was from [[personal computers]] and [[workstations]] directly connected to [[Local Area network|local area networks]] or from [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up connections]] using [[modems]] and analog [[telephone lines]]. LANs typically operated at 10 Mbit/s,&lt;!-- 100 Mbit/s only came in 1995 --&gt; while modem data-rates grew from 1200 bit/s in the early 1980s, to 56 kbit/s by the late 1990s. Initially, dial-up connections were made from [[Computer terminals|terminals]] or computers running [[Terminal emulator|terminal emulation software]] to [[terminal server]]s on LANs. These dial-up connections did not support end-to-end use of the Internet protocols and only provided terminal to host connections. The introduction of [[network access server]]s supporting the [[Serial Line Internet Protocol]] (SLIP) and later the [[point-to-point protocol]] (PPP) extended the Internet protocols and made the full range of Internet services available to dial-up users; although slower, due to the lower data rates available using dial-up.
 
Broadband Internet access, often shortened to just broadband, is simply defined as "Internet access that is always on, and faster than the traditional dial-up access"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= What is Broadband? |work= The National Broadband Plan |publisher= US Federal Communications Commission |url= http://www.broadband.gov/about_broadband.html/ |accessdate= July 15, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713053907/http://www.broadband.gov/about_broadband.html |archivedate= July 13, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion, and Possible Steps to Accelerate Such Deployment Pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as Amended by the Broadband Data Improvement Act |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |work=GN Docket No. 10-159, FCC-10-148A1 |date=August 6, 2010 |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135629/http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so covers a wide range of technologies. Broadband connections are typically made using a computer's built in [[Ethernet]] networking capabilities, or by using a [[Network interface controller|NIC]] [[expansion card]].

Most broadband services provide a continuous "always on" connection; there is no dial-in process required, and it does not interfere with voice use of phone lines.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; Broadband provides improved access to Internet services such as:
* Faster [[world wide web]] browsing
* Faster downloading of documents, photographs, videos, and other large files
* [[Internet telephony|Telephony]], [[Internet radio|radio]], [[Internet television|television]], and [[videoconferencing]]
* [[Virtual private network]]s and remote system administration
* [[Online game|Online gaming]], especially [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s which are interaction-intensive

In the 1990s, the [[National Information Infrastructure Protection Act|National Information Infrastructure]] initiative in the U.S. made broadband Internet access a public policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Jeffrey A. Hart |author2= Robert R. Reed |author3=François Bar |title= The building of the Internet: Implications for the future of broadband networks |journal= Telecommunications Policy |volume= 16 |issue= 8 |pages= 666–689 |date= November 1992 |doi= 10.1016/0308-5961(92)90061-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, most Internet access to homes was provided using dial-up, while many businesses and schools were using broadband connections. In 2000 there were just under 150 million dial-up subscriptions in the 34 OECD countries&lt;ref name=OECD-countries&gt;The 34 OECD countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,

By 2004, broadband had grown and dial-up had declined so that the number of subscriptions were roughly equal at 130 million each. In 2010, in the OECD countries, over 90% of the Internet access subscriptions used broadband, broadband had grown to more than 300 million subscriptions, and dial-up subscriptions had declined to fewer than 30 million.&lt;ref name=OCED-June2011&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/5/48255770.pdf ''The Future of the Internet Economy: A Statistical Profile''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616224428/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/5/48255770.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}, Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadband technologies in widest use are [[ADSL]] and [[cable Internet]] access. Newer technologies include [[VDSL]] and [[optical fibre]] extended closer to the subscriber in both telephone and cable plants. [[Fibre-optic communication]], while only recently being used in [[fibre to the x|premises and to the curb]] schemes, has played a crucial role in enabling broadband Internet access by making transmission of information at very high data rates over longer distances much more cost-effective than copper wire technology.

In areas not served by ADSL or cable, some community organizations and local governments are installing [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|Wi-Fi]] networks. Wireless and satellite Internet are often used in rural, undeveloped, or other hard to serve areas where wired Internet is not readily available.

Newer technologies being deployed for fixed (stationary) and mobile broadband access include [[WiMAX]], [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]], and [[fixed wireless]], e.g., [[Motorola Canopy]].

Starting in roughly 2006, [[mobile broadband]] access is increasingly available at the consumer level using "[[3G]]" and "[[4G LTE|4G]]" technologies such as [[High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EV-DO]], [[HSPA+]], and [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]].

==Availability==
In addition to access from home, school, and the workplace Internet access may be available from [[public place]]s such as [[libraries]] and [[Internet cafes]], where computers with Internet connections are available. Some libraries provide stations for physically connecting users' [[laptop]]s to [[local area network]]s (LANs).

Wireless Internet access points are available in public places such as airport halls, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Some access points may also provide coin-operated computers. Various terms are used, such as "public [[Internet kiosk]]", "public access terminal", and "Web [[payphone]]". Many hotels also have public terminals, usually fee based.

Coffee shops, shopping malls, and other venues increasingly offer wireless access to computer networks, referred to as [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]], for users who bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a [[laptop]] or [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A [[Wi-Fi]] hotspot need not be limited to a confined location since multiple ones combined can cover a whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled.

Additionally, [[Mobile broadband]] access allows [[smart phones]] and other digital devices to connect to the Internet from any location from which a [[mobile phone]] call can be made, subject to the capabilities of that mobile network.

{{Main article |Data rates | Bit rates |Bandwidth (computing) |Device data rates}}
The bit rates for dial-up [[modems]] range from as little as 110 bit/s in the late 1950s, to a maximum of from 33 to 64 kbit/s ([[V.90 (recommendation)|V.90]] and [[V.92]]) in the late 1990s. [[Dial-up Internet access|Dial-up connections]] generally require the dedicated use of a telephone line. Data compression can boost the effective bit rate for a dial-up modem connection to from 220 ([[V.42bis]]) to 320 ([[V.44]]) kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |title=What You Need to Know about Modems |accessdate=2008-03-02 |last=Willdig |first=Karl |author2=Patrik Chen |date=August 1994 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104124418/http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |archivedate=2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effectiveness of data compression is quite variable, depending on the type of data being sent, the condition of the telephone line, and a number of other factors. In reality, the overall data rate rarely exceeds 150 kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |title=Modem compression: V.44 against V.42bis |accessdate=2008-03-02 |last=Mitronov |first=Pavel |date=2001-06-29 |publisher=Pricenfees.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202062749/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadband technologies supply considerably higher bit rates than dial-up, generally without disrupting regular telephone use. Various minimum data rates and maximum latencies have been used in definitions of broadband, ranging from 64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s up to 4.0&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="Birth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/birthofbroadband/faq.html |title=Birth of Broadband |publisher=ITU |date=September 2003 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701173257/http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/birthofbroadband/faq.html |archivedate=July 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the [[ITU-T|CCITT]] standards body defined "broadband service" as requiring transmission channels capable of supporting [[bit rate]]s greater than the [[Primary Rate Interface|primary rate]] which ranged from about 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.113-199706-I!!PDF-E |title= Recommendation I.113, Vocabulary of Terms for Broadband aspects of ISDN |publisher= ITU-T |date= June 1997 |orig-year= originally 1988 |accessdate= 19 July 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121106141554/http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.113-199706-I!!PDF-E |archivedate= 6 November 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report defined broadband as having download [[data transfer rates]] equal to or faster than 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/broadband.html |title=2006 OECD Broadband Statistics to December 2006 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507202240/http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/broadband.html |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2015 the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) defined "Basic Broadband" as data transmission speeds of at least 25 Mbit/s downstream (from the Internet to the user’s [[computer]]) and 3&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s upstream (from the user’s computer to the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-331760A1.pdf |title=FCC Finds U.S. Broadband Deployment Not Keeping Pace |publisher=FCC |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419074040/https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-331760A1.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is to raise the threshold of the broadband definition as higher data rate services become available.&lt;ref name="engadget08"&gt;{{cite web |first=Nilay |last=Patel |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/19/fcc-redefines-broadband-to-mean-768kbps-fast-to-mean-kinda/ |title=FCC redefines "broadband" to mean 768&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, "fast" to mean "kinda slow" |publisher=Engadget |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213175111/http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/19/fcc-redefines-broadband-to-mean-768kbps-fast-to-mean-kinda |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher data rate dial-up modems and many broadband services are "asymmetric"—supporting much higher data rates for download (toward the user) than for upload (toward the Internet).

Data rates, including those given in this article, are usually defined and advertised in terms of the maximum or peak download rate. In practice, these maximum data rates are not always reliably available to the customer.&lt;ref name="100mb"/&gt; Actual end-to-end data rates can be lower due to a number of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Tom Phillips |title= 'Misleading' BT broadband ad banned |work= UK Metro |date= August 25, 2010 |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/839014-misleading-bt-broadband-ad-banned |accessdate= July 24, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110906220840/http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/839014-misleading-bt-broadband-ad-banned |archivedate= September 6, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2016, internet connection speeds averaged about 6 Mbit/s globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ben Munson |title=Akamai: Global average internet speeds have doubled since last Olympics |work=FierceOnlineVideo |date=June 29, 2016 |url=http://www.fierceonlinevideo.com/story/akamai-global-average-internet-speeds-have-doubled-last-olympics/2016-06-29 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702073650/http://www.fierceonlinevideo.com/story/akamai-global-average-internet-speeds-have-doubled-last-olympics/2016-06-29 |archivedate=July 2, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical link quality can vary with distance and for wireless access with terrain, weather, building construction, antenna placement, and interference from other radio sources. Network bottlenecks may exist at points anywhere on the path from the end-user to the remote server or service being used and not just on the first or last link providing Internet access to the end-user.

===Network congestion===
Users may share access over a common network infrastructure. Since most users do not use their full connection capacity all of the time, this aggregation strategy (known as [[contended service]]) usually works well and users can burst to their full data rate at least for brief periods. However, [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) [[file sharing]] and high-quality streaming video can require high data-rates for extended periods, which violates these assumptions and can cause a service to become oversubscribed, resulting in congestion and poor performance. The TCP protocol includes flow-control mechanisms that automatically throttle back on the bandwidth being used during periods of [[network congestion]]. This is fair in the sense that all users that experience congestion receive less bandwidth, but it can be frustrating for customers and a major problem for ISPs. In some cases the amount of bandwidth actually available may fall below the threshold required to support a particular service such as video conferencing or streaming live video–effectively making the service unavailable.

When traffic is particularly heavy, an ISP can deliberately throttle back the bandwidth available to classes of users or for particular services. This is known as [[traffic shaping]] and careful use can ensure a better [[quality of service]] for time critical services even on extremely busy networks. However, overuse can lead to concerns about fairness and [[network neutrality]] or even charges of [[censorship]], when some types of traffic are severely or completely blocked.

===Outages===
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of [[submarine communications cable]]s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [[2008 submarine cable disruption]].  Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.  Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|title=Georgian woman cuts off web access to whole of Armenia|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=11 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825075603/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|archivedate=25 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [[Internet censorship]], as in the blockage of the [[Internet in Egypt]], whereby approximately 93%&lt;ref name="renesys1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cowie |first=James |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys |url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga?url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|anti-government protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 | work=BBC News | title=Egypt severs internet connection amid growing unrest | date=28 January 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123164134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 | archivedate=23 January 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==
When the Internet is accessed using a [[modem]], [[digital data]] is converted to [[analog signal|analog]] for transmission over analog networks such as the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone]] and [[Cable television|cable]] networks.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;[http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howbroadbandworks.html "How Broadband Works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913021130/http://www.explainthatstuff.com//howbroadbandworks.html |date=2011-09-13 }}, Chris Woodford, Explain that Stuff, 20 August 2008. Retrieved 19 January.&lt;/ref&gt; A computer or other device accessing the Internet would either be connected directly to a modem that communicates with an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) or the modem's Internet connection would be shared via a [[Local Area Network]] (LAN) which provides access in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.

Although a connection to a LAN may provide very high data-rates within the LAN, actual Internet access speed is limited by the upstream link to the ISP. LANs may be wired or wireless. [[Ethernet]] over [[twisted pair]] cabling and [[Wi-Fi]] are the two most common technologies used to build LANs today, but [[ARCNET]], [[Token Ring]], [[Localtalk]], [[FDDI]], and other technologies were used in the past.

[[Ethernet]] is the name of the [[IEEE 802.3]] standard for physical LAN communication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124030206/http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.3.html |archivedate=2017-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wi-Fi]] is a trade name for a [[wireless local area network]] (WLAN) that uses one of the [[IEEE 802.11]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Wi-Fi (wireless networking technology)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1473553/Wi-Fi|accessdate=2010-02-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627181935/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1473553/Wi-Fi|archivedate=2010-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethernet cables are interconnected via switches &amp; routers. Wi-Fi networks are built using one or more wireless antenna called [[Wireless access point|access points]].

Many "modems" provide the additional functionality to host a LAN so most Internet access today is through a LAN{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, often a very small LAN with just one or two devices attached. And while LANs are an important form of Internet access, this raises the question of how and at what data rate the LAN itself is connected to the rest of the global Internet. The technologies described below are used to make these connections.

===Hardwired broadband access===

The term [[broadband]] includes a broad range of technologies, all of which provide higher data rate access to the Internet. The following technologies use wires or cables in contrast to wireless broadband described later.

====Dial-up access====
{{Listen
|filename = Dial up modem noises.ogg
|title = "Dial up modem noises"
|description = Typical noises of a [[dial-up|dial-up modem]] while establishing connection with a local [[Internet service provider|ISP]] in order to get access to the [[Internet]].
|pos=right}}
[[Dial-up Internet access]] uses a modem and a phone call placed over the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) to connect to a pool of modems operated by an ISP. The [[modem]] converts a computer's digital signal into an analog signal that travels over a phone line's [[local loop]] until it reaches a telephone company's switching facilities or central office (CO) where it is switched to another phone line that connects to another modem at the remote end of the connection.&lt;ref name=Network&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks, 5th Ed|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating on a single channel, a dial-up connection monopolizes the phone line and is one of the slowest methods of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas as it requires no new infrastructure beyond the already existing telephone network, to connect to the Internet. Typically, dial-up connections do not exceed a speed of 56 [[kbit/s]], as they are primarily made using modems that operate at a maximum data rate of 56 kbit/s downstream (towards the end user) and 34 or 48 kbit/s upstream (toward the global Internet).&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt;

====Multilink dial-up====
[[Multilink striping|Multilink]] dial-up provides increased bandwidth by [[channel bonding]] multiple dial-up connections and accessing them as a single data channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.56k.com/reports/bonding.shtml "Bonding: 112K, 168K, and beyond "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310194539/http://www.56k.com/reports/bonding.shtml |date=2007-03-10 }}, 56K.com&lt;/ref&gt; It requires two or more modems, phone lines, and dial-up accounts, as well as an ISP that supports multilinking – and of course any line and data charges are also doubled. This [[inverse multiplexing]] option was briefly popular with some high-end users before ISDN, DSL and other technologies became available. [[Diamond Multimedia|Diamond]] and other vendors created special modems to support multilinking.&lt;ref name="fail"&gt;[http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/top_tech_blunders_10_products_massively_failed "Diamond 56k Shotgun Modem"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331173853/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/top_tech_blunders_10_products_massively_failed |date=2012-03-31 }}, maximumpc.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated Services Digital Network====
[[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) is a switched telephone service capable of transporting voice and digital data, as well as one of the oldest Internet access methods. ISDN has been used for voice, video conferencing, and broadband data applications. ISDN was very popular in Europe, but less common in North America. Its use peaked in the late 1990s before the availability of [[DSL]] and [[cable modem]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stallings |title=ISDN and Broadband ISDN with Frame Relay and ATM |edition=4th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1999 |page=542 |isbn=0139737448 |url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/ISDN-and-Broadband-ISDN-with-Frame-Relay-and-ATM-4E/9780139737442.page |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924071103/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/ISDN-and-Broadband-ISDN-with-Frame-Relay-and-ATM-4E/9780139737442.page |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic rate ISDN, known as ISDN-BRI, has two 64 kbit/s "bearer" or "B" channels. These channels can be used separately for voice or data calls or bonded together to provide a 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s service. Multiple ISDN-BRI lines can be bonded together to provide data rates above 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s. Primary rate ISDN, known as ISDN-PRI, has 23 bearer channels (64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s each) for a combined data rate of 1.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (US standard). An ISDN E1 (European standard) line has 30 bearer channels and a combined data rate of 1.9&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.

====Leased lines====
[[Leased line]]s are dedicated lines used primarily by ISPs, business, and other large enterprises to connect LANs and campus networks to the Internet using the existing infrastructure of the [[Public switched telephone network|public telephone network]] or other providers. Delivered using wire, [[optical fiber]], and [[radio]], leased lines are used to provide Internet access directly as well as the building blocks from which several other forms of Internet access are created.&lt;ref name="Horak"&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470396075.html ''Telecommunications and Data Communications Handbook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308075758/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470396075.html |date=2013-03-08 }}, Ray Horak, 2nd edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2008, 791 p., {{ISBN|0-470-39607-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T-carrier]] technology dates to 1957 and provides data rates that range from 56 and {{val|64|u=kbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 0|DS0]]) to {{val|1.5|u=Mbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 1|DS1]] or T1), to {{val|45|u=Mbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 3|DS3]] or T3). A T1 line carries 24 voice or data channels (24 DS0s), so customers may use some channels for data and others for voice traffic or use all 24 channels for clear channel data. A DS3 (T3) line carries 28 DS1 (T1) channels. Fractional T1 lines are also available in multiples of a DS0 to provide data rates between 56 and {{val|1,500|u=kbit/s}}. T-carrier lines require special termination equipment that may be separate from or integrated into a router or switch and which may be purchased or leased from an ISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} pp 312–315.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan the equivalent standard is J1/J3. In Europe, a slightly different standard, [[E-carrier]], provides 32 user channels ({{val|64|u=kbit/s}}) on an E1 ({{val|2.0|u=Mbit/s}}) and 512 user channels or 16 E1s on an E3 ({{val|34.4|u=Mbit/s}}).

[[Synchronous Optical Networking]] (SONET, in the U.S. and Canada) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH, in the rest of the world) are the standard multiplexing protocols used to carry high-data-rate digital bit-streams over optical fiber using [[lasers]] or highly [[coherent light]] from [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs). At lower transmission rates data can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The basic unit of framing is an [[OC-3c]] (optical) or [[Synchronous optical networking#The basic unit of transmission|STS-3]]c (electrical) which carries {{val|155.520|u=Mbit/s}}. Thus an OC-3c will carry three [[Optical Carrier#OC-1|OC-1]] (51.84 Mbit/s) payloads each of which has enough capacity to include a full DS3. Higher data rates are delivered in OC-3c multiples of four providing [[OC-12]]c ({{val|622.080|u=Mbit/s}}), [[OC-48]]c ({{val|2.488|u=Gbit/s}}), [[OC-192]]c ({{val|9.953|u=Gbit/s}}), and [[OC-768]]c (39.813 Gbit/s). The "c" at the end of the OC labels stands for "concatenated" and indicates a single data stream rather than several multiplexed data streams.&lt;ref name="Horak" /&gt;

The 1, 10, 40, and 100 gigabit Ethernet ([[GbE]], [[10 GbE]], [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|40/100 GbE]]) [[IEEE 802.3|IEEE standards (802.3)]] allow digital data to be delivered over copper wiring at distances to 100 m and over optical fiber at distances to {{val|40|u=km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/3/ "IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Working Group"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012182235/http://www.ieee802.org/3/ |date=2014-10-12 }}, web page, IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee, accessed 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cable Internet access====
{{main article|Cable Internet access}}
Cable Internet provides access using a [[cable modem]] on [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|hybrid fiber coaxial]] wiring originally developed to carry television signals. Either fiber-optic or coaxial copper cable may connect a node to a customer's location at a connection known as a cable drop. In a [[cable modem termination system]], all nodes for cable subscribers in a neighborhood connect to a cable company's central office, known as the "head end." The cable company then connects to the Internet using a variety of means – usually fiber optic cable or digital satellite and microwave transmissions.&lt;ref name="Dean322"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} p 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Like DSL, broadband cable provides a continuous connection with an ISP.

[[Downstream (computer science)|Downstream]], the direction toward the user, bit rates can be as much as 400&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] for business connections, and 320&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for residential service in some countries. Upstream traffic, originating at the user, ranges from 384&amp;nbsp;kbit/s to more than 20&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. Broadband cable access tends to service fewer business customers because existing television cable networks tend to service residential buildings and commercial buildings do not always include wiring for coaxial cable networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} p 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because broadband cable subscribers share the same local line, communications may be intercepted by neighboring subscribers. Cable networks regularly provide encryption schemes for data traveling to and from customers, but these schemes may be thwarted.&lt;ref name="Dean322"/&gt;

====Digital subscriber line (DSL, ADSL, SDSL, and VDSL)====
[[Digital Subscriber Line]] (DSL) service provides a connection to the Internet through the telephone network. Unlike dial-up, DSL can operate using a single phone line without preventing normal use of the telephone line for voice phone calls. DSL uses the high frequencies, while the low (audible) frequencies of the line are left free for [[Plain old telephone service|regular telephone]] communication.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; These frequency bands are subsequently separated by filters installed at the customer's premises.

DSL originally stood for "digital subscriber loop". In telecommunications marketing, the term digital subscriber line is widely understood to mean [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line]] (ADSL), the most commonly installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s to 20&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e. in the direction to the service provider) is lower than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/?tag=ADSL_Theory "ADSL Theory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724040222/http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/?tag=ADSL_Theory |date=2010-07-24 }}, Australian broadband news and information, Whirlpool, accessed 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line#SDSL "SDSL"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418172858/http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line |date=2012-04-18 }}, ''Internetworking Technology Handbook'', Cisco DocWiki, 17 December 2009, accessed 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[VDSL2]] (ITU-T G.993.2) is a second-generation version and an enhancement of VDSL.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{Cite news |title= New ITU Standard Delivers 10x ADSL Speeds: Vendors applaud landmark agreement on VDSL2 |date= 27 May 2005 |work= News release |publisher= International Telecommunication Union |url= http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2005/06.html |accessdate= 22 September 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160903203113/http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2005/06.html |archivedate= 3 September 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved in February 2006, it is able to provide data rates exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream directions. However, the maximum data rate is achieved at a range of about 300 meters and performance degrades as distance and loop [[attenuation]] increases.

====Fiber to the home====
[[Fiber to the x|Fiber-to-the-home]] (FTTH) is one member of the Fiber-to-the-x (FTTx) family that includes Fiber-to-the-building or basement (FTTB), Fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), Fiber-to-the-desk (FTTD), Fiber-to-the-curb (FTTC), and Fiber-to-the-node (FTTN).&lt;ref name="council"&gt;{{cite web |title= FTTH Council – Definition of Terms |date= January 9, 2009 |url= http://ftthcouncil.eu/documents/Reports/FTTH-Definitions-Revision_January_2009.pdf |publisher= FTTH Council |accessdate= September 1, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods all bring data closer to the end user on optical fibers. The differences between the methods have mostly to do with just how close to the end user the delivery on fiber comes. All of these delivery methods are similar to [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] (HFC) systems used to provide [[cable Internet access]].

The use of [[Fiber-optic communication|optical fiber]] offers much higher data rates over relatively longer distances. Most high-capacity Internet and cable television backbones already use fiber optic technology, with data switched to other technologies (DSL, cable, [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]) for final delivery to customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiopt.com/primer.php "FTTx Primer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011033903/http://www.fiopt.com/primer.php |date=2008-10-11 }}, Fiopt Communication Services (Calgary), July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia began rolling out its [[National Broadband Network]] across the country using fiber-optic cables to 93 percent of Australian homes, schools, and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-08-12/big-gig-nbn-to-be-10-times-faster/941408 "Big gig: NBN to be 10 times faster"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429192147/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-08-12/big-gig-nbn-to-be-10-times-faster/941408 |date=2012-04-29 }}, Emma Rodgers, ''ABC News'', Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was abandoned by the subsequent LNP government, in favour of a hybrid FTTN design, which turned out to be more expensive and introduced delays.

====Power-line Internet====
[[Power-line Internet]], also known as [[Broadband over power lines]] (BPL), carries Internet data on a conductor that is also used for [[electric power transmission]].&lt;ref name="BERGU14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Lars T.|last2=Schwager|first2=Andreas |last3=Pagani|first3=Pascal|last4=Schneider|first4=Daniel M.|date=February 2014|title=MIMO Power Line Communications: Narrow and Broadband Standards, EMC, and Advanced Processing|publisher=CRC Press|series=Devices, Circuits, and Systems|isbn=9781466557529|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1201/b16540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the extensive power line infrastructure already in place, this technology can provide people in rural and low population areas access to the Internet with little cost in terms of new transmission equipment, cables, or wires. Data rates are asymmetric and generally range from 256 kbit/s to 2.7 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL"&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bpl.htm "How Broadband Over Powerlines Works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090550/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bpl.htm |date=2012-05-12 }}, Robert Valdes, ''How Stuff Works'', accessed 5 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these systems use parts of the radio spectrum allocated to other over-the-air communication services, interference between the services is a limiting factor in the introduction of power-line Internet systems. The [[IEEE P1901]] standard specifies that all power-line protocols must detect existing usage and avoid interfering with it.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL" /&gt;

Power-line Internet has developed faster in Europe than in the U.S. due to a historical difference in power system design philosophies. Data signals cannot pass through the step-down transformers used and so a repeater must be installed on each transformer.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL" /&gt; In the U.S. a transformer serves a small cluster of from one to a few houses. In Europe, it is more common for a somewhat larger transformer to service larger clusters of from 10 to 100 houses. Thus a typical U.S. city requires an order of magnitude more repeaters than in a comparable European city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/north-american-versus-european-distribution-systems "North American versus European distribution systems"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507211603/http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/north-american-versus-european-distribution-systems |date=2012-05-07 }}, Edvard, Technical articles, Electrical Engineering Portal, 17 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====ATM and Frame Relay====
[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) and [[Frame Relay]] are wide-area networking standards that can be used to provide Internet access directly or as building blocks of other access technologies. For example, many DSL implementations use an ATM layer over the low-level bitstream layer to enable a number of different technologies over the same link. Customer LANs are typically connected to an ATM switch or a Frame Relay node using leased lines at a wide range of data rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items ''B-ISDN asynchronous transfer mode functional characteristics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012161801/http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items |date=2012-10-12 }}, ITU-T Recommendation I.150, February 1999, International Telecommunications Union&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/frame-relay "Frame Relay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409171824/http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/frame-relay |date=2012-04-09 }}, Margaret Rouse, TechTarget, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While still widely used, with the advent of Ethernet over optical fiber, [[MPLS]], [[VPN]]s and broadband services such as [[cable modem]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], ATM and Frame Relay no longer play the prominent role they once did.

===Wireless broadband access===
[[Wireless broadband]] is used to provide both fixed and mobile Internet access with the following technologies.

====Satellite broadband====

Satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) operate in a fixed position 35,786&amp;nbsp;km (22,236 miles) above the Earth's equator. At the speed of light (about 300,000&amp;nbsp;km/s or 186,000 miles per second), it takes a quarter of a second for a radio signal to travel from the Earth to the satellite and back. When other switching and routing delays are added and the delays are doubled to allow for a full round-trip transmission, the total delay can be 0.75 to 1.25 seconds. This latency is large when compared to other forms of Internet access with typical latencies that range from 0.015 to 0.2 seconds. Long latencies negatively affect some applications that require real-time response, particularly online games, [[voice over IP]], and remote control devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Basics of Satellite Communication| author=Joseph N.

Satellites in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO, below 2000&amp;nbsp;km or 1243 miles) and [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO, between 2000 and 35,786&amp;nbsp;km or 1,243 and 22,236 miles) are less common, operate at lower altitudes, and are not fixed in their position above the Earth. Lower altitudes allow lower latencies and make real-time interactive Internet applications more feasible. LEO systems include [[Globalstar]] and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]]. The [[O3b (satellite)|O3b Satellite Constellation]] is a proposed MEO system with a latency of 125 ms. COMMStellation™ is a LEO system, scheduled for launch in 2015, that is expected to have a latency of just 7&amp;nbsp;ms.

====Mobile broadband====
[[File:Mobile Broadband service mark.jpg|thumb |150px |Service mark for [[GSM Association|GSMA]] ]]
[[Mobile broadband]] is the marketing term for wireless Internet access delivered through mobile phone towers to computers, [[mobile phone]]s (called "cell phones" in North America and South Africa, and "hand phones" in Asia), and other digital devices using [[portable modem]]s. Some mobile services allow more than one device to be connected to the Internet using a single cellular connection using a process called [[tethering]]. The modem may be built into laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices, added to some devices using [[PC card]]s, [[USB modem]]s, and [[USB sticks]] or [[PC Card dongle|dongles]], or separate [[wireless modem]]s can be used.&lt;ref name="ergen"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mobile Broadband: including WiMAX and LTE |publisher= Springer Science+Business Media |year= 2009 |author= Mustafa Ergen |isbn= 978-0-387-68189-4 |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-68189-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New mobile phone technology and infrastructure is introduced periodically and generally involves a change in the fundamental nature of the service, non-backwards-compatible transmission technology, higher peak data rates, new frequency bands, wider channel frequency bandwidth in Hertz becomes available. These transitions are referred to as generations. The first mobile data services became available during the second generation (2G).

[[WiMAX]] was originally developed to deliver fixed wireless service with wireless mobility added in 2005. CDPD, CDMA2000 EV-DO, and MBWA are no longer being actively developed.

In 2011, 90% of the world's population lived in areas with 2G coverage, while 45% lived in areas with 2G and 3G coverage.&lt;ref name=ITU-ITCFacts&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf "The World in 2011: ITC Facts and Figures"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510070621/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf |date=2012-05-10 }}, International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), Geneva, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====WiMAX====
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access ([[WiMAX]]) is a set of interoperable implementations of the [[IEEE 802.16]] family of wireless-network standards certified by the [[WiMAX Forum]]. WiMAX enables "the delivery of [[last mile]] wireless broadband access as an alternative to cable and DSL".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimaxforum.org/technology/ |title=WiMax Forum – Technology |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722062158/http://www.wimaxforum.org/technology/ |archivedate=2008-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original IEEE 802.16 standard, now called "Fixed WiMAX", was published in 2001 and provided 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/interviews/blog/speeding-up-wimax/?cs=40726 |title= Speeding Up WiMax |author= Carl Weinschenk |date= 16 April 2010 |work= IT Business Edge |quote= Today the initial WiMax system is designed to provide 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates. |accessdate= 31 August 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110905081903/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/interviews/blog/speeding-up-wimax/?cs=40726 |archivedate= 5 September 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility support was added in 2005. A 2011 update provides data rates up to 1 Gbit/s for fixed stations. WiMax offers a metropolitan area network with a signal radius of about 50&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles), far surpassing the 30-metre (100-foot) wireless range of a conventional [[Wi-Fi]] [[local area network]] (LAN). WiMAX signals also penetrate building walls much more effectively than Wi-Fi.

====Wireless ISP====
[[File:Wi-Fi Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Wi-Fi logo]]
[[Wireless Internet service provider]]s (WISPs) operate independently of [[mobile phone operator]]s. WISPs typically employ low-cost IEEE 802.11 [[Wi-Fi]] radio systems to link up remote locations over great distances ([[Long-range Wi-Fi]]), but may use other higher-power radio communications systems as well.

Traditional 802.11a/b/g/n/ac is an unlicensed omnidirectional service designed to span between 100 and 150 m (300 to 500&amp;nbsp;ft). By focusing the radio signal using a [[directional antenna]] (where allowed by regulations), 802.11 can operate reliably over a distance of many km(miles), although the technology's line-of-sight requirements hamper connectivity in areas with hilly or heavily foliated terrain. In addition, compared to hard-wired connectivity, there are security risks (unless robust security protocols are enabled); data rates are usually slower (2 to 50 times slower); and the network can be less stable, due to interference from other wireless devices and networks, weather and line-of-sight problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Certified Wireless Network Administrator Official Study Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnMunBGVDuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cwna+official+study+guide&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EJaXTpSaFMPSiALTu4HCDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Joshua Bardwell|author2=Devin Akin|page=418|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2005|edition=Third|isbn=978-0-07-225538-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109135240/https://books.google.com/books?id=QnMunBGVDuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cwna+official+study+guide&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EJaXTpSaFMPSiALTu4HCDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing popularity of unrelated consumer devices operating on the same 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, many providers have migrated to the [[List of WLAN channels#5.C2.A0GHz .28802.11a.2Fh.2Fj.2Fn.2Fac.29.5B18.5D|5GHz ISM band]]. If the service provider holds the necessary spectrum license, it could also reconfigure various brands of off the shelf Wi-Fi hardware to operate on its own band instead of the crowded unlicensed ones. Using higher frequencies carries various advantages:
* usually regulatory bodies allow for more power and using (better-) directional antennae,
* there exists much more bandwidth to share, allowing both better throughput and improved coexistence,
* there are less consumer devices that operate over 5&amp;nbsp;GHz than on 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz, hence less interferers are present,
* the shorter wavelengths propagate much worse through walls and other structure, so much less interference leaks outside of the homes of consumers.

Proprietary technologies like [[Motorola Canopy]] &amp; Expedience can be used by a WISP to offer wireless access to rural and other markets that are hard to reach using Wi-Fi or WiMAX. There are a number of companies that provide this service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wispa.org/directories/member-directory "Member Directory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220031021/http://www.wispa.org/Directories/Member-Directory |date=2017-02-20 }}, Wireless Internet Service Providers’ Association (WISPA), accessed 5 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Local Multipoint Distribution Service====
[[Local Multipoint Distribution Service]] (LMDS) is a broadband wireless access technology that uses microwave signals operating between 26&amp;nbsp;GHz and 29&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cis788-99/ftp/lmds/index.html "Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LDMS)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010031040/http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cis788-99/ftp/lmds/index.html |date=2012-10-10 }}, Vinod Tipparaju, November 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed for digital television transmission (DTV), it is conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. Data rates range from 64 kbit/s to 155 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nd/ramdinchacha/DEC00.html "LMDS: Broadband Out of Thin Air "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415040102/http://www.angelfire.com/nd/ramdinchacha/DEC00.html |date=2014-04-15 }}, Niraj K Gupta, from My Cell, Voice &amp; Data, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Distance is typically limited to about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, but links of up to 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) from the base station are possible in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijest.info/docs/IJEST09-01-01.pdf "Review and Analysis of Local Multipoint Distribution System (LMDS) to Deliver Voice, Data, Internet, and Video Services"], S.S. Riaz Ahamed, International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, Vol. 1(1), October 2009, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

LMDS has been surpassed in both technological and commercial potential by the LTE and WiMAX standards.

===Hybrid Access Networks===
{{See also |Hybrid Access Networks}}

In some regions, notably in rural areas, the length of the copper lines makes it difficult for network operators to provide high bandwidth services. An alternative is to combine a fixed access network, typically [[XDSL]], with a wireless network, typically [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]. The [[Broadband Forum]] has standardised an architecture for such [[Hybrid Access Networks]].

===Non-commercial alternatives for using Internet services===
{{See also |Project Loon}}

====Grassroots wireless networking movements====
Deploying multiple adjacent Wi-Fi access points is sometimes used to create [[Municipal wireless network|city-wide]] wireless networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-and-learn | title = Discover and Learn | publisher = The Wi-Fi Alliance | accessdate = 6 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120510032811/http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-and-learn | archivedate = 10 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually ordered by the local municipality from commercial WISPs.

[[Grassroots]] efforts have also led to [[wireless community network]]s widely deployed at numerous countries, both developing and developed ones. Rural wireless-ISP installations are typically not commercial in nature and are instead a patchwork of systems built up by hobbyists mounting antennas on [[radio masts and towers]], agricultural [[storage silo]]s, very tall trees, or whatever other tall objects are available.

Where radio spectrum regulation is not community-friendly, the channels are crowded or when equipment can not be afforded by local residents, [[Free-space optical communication#LEDs|free-space optical communication]] can also be deployed in a similar manner for point to point transmission in air (rather than in fiber optic cable).

====Packet radio====
{{Main article |Packet radio|AMPRNet}}

Packet radio connects computers or whole networks operated by radio amateurs with the option to access the Internet. Note that as per the regulatory rules outlined in the HAM license, Internet access and e-mail should be strictly related to the activities of hardware amateurs.

====Sneakernet====
{{Main article |Sneakernet}}

The term, a [[tongue-in-cheek]] play on ''net(work)'' as in ''[[Internet]]'' or ''[[Ethernet]]'', refers to the wearing of [[sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]] as the transport mechanism for the data.

For those who do not have access to or can not afford broadband at home, downloading large files and disseminating information is done by transmission through workplace or library networks, taken home and shared with neighbors by sneakernet.

There are various decentralized, [[Delay-tolerant networking|delay tolerant]] peer to peer applications which aim to fully automate this using any available interface, including both wireless (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi mesh, P2P or hotspots) and physically connected ones (USB storage, ethernet, etc.).

Sneakernets may also be used in tandem with computer network data transfer to increase data security or overall throughput for big data use cases. Innovation continues in the area to this day, for example AWS has recently announced Snowball, and bulk data processing is also done in a similar fashion by many research institutes and government agencies.

==Pricing and spending==
[[File:Broadband Affordability.png|thumb|400px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;'''Broadband affordability in 2011'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;small&gt;This map presents an overview of broadband affordability, as the relationship between average yearly income per capita and the cost of a broadband subscription (data referring to 2011). Source: Information Geographies at the Oxford Internet Institute.&lt;ref name=InternetPopulation2011&gt;[http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/#broadband-affordability "Broadband affordability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614024048/http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/ |date=2014-06-14 }}, Information Geographies at the Oxford Internet Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

Internet access is limited by the relation between pricing and available resources to spend. Regarding the latter, it is estimated that 40% of the world's population has less than US$20 per year available to spend on [[information and communications technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019 | volume=38 | title=When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide?

From Latin America it is known that the borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the “magical number” of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; This is the amount of ICT spending people esteem to be a basic necessity. Current Internet access prices exceed the available resources by large in many countries.

Dial-up users pay the costs for making local or long distance phone calls, usually pay a monthly subscription fee, and may be subject to additional per minute or traffic based charges, and connect time limits by their ISP. Though less common today than in the past, some dial-up access is offered for "free" in return for watching banner ads as part of the dial-up service. [[NetZero]], [[Kmart#BlueLight internet service|BlueLight]], [[Juno Online Services|Juno]], [[Freenet (ISP)|Freenet (NZ)]], and [[Free-net]]s are examples of services providing free access. Some [[Wireless community network]]s continue the tradition of providing free Internet access.

Fixed broadband Internet access is often sold under an "unlimited" or [[flat rate]] pricing model, with price determined by the maximum data rate chosen by the customer, rather than a per minute or traffic based charge. Per minute and traffic based charges and traffic caps are common for mobile broadband Internet access.

Internet services like [[Facebook]], [[Wikipedia]] and [[Google]] have built special programs to partner with [[mobile network operator]]s (MNO) to introduce ''[[zero-rating]]'' the cost for their data volumes as a means to provide their service more broadly into developing markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/zero-rating-development-darling-or-net-neutrality-nemesis |title=Zero-rating: Development Darling or Net Neutrality Nemesis? |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |last=McDiarmid |first=Andrew |publisher=Knight News Challenge |date=March 18, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808054736/https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/zero-rating-development-darling-or-net-neutrality-nemesis |archivedate=August 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increased consumer demand for streaming content such as video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing, demand for bandwidth has increased rapidly and for some ISPs the flat rate pricing model may become unsustainable. However, with [[fixed costs]] estimated to represent 80–90% of the cost of providing broadband service, the marginal cost to carry additional traffic is low. Most ISPs do not disclose their costs, but the cost to transmit a gigabyte of data in 2011 was estimated to be about $0.03.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/gadgets-and-gear/hugh-thompson/what-is-a-fair-price-for-internet-service/article1890596/ "What is a fair price for Internet service?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209005530/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/gadgets-and-gear/hugh-thompson/what-is-a-fair-price-for-internet-service/article1890596/ |date=2012-02-09 }}, Hugh Thompson, ''Globe and Mail'' (Toronto), 1 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ISPs estimate that a small number of their users consume a disproportionate portion of the total bandwidth. In response some ISPs are considering, are experimenting with, or have implemented combinations of traffic based pricing, time of day or "peak" and "off peak" pricing, and bandwidth or traffic caps. Others claim that because the marginal cost of extra bandwidth is very small with 80 to 90 percent of the costs fixed regardless of usage level, that such steps are unnecessary or motivated by concerns other than the cost of delivering bandwidth to the end user.&lt;ref name=Hansell-2008&gt;{{cite news |first=Saul |last=Hansell |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/time-warner-download-too-much-and-you-might-pay-30-a-movie/?ref=technology |title=Time Warner: Download Too Much and You Might Pay $30 a Movie |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061232/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/time-warner-download-too-much-and-you-might-pay-30-a-movie/?ref=technology |archivedate=January 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comparebroadband.com.au/article_64_On--and-Off-Peak-Quotas.htm "On- and Off-Peak Quotas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331205209/http://www.comparebroadband.com.au/article_64_On--and-Off-Peak-Quotas.htm |date=2012-03-31 }}, Compare Broadband, 12 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leslie |last=Cauley |title=Comcast opens up about how it manages traffic |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=4692338&amp;page=1 |publisher=ABC News |date=April 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215205818/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4692338&amp;page=1 |archivedate=February 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet access has changed the way in which many people think and has become an integral part of peoples economic, political, and social lives.

In developing countries mobile broadband is often the only access method available.&lt;ref name=ITU-ITCFacts/&gt;

===Bandwidth divide===

Traditionally the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices ("have and have-not of subscriptions"). Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jp4w5rq | doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2016.01.006 | volume=40 | title=The bad news is that the digital access divide is here to stay: Domestically installed bandwidths among 172 countries for 1986–2014 | year=2016 | journal=Telecommunications Policy | pages=567–581 | last1=Hilbert | first1=Martin | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604191331/http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jp4w5rq | archivedate=2016-06-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/asi.23020 | volume=65 | title=Technological information inequality as an incessantly moving target: The redistribution of information and communication capacities between 1986 and 2010 | year=2013 | journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | pages=821–835 | last1=Hilbert | first1=Martin | url=http://martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027053254/http://www.martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | archivedate=2016-10-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing, but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, "the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s" increased digital inequality, as well as "the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality".&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).&lt;ref&gt;SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; {{cite web |url=http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307214246/http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the Figure, Internet access in terms of bandwidth is more unequally distributed in 2014 as it was in the mid-1990s.

=== In the United States ===
{{Main article|Internet in the United States}}

In the United States, billions of dollars have been invested in efforts to narrow the digital divide and bring Internet access to more people in low-income and rural areas of the United States. Internet availability varies widely state by state in the U.S. In 2011 for example, 87.1% of all [[New Hampshire]] residents lived in a household where Internet was available, ranking first in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Obama administration continued this commitment to narrowing the digital divide through the use of [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus funding]].&lt;ref name="McCollum-Spring2011" /&gt;  The [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reported that 98% of all U.S. classroom computers had Internet access in 2008 with roughly one computer with Internet access available for every three students.

===Rural access===
{{main article|Broadband universal service}}

One of the great challenges for Internet access in general and for broadband access in particular is to provide service to potential customers in areas of low [[population density]], such as to farmers, ranchers, and small towns. In cities where the population density is high, it is easier for a service provider to recover equipment costs, but each rural customer may require expensive equipment to get connected. While 66% of Americans had an Internet connection in 2010, that figure was only 50% in rural areas, according to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Home-Broadband-2010/Part-1/Broadband-adoption-among-African-Americans-grew-significantly-between-2009-and-2010.aspx |title=Trends in broadband adoption |work=Home Broadband 2010 |first=Aaron |last=Scott |publisher=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219195728/http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Home-Broadband-2010/Part-1/Broadband-adoption-among-African-Americans-grew-significantly-between-2009-and-2010.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative]] is the first program in North America to guarantee access to "100% of civic addresses" in a region. It is based on [[Motorola Canopy]] technology. As of November 2011, under 1000 households have reported access problems. Deployment of a new cell network by one Canopy provider ([[EastLink (company)|Eastlink]]) was expected to provide the alternative of 3G/4G service, possibly at a special unmetered rate, for areas harder to serve by Canopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/econ/broadband/ "Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519220248/http://www.gov.ns.ca/econ/broadband/ |date=2012-05-19 }}, Economic and Rural Development, Nova Scotia, Canada, access 27 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. We, the representatives of the peoples of the world, assembled in Geneva from 10–12 December 2003 for the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, declare our common desire and commitment to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life, premised on the purposes and principles of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and respecting fully and upholding the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

:3. We reaffirm the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the [[right to development]], as enshrined in the [[Vienna Declaration]]. We also reaffirm that [[democracy]], [[sustainable development]], and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We further resolve to strengthen the rule of law in international as in national affairs.

The [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] Declaration of Principles makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] in the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
:4. We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers."&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;

The 88 recommendations made by the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in a May 2011 report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] include several that bear on the question of the right to Internet access:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf "VI. Conclusions and recommendations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402152208/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}, ''Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue'', Human Rights Council, Seventeenth session
Agenda item 3, United Nations General Assembly, 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
:67. Unlike any other medium, the Internet enables individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds instantaneously and inexpensively across national borders. By vastly expanding the capacity of individuals to enjoy their right to freedom of opinion and expression, which is an “enabler” of other human rights, the Internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages other Special Procedures mandate holders to engage on the issue of the Internet with respect to their particular mandates.

:78. While blocking and filtering measures deny users access to specific content on the Internet, States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. The Special Rapporteur considers cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

:79. The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest.

:85. Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population.

===Network neutrality===
{{Net neutrality}}
{{main article |Net neutrality }}

Network neutrality (also net neutrality, Internet neutrality, or net equality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF|title=Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination|publisher=Journal on telecom and high tech law|author=Tim Wu|year=2003|accessdate=23 Apr 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424062409/http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF|archivedate=2014-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kraemer-def&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krämer | first1 = J | last2 = Wiewiorra | first2 = L. | last3 = Weinhardt | first3 = C. | year = 2013 | title = Net Neutrality: A progress report | url = http://www.im.uni-karlsruhe.de/Upload/Publications/336c39b3-7a62-4159-bb1a-483f39dd5b24.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 794–813 | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.08.005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6YjuB9cRc?url=http://www.im.uni-karlsruhe.de/Upload/Publications/336c39b3-7a62-4159-bb1a-483f39dd5b24.pdf | archivedate = 2015-05-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berners-lee-def"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/144 |title=Net Neutrality: This is serious |accessdate=26 December 2008 |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee |date=21 June 2006 |work=timbl's blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227100511/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/144 |archivedate=27 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nn-for-google-users"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url= https://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html |title=A Guide to Net Neutrality for Google Users |accessdate=7 December 2008 |publisher=[[Google]] |deadurl=yes |archivedate=1 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901084929/https://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of net neutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their [[last mile]] infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. 1999.

==Natural disasters and access==

Natural disasters disrupt internet access in profound ways. This is important—not only for telecommunication companies who own the networks and the businesses who use them, but for emergency crew and displaced citizens as well. The situation is worsened when hospitals or other buildings necessary to disaster response lose their connection. Knowledge gained from studying past internet disruptions by natural disasters could be put to use in planning or recovery. Additionally, because of both natural and man-made disasters, studies in network resiliency are now being conducted to prevent large-scale outages.&lt;ref name="omer"&gt;[http://www.stevens-tech.edu/csr/fileadmin/csr/Publications/Omer_Measuring_the_Resilience_of_the_Global_Internet__Infrastructure.pdf Measuring the Resilience of the Global Internet Infrastructure System]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2009 3rd Annual IEEE Systems Conference, 156–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

One way natural disasters impact internet connection is by damaging end sub-networks (subnets), making them unreachable. A study on local networks after [[Hurricane Katrina]] found that 26% of subnets within the storm coverage were unreachable.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee"&gt;[http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf Inference of Network-Service Disruption upon Natural Disasters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523173124/http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf |date=2013-05-23 }}, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At Hurricane Katrina’s peak intensity, almost 35% of networks in Mississippi were without power, while around 14% of Louisiana’s networks were disrupted.&lt;ref name="Katrina"&gt;[http://www.renesys.com/tech/presentations/pdf/Renesys-Katrina-Report-9sep2005.pdf Impact of Hurricane Katrina on Internet Infrastructure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115094240/http://www.renesys.com/tech/presentations/pdf/Renesys-Katrina-Report-9sep2005.pdf |date=2012-11-15 }}, Renesys Report, 9 September 2005, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those unreachable subnets, 73% were disrupted for four weeks or longer and 57% were at “network edges where important emergency organizations such as hospitals and government agencies are mostly located”.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee" /&gt; Extensive infrastructure damage and inaccessible areas were two explanations for the long delay in returning service.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee" /&gt; The company Cisco has revealed a Network Emergency Response Vehicle (NERV), a truck that makes portable communications possible for emergency responders despite traditional networks being disrupted.&lt;ref name="NERV"&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/business&amp;id=8867345 Cisco trucks help restore internet after disasters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303132941/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news%2Fbusiness&amp;id=8867345 |date=2013-03-03 }}, ABC News report, 30 October 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second way natural disasters destroy internet connectivity is by severing submarine cables—fiber-optic cables placed on the ocean floor that provide international internet connection. A [[2006 Hengchun earthquakes|sequence of undersea earthquakes]] cut six out of seven international cables connected to that country and caused a tsunami that wiped out one of its cable and landing stations.&lt;ref name="telkom"&gt;[http://www.telkom.co.id/media-corner/press-release/taiwan-s-earthquake-and-tsunami-caused-internet-access-s-interference.html Taiwan’s Earthquake and Tsunami Caused Internet access’s Interference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605104155/http://www.telkom.co.id/media-corner/press-release/taiwan-s-earthquake-and-tsunami-caused-internet-access-s-interference.html |date=2013-06-05 }}, Telkom Indonesia Press Release, 27 December 2006, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HKUST"&gt;[http://www.ust.hk/itsc/channel/2007feb/earthquake.html Impact of Taiwan Earthquake on Internet Access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228000932/http://www.ust.hk/itsc/channel/2007feb/earthquake.html |date=2008-12-28 }}, Choy, C.

''Telecommunications and Cybersecurity'', Noblis. Accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise in popularity of [[cloud computing]], concern has grown over access to cloud-hosted data in the event of a natural disaster. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been in the news for major network outages in April 2011 and June 2012.&lt;ref name="AWS2011"&gt;[http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/ Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907143711/https://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/ |date=2013-09-07 }}, AWS message, 29 April 2011, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWS2012"&gt;[https://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ Summary of the AWS Service Event in the US East Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724051708/http://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ |date=2013-07-24 }}, AWS message, 2 July 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; AWS, like other major cloud hosting companies, prepares for typical outages and large-scale natural disasters with backup power as well as backup data centers in other locations. AWS divides the globe into five regions and then splits each region into availability zones. A data center in one availability zone should be backed up by a data center in a different availability zone. Theoretically, a natural disaster would not affect more than one availability zone.&lt;ref name="justinsb"&gt;[http://justinsb.posterous.com/aws-down-why-the-sky-is-falling AWS is down: Why the sky is falling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223213308/http://justinsb.posterous.com/aws-down-why-the-sky-is-falling |date=2012-12-23 }}, justinsb's posterous, 21 April 2011, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory plays out as long as human error is not added to the mix. The June 2012 major storm only disabled the primary data center, but human error disabled the secondary and tertiary backups, affecting companies such as Netflix, Pinterest, Reddit, and Instagram.&lt;ref name="cloud"&gt;[http://cloud-computing-today.com/2012/06/18/amazon-web-services-june-2012-outage-explained/ Amazon Web Services June 2012 Outage Explained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718022121/http://cloud-computing-today.com/2012/06/18/amazon-web-services-june-2012-outage-explained/ |date=2012-07-18 }}, Cloud Computing Today, 18 June 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crashcloud"&gt;[http://crashcloud.com/will-natural-disasters-kill-cloud/ Will Natural Disasters Kill the Cloud?], CrashCloud, 21 August 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet censorship''' is the [[censorship|control or suppression]] of what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the [[Internet]] enacted by regulators, or on their own initiative. Individuals and organizations may engage in [[self-censorship]] for moral, religious, or business reasons, to conform to societal norms, due to intimidation, or out of fear of legal or other consequences.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181015"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=There May Soon Be Three Internets.

While most democratic countries have moderate Internet censorship, other countries go as far as to limit the access of information such as news and suppress discussion among citizens.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt; Internet censorship also occurs in response to or in anticipation of events such as elections, protests, and riots. An example is the increased censorship due to the events of the [[Arab Spring]]. Other areas of censorship include copyrights, defamation, harassment, and obscene material.

Support for and opposition to Internet censorship also varies. In a [[#Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey|2012 Internet Society survey]] 71% of respondents agreed that "censorship should exist in some form on the Internet". In the same survey 83% agreed that "access to the Internet should be considered a basic human right" and 86% agreed that "[[freedom of expression]] should be guaranteed on the Internet". Perception of internet censorship in the US is largely based on the First Amendment and the right for expansive free speech and access to content without regard to the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Erica|date=|title=FREE SPEECH CONSEQUENTIALISM|url=www.jstor.org/stable/43783393|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=116|pages=687-694|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[GlobalWebIndex]], over 400 million people use [[virtual private network]]s to circumvent censorship or for increased user privacy.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014"/&gt;

==Overview==
Many of the challenges associated with Internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, books, music, radio, television, and film. One difference is that national borders are more permeable online: residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on websites hosted outside the country. Thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves. This in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the Internet, such as site blocking and content filtering.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

Views about the feasibility and effectiveness of Internet censorship have evolved in parallel with the development of the Internet and censorship technologies:
* A 1993 ''Time Magazine'' article quotes computer scientist [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], one of the founders of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], as saying "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html "First Nation in Cyberspace"], Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ''Time'', 6 December 1993, No.49&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2007, "Father of the Internet" [[Vint Cerf]] stated that he sees government control of the Internet failing because the Web is almost entirely privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN1420689320071114?sp=true "Cerf sees government control of Internet failing"], Pedro Fonseca, Reuters, 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* A report of research conducted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University stated that: "We are confident that the [ [[censorship circumvention]] ] tool developers will for the most part keep ahead of the governments' blocking efforts", but also that "...we believe that less than two percent of all filtered Internet users use circumvention tools".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/2007_Circumvention_Landscape.pdf ''2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools''], Hal Roberts, Ethan Zuckerman, and John Palfrey, Beckman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, a 2011 report by researchers at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] published by [[UNESCO]] concludes "... the control of information on the Internet and Web is certainly feasible, and technological advances do not therefore guarantee greater freedom of speech."&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;
* Dr Shashi Tharoor in quarterly lecture series programme organized by a think tank based in India, Centre for Public Policy Research stated that "avenues of expressing our views and opinions having amplified multifold via digital media, freedom of expression comes immense responsibility"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2012/sep/15/tharoor-calls-for-caution-in-freedom-of-expression-406318.html|title=Tharoor calls for caution in freedom of expression|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Internet blocked in Iran.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Error message used to block content deemed harmful by government in Iran.]]

Blocking and filtering can be based on relatively static [[blacklist]]s or be determined more dynamically based on a real-time examination of the information being exchanged. Blacklists may be produced manually or automatically and are often not available to non-customers of the blocking software. Blocking or filtering can be done at a centralized national level, at a decentralized sub-national level, or at an institutional level, for example in libraries, universities or [[Internet cafes]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt; Blocking and filtering may also vary within a country across different ISPs.&lt;ref name=Chadwick-2009&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed. Chadwick| first = Andrew| title = Routledge handbook of Internet politics| publisher = Taylor and Francis| series = Routledge international handbooks| year = 2009| pages = 332 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_handbook_of_Internet_politics.html?id=GJdfuGSa1xUC| isbn = 978-0-415-42914-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries may filter sensitive content on an ongoing basis and/or introduce temporary filtering during key time periods such as elections. In some cases the censoring authorities may surreptitiously block content to mislead the public into believing that censorship has not been applied. This is achieved by returning a fake [[404 error|"Not Found"]] error message when an attempt is made to access a blocked website.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Unless the censor has total control over all Internet-connected computers, such as in [[Internet censorship in North Korea|North Korea]] (who employ an [[intranet]] that only privileged citizens can access), or [[Internet censorship in cuba|Cuba]], total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the Internet. [[Pseudonymity]] and [[data haven]]s (such as [[Freenet]]) protect [[free speech]] using technologies that guarantee material cannot be removed and prevents the identification of authors. Technologically savvy users can often find ways to access blocked content. Nevertheless, blocking remains an effective means of limiting access to sensitive information for most users when censors, such as those in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], are able to devote significant resources to building and maintaining a comprehensive censorship system.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

The term "[[splinternet]]" is sometimes used to describe the effects of national [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. The verb "[[River crab (Internet slang)|rivercrab]]" colloquially refers to censorship of the Internet, particularly in Asia.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lao Wai|title=I've Been Rivercrabbed!|work=An American In Beijing|date=21 October 2007|url=http://americaninbeijing.blogspot.com/2007/10/ive-been-rivercrabbed.html|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content suppression methods ==

===Technical censorship===

As per Hoffmann, different methods are used to block certain websites or pages including [[DNS poisoning]], blocking access to [[IP address|IP]]s, analyzing and [[URL|filtering URLs]], inspecting filter packets and resetting connections.&lt;ref name="howto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoffman |first1=Chris |title=How the “Great Firewall of China” Works to Censor China’s Internet |url=https://www.howtogeek.com/162092/htg-explains-how-the-great-firewall-of-china-works/ |website=https://www.howtogeek.com |publisher=How to geek |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Approaches====
Internet content is subject to technical censorship methods, including:&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of connection, freedom of expression: the changing legal and regulatory ecology shaping the Internet''], Dutton,  March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Internet Protocol (IP) address blocking''': Access to a certain [[IP address]] is denied. If the target Web site is hosted in a [[Shared web hosting service|shared hosting server]], all websites on the same server will be blocked. This affects IP-based protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Post Office Protocol|POP]]. A typical circumvention method is to find [[Proxy server|proxies]] that have access to the target websites, but proxies may be jammed or blocked, and some Web sites, such as Wikipedia (when editing), also block proxies. Some large websites such as [[Google]] have allocated additional IP addresses to circumvent the block, but later the block was extended to cover the new addresses. Due to challenges with [[geolocation]], [[geo-blocking]] is normally implemented via IP address blocking.
*'''Domain name system (DNS) filtering and redirection''': Blocked [[domain name]]s are not resolved, or an incorrect IP address is returned via [[DNS hijacking]] or other means. This affects all IP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP. A typical circumvention method is to find an alternative [[DNS resolver]] that resolves domain names correctly, but domain name servers are subject to blockage as well, especially IP address blocking. Another workaround is to bypass DNS if the IP address is obtainable from other sources and is not itself blocked. Examples are modifying the [[Hosts file]] or typing the IP address instead of the domain name as part of a URL given to a [[Web browser]].
*'''Uniform Resource Locator (URL) filtering''': [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] strings are scanned for target keywords regardless of the domain name specified in the URL. This affects the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] protocol. Typical circumvention methods are to use [[percent-encoding|escaped characters]] in the URL, or to use encrypted protocols such as [[Virtual private network|VPN]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS/SSL]].&lt;ref&gt;For an example, see [[Wikipedia:Advice to users using Tor to bypass the Great Firewall]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Packet filtering''': Terminate [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] transmissions when a certain number of controversial keywords are detected. This affects all TCP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP, but [[Search engine results page]]s are more likely to be censored. Typical circumvention methods are to use encrypted connections – such as VPN and TLS/SSL – to escape the HTML content, or by reducing the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] [[Protocol stack|stack]]'s [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]]/[[Maximum segment size|MSS]] to reduce the amount of text contained in a given packet.
*'''Connection reset''': If a previous [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection is blocked by the filter, future connection attempts from both sides can also be blocked for some variable amount of time. Depending on the location of the block, other users or websites may also be blocked, if the communication is [[Routing|routed]] through the blocking location. A circumvention method is to ignore the reset packet sent by the firewall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/security/0,39044215,39372326,00.htm|title=Topics - ZDNet|work=ZDNet|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Network disconnection''': A technically simpler method of Internet censorship is to completely cut off all routers, either by software or by hardware (turning off machines, pulling out cables). This appears to have been the case on 27/28 January 2011 during the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], in what has been widely described as an "unprecedented" internet block.&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowie |first=James |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys |url=http://research.dyn.com/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet/ |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga?url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDGnews_Egyptfullblock"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy |last=Kirk |title=With Wired Internet Locked, Egypt Looks to the Sky |date=28 January 2011 |publisher=IDG News/[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/218064/with_wired_internet_locked_egypt_looks_to_the_sky.html |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w518Yu9B?url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/218064/with_wired_internet_locked_egypt_looks_to_the_sky.html |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 3500 [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) routes to Egyptian networks were shut down from about 22:10 to 22:35 UTC 27 January.&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock" /&gt; This full block was implemented without cutting off major intercontinental [[fibre optics|fibre-optic]] links, with Renesys stating on 27 January, "Critical European-Asian fiber-optic routes through Egypt appear to be unaffected for now."&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock" /&gt; Full blocks also occurred in [[Internet censorship in Myanmar|Myanmar/Burma]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opennet.net/research/bulletins/013|title=Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma|work=opennet.net|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] in 2011,&lt;ref name=Libya-RWB-2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalists confined to their hotels, Internet disconnected|url=http://en.rsf.org/journalists-confined-to-their-04-03-2011,39681.html|work=Journalists confined to their hotels, Internet disconnected|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Internet censorship in Syria|Syria]] during the [[Syrian civil war]]. A circumvention method could be to use a satellite ISP to access Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/ingenious-way-iranians-using-satellite-tv-beam-banned-data/|title=The Ingenious Way Iranians Are Using Satellite TV to Beam in Banned Internet|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Portal censorship''' and '''search result removal''': Major portals, including [[search engine]]s, may exclude web sites that they would ordinarily include. This renders a site invisible to people who do not know where to find it. When a major portal does this, it has a similar effect as censorship. Sometimes this exclusion is done to satisfy a legal or other requirement, other times it is purely at the discretion of the portal. For example, [https://www.google.com/ Google.de] and [https://www.google.com/ Google.fr] remove [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] and other listings in compliance with German and French law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/google-excluding-controversial-sites/ Google excluding controversial sites], Declan McCullagh, CNET News, 23 October 2002, 8:55&amp;nbsp;pm PDT. Retrieved 22 April 2007 00:40 UTC&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Computer network attacks''': [[Denial-of-service attack]]s and attacks that deface opposition websites can produce the same result as other blocking techniques, preventing or limiting access to certain websites or other online services, although only for a limited period of time. This technique might be used during the lead up to an election or some other sensitive period. It is more frequently used by non-state actors seeking to disrupt services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/emergence-open-and-organized-pro-government-cyber-attacks-middle-east-case-syrian-electronic-army "The Emergence of Open and Organized Pro-Government Cyber Attacks in the Middle East: The Case of the Syrian Electronic Army"], Helmi Noman, OpenNet Initiative, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Over- and under-blocking====
Technical censorship techniques are subject to both over- and under-blocking since it is often impossible to always block exactly the targeted content without blocking other permissible material or allowing some access to targeted material and so providing more or less protection than desired.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt; An example is blocking an IP-address of a server that hosts multiple websites, which prevents access to all of the websites rather than just those that contain content deemed offensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/24/india_blocks_yahoo_groups/ "India blocks Yahoo! Groups"], Andrew Orlowski, The Register, 24 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Use of commercial filtering software ====

Writing in 2009 [[Ronald Deibert]], professor of political science at the [[University of Toronto]] and co-founder and one of the principal investigators of the [[OpenNet Initiative]], and, writing in 2011, Evgeny Morzov, a visiting scholar at [[Stanford University]] and an Op-Ed contributor to the ''[[New York Times]]'', explain that companies in the United States, Finland, France, Germany, Britain, Canada, and South Africa are in part responsible for the increasing sophistication of online content filtering worldwide. While the off-the-shelf [[filtering software]] sold by Internet security companies are primarily marketed to businesses and individuals seeking to protect themselves and their employees and families, they are also used by governments to block what they consider sensitive content.&lt;ref name=Chadwick2009-1&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

Among the most popular filtering software programs is [[SmartFilter]] by [[Secure Computing]] in California, which was bought by [[McAfee]] in 2008. SmartFilter has been used by [[Tunisia]], Saudi Arabia, [[Sudan]], the [[UAE]], Kuwait, [[Bahrain]], Iran, and [[Oman]], as well as the United States and the UK.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |work=The Guardian  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myanmar]] and [[Yemen]] have used filtering software from [[Websense]].

On 12 March 2013 in a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance'', Reporters Without Borders named five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet": [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[FinFisher|Gamma]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany). The companies sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. RWB said that the list is not exhaustive and will be expanded in the coming months.&lt;ref name="RSFSRS-March2013"/&gt;

In a U.S. lawsuit filed in May 2011, [[Cisco Systems]] is accused of helping the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese Government]] build a firewall, known widely as the [[Golden Shield]], to censor the Internet and keep tabs on dissidents. Cisco said it had made nothing special for China. Cisco is also accused of aiding the Chinese government in monitoring and apprehending members of the banned [[Falun Gong]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/technology/group-says-it-has-new-evidence-of-ciscos-misdeeds-in-china.html "Group Says It Has New Evidence of Cisco’s Misdeeds in China"], Somini Sengupta, ''New York Times'', 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Many filtering programs allow blocking to be configured based on dozens of categories and sub-categories such as these from Websense: "abortion" (pro-life, pro-choice), "adult material" (adult content, lingerie and swimsuit, nudity, sex, sex education), "advocacy groups" (sites that promote change or reform in public policy, public opinion, social practice, economic activities, and relationships), "drugs" (abused drugs, marijuana, prescribed medications, supplements and unregulated compounds), "religion" (non-traditional religions occult and folklore, traditional religions), ....&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt; The blocking categories used by the filtering programs may contain errors leading to the unintended blocking of websites.&lt;ref name=Chadwick2009-1/&gt; The blocking of [[DailyMotion]] in early 2007 by Tunisian authorities was, according to the [[OpenNet Initiative]], due to Secure Computing wrongly categorizing DailyMotion as pornography for its SmartFilter filtering software. It was initially thought that Tunisia had blocked DailyMotion due to satirical videos about human rights violations in Tunisia, but after Secure Computing corrected the mistake access to DailyMotion was gradually restored in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

Organizations such as the [[Global Network Initiative]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Amnesty International]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] have successfully lobbied some vendors such as [[Websense]] to make changes to their software, to refrain from doing business with repressive governments, and to educate schools who have inadvertently reconfigured their filtering software too strictly.&lt;ref name="riaclu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.riaclu.org/20050418.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070114/http://www.riaclu.org/20050418.html | title = R.I.

Vendors often consider information about what sites and content is blocked valuable intellectual property that is not made available outside the company, sometimes not even to the organizations purchasing the filters. Thus by relying upon out-of-the-box filtering systems, the detailed task of deciding what is or is not acceptable speech may be outsourced to the commercial vendors.&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt;

===Non-technical censorship===
{{Main |Censorship}}

Internet content is also subject to censorship methods similar to those used with more traditional media. For example:&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;
* Laws and regulations may prohibit various types of content and/or require that content be removed or blocked either proactively or in response to requests.
* Publishers, authors, and ISPs may receive formal and informal requests to remove, alter, slant, or block access to specific sites or content.
* Publishers and authors may accept [[bribe]]s to include, withdraw, or slant the information they present.
* Publishers, authors, and ISPs may be subject to arrest, criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment.
* Publishers, authors, and ISPs may be subject to [[civil lawsuit]]s.
* Equipment may be [[confiscation|confiscated]] and/or destroyed.
* Publishers and ISPs may be closed or required licenses may be withheld or revoked.
* Publishers, authors, and ISPs may be subject to [[boycott]]s.

Most major web service operators reserve to themselves broad rights to remove or pre-screen content, sometimes without giving a specific list or only a vague general list of the reasons allowing the removal. The phrases "at our sole discretion", "without prior notice", and "for other reasons" are common in Terms of Service agreements. On 06 August 2018, for example, several major platforms, including [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]], executed a coordinated, permanent ban on all accounts and media associated with conservative talk show host, Alex Jones, and his popular media platform, InfoWars, citing "hate speech" and "glorifying violence."&lt;ref&gt;

==Circumvention==
{{Main|Internet censorship circumvention}}

Internet censorship circumvention is the processes used by technologically savvy Internet users to bypass the technical aspects of Internet filtering and gain access to the otherwise censored material. Circumvention is an inherent problem for those wishing to censor the Internet because filtering and blocking do not remove content from the Internet, but instead block access to it.  Therefore, as long as there is at least one publicly accessible uncensored system, it will often be possible to gain access to the otherwise censored material. However circumvention may not be possible by non-tech-savvy users, so blocking and filtering remain effective means of censoring the Internet access of large numbers of users.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

Different techniques and resources are used to bypass Internet censorship, including [[Proxy server|proxy websites]], [[virtual private network]]s, [[sneakernet]]s, and circumvention software tools. Solutions have differing ease of use, speed, security, and risks. Most, however, rely on gaining access to an Internet connection that is not subject to filtering, often in a different jurisdiction not subject to the same censorship laws. According to [[GlobalWebIndex]], over 400 million people use virtual private networks to circumvent censorship or for an increased level of privacy.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014"/&gt; The majority of circumvention techniques are not suitable for day to day use.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, H., Zuckerman, E., &amp; Palfrey, J. (2009, March). 2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools (Rep.). Retrieved March 18, 2016, from The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are risks to using circumvention software or other methods to bypass Internet censorship. In some countries, individuals that gain access to otherwise restricted content may be violating the law and if caught can be expelled, fired, jailed, or subject to other punishments and loss of access.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cship.org/wiki/Risks "Risks"], ''Internet censorship wiki''. Retrieved 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 the ''New York Times'' reported that the U.S. is engaged in a "global effort to deploy 'shadow' Internet and mobile phone systems that dissidents can use to undermine repressive governments that seek to silence them by censoring or shutting down telecommunications networks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html?pagewanted=all "U.S. Underwrites Internet Detour Around Censors"], James Glanz and John Markoff, ''New York Times'', 12 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to circumvent Internet censorship is to physically go to an area where the Internet is not censored. In 2017 a so-called "Internet refugee camp" was established by IT workers in the village of Bonako, just outside an area of Cameroon where the Internet is regularly blocked.&lt;ref&gt;https://qz.com/942879/an-internet-shutdown-in-cameroon-has-forced-startups-to-create-an-internet-refugee-camp-in-bonako-village/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/cameroon-internet-shutdowns-cost-anglophones-millions-180123202824701.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common targets==
There are several motives or rationales for Internet filtering: politics and power, social norms and morals, and security concerns. Protecting existing economic interests is an additional emergent motive for Internet filtering. In addition, networking tools and applications that allow the sharing of information related to these motives are themselves subjected to filtering and blocking. And while there is considerable variation from country to country, the blocking of web sites in a local language is roughly twice that of web sites available only in English or other international languages.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008&gt;[http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/Deibert_02_Ch01_005-028.pdf "Measuring Global Internet Filtering"], Robert Faris and Nart Villeneuve, in [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 ''Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226100258/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 |date=26 February 2009 }}, Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain, eds., MIT Press (Cambridge), 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and power===
Censorship directed at political opposition to the ruling government is common in authoritarian and repressive regimes. Some countries block web sites related to religion and minority groups, often when these movements represent a threat to the ruling regimes.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* Political blogs and web sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/Blog-censorship-gains-support/2100-1028_3-5670096.html |title=Blog censorship gains support |work=CNET |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Lèse majesté]]'' sites, sites with content that offends the dignity of or challenges the authority of a reigning [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or of a [[Sovereign state|state]]
* [[Falun Gong]] and [[Tibetan exile]] group sites in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]] or [[Buddhist]], [[Cao Dai]] faith, and indigenous [[Hill tribes#South-East Asia|hill tribes]] sites in [[Internet censorship in Vietnam|Vietnam]]
* Sites aimed at religious conversion from Islam to Christianity&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;
* Sites criticizing the government or an authority in the country&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that comment on political parties that oppose the current government of a country&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that accuse authorities of corruption&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that comment on minorities or [[LGBT]] issues&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;

===Social norms===
Social filtering is censorship of topics that are held to be antithetical to accepted societal norms.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt; In particular censorship of [[child pornography]] and to [[think of the children|protect children]] enjoys very widespread public support and such content is subject to censorship and other restrictions in most countries.

Examples include:
* Sites that include [[hate speech]] inciting [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], or other forms of bigotry
* Sites seen as promoting [[Substance abuse|illegal drug use]] ([[Erowid]]){{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* [[Eroticism|Sex and erotic]], [[fetishism]], prostitution, and [[Anti-pornography movement|pornographic]] sites
* [[Child pornography]] and [[pedophile]] related sites (see also [[CIRCAMP]])
* Gambling sites
* Sites encouraging or inciting violence&lt;ref name=time20151123&gt;{{cite magazine |title=WHAT IT TAKES TO FORGIVE A KILLER |magazine=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2015-11-23 |url=http://backissues.time.com/storefront/2015/what-it-takes-to-forgive-a-killer/prodTD20151123.html |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sites promoting criminal activity&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* [[Communist]] symbols and imagery in [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Latvia]], [[Moldova]], and [[Hungary]]
* [[Nazism|Nazi]] and similar websites, particularly in [[Internet censorship in France|France]] and [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22885402-12335,00.html |title=Latest Stories From News.Com.Au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sites that contain [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] content, particularly when directed at a majority or state supported religion&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that contain [[Defamation|defamatory, slanderous, or libelous]] content&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that include [[political satire]]&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that contain information on social issues or "online protests, petitions and campaigns"&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;

===Security concerns===
Many organizations implement filtering as part of a [[defense in depth (computing)|defense in depth]] strategy to protect their environments from [[malware]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/id=747218 |publisher=[[Gartner]] |title=Why Malware Filtering Is Necessary in the Web Gateway |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to protect their reputations in the event of their networks being used, for example, to carry out sexual harassment.

Internet filtering related to threats to [[national security]] that targets the Web sites of [[insurgents]], [[extremists]], and terrorists often enjoys wide public support.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* [[North Korean websites banned in South Korea|Blocking of pro–North Korean sites by South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/bulletins/009/ "Collateral Blocking: Filtering by South Korean Government of Pro-North Korean Websites"], OpenNet Initiative: Bulletin 009, 31 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking sites of groups that foment domestic conflict in [[Internet censorship in India|India]]
* Blocking of sites of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in some countries in the Middle East
* Blocking [[WikiLeaks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Australia_secretly_censors_Wikileaks_press_release_and_Danish_Internet_censorship_list%2C_16_Mar_2009 |title=Australia secretly censors Wikileaks press release and Danish Internet censorship list |date=16 March 2009 |work=wikileaks.org |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking sites such as [[4chan]] thought to be related to the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-authorities-take-on-anonymous-hackers/2011/09/11/gIQAYrhgMK_story.html "Federal authorities take on Anonymous hackers"], Associated Press in the Washington Post, 12 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection of existing economic interests and copyright===
The protection of existing economic interests is sometimes the motivation for blocking new Internet services such as low-cost telephone services that use [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP). These services can reduce the customer base of telecommunications companies, many of which enjoy entrenched monopoly positions and some of which are government sponsored or controlled.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

[[Anti-copyright]] activists [[Christian Engström]], [[Rick Falkvinge]] and [[Oscar Swartz]] have alleged that censorship of child pornography is being used as a pretext by copyright lobby organizations to get politicians to implement similar site blocking legislation against copyright-related piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/the-copyright-lobby-absolutely-loves-child-pornography-110709/ |title=The Copyright Lobby Absolutely Loves Child Pornography |author=[[Rick Falkvinge]] |date=9 July 2011 |work=[[TorrentFreak]] |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include:
* [[File sharing]] and [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) related websites such as [[The Pirate Bay]]
* [[Skype]]
* Sites that sell or distribute music, but are not 'approved' by rights holders, such as [[allofmp3]]

===Network tools===
Blocking the intermediate tools and applications of the Internet that can be used to assist users in accessing and sharing sensitive material is common in many countries.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* Media sharing websites (e.g. [[Flickr]] and [[Censorship of YouTube|YouTube]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2007/03/11/youtube-blocked-inthailand/ |title=YouTube Blocked in...Thailand |date=11 March 2007 |work=Mashable |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Right to be forgotten}}

The ''right to be forgotten'' is a concept that has been discussed and put into practice in the [[European Union]]. In May 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled against [[Google]] in ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'', a case brought by a Spanish man who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in ''La Vanguardia'' newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain |title=What we can salvage from 'right to be forgotten' ruling |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=15 May 2014 |accessdate=16 May 2014 |author=Julia Powles |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516024112/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain |archivedate=16 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially attempted to have the article removed by complaining to Spain's data protection agency—''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos''—which rejected the claim on the grounds that it was lawful and accurate, but accepted a complaint against Google and asked Google to remove the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Solon |first=Olivia |title=People have the right to be forgotten, rules EU court |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling |work=Wired.co.uk |publisher=Conde Nast Digital |accessdate=13 May 2014 |date=13 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514071400/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling |archivedate=14 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google sued in Spain and the lawsuit was transferred to the European Court of Justice.

[[Index on Censorship]] claimed that "''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' ruling ... allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight. This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books. Although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history....The Court’s decision is a retrograde move that misunderstands the role and responsibility of search engines and the wider internet.

As more people in more places begin using the Internet for important activities, there is an increase in online censorship, using increasingly sophisticated techniques. The motives, scope, and effectiveness of Internet censorship vary widely from country to country. The countries engaged in state-mandated filtering are clustered in three main regions of the world: east Asia, central Asia, and the [[MENA|Middle East/North Africa]].

Countries in other regions also practice certain forms of filtering. In the [[Internet censorship in the United States|United States]] state-mandated Internet filtering occurs on some computers in libraries and [[K-12 schools]]. Content related to [[Nazism]] or [[Holocaust denial]] is blocked in [[Internet censorship in France|France]] and [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]].

The government blocks Web sites that discuss the [[Dalai Lama]], the 1989 crackdown on [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protesters]], the banned spiritual practice [[Falun Gong]], as well as many general Internet sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet Censorship in China|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/internet_censorship/index.html|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government requires Internet search firms and state media to censor issues deemed officially “sensitive,” and blocks access to foreign websites including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=World Report 2012: China|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-china|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a recent study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=G. King|title=Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation|journal=Science|doi= 10.1126/science.1251722 |date=22 August 2014|volume= 345 |issue= 6199 |page=891|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6199/1251722|display-authors=etal |pmid=25146296}}&lt;/ref&gt; censorship in China is used to muzzle those outside government who attempt to spur the creation of crowds for any reason—in opposition to, in support of, or unrelated to the government. The government allows the Chinese people to say whatever they like about the state, its leaders, or their policies, because talk about any subject unconnected to collective action is not censored. The value that Chinese leaders find in allowing and then measuring criticism by hundreds of millions of Chinese people creates actionable information for them and, as a result, also for academic scholars and public policy analysts.

There are international bodies that oppose internet censorship, for example "Internet censorship is open to challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) as it can restrict trade in online services, a forthcoming study argues".&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/217137198 WTO could challenge Internet censorship Anonymous. Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom 59(1) (Jan 2010): 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed country by country information on Internet censorship is provided by the [[OpenNet Initiative]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Freedom House]], and in the [[U.S. State Department]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]'s ''Human Rights Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm "2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings produced by several of these organizations are summarized in the [[Internet censorship by country]] and the [[Censorship by country]] articles.

====OpenNet Initiative reports====
Through 2010 the OpenNet Initiative had documented Internet filtering by governments in over forty countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt; The level of filtering in 26 countries in 2007 and in 25 countries in 2009 was classified in the political, social, and security areas. Of the 41 separate countries classified, seven were found to show no evidence of filtering in all three areas ([[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Internet censorship in France|France]], [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]], [[Internet censorship in India|India]], [[Human rights in Ukraine#Media Freedom and Freedom of Information|Ukraine]], [[Internet censorship in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and [[Internet censorship in the United States|United States]]), while one was found to engage in pervasive filtering in all three areas ([[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]]), 13 were found to engage in pervasive filtering in one or more areas, and 34 were found to engage in some level of filtering in one or more areas. Of the 10 countries classified in both 2007 and 2009, one reduced its level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in Pakistan|Pakistan]]), five increased their level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Internet censorship in Belarus|Belarus]], [[Internet censorship in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Internet censorship in South Korea|South Korea]], and [[Internet censorship in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]]), and four maintained the same level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Internet censorship in Iran|Iran]], [[Internet censorship in Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[Human rights in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=ONIChildPornLegal&gt;Due to legal concerns the [[OpenNet Initiative]] does not check for filtering of [[child pornography]] and because their classifications focus on technical filtering, they do not include other types of censorship.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom on the Net reports====

The ''Freedom on the Net'' reports from [[Freedom House]] provide analytical reports and numerical ratings regarding the state of [[Digital rights|Internet freedom]] for countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2018/&gt; The countries surveyed represent a sample with a broad range of geographical diversity and levels of economic development, as well as varying levels of political and media freedom. The surveys ask a set of questions designed to measure each country's level of Internet and digital media freedom, as well as the access and openness of other digital means of transmitting information, particularly mobile phones and text messaging services. Results are presented for three areas: Obstacles to Access, Limits on Content, and Violations of User Rights.
The results from the three areas are combined into a total score for a country (from 0 for best to 100 for worst) and countries are rated as "Free" (0 to 30), "Partly Free" (31 to 60), or "Not Free" (61 to 100) based on the totals.

Starting in 2009 Freedom House has produced nine editions of the report.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2009&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20OnThe%20Net_Full%20Report.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2009''], Freedom House, accessed 16 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2011&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2011 ''Freedom on the Net 2011''], Freedom House, accessed 15 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2012&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/FOTN%202012%20FINAL.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2012''], Freedom House, accessed 24 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2013&gt;[http://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013_Full%20Report_0.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2013''], Freedom House, 3 October 2013.

The 2014 report assessed 65 countries and reported that 36 countries experienced a negative trajectory in Internet freedom since the previous year, with the most significant declines in [[Internet censorship in Russia|Russia]], [[Censorship in Turkey#Internet censorship|Turkey]] and [[Internet in Ukraine#Internet censorship and surveillance|Ukraine]]. According to the report, few countries demonstrated any gains in Internet freedom, and the improvements that were recorded reflected less vigorous application of existing controls rather than new steps taken by governments to actively increase Internet freedom. The year's largest improvement was recorded in [[Internet censorship in India|India]], where restrictions to content and access were relaxed from what had been imposed in 2013 to stifle rioting in the northeastern states. Notable improvement was also recorded in [[Censorship in Brazil#Internet freedom|Brazil]], where lawmakers approved the bill [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Marco Civil da Internet]], which contains significant provisions governing net neutrality and safeguarding privacy protection.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2014/&gt;

=====RWB ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''=====
On 12 March 2013, [[Reporters_Without_Borders|Reporters Without Borders]] published a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=31 August 2013 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The report includes two new lists: 
* a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights; and
* a list of "Corporate Enemies of the Internet", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information.

The five "State Enemies of the Internet" named in March 2013 are: [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet" named in March 2013 are: [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[Gamma International]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany).&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

====BBC World Service global public opinion poll====
A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users,&lt;ref&gt;For the BBC poll Internet users are those who used the Internet within the previous six months.&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted for the [[BBC World Service]] by the international polling firm [[GlobeScan]] using telephone and in-person interviews between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010. GlobeScan Chairman Doug Miller felt, overall, that the poll showed that:
:Despite worries about privacy and fraud, people around the world see access to the internet as their fundamental right. They think the web is a force for good, and most don’t want governments to regulate it.&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf "BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from the poll include:&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010/&gt;
*Nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom.
*Most Internet users (53%) felt that "the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere".
*Opinion was evenly split between Internet users who felt that “the internet is a safe place to express my opinions” (48%) and those who disagreed (49%). Somewhat surprisingly users in [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]] and [[Internet censorship in France|France]] agreed the least, followed by users in a highly filtered country such as [[Internet Censorship in China|China]], while users in [[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Internet censorship in India|India]] and [[Internet in Kenya|Kenya]] agreed more strongly.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;
*The aspects of the Internet that cause the most concern include: fraud (32%), violent and explicit content (27%), threats to [[internet privacy|privacy]] (20%), state censorship of content (6%), and the extent of corporate presence (3%).
*Almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm "Internet access is 'a fundamental right'"], ''BBC News'', 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; And while there is strong support for this right in all of the countries surveyed, it is surprising that the United States and Canada were among the top five countries where people most strongly disagreed that access to the Internet was a fundamental right of all people (13% in [[Human rights in Japan#Civil liberties|Japan]], 11% in the [[Internet censorship in the United States|U.S.]], 11% in [[Internet in Kenya|Kenya]], 11% in [[Internet censorship in Pakistan|Pakistan]], and 10% in [[Internet censorship in Canada|Canada]] strongly disagree).&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

====Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey====
In July and August 2012 the [[Internet Society]] conducted online interviews of more than 10,000 Internet users in 20 countries. Some of the results relevant to Internet censorship are summarized below.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/GIUS2012-GlobalData-Table-20121120_0.pdf "Global Internet User Survey 2012"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314063616/https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/GIUS2012-GlobalData-Table-20121120_0.pdf |date=14 March 2013 }}, Internet Society, 20 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency of filtering or blocking activities===
Among the countries that filter or block online content, few openly admit to or fully disclose their filtering and blocking activities. States are frequently opaque and/or deceptive about the blocking of access to political information.&lt;ref name=Chadwick-2009/&gt; For example:
* [[Internet censorship in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Internet in the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) are among the few states that publish detailed information about their filtering practices and display a notification to the user when attempting to access a blocked website. The websites that are blocked are mostly [[Pornographic]] and against the respective states and/or the Islamic Religion.
* In contrast, countries such as [[Internet censorship in China|China]] and [[Internet censorship in Tunisia|Tunisia]] send users a false error indication. China blocks requests by users for a banned website at the [[Transport layer|router level]] and a connection error is returned, effectively preventing the user's [[IP address]] from making further [[HTTP]] requests for a varying time, which appears to the user as "time-out" error with no explanation. Tunisia has altered the block page functionality of [[SmartFilter]], the commercial filtering software it uses, so that users attempting to access blocked websites receive a fake "File not found" error page.

===Arab Spring===

During the [[Arab Spring]] of 2011, media [[jihad]] (media struggle) was extensive. Internet and mobile technologies, particularly social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, played and are playing important new and unique roles in organizing and spreading the protests and making them visible to the rest of the world. An activist in Egypt tweeted, “we use Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ "The Arab Spring’s Cascading Effects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051329/http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |date=27 February 2011 }}, Philip N. Howard, Miller-McCune, 23 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This successful use of digital media in turn led to increased censorship including the complete loss of Internet access for periods of time in Egypt&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDGnews_Egyptfullblock"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://monkey.org/~labovit/blog//viewpage.php?page=middle_east_scorecard_feb20 "Middle East Political Protest And Internet Traffic Report: February 12–20, 2011"], Craig Labovitz, Arbor Networks&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=Libya-RWB-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Analysis of Egyptian and Libyan outages"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2011/outages_censorship/outages_censorship.pdf| title=Analysis of Country-wide Internet Outages Caused by Censorship|last=Dainotti|year=2011| publisher=ACM|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Syria, the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), an organization that operates with at least tacit support of the government, claims responsibility for defacing or otherwise compromising scores of websites that it contends spread news hostile to the Syrian government. SEA disseminates denial of service (DoS) software designed to target media websites including those of [[Al Jazeera]], [[BBC News]], Syrian satellite broadcaster [[Orient TV]], and Dubai-based [[Al Arabiya]] TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/syrian-electronic-army-disruptive-attacks-and-hyped-targets "Syrian Electronic Army: Disruptive Attacks and Hyped Targets"], OpenNet Initiative, 25 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the greater freedom of expression brought about by the Arab Spring revolutions in countries that were previously subject to very strict censorship, in March 2011, Reporters Without Borders moved [[Internet censorship in Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]] from its "Internet enemies" list to its list of countries "under surveillance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-egypt,39740.html "Countries under surveillance: Egypt"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060153/http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-egypt,39740.html |date=4 March 2016 }}, Reporters Without Borders, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 dropped [[Free speech in the media during the Libyan civil war|Libya]] from the list entirely.&lt;ref name=RWBEnemies2012/&gt;&lt;!-- defined by template:RWB Internet lists --&gt; At the same time, there were warnings that Internet censorship might increase in other countries following the events of the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future500.org/blog/censorship-fallout-from-the-arab-spring/ "Censorship fallout from the Arab Spring?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126060054/http://www.future500.org/blog/censorship-fallout-from-the-arab-spring/ |date=26 January 2012 }}, Juliette Terzieff, The Future 500, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCATRE78R3CM20110928?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 "Insight: Social media – a political tool for good or evil?"], Peter Apps, Reuters Canada, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2013, Libyan communication company [[Libya Telecom &amp; Technology|LTT]] blocked the pornographic websites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2013/09/13/ltt-blocks-pornographic-websites/ LTT Blocks Pornographic Websites]&lt;/ref&gt; It even blocked the family-filtered videos of ordinary websites like [[Dailymotion]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

{{UStaxation}}
In 1996, several U.S. states and municipalities began to see [[Internet]] services as a potential source of tax revenue.

The 1998 [[Internet Tax Freedom Act]] halted the expansion of direct taxation of the Internet, grandfathering existing taxes in ten states.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Internet Tax Freedom Act]]'', 47 U.S.C. § 151 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States alone, some 30,000 taxing jurisdictions could otherwise have laid claim to [[tax]]es on a piece of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Taxation'' [http://www-pps.aas.duke.edu/centers/dewitt/course/internetandsociety/taxation/index.html] published by [[Duke University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law, however, did not affect sales taxes applied to online purchases. These continue to be taxed at varying rates depending on the jurisdiction, in the same way that phone and mail orders are taxed.

==Forms of Internet taxation==

===Internet access tax===
Internet access taxes normally take the form of taxation on [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) access charges. ISPs levy these charges on users. Currently, these fees are typically imposed at the state level. There is no national tax on ISP user charges.  No uniform description of Internet access taxes is possible; they fall within the category of [[sales tax]]es in some states, and [[telecommunications]] taxes in others; and they are considered service charges, which are usually exempt from taxation, in still other states. Ten states (which were grandfathered under the Internet Tax Freedom Act as part of a political compromise) are allowed to provide for some manner of taxation on ISP charges.  The ten states are Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington &amp; Wisconsin.  Under the grandfather clause included in the Internet Tax Freedom Act, Texas is currently collecting a tax on Internet access charges over $25.00 per month.  Texas collected tax on internet access prior to the enactment of ITFA under the "Taxables Services" provision of its Tax Code, see older § 151.0101(a).  Texas has refined its tax code to define "Internet access service", include it under "Taxable Services" and exempted the first $25.00 on a monthly basis, See current Texas Tax Code § 151.325 &amp; 151.0101(a)

====E-mail tax====
E-mail tax is a specific type of bit-tax, which would tax based on volume of email sent or received, quantified either by number of messages or data size of the messages.
This type of tax was mentioned in a 1999 report by the [[United Nations]] Development Program entitled "Globalization With a Human Face", as a type of bit tax which would raise an estimated $70 billion (US) if implemented globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_1999_EN.pdf UNDP Human Development Report 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; The e-mail tax has been the subject of numerous internet and political hoaxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/internet/04/01/e.mail.hoax/ | work=CNN | title=Tax on e-mail? Long-running hoax endures | date=April 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirednews.com/news/culture/0%2C1284%2C38418%2C00.html No, Newbies, There's No Email Tax&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Imposition of [[e-mail]] taxes by the U.S. government or any of its political subdivisions is banned by the Internet Tax Freedom Act.

==Conceptual issues==
Beyond the questions of direct taxation of Internet access through levies such as bit taxes, bandwidth taxes, email taxes, and franchise fees, a related issue concerns the imposition of sales taxes on [[Internet]] sales of goods and services. This taxation is not prohibited by federal statute, but rather by a series of [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions including ''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;504 U.S. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those cases held that state [[taxation]] of in-state sales by vendors with no significant physical presence in the state violates the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]].  Because of this constitutional prohibition on collecting [[sales tax]] from so-called "remote" sales on the Internet, the issue of local jurisdictions taxing goods and services purchased from out of state by their residents using the Internet has not yet raised the conceptual questions discussed below. See [[tax-free shopping]].''

===Location===
The issue of location&amp;mdash;of the Internet user, the user's counterparties in a commercial transaction, the headquarters facilities of any involved commercial entities, and even the servers and switches&amp;mdash;is important for tax purposes. For example, of the nine U.S. states that currently tax access in some manner, four make reference to location.  In each case, both the provision of service and the billing must take place within the state. [[Connecticut]] places the burden of determining whether this is so upon the [[Internet service provider]]. But in general, there is no simple way to determine location, owing largely to the Internet's lack of boundaries. Users can and routinely do access their accounts from remote locations; providers are almost always located in multiple taxing jurisdictions; and the data traffic itself, via the Internet's packet-switched architecture, is routed through myriad locations.  Such issues are important not only for practical reasons of determining the incidence of the tax and its enforcement, but also because the [[U.S. Constitution]] requires that a state or taxing sub-jurisdiction have "nexus" with the transaction in order to exert its taxing power, and that determination rests precisely upon such considerations.&lt;ref&gt;''See Quill Corp. v. North Dakota'', 504 U.S. 298 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setup v. monthly fee===
In the United States, some states and taxing authorities distinguish between the initial setup fee for Internet access and the monthly, hourly, or per-minute billing fee for actual access. [[Nebraska]] taxes the initial setup, but only if software is provided. It does not tax subsequent monthly billing. [[Tennessee]], on the other hand, taxes both.

===Good vs. service===
A basic issue in determining whether Internet access and Internet usage of various kinds is subject to sales tax, [[use tax]], telecommunications tax, a combination of these taxes, or no taxes at all, is whether Internet access and usage is determined to be a "good" or a "service."  If access to the Internet or usage is deemed a service, in general no sales or use taxation applies, while the rates and variants of telecommunications taxes that apply can be different. However, if access requires downloading of user software, some U.S. states (e.g., Massachusetts) may deem that to be a "taxable sale" of goods for their residents.

===Collection===
Collection of Internet taxes presents a complex array of issues.  These include whether states themselves should collect the tax; whether the burden instead should be placed on the [[Internet service provider]]; the extent to which retailers or value-added intermediaries can be required to perform collection duties; and in all cases, the ways in which this collection can be accurately and meaningfully enforced by the taxing jurisdiction. The roots of these issues stem from two debates. The first is the constitutionality of requiring internet businesses to collect taxes relating to the "Due Process" and "Commerce" clause of the constitution which require fair action by the government and no undue burden placed on interstate commerce. The second is whether the economic benefit gained from taxation outweighs the economic costs of enforcing the taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Dennis|title=Economic Issues in Taxing Internet and Mail-Order Sales|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/46xx/doc4638/10-20-internettax.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current law and future prospects==
The 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act was authored by [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Christopher Cox]], R-CA and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ron Wyden]], D-OR and signed into law on October 21, 1998 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in an effort to promote and preserve the commercial potential of the Internet.  This law bars federal, state, and local governments from taxing Internet access and from imposing discriminatory Internet-only taxes such as bit [[tax]]es, bandwidth taxes, and e-mail taxes.  The law also bars multiple taxes on [[electronic commerce]].

The 1998 bill had been extended three times by the [[United States Congress]] since its original enactment and was last renewed on October 30, 2007 for 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2007-10-30-internet-tax_N.htm Internet tax moratorium bill goes to Bush - USATODAY.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On Feb. 11, 2016 the U.S. Congress passed the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act and sent the bill to President Barack Obama for his expected signature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Congress-Passes-Permanent-Ban-on-Broadband-Taxes-136284 Congress Passes Permanent Ban on Broadband Taxes - DSLReports.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet taxes outside the United States==
In 2014, the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]] imposed a 5% sales tax on all internet services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Namgay Dorji, Finance Minister|title=Levy of 5% Sales Tax on Telecom Services|url=http://www.mof.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SaleTaxTele25102014.pdf|website=Ministry of Finance|publisher=Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Finance|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorji|first1=Gyalsten K.|title=Telecom services dearer thanks to sales tax|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/telecom-services-dearer-thanks-to-sales-tax/|accessdate=10 November 2014|publisher=Kuensel|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government of Pakistan has imposed 14% tax on internet across Pakistan. With this new advance tax which can be reclaimed at the time of filing of returns 14% of the bill amount is supposed to get deducted on internet usage across Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14% Advance Tax Imposed on Internet Across Pakistan|url=http://propakistani.pk/2015/07/03/14-advance-tax-imposed-on-internet-across-pakistan/|publisher=AAMIR ATTAA }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A vast majority of people took to Social networking websites to voice their grievances. With the imposition of this tax, Pakistan became the most heavily internet-taxed region of the world.

On May 30, 2018, the Ugandan parliament passed The Excise Duty Amendment Bill which proposed that; 

•A person providing an excisable service becomes liable to pay excise duty on that service on the earlier of the date on which the performance of the service is completed; the date on which payment for the service is made; or the date on which an invoice is issued. 

•A telecommunications service operator providing data used for accessing over the top services is liable to account for and pay excise duty on the access to the over the top services.
“Over the top services" are defined as the transmission or receipt of voice or messages over the internet protocol network and includes access to virtual private networks but does not include educational or research sites prescribed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette.

==Propositions outside the United States==
French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] announced on January 8, 2008, that he would propose taxing the Internet as a way to fund the country's state-owned television stations.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposition came as part of a broader plan for the French audiovisual network; the plan also included provisions such as the "total suppression of advertising on public channels" whose funding would then be aided by "an infinitesimal sales tax on new communication methods, like Internet access and mobile telephony.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''Kay's Tutor v. Ayrshire &amp; Arran Health Board''''' [1987] 2 All ER 417; 1987 S.C. 145; 1987 S.L.T. 577; is an [[Scots Delict Law]] case concerning [[Causation (law)|causation]] in a [[Medical malpractice|medical negligence]] context. It was decided by the House of Lords, with [[Lord Keith of Kinkel]], [[Lord Brandon of Oakbrook]], [[Hugh Griffiths, Baron Griffiths|Lord Griffiths]], [[Lord Mackay of Clashfern]] and [[Lord Ackner]] sitting.

==Facts==
Kay's son was admitted to hospital with [[meningitis]]. By mistake, he was given a [[penicillin]] overdose. It was thirty times the norm. He went deaf. No case had ever been recorded where penicillin had caused deafness. Often, [[meningitis]] itself caused deafness. The first instance found in favour of the plaintiff, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. In the House of Lords the plaintiff argued, the overdose increased the risk of neurological damage. Deafness was damage of the same type, therefore the defendants should be liable. Lord Keith demonstrated grasp of medical knowledge by describing the facts somewhat more elaborately.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Meningitis is a disease which causes [[inflammation]] of one or more of the three [[Biological membrane|membranes]] which envelop the [[central nervous system]] consisting of the brain and [[spinal chord]]{{sic|?|}}. The three membranes are the [[dura mater]], the [[arachnoid mater|arachnoid]] and the [[pia mater]]. Between the arachnoid and the underlying pia mater is the [[subarachnoid space]], which is filled with [[cerebro-spinal fluid]] (CSF). The general practitioner had treated the respiratory infection with [[ampicillin]] administered orally, but due to vomiting its therapeutic effect may have been to some extent frustrated. On admission to hospital Andrew was found to be seriously ill. He was treated with [[benzyl penicillin]] and [[sulphadiazine]] administered [[intravenous]]ly. A specimen of CSF was taken and sent for analysis. On the following day, 29 November, the laboratory reported that two cultures of [[pneumococci]] had been cultivated from the specimen. This led to a confirmed diagnosis of [[pneumococcal meningitis]], a most virulent form of the disease. The consultant [[paediatrician]] in charge of the case, Dr McClure, instructed that 10,000 units of penicillin be injected [[intrathecal]]ly, that is to say by way of lumbar puncture into the subarachnoid space containing the CSF. The reason for this procedure was to bring about that the penicillin might most readily reach the infected [[meninges]] and attack the [[bacteria]] which were causing the disease. The injection was carried out shortly after noon on that day by Dr Adam-Strump, a senior house officer. By mistake he injected about 300,000 units of penicillin instead of 10,000 units. This rapidly produced toxic effects. The child went into [[convulsion]]s and later developed a degree of [[hemiparesis]], that is to say [[paralysis]] on one side of his body. Dr Adam-Strump realised his mistake immediately, and remedial measures were urgently instituted. These were successful in saving the child's life and by 1 December the immediate ill effects of the overdose appeared to have been surmounted. A rapid recovery from the meningitis also followed. He was discharged from hospital on 24 December. His parents before then had begun to suspect that he was suffering from deafness. This proved to be indeed the case. He was suffering and still suffers from profound [[bilateral deafness]]."&lt;ref&gt;1987 S.L.T. 577, 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judgment==
It was held that where two competing causes of damage existed the law could not presume that the tortious cause was responsible. It needed to be proved that it was an accepted fact that the tortious cause was capable of aggravating the damage. The case was distinguished from ''[[McGhee v. National Coal Board]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[McGhee v. National Coal Board]]'' [1973] 1 W.L.R. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Ackner, who gave the final judgment, offered a good anecdotal account of the evidence at trial about the possible causes of the boy's deafness.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr McAllister, consultant bacteriologist in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow had made a special study in laboratory and clinical assessment of antibiotics, organising many symposia on antibiotics all over the world and, in particular, Europe and the United States. His contributions to the literature on this subject numbered nearly 100, including 20 dealing with penicillins. He confirmed that pneumococcal meningitis was the classical disease for producing deafness. He was asked whether he had ever come across any information which would suggest that an overdose of intrathecal penicillin causes or could cause deafness. He said he had searched the literature, he had computer scans done by three different processes, he had watched for years and in his experience there was no single recorded case of deafness from such an overdose.
He was asked in terms by the Lord Ordinary whether, as a bacteriologist, he was saying there was any reason why an overdose of penicillin injected intrathecally could not cause deafness. His reply was:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As a medical scientist I need evidence for things, without evidence and without rational balance of evidence medicine is a dead duck and in this case there is no evidence that an overdose of intrathecal Benzylpenicillin ever has caused deafness." In answer to a further question from the learned judge he said:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are possible and in medicine we never say never, but from the point of view of scientific medicine to my mind there is no evidence to incriminate an overdose of intrathecal Benzylpenicillin as a cause of deafness in this or in other cases and on the other side of the waterfall there is a massive amount of evidence to incriminate pneumococcal meningitis as one of the best known causes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only evidence to the effect that penicillin was the cause of the boy's deafness came from Mr Williams, a neuro-surgeon. His theory that penicillin injected intrathecally would itself have a destructive effect on the auditory nerve was rejected by the Lord Ordinary. The Lord Ordinary, however, developed his own theory, which was not put to any of the expert medical witnesses who gave evidence for the respondents nor was it canvassed at all at the hearing. The First Division of the Court of Session held that the appellant was not entitled to succeed on the basis of this theory and this decision has not been challenged before your Lordships.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lord Ackner agreed that this case was distinguishable from ''McGhee''. In ''McGhee'' there was no problem about evidence that the failure to provide a shower could have caused Mr McGhee's dermatitis. The "could have" element simply reflected that it was uncertain which cause (the brick dust at work, or the lack of a shower) was the operating cause of dermatitis. But here, the idea that the penicillin overdose "could have" caused deafness was of a different quality. It was not just of lesser degree of possibility, but that there was no evidential basis for the assertion at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49211">{{LGBT rights at the UN|size=530px}}
Discussions of '''LGBT rights at the United Nations''' have included resolutions and joint statements in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC), attention to the expert-led human rights mechanisms (such as the [[Human rights treaty bodies|United Nations Treaty Bodies]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Procedures)]], as well as by the UN Agencies.

Since its founding in 1945, the [[United Nations]] political bodies had not discussed [[LGBT rights]] (regarding equality regardless of [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]) until September 1995, when sexual orientation became a topic of debate in the negotiations on the Draft of the 1995 [[Beijing Platform for Action]]&lt;ref&gt;Shelagh Day (1996) "Women's Sexual Autonomy: Universality, Sexual Rights and Sexual Orientation at the Beijing Conference". ''Canadian Women's Studies / Les Cahiers de la Femme,'' Vol. 16, Number 3. Available at: http://cws.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/cws/article/viewFile/12095/11178 and http://cws.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/cws/issue/view/538/showToc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francoise Girard (2004) "United Nations: Negotiation Sexual Rights and Sexual Orientation at the UN", in Richard Parker, Rosalind Petchesky and Robert Sember (Eds.) ''Sex Politics: From the Frontlines,'' pp. 311-358. Sexuality Policy Watch. Book available at: http://www.sxpolitics.org/frontlines/book/index.php, Chapter available at: http://www.sxpolitics.org/frontlines/book/pdf/capitulo9_united_nations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; at the 4th [[World Conference on Women, 1995|World Conference on Women]]. While the proposed language on "sexual orientation" was eventually dropped from the text, it was the first time governments took a public and explicit stance for or against the inclusion and recognition of sexual orientation as part of women's right to control their sexuality. Furthermore, at that conference [[Beverley Palesa Ditsie]] became the first openly lesbian person to address the United Nations regarding LGBT issues, calling for States to adopt resolutions that recognized sexual diversity.

In April 2003, [[Brazilian Resolution|Brazil presented a resolution]] prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. However, in the ensuing debates the Commission voted to postpone discussions on the resolution until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iglhrc.org/sites/default/files/213-1.pdf|title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Human Rights - United Nations Commission on Human Rights - IGLHRC Campaign Dossier|author=IGLHRC|date=2003|website=IGLHRC|access-date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, the discussions expanded to include gender identity, when Norway presented a [http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/sogi-statements/2006-joint-statement/ joint statement on human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity] at the Commission on Human Rights on behalf of 54 states. This was followed by a [http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/sogi-statements/2008-joint-statement/ joint statement] presented at the General Assembly by Argentina on behalf of 66 states in December 2008. The 2008 statement in support of LGBT rights in the General Assembly prompted a statement backed by the [[Arab League]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] in opposition to LGBT rights. Both statements remain open for signature, and neither has been officially adopted by the General Assembly.

On June 17, 2011, [[South Africa]] led a resolution at the UNHRC requesting that the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) draft a report "documenting discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity" to follow up and implementation of the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc-international.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/HRC-Res-17-191.pdf Human Rights Council Resolution, 17th session]&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution passed with 23 votes in favour to 19 against, with 3 abstentions. It was the first such resolution and was hailed as "historic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/17/un-gay-rights-protection-resolution-passes-_n_879032.html |date=June 17, 2011 |agency=Associated Press |first=Frank |last=Jordans |title=U.N. Gay Rights Protection Resolution Passes, Hailed As 'Historic Moment' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Discrimination/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf The report], which came out in December 2011, documented human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including [[hate crime]]s, criminalization of homosexuality, and discrimination. High Commissioner [[Navi Pillay]] called for equitable ages of consent; comprehensive laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation; prompt investigation and recording of hate crime incidents; the repeal of laws criminalizing homosexuality; and other measures to ensure the protection of the rights of LGBT persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=United Nations |title=UN issues first report on human rights of gay and lesbian people |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743 |date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the report from the UNHRC is dated on 17 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_en.pdf Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, A.HRC/19/41]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the United Nations (as an employer) announced it would extend equal benefits to employees in same-sex unions entered into in jurisdictions where they are legal.

In September 2014, [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and [[Uruguay]] led on a follow up resolution at the UNHRC. This second resolution on "human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/RES/27/32|title=HRC resolution 27/32 on "human rights &amp; SOGI"|website=ap.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed with an increased vote margin (25 to 14, 7 abstentions), reflecting the trend for increased support by member states to address these issues at the international level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Discrimination/Endingviolence_ACHPR_IACHR_UN_SOGI_dialogue_EN.pdf|title=Norms, case law and practices relevant to sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status in the United Nations system (Annex 6)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requested the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to update the 2011 report "with a view to sharing good practices and ways to overcome violence and discrimination, in application of existing international human rights law and standards". The update was presented to the Human Rights Council in June 2015.

In 2016, the UNHRC passed a resolution to appoint an [[United Nations special rapporteur|Independent Expert]] to find the causes of violence and discrimination against people due to their gender identity and sexual orientation, and discuss with governments about how to protect those people. This long-term OHCHR-based mandate has been seen as the UN's "most overt expression of gay rights as human rights".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morello |first=Carol |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-council-creates-watchdog-for-lgbt-rights/2016/06/30/54976de6-3eee-11e6-80bc-d06711fd2125_story.html |title=U.N. council creates watchdog for LGBT rights |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, the UN Security Council condemned the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]]; this statement marked the first time the U.N. Security Council used language recognizing violence targeting the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.voanews.com/a/un-acknowledges-human-rights-violation-against-lgbt-community/3374946.html |title=UN Acknowledges Human Rights Violation Against LGBT Community |publisher=M.voanews.com |date=2016-06-14 |accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{World homosexuality laws map|align=right|size=300px}}

[[Same-sex relationship]]s are currently illegal in 76 countries and punishable by death in seven.&lt;ref name="reuters-art"&gt;{{cite web|title=State-sponsored Homophobia |url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2010.pdf |publisher=The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association |date=May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122235101/http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2010.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1980s, early United Nations reports on the [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic made some reference to homosexuality. The 1986 Human Freedom Index, in judging the [[human rights]] record of each nation, included a specific question with regards to the existence of criminal laws against homosexuality.

In its 1994 decision in ''[[Toonen v. Australia]]'', the UN Human Rights Committee—which is responsible for the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR)—declared that laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations between adults are in violation of international human rights law.&lt;ref name="ai-usa"&gt;{{cite press release |title=United Nations: General assembly to address sexual orientation and gender identity - Statement affirms promise of Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=12 December 2008 |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGIOR410452008 |accessdate=20 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Brazilian Resolution|Brazil tabled a Resolution]] at the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Commission on Human Rights]], stressing that human rights apply to all human beings regardless of sexual orientation. The resolution was indefinitely deferred (the Commission itself ceased in 2006 when the UN replaced it with the Human Rights Council). Since 2008, the 34 member countries of the [[Organization of American States]] have unanimously approved a series of resolutions affirming that human rights protections extend to sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref name="ai-usa" /&gt; Since 2000, the UN General Assembly has included a reference to sexual orientation in its biennial resolutions on [[Extrajudicial executions|extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions]], as did the former Commission on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The latter had also addressed the use of the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for sexual relations between consenting adults in its annual resolutions on the death penalty between 2002 and 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In recent years the General Assembly resolution on executions also covered [[gender identity]] as a ground for protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Joint statements ==
A series of joint statements on sexual orientation and gender identity by Member States at the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council between 2006 and 2011 provides evidence of increasing support for the issues among UN Member States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/sogi-statements/|title=SOGI Joint Statements|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following meetings between international advocacy leader [[International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia|Louis George Tin]] and French Minister of Human Rights and Foreign Affairs [[Rama Yade]] in early 2008, Yade announced that she would appeal at the UN for the universal decriminalization of homosexuality; the appeal was quickly taken up as an international concern.&lt;ref name="prai"&gt;{{cite press release |title=UN: General Assembly statement affirms rights for all |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=12 December 2008 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/es/documents/ior40/024/2008/es/ |accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-sponsored by France (which then held the rotating presidency of the EU) and the Netherlands on behalf of the EU, the declaration had been intended as a resolution; it was decided to use the format of a declaration of a limited group of states because there was not enough support for the adoption of an official resolution by the General Assembly as a whole. The declaration was read out into the General Assembly Record by Ambassador [[Jorge Argüello]] of [[Argentina]] on 18 December 2008—the first declaration concerning gay rights read in the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="nyt-art"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/world/19nations.html |title=In a First, Gay Rights Are Pressed at the U.N. |work=[[New York Times]] |last=MacFarquhar |first=Neil |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGARG"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ga10801.doc.htm | title= UN General Assembly press report | date= 18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement includes a condemnation of violence, [[harassment]], discrimination, [[social exclusion|exclusion]], [[stigmatization]], and [[prejudice]] based on sexual orientation and gender identity that undermine [[bodily integrity|personal integrity]] and dignity. It also includes condemnation of killings and executions, torture, arbitrary arrest, and deprivation of economic, social, and cultural rights on those grounds. The statement asserts: "we recall the statement in 2006 before the Human Rights Council by fifty four countries requesting the President of the Council to provide an opportunity, at an appropriate future session of the Council, for discussing these violations". Additionally, it says "we commend the attention paid to those issues by [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|special procedures of the Human Rights Council]] and treaty bodies and encourage them to continue to integrate consideration of human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity within their relevant mandate", indicating the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], which provide definitions in detail on sexual orientation and on gender identity as a document on [[international human rights law]].&lt;ref&gt;The Preamble of The Yogyakarta Principles&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
Several speakers addressing a conference on the declaration noted that in many countries laws against homosexuality stemmed as much from the British [[Colonialism|colonial]] past as from alleged religious or tradition reasons.&lt;ref name="nyt-art"/&gt; Voicing France's support for the draft declaration, Rama Yade asked: "How can we tolerate the fact that people are stoned, hanged, decapitated and tortured only because of their sexual orientation?"&lt;ref name="nyt-art" /&gt; [[UK]]-based activist [[Peter Tatchell]] said of the declaration:{{Quote|This was history in the making… Securing this statement at the UN is the result of an inspiring collective global effort by many LGBT and human rights organisations. Our collaboration, unity and solidarity have won us this success. As well as IDAHO, I pay tribute to the contribution and lobbying of [[Amnesty International]]; ARC International; Center for Women's Global Leadership; [[COC Nederland|COC Netherlands]]; Global Rights; [[Human Rights Watch]]; International Committee for IDAHO (the International Day Against Homophobia); [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]] (IGLHRC); [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]] (ILGA); [[International Service for Human Rights]]; Pan Africa ILGA; and [[Public Services International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=66 countries sign UN gay rights statement |first=Peter |last=Tatchell |authorlink=Peter Tatchell |date=18 December 2008 |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/international/UNmakeshistory.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616055340/http://www.petertatchell.net/international/UNmakeshistory.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Opposition===
Among the first to voice opposition for the declaration, in early December 2008, was the [[Holy See]]'s Permanent Observer at the United Nations, Archbishop [[Celestino Migliore]], who claimed that the declaration could be used to force countries to recognise same-sex marriage: "If adopted, they would create new and implacable discriminations. For example, states which do not recognise same-sex unions as 'matrimony' will be pilloried and made an object of pressure."&lt;ref name=migliore&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1202/breaking62.htm |title=Vatican criticised for opposing gay decriminalisation |date=2 December 2008 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key part of the Vatican opposition to the draft Declaration relates to the concept of gender identity. In a statement on 19 December,&lt;ref name="vapr"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Statement of the Holy See Delegation at the 63rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity |publisher=[[Holy See]] |date=18 December 2008 |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html |accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Migliore noted: "In particular, the categories 'sexual orientation' and 'gender identity', used in the text, find no recognition or clear and agreed definition in international law. If they had to be taken into consideration in the proclaiming and implementing of fundamental rights, these would create serious uncertainty in the law as well as undermine the ability of States to enter into and enforce new and existing human rights conventions and standards."&lt;ref name="vapr" /&gt; However, Archbishop Migliore also made clear the Vatican's opposition to legal discrimination against homosexuals: "The Holy See continues to advocate that every sign of unjust discrimination towards homosexual persons should be avoided and urges States to do away with criminal penalties against them."&lt;ref name="vapr" /&gt; In an editorial response, the [[Italy|Italian]] newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' called the Vatican's reasoning "grotesque", claiming that the Vatican feared a "chain reaction in favour of legally recognised homosexual unions in countries, like Italy, where there is currently no legislation."&lt;ref name="pullella20081202"&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Pullella |author2=[[Reuters]]  |title=Vatican attacked for opposing gay decriminalisation |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/12/02/africa/OUKWD-UK-VATICAN-HOMOSEXUALS.php |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]], citing conflicts with US law,&lt;ref name="reuters-art" /&gt; originally opposed the adoption of the nonbinding measure, as did [[Russia]], China, the Holy See, and members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC).&lt;ref name="nyt-art" /&gt; The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] changed the US position to support the measure in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sue |last=Pleming |date=18 March 2009 |title=In turnaround, U.S. signs U.N. gay rights document |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE52H5CK20090318 |accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative statement, supported by 57 member nations, was read by the [[Syria]]n representative in the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjsl.edu/slomansonb/10.3_GLBT_UN.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 10.3_GLBT_UN.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OIC-led statement rejected the idea that [[biology and sexual orientation|sexual orientation is a matter of genetic coding]] and claimed that the declaration threatened to undermine the international framework of human rights,&lt;ref name="nyt-art" /&gt; adding that the statement "delves into matters which fall essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states" and could lead to "the social normalization, and possibly the legitimization, of many deplorable acts including paedophilia".&lt;ref name="reuters-art" /&gt; 

The OIC failed in a related attempt to delete the phrase "sexual orientation" from a [[Sweden|Swedish]]-backed formal resolution condemning summary executions.&lt;ref name="nyt-art" /&gt; Recently, though, the phrase was removed (with 79 votes to 70)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishr.ch/general-assembly/957-ga-third-committee-takes-backward-step-on-sexual-orientation-in-relation-to-extrajudicial-executions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202191115/http://www.ishr.ch/general-assembly/957-ga-third-committee-takes-backward-step-on-sexual-orientation-in-relation-to-extrajudicial-executions |archivedate=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then subsequently restored (by a vote of 93 to 55).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/pressroom/pressrelease/1291.html |title=Civil Society Pressures Governments to Successfully Reverse Discriminatory Vote at UN &amp;#124; OutRight |publisher=Iglhrc.org |date=2010-12-21 |accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Signatories====

In 2008, 57 UN member nations initially co-sponsored the opposing statement.&lt;ref name="un-art"&gt;{{cite web |title=General Assembly: 70th and 71st plenary meeting, morning session, 02:32:00|url=https://www.un.org/webcast/ga2008.html |publisher=United Nations |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later switched their position to support the original resolution backing LGBT rights in 2011, leaving 54 countries as continued sponsors of the statement opposing LGBT rights. The countries that removed themselves as co-sponsors of the statement opposing LGBT rights are specifically noted below (all subsequently sponsored the statement supporting LGBT rights).

== The United Nations LGBTI Core Group ==
An informal group of [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations Member States]] was established in 2008 to focus on LGBTI rights intergovernmentally—by (most notably) ongoing collaboration between Global South and Global North state diplomats. {{as of|2018}}, the LGBTI Core Group is co-chaired by Argentina and the Netherlands; includes further Member States Albania, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Montenegro, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay; the European Union (UN-recognized regional body of states); the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN executive agency); and two non-governmental organizations, [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[OutRight Action International|Outright Action International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.passblue.com/2015/12/08/keeping-lgbt-rights-active-on-the-un-agenda/|title=Keeping LGBT Rights Active on the UN Agenda {{!}} PassBlue|website=www.passblue.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unclassified discussions open to the public at [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UNHQ]] occur once or twice a year and an [[RSVP]] is regularly announced on [[Twitter]]. An event held on December 10, 2015 looked at ''The Economic Cost of LGBT Exclusion'' and offered fiscal effects from exclusionary practices from the [[World Bank]] who estimated it to be 5% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and included the companion video released by the UN's [[United Nations Free &amp; Equal|Free &amp; Equal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; campaign. International concerns of the UN such as extreme hunger or clean water supplies could be remedied if this 5% of GDP was reallocated. At that meeting, the [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] announced the launch of their LGBTI Inclusions Index, a global collection of data which they hope will help sway minds and move countries toward a brighter future for LGBT citizens. Another topic speaker on that day was the CEO of [[Out &amp; Equal]] who recounted her 20-year efforts working with [[Fortune 500]] and 1000 companies watching them move from 5% inclusion in 1995 to 90% inclusion by 2015. On September 20, 2017, the Group held an event entitled ''Ending Violence and Discrimination against LGBTI Persons''. This included firsthand reports of [[Human rights|Human Rights]] violations. For May 17, 2018 on [[International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia]], the ''UN LGBTI Core Group Special Event Celebrating our Allies'' opened with remarks by the UK Ambassador.

During the 2018 UN LGBTI Core Group meeting, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Michelle Bachelet]] said: "More than 70 countries criminalise consensual same-sex relationships, and also criminalise transgender people based on their appearance. These laws subject LGBT people to long prison sentences, and in some cases physical punishment. They also implicitly encourage prejudice, hatred and violence. But laws can change (…) we need to see more countries taking steps to bring their laws and practices in line with the fundamental equality of all their people. It is essential that we defend and protect the LGBTI community, from every kind of violence and discrimination. There should be nothing 'controversial' about stopping people being murdered, or executed by agents of the State, simply because of who they are or whom they love. Tackling extreme violence does not require new norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/09/27/un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres-lgbt-india/|title=UN chief praises India for axing anti-gay law, vows to 'stand up for' LGBT+ rights|work=PinkNews|date=27 September 2018|last=Duffy|first=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/09/1020592|title=Violence against the LGBTI community: UN focuses on 'need to challenge hatred'|work=UN News|date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lgbti-time-to-break-the-taboo-of-immorality-embrace-the-difference/world/news/1361510.html|title=LGBTI: Time to break the taboo of immortality, embrace the difference|work=United News of India|date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/sep/26/unhrc-cites-indian-apex-courts-ruling-on-gay-sex-urges-countries-to-amend-laws-1877347.html|title=UNHRC cites Indian apex court's ruling on gay sex, urges countries to amend laws|work=The News Indian Express|date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Human Rights Council==
A resolution submitted by South Africa requesting a study on discrimination and sexual orientation (A/HRC/17/19) passed, 23 to 19, with 3 abstentions, in the UNHRC on June 17, 2011.&lt;ref name="UN Human Rights Council"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E |title=UN Human Rights Council |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624081557/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E |archivedate=24 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first time that any United Nations body approved a resolution affirming the rights of LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gpjOuYqR_9HwpkxaT7bS6f0x_glA?docId=3e1fdafae97c40f393a3d245c0df9fe4|title=UN group backs gay rights for the 1st time ever|author=Jordans, Frank|date=2011-05-17|accessdate=2011-05-17|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution called on the office of [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navi Pillay]] to draw up the first UN report "documenting discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity".

The [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/a.hrc.19.41_english.pdf High Commissioner's report], released December 2011, found that violence against LGBT persons remains common, and confirmed that "Seventy-six countries retain laws that are used to criminalize people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity" (para. 40), and that "In at least five countries the death penalty may be applied to those found guilty of offences relating to consensual, adult homosexual conduct" (para. 45).&lt;ref name="High Commissioner"&gt;{{cite web|last=High Commissioner for Human Rights|title=Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/a.hrc.19.41_english.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Commissioner's report led to a [http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/human-rights-council/hrc19/panel-summary panel discussion] by the Human Rights Council in March 2012. The divided nature of the UN (and the Council  in particular) was again evident. Former UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] described violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation as "a monumental tragedy for those affected and a stain on the collective consciousness" (para. 3), and many others voiced similar concerns. However, "A number of states had signaled their opposition to any discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity by leaving the Council chamber at the start of the meeting", and "A number voiced their opposition on cultural or religious grounds, or argued that sexual orientation and gender identity were new concepts that lay outside the framework of international human rights law" (para. 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Council|title=Human Rights Council panel on ending violence and discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity|url=http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/human-rights-council/hrc19/panel-summary|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNHRC adopted a second resolution related to sexual orientation and gender identity on September 26, 2014.&lt;ref name="msnbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Howard |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/un-passes-resolution-behalf-lgbt-citizens-around-the-globe |title=UN passes resolution on behalf of LGBT citizens around the globe |publisher=MSNBC |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/70315-philippines-unhrc-lgbt-resolution |title=PH votes yes to landmark UN reso on gay rights |publisher=Rappler.com |date=2014-09-27 |accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the resolution calls a report from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on best practices for combating discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It passed by a vote of 25 to 14, marking the first time the UNHRC adopted a resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity with the majority of its members.&lt;ref name="msnbc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rappler.com"/&gt; The second resolution voting was as follows:

===Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity===
In 2016, the UNHRC passed a resolution to appoint an [[United Nations special rapporteur|independent expert]] to find the causes of violence and discrimination against people due to their gender identity and sexual orientation, and discuss with governments about how to protect those people.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document|docid=A/HRC/RES/32/2|body=Human Rights Council|type=Resolution|session=32|resolution_number=32/2|title=Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 30 June 2016—32/2: Protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity|date=15 July 2016|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; Accordingly, Vitit Muntarbhorn, a Thai international law professor experienced in UN fieldwork, was the first UN [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SexualOrientationGender/Pages/Index.aspx Independent Expert on Protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity] (IE-SOGI).

==UN Secretary-General and Secretariat==
On 25 September 2018, United Nations Secretary-General [[António Guterres]] expressed support for a move towards greater respect for LGBT rights. In a pre-recorded speech, he addressed members of the UN LGBTI Core Group. He also praised [[LGBT rights in India|India]] for legalising gay sex after the repeal of [[Section 377]]. He told attendees: "The United Nations stands up for the rights of the LGBTI community. Many of its members are imprisoned, abused and even killed simply for who they are or whom they love." He added: "Progress has been made in recent years, including this month with the decision by the Supreme Court of India. But so long as people face criminalisation, bias and violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, we must redouble our efforts to end these violations.

===Treatment of UN staff===
In July 2014, it was announced that the United Nations (as an employer) would extend equal benefits to its [[civil service|employees]] who have entered into same-sex unions in [[jurisdiction]]s where they are legal. Under the new policy, staff who have married a same-sex spouse in a jurisdiction will receive the same benefits and recognition as those in heterosexual marriages, regardless of whether same-sex marriage is legal in their country of citizenship. Former UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] supported a move towards greater respect for gay rights. He stated: "Human rights are at the core of the mission of the United Nations. I am proud to stand for greater equality for all staff, and I call on all members of our UN family to unite in rejecting homophobia as discrimination that can never be tolerated at our workplace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/united-nations-will-now-recognize-gay-marriage040714 United Nations will now recognize gay marriage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== UN agencies and entities ==
Agencies and entities in the UN system have increasingly addressed human rights issues relating to sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An early and important milestone was in 1994 when the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] clarified that homosexuality was neither a disorder nor a disease when it removed sexual orientation from the International Classification of Diseases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since then other UN entities have made efforts to integrate issues concerning LGBTI persons into their work, including the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|OHCHR]], the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]], the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)]], the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]], the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)]], the I[[International Labour Organization|nternational Labour Organization (ILO)]], the [[United Nations Population Fund|United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)]] and the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in 2013 the ILO issued the results of a pilot research on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in 2014, UNDP released a discussion paper on transgender health and human rights; also that year, UNICEF published an issues paper on eliminating discrimination against children and parents based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and since 2013 the OHCHR has dedicated ongoing efforts to produce a multipronged awareness-raising campaign, [https://www.unfe.org/ “Free &amp; Equal”], relating to the human rights of LGBTI persons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, the OHCHR, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN Women, ILO, UNESCO, WHO, the World Bank and UNAIDS issued a joint report providing a snapshot of the work of UN bodies in combating discrimination and [[violence against LGBT people|violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity]], and related work in support of LGBTI communities around the world, together with a contact list of focal points in each UN entity and links and references to documents, reports and other materials that can be consulted for further information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, the ILO, OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNODC, UN Women, WFP and WHO issued a [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Discrimination/Pages/JointLGBTIstatement.aspx joint statement] calling on States to act urgently to end violence and discrimination against LGBTI adults, adolescents and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Left-libertarianism''' (also known as '''classical libertarianism''' and '''left-wing libertarianism''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RAI_023_0023--left-wing-libertarianism-equality-based.htm|title=Left-wing libertarianism: equality based on self-ownership|author=Spitz, Jean-Fabien|website=cairn-int.info|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; names several related, but distinct approaches to [[Politics|political]] and [[social theory]] which stress both [[Political freedom|individual freedom]] and [[social equality]].

In its classical usage, left-libertarianism is a synonym for [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] varieties of [[left-wing politics]], e.g. [[libertarian socialism]], which includes [[anarchism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]] among others.&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bookchinreader"&gt;Bookchin, Murray and Biehl, Janet (1997). ''The Murray Bookchin Reader''. Cassell:  p. 170. {{ISBN|0-304-33873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-libertarianism can also refer to political positions associated with academic philosophers [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]] and [[Peter Vallentyne]] that combine [[self-ownership]] with an egalitarian approach to [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name="oxfordcompanion"&gt;[[Will Kymlicka|Kymlicka, Will]] (2005). "libertarianism, left-". In [[Ted Honderich|Honderich, Ted]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. New York City: [[Oxford University Press]].  p. 516.  {{ISBN|978-0199264797}}. "'Left-libertarianism' is a new term for an old conception of justice, dating back to Grotius. It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George. Recent exponents include Philippe Van Parijs and Hillel Steiner."&lt;/ref&gt;

While maintaining full respect for [[personal property]], left-libertarians are skeptical of or fully against private ownership of natural resources, arguing that neither claiming nor [[Labor theory of property|mixing one's labor]] with [[natural resource]]s is enough to generate full [[Right to property|private property rights]]&lt;ref name="socialhistory"&gt;Carlson, Jennifer D. (2012). "Libertarianism". In Miller, Wilbur R. ''The social history of crime and punishment in America''.  London: Sage Publications. p. 1007. {{ISBN|1412988764}}. "Left-libertarians disagree with right-libertarians with respect to property rights, arguing instead that individuals have no inherent right to natural resources.  Namely, these resources must be treated as collective property that is made available on an egalitarian basis".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rhteol"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Narveson|first1=Jan|last2=Trenchard|first2=David|authorlink1=Jan Narveson|editor-first=Ronald|editor-last=Hamowy|editor-link=Ronald Hamowy|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|title=Left libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC|year=2008|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]]|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n174|isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4|oclc=750831024|lccn=2008009151|pages=288–289|quote=Left libertarians regard each of us as full self-owners. However, they differ from what we generally understand by the term ''libertarian'' in denying the right to private property.  We own ourselves, but we do not own nature, at least not as individuals. Left libertarians embrace the view that all natural resources, land, oil, gold, and so on should be held collectively. To the extent that individuals make use of these commonly owned goods, they must do so only with the permission of society, a permission granted only under the proviso that a certain payment for their use be made to society at large.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintain that natural resources (raw land, oil, gold, the electromagnetic spectrum, air-space, etc.) should be held in an egalitarian manner, either [[Unowned property|unowned]] or [[Common ownership|owned collectively]]. Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under the condition that recompense is offered to the [[Local community|local]] or even [[global community]].&lt;ref name="rhteol"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[left-wing market anarchism]], which includes [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]]'s [[agorism]], appeals to left-wing concerns such as [[egalitarianism]], [[gender]] and [[Sexual identity|sexuality]], [[Social class|class]], [[immigration]] and [[environmentalism]] within the paradigm of a [[Market socialism|socialist free market]].&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"/&gt; In the United States, the word "libertarian" has become associated with [[right-libertarianism]] after [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Karl Hess]] reached out to the [[New Left]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin (15 June 2014). [http://c4ss.org/content/28216 "What is Left-Libertarianism?"]. Center for a Stateless Society.&lt;/ref&gt; However, until then political usage of the word was associated exclusively with [[anti-capitalism]] and in most parts of the world such an association still predominates.

== Definition ==
The term left-libertarian has been used to refer to a variety of different [[Political economy|political economic]] [[Political philosophy|philosophies]], emphasizing [[Civil liberties|individual liberty]]. According to one textbook: &lt;blockquote&gt;The term "left-libertanism" has at least three meanings. In its oldest sense, it is a synonym either for anarchism in general or social anarchism in particular. Later it became a term for the left or Konkinite wing of the free-market libertarian movement, and has since come to cover a range of pro-market but anti-capitalist positions, mostly individualist anarchist, including agorism and mutualism, often with an implication of sympathies (such as for radical feminism or the labor movement) not usually shared by anarcho-capitalists. In a third sense it has recently come to be applied to a position combining individual self-ownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources; most proponents of this position are not anarchists.&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Henry George.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry George]] proposed the abolition of all [[tax]]es except those on [[Land value tax|land value]]]]
Contemporary left-libertarian scholars such as [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Peter Vallentyne]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Michael Otsuka]] and [[David Ellerman]] root an economic egalitarianism in the [[classical liberal]] concepts of [[self-ownership]] and [[Appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. They hold that it is illegitimate for anyone to claim private ownership of [[natural resource]]s to the detriment of others, a condition [[John Locke]] explicated in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kymlicka, Will (2005).  "libertarianism, left-."  ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.  In Honderich, Ted.  New York: Oxford University Press.  "[Left-libertarians maintain that] the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property."&lt;/ref&gt; Locke argued that natural resources could be appropriated as long as doing so satisfies the [[Lockean proviso|proviso]] that there remains "enough, and as good, left in common for others".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John (1689).  ''Two Treatises of Government''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, unappropriated natural resources are either unowned or owned in common and private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount or the property is taxed to compensate those who are excluded. This position is articulated in contrast to the position of [[Right-libertarianism|other libertarians]] who argue for a characteristically labor-based right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as [[Land (economics)|land]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982). ''The Ethics of Liberty''.

Economists since [[Adam Smith]] have known that—unlike other forms of taxation—a [[land value tax]] would not cause economic inefficiency.&lt;ref name="Adam Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Wealth of Nations, Book V|date=1776|chapter=Chapter 2, Article 1: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be a [[progressive tax]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suits|first1=Daniel B.|title=Measurement of Tax Progressivity|journal=The American Economic Review, published by American Economic Association|date=Sep 1977|volume=67|issue=4|pages=747–52|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1813408?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21105057475763|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, a tax paid primarily by the wealthy—that increases wages, reduces [[economic inequality]], removes incentives to misuse real estate and reduces the vulnerability that economies face from credit and property bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suits|first=Daniel B.|title=Measurement of Tax Progressivity|journal=American Economic Review|date=September 1977|volume=67|issue=4|pages=747–52|jstor=1813408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCluskey and Franzsen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&amp;pg=PA73 Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis, William J.

George was among the staunchest defenders of [[free market]]s and his book ''[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' was read into the United States Congressional Record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/ei/ei0502.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Early followers of Henry George's philosophy called themselves "[[single tax]]ers" because they believed the only economically and morally legitimate, broad-based tax is on land rent. The term "Georgism" was coined later, though some modern proponents prefer the less eponymous term geoism instead,&lt;ref name="Casal 2011 307–327"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casal|first=Paula|title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|year=2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–27|url=http://www.unipa.it/dottoratodirittocomparato/sites/default/files/20052009/Materiale%20Casal%282%29.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2014|quote=It can also invoke geoism, a philosophical tradition encompassing the views of John Locke and Henry George ...|doi=10.1163/174552411x591339}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the meaning of geo- (from the Greek ''ge'', meaning "earth") deliberately ambiguous.

Geolibertarianism is a [[political movement]] and ideology that synthesizes libertarianism and geoist theory, traditionally known as Georgism.&lt;ref name="progress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progress.org/archive/fold251.htm|title=Foldvary, Fred E.

"Geo-libertarianism." ''Land and Liberty''. pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[geoanarchism]], a proposed [[voluntaryism|voluntaryist]] form of geolibertarianism as described by Foldvary, rent would be collected by private associations with the opportunity to secede from a geocommunity (and not receive the geocommunity's services) if desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-state.com/geo/foldvary1.html|title=Geoanarchism|last=Foldvary|first=Fred E.|authorlink=Fred E.

[[Oxford University]] philosopher [[G. A. Cohen]] extensively criticized the claim, characteristic of the Georgist school of political economy, that self-ownership and a privilege-free society can be realized simultaneously. In ''Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality'', Cohen argued that any system purporting to take equality and its enforcement seriously is not consistent with the full emphasis on self-ownership and [[Negative liberty|negative freedom]] that defines market libertarian thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom G. Palmer]] has responded to Cohen's critique:

== Anarchism ==
{{main|Anarchism}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the first self-described [[Anarchism|anarchist]]]]
Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies characterized by self-governed, non-hierarchical, voluntary institutions. It developed in the 19th century from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;(2006).  "Anarchism".  ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s and in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. (1982).  ''The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society''.  Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research.  p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; According to anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work".&lt;ref name="EB1910"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin instead attached his ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, William (1793).  ''[[Political Justice]]''.  "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in [Edmund] Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence".&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of [[philosophical anarchism]]. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian (2001).

He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.

In France, revolutionaries began using the term ''anarchiste'' in a positive light as early as September 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean (2004). ''Anarchism''. London. Reaktion Books Ltd. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the first self-proclaimed anarchist (a label he adopted in his treatise ''[[What is Property?]]'') and is often described as the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, Daniel (1970). ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice''.  New York: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society in which organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests, saying: "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". Proudhon answers his own question in ''What is Property?'' with the famous statement: "[[Property is theft]]". He opposed the institution of decreed property ("proprietorship") in which owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish&lt;ref name="proudhon-prop"&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph]] (1840).

In ''[[What is Property?]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and contrasted this with [[usufruct]] ("possession") or limited ownership of resources only while in more or less continuous use. Later, Proudhon added that "Property is Liberty" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Stewart (1969).  "Introduction".

Anchor Books, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the state, organized religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

In a scathing letter written in 1857, French anarchist [[Joseph Déjacque]] castigated Proudhon for his [[sexist]] economic and political views.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm "De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J.

"The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work.  The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sébastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas|volume=Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE–1939)|year=2005|location=Montreal|publisher=Black Rose Books|editor=Robert Graham|chapter=|author=|at=§17|editor-link=Robert Graham (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature".&lt;ref&gt;(21 September 1858).

In the 1950s, [[classical liberal]]s in the United States began identifying as libertarians in order to distance themselves from the [[social liberal]]s of the [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Jennifer (2009).

"Although it did not become widely used until the 1950s, 'libertarian' was in circulation prior to the New Deal.

The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of [[anarcho-capitalism]], 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'.  It has therefore no become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Saul (2010).

"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism).  There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone.  From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions--the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions--neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a laissez-faire 'free' market.  ...  Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory.  The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all."&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the former is often described as [[right-wing libertarianism]] or simply right-libertarianism, while synonyms for the latter include left-libertarianism,&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"&gt;Anarchism".

Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include [[anarchism]] (especially [[anarchist communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|anarchist collectivism]], [[anarcho-syndicalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sims | first=Franwa | title=The Anacostia Diaries As It Is | page=160 | year=2006 | publisher=Lulu Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html A Mutualist FAQ: A.4.

After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at [[New Harmony, Indiana]] during 1825.

[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|left|upright|American [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]], known for his [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] journal ''[[Liberty (1881-1908)|Liberty]]'']]
While with notable exceptions American market-oriented libertarians after [[Benjamin Tucker]] tended to ally with the political right, relationships between such libertarians and the [[New Left]] thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern [[left-wing market anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick T. (2006). "[https://mises.org/daily/2099 Rothbard's 'Left and Right': Forty Years Later]".  Rothbard Memorial Lecture, Austrian Scholars Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism,&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo, Justin (2001). ''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard''.  Amherst, NY: Prometheus.&lt;/ref&gt; but long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions, one that was thus naturally agreeable to many on the left. In the 1960s, he came increasingly to seek alliances on the left, especially with members of the New Left, in light of the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo.  pp. 151–209.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[military draft]] and the emergence of the [[black power]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Brian M. (2007). ''Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement''. New York: Public Affairs. p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with other radicals like [[Ronald Radosh]] and [[Karl Hess]], Rothbard argued that the consensus view of American economic history, according to which a beneficent government has used its power to counter corporate predation, is fundamentally flawed. Rather, government intervention in the economy has largely benefited established players at the expense of marginalized groups, to the detriment of both liberty and equality. Moreover, the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]] period, hailed by the right and despised by the left as a heyday of ''[[laissez-faire]]'', was not characterized by ''laissez-faire'' at all, but it was a time of massive state privilege accorded to capital.&lt;ref&gt;On partnerships between the state and big business and the role of big business in promoting regulation, see Gabriel Kolko, ''The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History, 1900–1916'' (New York: Free 1977); Butler Shaffer, ''In Restraint of Trade: The Business Campaign against Competition, 1918–1938'' (Auburn, AL: Mises 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with his emphasis on the intimate connection between state and corporate power, he defended the seizure of corporations dependent on state largesse by workers and others.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (15 June 1969). "Confiscation and the Homestead Principle." ''Libertarian Forum''. '''1''':6. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard himself ultimately broke with the left, allying himself instead with the burgeoning [[paleoconservative]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;See Raimondo 277–78; Doherty 562–65.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the tendency of left-libertarians to appeal to "'free spirits,' to people who don't want to push other people around, and who don't want to be pushed around themselves" in contrast to "the bulk of Americans", who "might well be tight-assed conformists, who want to stamp out drugs in their vicinity, kick out people with strange dress habits, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, letter to David Bergland, 5 June 1986, qtd. Raimondo 263–64. Rothbard emphasized that this was relevant as a matter of strategy: the failure to pitch the libertarian message to Middle America, he wrote, might result in the loss of "the tight-assed majority."&lt;/ref&gt; Some thinkers associated with market-oriented American libertarianism, drawing on the work of Rothbard during his alliance with the left and on the thought of Karl Hess, came increasingly to identify with the left on a range of issues, including opposition to war, to [[Oligopoly|corporate oligopolies]] and state-corporate partnerships, and an affinity for [[cultural liberalism]]. This left-libertarianism is associated with scholars such as [[Kevin Carson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin A. (2008).  ''Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective''. Charleston, SC.

Referred to as left-wing [[market anarchist]]s&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, Gary; Johnson, Charles W. (2011). ''Markets Not Capitalism''. Brooklyn, NY:Minor Compositions/Autonomedia. pp. 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; or market-oriented left-libertarians,&lt;ref name="LibertarianLeft"/&gt; proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly liberal or radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race. While adopting familiar libertarian views, including opposition to [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug prohibition]], [[gun control]], [[civil liberties]] violations and war, left-libertarians are more likely to take more distinctively leftist stances on issues as diverse as [[feminism]], [[gender]] and [[Sexual identity|sexuality]], class, immigration and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, Roderick T.; Johnson, Charles W. (1 May 2005). "[http://charleswjohnson.name/essays/libertarian-feminism Libertarian Feminism: Can this Marriage Be Saved?]" Molinari Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this school typically urge the abolition of the state, arguing that vast disparities in wealth and social influence result from the use of force—especially state power—to steal and engross land and acquire and maintain special privileges. They judge that in a stateless society the kinds of privileges secured by the state will be absent and injustices perpetrated or tolerated by the state can be rectified, thus they conclude that with state interference eliminated it will be possible to achieve "socialist ends by market means".&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, Gary (2009). ''Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays''. Tulsa, OK: Tulsa Alliance of the Libertarian Left.&lt;/ref&gt; According to libertarian scholar Sheldon Richman: {{quote|Left-libertarians favor worker solidarity vis-à-vis bosses, support poor people's [[squatting]] on government or abandoned property, and prefer that corporate privileges be repealed before the regulatory restrictions on how those privileges may be exercised. They see [[Walmart]] as a symbol of corporate favoritism – supported by highway subsidies and eminent domain – view the fictive personhood of the [[Limited liability company|limited-liability corporation]] with suspicion, and doubt that [[Third World]] [[sweatshop]]s would be the "best alternative" in the absence of government manipulation. Left-libertarians tend to eschew electoral politics, having little confidence in strategies that work through the government. They prefer to develop alternative institutions and methods of working around the state.&lt;ref name="LibertarianLeft"/&gt;}}

Agorism is an anarchist tendency founded by Samuel Edward Konkin III which advocates [[counter-economics]], working in untaxable [[black market|black]] or [[grey market]]s and boycotting as much as possible the unfree, taxed market with the intended result that private voluntary institutions emerge and outcompete statist ones.

== Steiner–Vallentyne school ==
Contemporary left-libertarian scholars such as Hillel Steiner,&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Hillel (1994). ''An Essay on Rights''. Oxford:Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Vallentyne,&lt;ref&gt;(2000). ''Left Libertarianism and Its Critics: The Contemporary Debate''. In Vallentyne, Peter; and Steiner, Hillel. London:Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Van Parijs,&lt;ref&gt;Van Parijs, Philippe (2009). ''Marxism Recycled''. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Otsuka&lt;ref&gt;Otsuka, Michael (2005). ''Libertarianism without Inequality''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and David Ellerman&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, David (1992). ''Property and Contract in Economics: The Case for Economic Democracy''. Cambridge MA:Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, David (1990). ''The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm''. London:Unwin Hyman.&lt;/ref&gt; root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and land appropriation, combined with geoist or [[physiocrat]]ic views regarding the ownership of land and natural resources (e.g. those of John Locke and Henry George).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Scholars representing this school of left-libertarianism often understand their position in contrast to other libertarians who maintain that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation that individuals have the power to appropriate unowned things by claiming them (usually by mixing their labor with them), and deny any other conditions or considerations are relevant, and that there is no justification for the state to redistribute resources to the needy or to overcome market failures. Left-libertarians of the Carson–Long school (called left-wing market anarchists), referenced below, typically endorse the labor-based property rights Steiner–Vallentyne left-libertarians reject, but hold that implementing such rights would have radical rather than conservative consequences.

"[left-libertarians maintain that] the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4159">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;tt&gt;lex&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''' is a ''URN namespace'', a type of  [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN), that allows accurate identification of [[law]]s and other legal norms.

[[LexML Brasil]]&lt;ref&gt;http://projeto.lexml.gov.br/documentacao/resumo-em-ingles&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.normattiva.it/&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] countries) already do an official use of the ''URN LEX standard draft v0.9'',&lt;ref name="rfc"&gt;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-spinosa-urn-lex&lt;/ref&gt; as a ''namespace'' for sources of law.

== Syntax ==
The identifier has a hierarchical structure as follows:&lt;ref name="rfc"/&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;"urn:lex:"&lt;NSS&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
where &lt;tt&gt;NSS&lt;/tt&gt; is the ''Namespace Specific String'' composed as follows:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;NSS&gt;::=&lt;jurisdiction&gt;":"&lt;local-name&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
where:
:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;jurisdiction&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the part providing the identification of the jurisdiction, generally corresponding to the country where the source of law is issued.
:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;local-name&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the uniform name of the source of law in the country or jurisdiction where it is issued; its internal structure is common to the already adopted schemas.

Illustrative examples of sources of law identifyed by &lt;tt&gt;lex&lt;/tt&gt; URNs:&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 urn:lex:it:stato:legge:2003-09-21;456              (Italian act) 
 urn:lex:fr:etat:lois:2004-12-06;321                (French act)
 urn:lex:es:estado:ley:2002-07-12;123               (Spanish act)
 urn:lex:ch;glarus:regiere:erlass:2007-10-15;963    (Glarus Swiss Canton decree)
 urn:lex:eu:council:directive:2010-03-09;2010-19-UE (EU Council Directive)
 urn:lex:us:federal.supreme.court:decision:1963-03-18;372.us.335 (US FSC decision)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Concrete examples ==
Real ''URN LEX resolver'' at [[Brazil]], the country where URN LEX was adopted since 2009, with the [http://www.LexML.gov.br LexML.gov.br] portal:

* [http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:constituicao:1988-10-05;1988 urn:lex:br:federal:constituicao:1988-10-05;1988]: [[Constitution|Brazilian Constitution]] of 1988.

* [http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei:2008-06-19;11705 urn:lex:br:federal:lei:2008-06-19;11705]: Law nº 11.705, of June 19, 2008, known also as "[[Prohibition|Brazilian Prohibition]]".

== Transparent identifiers ==

URNs are used as [[unique identifier]]s (unique IDs), like in, for example, to identify a book by its [[ISBN]] &amp;ndash; so, the URN is also nominated as "''public'' (unique) ID". In that kind of public utilization, the need for a central authority (the International ISBN Agency in the example) as unique and necessary [[Uniform Resource Name#Resolver|URN-resolver]], is a problem. In that context, the identifier's user must to query the authority about the correct ID, from some object's metadata, like year or title. IDs like ISBN, that need a  central authority are also named "'''opaque''' IDs".

A common use of Lex URNs, by other hand, is to express '''transparent identifiers''', that can be built up by simple rules or inferences from basic metadata. Example: the Brazilian Lex URN is used for both, [[Legislation|legislative]] and [[European Case Law Identifier|case law]] unique and universal identifier, using rules of formatting and abbreviation of the authority's name, the publication date, and the local identifier (present in the title of the document).

: NOTE about terminology. In computer science a identifier is a data type, and an [[opaque data type|''opaque'' data type]] is a data type whose concrete data structure is not defined in an interface. In opposition, a data type whose representation is visible is called ''transparent''.

URN schemes where each URN is also a transparent identifier, can be used in distributed (non-central) URN-resolution systems; and the URNs can be created in absence of these systems, even before to the recording in these systems.

'''Medical law''' is the branch of [[law]] which concerns the [[prerogative]]s and responsibilities of [[medical professionals]] and the [[rights of the patient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawbore.net/medical|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423233530/http://lawbore.net/medical|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-04-23|title=Topic: Medical Law|publisher=[[City University Law School]] - Lawbore|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[medical jurisprudence]], which is a branch of [[medicine]], rather than a branch of [[law]].

The main branches of medical law are the law of [[torts]] (most notably [[medical malpractice]]) and [[criminal law]] in relation to medical practice and treatment.

{{Contract law}}

In the law of [[contract]]s, the '''mirror image rule,''' also referred to as an unequivocal and absolute acceptance requirement, states that an [[offer and acceptance|offer]] must be accepted exactly with no modifications. The offeror is the master of one's own offer. An attempt to accept the offer on different terms instead creates a [[counter-offer]], and this constitutes a rejection of the original offer.&lt;ref&gt;(Restatement(2d) Contracts §59)&lt;/ref&gt;

==England==
The [[English common law]] established the concepts of ''[[consensus ad idem]]'', offer, acceptance and counter-offer.  The leading case on counter-offer is ''[[Hyde v Wrench]]'' [1840].&lt;ref&gt; Hyde v Wrench [1840] EWHC Ch J90&lt;/ref&gt;   The phrase "Mirror-Image Rule" is rarely (if at all) used by English lawyers; but the concept remains valid, as in ''[[Gibson v Manchester City Council]]'' [1979],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] UKHL 6|&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd|Butler Machine Tool v Excello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-cello Cpn (England) Ltd 1979 1 WLR 401 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
This position is adhered to in [[Australia]] ([[New South Wales]]). If a person were to accept an offer, but make a modification, then they are actually rejecting the offer presented to them and are proposing a counter-offer: ''Masters v Cameron'' (1954) 91 CLR 353. That modifying party is then the one making a new offer, and the original offeror is now the one who has to accept.

==United States==
{{See also|United States contract law#UCC .C2.A7 2-207|Uniform Commercial Code#Section 2-207: Battle of the forms|Offer and acceptance#Battle of the forms}}

In the [[United States]], this rule still exists at common law.  However, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] ("UCC") dispenses with it in § 2-207. (but it can also be argued that § 2-207(1) enforces the mirror image rule)&lt;ref&gt;Text of § 2-207: https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-207&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, its applicability depends upon what law governs.  Most states have adopted the UCC, which governs transactions in goods.  Contracts for services or land, for example, would not be governed by the UCC.  The 2nd restatement of contracts also provides that when parties have not agreed to an essential term, "a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court."  However, it may not be possible for a reasonable term to be supplied by the court.

'''''Parens patriae''''' is [[Latin]] for "parent of the nation" (lit., "parent of the fatherland").  In [[law]], it refers to the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] power of the [[state (polity)|state]] to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent, [[legal guardian]], or informal caretaker, and to act as the parent of any child or individual who is in need of protection.  For example, some children, incapacitated individuals, and disabled individuals lack parents who are able and willing to render adequate care, thus requiring state intervention.

In U.S. litigation, ''parens patriae'' can be invoked by the state to create its [[Standing (law)|standing]] to sue; the state declares itself to be suing on behalf of its people. For example, the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act|Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/15c- 15 USC 15c]), through Section 4C of the [[Clayton Act]], permits [[state attorneys general]] to bring ''parens patriae'' suits on behalf of                                   those injured by violations of the [[Sherman Act|Sherman Antitrust Act]].

==Discussion==
''Parens patriae'' relates to a notion initially invoked by the [[King's Bench]] in the sixteenth century in cases of ''[[non compos mentis]]'' adults.&lt;ref&gt;Lat: not having control over the mind or intellect. Not of sound mind; insane. See 108 A. 2d 820, 822. In certain circumstances its effect is lessened to mean only "not legally competent." See 1 S.E. 2d 768, 770. Compare diminished capacity; incompetent; non ''[[sui juris]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion dates from at least 1608, as recorded in [[Edward Coke|Coke]]'s report of [[Calvin's Case]], wherein it is said "that moral law, honora patrem…doubtless doth extend to him that is pater patriæ."&lt;ref name="CokeThomas1826"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Edward Coke|author2=John Henry Thomas|author3=John Farquhar Fraser|title=The Reports of Sir Edward Coke, Knt. [1572-1617]: In Thirteen Parts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlYDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=4 July 2013|year=1826|publisher=J. Butterworth and Son|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''parens patriæ'' doctrine was gradually applied to children throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and has since evolved from one granting absolute rights to the sovereign to one more associated with rights and obligations of the state and courts towards children and incapacitated adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/1996/1/1996-01%20Cmt%20&amp;%20Note%20Witte.pdf People v. Bennett: Analytic Approaches to Recognizing a Fundamental Parental Right Under the Ninth Amendment, 1996 BYU Law Review 186, 227-34&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2008/2/8WITTE.FIN.pdf Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice, 2008 BYU Law Review 377, 386 n.30&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, this appears in the principle that makes the protection of the [[best interests]] of any child the first and single most important concern of the [[court]]s. For example, in any proceedings affecting the validity of a [[marriage (conflict)|marriage]], the children will not be parties in their own right, nor will they be parties to any agreement that the spouses may make. In these proceedings, the courts will often be invited to accept and enforce any agreement between a husband and wife regarding [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibility]] for their children. This will usually be done so long as the agreement is seen to be in the best interests and welfare of the children. Courts are not obliged to invoke the ''parens patriae'' doctrine in cases involving children and not all courts, particularly newer courts such as the [[Family Court of Australia]], have specific ''parens patriae'' jurisdiction.

In the United States, some proponents of [[homeschooling]] have asserted that the Parens Patriae Doctrine is constrained by a so-called "Parental Liberty Doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaqua.org/parenspatriae.htm Parens Patriae – Quaqua Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In some situations, the parties may have submitted their dispute to formal [[arbitration]] proceedings. Such proceedings, whether [[judicial]] or [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]], cannot displace the supervisory power of the court in the exercise of its ''parens patriae'' function to the child. To the extent that such an award conflicts with the best interests of the child, the courts will treat it as void in respect of the child, even though it might be binding on the parents. The test of the best interests of the child can always be the basis of a challenge by a parent, grandparent, an interested relative, or the child acting through a friend.

Thus, for example, the spouses might already have been through a religious form of divorce known as the ''[[get (conflict)|get]]'' before the ''[[Beth Din]]'', the Jewish [[rabbinical]] court, which included provision for the children. Even though there might appear to be a grant of custody in absolute terms by this court, public policy always requires that it can be reviewed by a secular court and, if the state court is of the view that it is not in the best interests of the child, it will be set aside (see ''Stanley G. v. Eileen G.'' New York Law Journal, 10-13-94, P.22, Col.6, Sup. Ct., NY Co.).

Within the [[European Union|EU]], the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity. It also provides that the child's best interest shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions.

The same principles apply to individuals whose mental [[capacity (law)|capacity]] is impaired and who are being abused by carers or other individuals, whether family members or otherwise. Since these individuals cannot protect themselves, the courts have an [[inherent jurisdiction]] to appoint a [[legal guardian|guardian ''ad litem'']] for particular proceedings. In [[English Law]], long-term care is arranged through the [[Court of Protection]].

==In US federal courts==

The concept of the ''parens patriae'' suit has been greatly expanded in the United States federal courts beyond those that existed in England.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.'', 405 U.S. 251 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Louisiana v. Texas'',&lt;ref&gt;176 U.S. 1 (1900).&lt;/ref&gt; the State of Louisiana brought suit to enjoin officials of the State of Texas from so administering the Texas quarantine regulations as to prevent Louisiana merchants from sending goods into Texas. The US Supreme Court recognized that Louisiana was attempting to sue, not because of any particular injury to a particular business of the state, but as ''parens patriae'' for all its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;176 U.S., at 19.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Court found that ''parens patriae'' could not properly be invoked in that case, the propriety and utility of ''parens patriae'' suits were clearly recognized, thus setting a precedent. Thus, in a series of cases after ''Louisiana v. Texas'' the Supreme Court followed that precedent to allow states to sue as ''parens patriae'':

* ''Missouri v. Illinois'', 180 U.S. 208 (1901) (holding that Missouri was permitted to sue Illinois and a Chicago sanitation district on behalf of Missouri citizens to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the Mississippi River);
* ''Kansas v. Colorado'', 206 U.S. 46 (1907) (holding that Kansas was permitted to sue as ''parens patriae'' to enjoin the diversion of water from an interstate stream);
* ''Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.'', 206 U.S. 230 (1907) (holding that Georgia was entitled to sue to enjoin fumes from a copper plant across the state border from injuring land in five Georgia counties);
* ''New York v. New Jersey'', 256 U.S. 296 (1921) (holding that New York could sue to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the New York harbor);
* ''Pennsylvania v. West Virginia'', 262 U.S. 553 (1923) (holding that Pennsylvania might sue to enjoin restraints on the commercial flow of natural gas);
* ''North Dakota v. Minnesota'', 263 U.S. 365 (1923) (holding that Minnesota could sue to enjoin changes in drainage which increase the flow of water in an interstate stream).

The Supreme Court recognized a different kind of ''paren patriae'' suit in ''Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co.''&lt;ref&gt;324 U.S. 439 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt; While the earlier cases were common-law actions to prevent or repair harm to a state's "quasi-sovereign" interests. Georgia now sought relief under the federal antitrust statute, alleging that twenty railroads had conspired to restrain trade and to fix prices in a manner that would favor shippers in other states (particularly northern states) to the detriment of Georgia shippers and the state's economy. The court upheld Georgia's claim as ''parens patriae'' with respect to injunctive relief, but did not consider whether the antitrust laws also authorized damages for an injury to the state's economy, because the ICC's approval of the challenged rates barred any damage recovery.

Then, three decades later, in ''Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;405 U.S. 251 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; the court considered a generally similar damages action Hawaii brought under the antitrust laws for damages to its general economy resulting from a price fix by four oil companies. The court held that the state could sue as ''parens patriae'' only for injunctive relief and not for damages. Its citizens would have to sue individually for damages.

In ''Massachusetts v. EPA'',&lt;ref&gt;549 U.S. 497 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; a group of states (mostly coastal states) sought to sue the EPA to require it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions because they were causing global warming and rising sea levels. "These rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts' coastal land."&lt;ref&gt;549 U.S. at 522.&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated:

{{quote|In sum—at least according to petitioners' uncontested affidavits—the rise in sea levels associated with global warming has already harmed and will continue to harm Massachusetts. The risk of catastrophic harm, though remote, is nevertheless real. That risk would be reduced to some extent if petitioners received the relief they seek.&lt;ref&gt;549 U.S. at 526.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Therefore, states such as Massachusetts had standing as ''parens patriae'' to sue EPA to seeks to require it to regulate to protect their coastlines. The Court held that EPA would have to consider the matter and give a reasoned explanation of whatever its decision on the merits would be.&lt;ref&gt;549 U.S. at 534-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;704 F.2d 125 (4th Cir. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; the Fourth Circuit held that several state attorney generals were proper ''parens patriae'' plaintiffs to sue a group of car dealers for price fixing, in order to recover damages for their citizen injured by overcharges. The court held that because plaintiffs were authorized to pursue antitrust litigation against defendants on behalf of their states' natural-person residents under both 15 U.S.C. §§&amp;nbsp;15c-15h and state laws and constitutions, they could sue on behalf of their citizens.

{{Competition law}}
The '''Parker immunity doctrine''' is an exemption from [[Legal liability|liability]] for engaging in [[antitrust]] violations.  It applies to the state when it exercises legislative authority in creating a regulation with anticompetitive effects, and to private actors when they act at the direction of the state after it has done so.  The doctrine is named for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case in which it was initially developed, ''[[Parker v. Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Parker, Director of Agriculture, et al. v. Brown'', 317 U.S. 341 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind ''Parker'' immunity is that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, evidenced no intent to restrain state behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parker v. Brown]] at 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State must act as a sovereign==
For the doctrine to apply, the state must act as a sovereign, rather than as a "participant in a private agreement or combination by others for restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Parker'' at 351-2; see also ''Omni'', 499 U.S. at 374-5 ("Immunity does not necessarily obtain where the state acts not in a regulatory capacity but as a commercial participant in a given market").&lt;/ref&gt; Antitrust laws do not bar anticompetitive restraints that sovereign states impose "as an act of government".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parker v. Brown]]'', 317 U.S. 341, 352 (1943); see also ''[[Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Assoc.]]'', 107 F.3d 1026, 1035 (3d Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; "The key question is whether the allegedly anticompetitive restraint may be considered the product of sovereign state action. If it is not, then even if sectors of state government are involved, the activity will not constitute "state action" under the Parker doctrine and will not receive immunity."&lt;ref name="BedellWholesale"&gt;[[A.D. Bedell Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Philip Morris Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Parker court found that "a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 317 U.S. at 351.&lt;/ref&gt;Instead, the anticompetitive conduct "must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign," not merely prompted by state action, to be immunized under the state action doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar]]'', {{ussc|421|773|1975|pin=791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special definition of "state action" in Parker immunity cases==
"State action," as defined in cases granting Parker immunity, is qualitatively different from "state action" in other contexts such as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;See 1 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, supra, at P 221.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Fourteenth Amendment can cover
:inadvertent or unilateral acts of state officials not acting pursuant to state policy . . . the term "state action" in antitrust adjudication refers only to government policies that are articulated with sufficient clarity that it can be said that these are in fact the state's policies, and not simply happenstance, mistakes, or acts reflecting the discretion of individual officials.
Because it is grounded in federalism and respect for state sovereignty, this interest in protecting the acts of the  sovereign state, even if anticompetitive, outweighs the importance of a freely competitive marketplace, especially in the absence of contrary congressional intent.

"State action" as defined by the Parker doctrine differs from the government "actions" which results from petitioning. The two are not coterminous. A finding of immunity from injury caused by government action under the [[Noerr-Pennington doctrine]] does not require a finding of Parker state action.&lt;ref&gt;See 1 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, supra, at P 206 (interpreting our dicta in Massachusetts School of Law, 107 F.3d 1026 (3d Cir. 1997) as noting this distinction).&lt;/ref&gt; If the government "action" taken is the result of petitioning, Noerr-Pennington immunity attaches to a broader range of government action than does Parker immunity. Noerr-Pennington immunity protects petitioning, so long as it is not a sham.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Subscription Television v. S. Cal. Theatre Owners Ass'n]], 576 F.2d 230, 233-34 (9th Cir. 1978) (holding defendants immune from antitrust liability under Noerr-Pennington even though their petitioning led to the passage of an unconstitutional initiative).&lt;/ref&gt; Under Noerr-Pennington immunity, the government actions which flow from valid petitioning need not qualify as Parker "state action." Petitioning "would be considerably chilled by a rule which would require an advocate to predict whether the desired legislation would withstand a constitutional challenge in the courts and to expose itself to a potential treble antitrust action based on that prediction."&lt;ref&gt;Subscription Television, 576 F.2d at 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congress intended the Sherman Act to address business combination, not state combination==
Without clear congressional intent to preempt, federal laws should not invalidate state programs. "In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress."&lt;ref&gt;Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; While individual anticompetitive acts of state governments may be considered unwise or counterproductive, the decision to make such choices lies within the sovereign power of the states. Congress did not intend to override important state interests in passing the Sherman Act. "The general language of the Sherman Act should not be interpreted to prohibit anticompetitive actions by the States in their governmental capacities as sovereign regulators."&lt;ref&gt;[[City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver.]], 499 U.S. 365, 374 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sherman Act was enacted to address the unlawful combination of private businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader]], 310 U.S. 469, 493 n.15 (1940) ("The history of the Sherman Act as contained in the legislative proceedings is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that 'business competition' was the problem considered and that the act was designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect on such competition.").&lt;/ref&gt; "There is no suggestion of a purpose to restrain state action in the Act's legislative history."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 63 S. Ct. at 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sherman Act was passed "in the era of 'trusts' and of 'combinations' of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern."&lt;ref&gt;Apex, 310 U.S. at 493.&lt;/ref&gt; Given its focus on the problems of private monopolies and combinations, it is not surprising that the Sherman Act does not set out to curb clearly defined anticompetitive state actions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Assoc. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]], 445 U.S. 97, 104 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

When a state clearly acts in its sovereign capacity it avoids the constraints of the Sherman Act and may act anticompetitively to further other policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;See S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 54 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, state governments frequently sanction monopolies to ensure consistent provision of essential services like electric power, gas, cable television, or local telephone service. But "a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 317 U.S. at 351 (states cannot authorize private parties to set a price and then enforce those prices without any evaluation of their reasonableness).&lt;/ref&gt; Only an affirmative decision by the state itself, acting in its sovereign capacity, and with active supervision, can immunize otherwise anticompetitive activity.

==Midcal's two-part test for whether to treat an action as a "state action"==
Applying ''Midcal'' is unnecessary if the alleged antitrust injury was the direct result of a clear sovereign state act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover v. Am. Bar Assoc.]], 107 F.3d 1026, 1036 (3d Cir. 1997); [[Sessions Tank Liners, Inc. v. Joor Mfg.]], Inc., 17 F.3d 295, 299 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding immunity from antitrust liability where "injuries for which [the plaintiff] seeks recovery flowed directly from government action").&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Massachusetts School of Law'', the Court held that where "the states are sovereign in imposing the bar admission requirements [the alleged anticompetitive restraints], the clear articulation and active supervision requirements . . . are inapplicable."&lt;ref&gt;107 F.3d at 1036.&lt;/ref&gt; There is less need for scrutiny "when the conduct is that of the sovereign itself . . . [because] the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise."&lt;ref&gt;[[PTI, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc.]], 100 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1196 (C.D. Ca. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, concerns about the legitimacy of the action are reduced. The test to determine sufficient state involvement as sovereign is unnecessary when the state legislature or state supreme court acts directly. As the Supreme Court explained: "Closer analysis is required when the activity at issue is not directly that of the legislature or supreme court, but is carried out by others pursuant to state authorization.... When the conduct is that of the sovereign itself, on the other hand, the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise. When the conduct at issue is in fact that of the state legislature or supreme court, we need not address the issues of 'clear articulation' and 'active supervision.'&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hoover v. Ronwin]]'', {{ussc|466|558|1984|pin=568}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when it is uncertain whether an act should be treated as state action for the purposes of Parker immunity, courts apply the test set forth in ''[[California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. 97, 104 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; to "determine whether anticompetitive conduct engaged in by private parties should be deemed state action and thus shielded from the antitrust laws."&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick v. Burget]], 486 U.S. 94, 100 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; "First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself."&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. 97, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Supreme Court has recognized state legislative and judicial action as sovereign under ''Parker''. But "closer analysis is required" when the action is less directly that of the legislature or judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hoover v. Ronwin]], 466 U.S. 558, 568 (1984) (relying in part on Midcal).&lt;/ref&gt; One Court of Appeals has decided that executive officers and agencies "are entitled to Parker immunity for actions taken pursuant to their constitutional or statutory authority, regardless whether these particular actions or their anticompetitive effects were contemplated by the legislature," without the need for ''Midcal'' analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Haw., Inc.]], 810 F.2d 869, 876 (9th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Parker, by its own terms, immunizes only states. But in order to give effect to Parker immunity, private parties to state action must also be immune.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armstrong Surgical Ctr, Inc. v. Armstrong County Mem'l Hosp.]]'', 185 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir. 1999) ("If relief is sought solely for injury as to which the state would enjoy immunity under Parker, the private petitioner also enjoys immunity.").&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, plaintiffs could sue only the private parties and by winning antitrust judgments against them, could thwart state policies as if there were no state immunity. No state could enter into an agreement with private groups, even to further clear state policies, because the potential liability of the private groups would prevent them from joining. Artful pleading should not frustrate state policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., v. United States]], 471 U.S. 48, 56-57 (1985) (absent immunity for private parties, a "plaintiff could frustrate any [State] program merely by filing suit against the regulated private parties").&lt;/ref&gt; "If Parker immunity attaches, it would also reach the private participants of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|[tobacco] Multistate Settlement Agreement]]."&lt;ref name="BedellWholesale"/&gt;

In ''Midcal'', the Supreme Court clarified that requires states to meet two conditions before antitrust immunity will attach: "First, the challenged restraint must be 'one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy'; second, the policy must be 'actively supervised' by the State itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Midcal'', 445 U.S. at 105 (quoting ''City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.'', 435 U.S. 389, 410 (1978)).&lt;/ref&gt; This clearly articulated state policy may be inferred "if suppression of competition is the 'foreseeable result' of what the statute authorizes".&lt;ref&gt;''Omni'', 499 U.S. at 372-73 (quoting ''Hallie v. Eau Claire'', 471 U.S. 34, 42 (1985)).&lt;/ref&gt; Under ''Midcal'', a state "may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details. Actual state involvement, not deference to private pricefixing arrangements under the general auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from federal law."&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 633 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as state action under the ''Midcal'' test, "the challenged restraint must be one 'clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy.'"&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. at 104 (quoting ''City of Lafayette v. La. Power &amp; Light Co.'', 435 U.S. 389, 410 (1978) (opinion of Brennan, J.)).&lt;/ref&gt; A government entity need not "be able to point to a specific, detailed, legislative authorization" to assert a successful Parker defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Lafayette'', 435 U.S. at 415.&lt;/ref&gt; But it must be evident that under the "clear articulation" standard the challenged restraint is part of state policy. As the Supreme Court has stated, "Midcal confirms that while a State may not confer antitrust immunity on private persons by fiat, it may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details".&lt;ref&gt;''FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 633 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prong of the ''Midcal'' test is whether the resulting antitrust violation was "actively supervised" by the state. This standard is more problematic. The essential inquiry of the "actively supervised" prong is to determine if the "anticompetitive scheme is the State's own".&lt;ref&gt;''FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 635 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The active supervision prong "requires that state officials have and exercise power to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy."&lt;ref&gt;''Patrick v. Burget'', 486 U.S. 94, 101 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; "Absent such a program of supervision, there is no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy, rather than merely the party's individual interests." Id. at 100-01. "Such active state review is clearly necessary where private defendants are empowered with some type of discretionary authority in connection with the anticompetitive acts (e.g. to determine price or rate structures)."&lt;ref&gt;''Zimomra'', 111 F.3d at 1500.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubberstamp approval of private action does not constitute state action. A state must independently review and approve the anticompetitive behavior to satisfy this prong of the Parker doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, 486 U.S. at 101 ("The active supervision requirement mandates that the State exercise ultimate control over the challenged anticompetitive conduct."); Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 998 F.2d 1129, 1139 (3d Cir. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

A "hybrid restraint" is discussed by Justice Stevens in his concurrence in ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;458 U.S. 654, 666-67 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; They are not purely private actions, nor are they entirely attributable to the state in the manner of a legislative act. Hybrid restraints are not the type of sovereign state action found in ''Massachusetts School of Law'' or ''Zimomra'', that avoid ''Midcal'' treatment. Instead, hybrid restraints involve a degree of private action which calls for ''Midcal'' analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See Rice, 458 U.S. at 666 ("Hybrid restraints of this character require analysis that is different from a public regulatory scheme on the one hand, and a purely private restraint on the other.") (citations omitted) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pragmatic Sanction''' ({{lang-la|Sanctio Pragmatica}}) was an edict issued by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], on 19 April 1713 to ensure that the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg hereditary possessions]], which included the [[Archduchy of Austria]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], the [[Duchy of Milan]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the [[Austrian Netherlands]], could be inherited by a daughter.

Charles and his wife [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Elizabeth Christine]] had not, to that point, had children and since 1711 Charles had been the sole surviving male member of the [[House of Habsburg]]. Charles' elder brother [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] had died without male issue, leaving Joseph's daughter [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]] as the [[heir presumptive]].  This presented two problems.  First, a prior agreement with his brother known as the [[Mutual Pact of Succession]] (1703) had agreed that, in the absence of male heirs, Joseph's daughters would take precedence over Charles's daughters in all Habsburg lands.  Though at that time Charles had no children, if he were to be survived by daughters alone, they would be cut out of the inheritance.  Secondly, because [[Salic law]] precluded female inheritance, Charles VI needed to take extraordinary measures to avoid a protracted succession dispute as other claimants would have surely contested a female inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjUEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Emperor%20Charles%20VI&amp;pg=RA1-PA905#v=onepage&amp;q=Emperor%20Charles%20VI&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica – Eleventh Edition|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles VI was indeed ultimately succeeded by his own elder daughter [[Maria Theresa]] (born 1717).  However, despite the promulgation of the Pragmatic Sanction, her accession in 1740 resulted in the outbreak of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] as [[Charles-Albert of Bavaria]], backed by France, contested her inheritance.  Following the war, Maria Theresa's inheritance of the Habsburg lands was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], while the election of her husband [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was secured by the [[Treaty of Füssen]].

==Background==
{{main|Mutual Pact of Succession}}
In 1700, the senior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] became extinct with the death of [[Charles II of Spain]]. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ensued, with [[Louis XIV of France]] claiming the crowns of Spain for his grandson [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]] and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]], claiming them for his son [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]]. In 1703, Charles and [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph]], Leopold's sons, signed the [[Mutual Pact of Succession]], granting succession rights to the daughters of Joseph and Charles in the case of complete extinction of the male line but favouring the daughters of Joseph over those of Charles, as Joseph was older.

In 1705, Leopold I died and was succeeded by his elder son, Joseph I. Six years later, Joseph I died leaving behind two daughters, Archduchesses [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]] and [[Maria Amalia of Austria|Maria Amalia]]. Charles succeeded Joseph, according to the Pact, and Maria Josepha became his [[List of heirs to the Austrian throne|heir presumptive]].

However, Charles decided to amend the Pact to give his own future daughters precedence over his nieces. On 19 April 1713, he announced the changes in a secret session of the council.&lt;ref name="Holborn, 128"&gt;Holborn, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Securing the right to succeed for his own daughters, who were not even born yet, became Charles's obsession. The previous succession laws had also forbidden the partition of the Habsburg dominions and provided for succession by females, but that had been mostly hypothetical. The Pragmatic Sanction was the first such document to be publicly announced and so required formal acceptance by the estates of the realms affected.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrao, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign recognition==
For 10 years, Charles VI labored, with the support of his closest advisor, Johann Christoph von Bartenstein, to have his sanction accepted by the courts of Europe. Only the Electorate of Saxony and the Electorate of Bavaria did not accept it because it was detrimental to their inheritance rights. ([[Augustus III of Poland|Frederick Augustus II]], [[Elector of Saxony]] was married to [[Maria Josepha of Austria]] and [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], [[Elector of Bavaria]] to [[Maria Amalia of Austria]], both daughters of Charles's deceased elder brother [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]].)

* France accepted in exchange for the duchy of Lorraine, under the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)]].
* Spain's acceptance was also gained under the Treaty of Vienna (1738). In 1731, the 15-year-old Spanish prince Charles became the Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as Charles I, on the death of his childless granduncle Antonio Farnese. He went on to conquer Naples and Sicily, after which he returned Parma to the Emperor by the Treaty of Vienna (1738). In 1759, he became King of Spain as [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]].
* Great Britain and the Dutch Republic accepted in exchange for the cessation of operations of the [[Ostend Company]].
* King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] approved out of loyalty to the Emperor.

Charles VI made commitments with Russia and Augustus of Saxony, King of Poland, which caused two wars: the [[War of the Polish Succession]] against France and Spain, which cost him Naples and Sicily, and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)|Austro-Russian–Turkish War]], which cost him Little Wallachia and northern Serbia, including the [[Fortress of Belgrade]].

==Internal recognition==
[[Hungary]], which had an elective kingship, had accepted the house of Habsburg as hereditary kings in the male line without election in 1687 but not [[semi-Salic]] inheritance. The Emperor-King agreed that if the Habsburg male line became extinct, Hungary would once again have an elective monarchy; the same was the rule in the Kingdom of Bohemia.

Maria Theresa, however, still gained the throne of Hungary. The Hungarian Parliament voted its own [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1723]] in which the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] accepted female [[inheritance]] supporting her to become queen of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy"|author=R. W. SETON -WATSON: The southern Slav question|page =22|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Dalmatia Croatia Slavonia Bosnia 1720 Matthaeus Seuteri.png|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and other Croatian lands at the time of the Pragmatic Sanction]]
Croatia was one of the crown lands that supported Emperor Charles's Pragmatic Sanction of 1713&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=404|title=Hrvatski sabor|website=www.sabor.hr|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported Empress Maria Theresa in the War of the Austrian Succession of 1741–48 and the Croatian Parliament signed their own [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1712]]. Subsequently, the empress made significant contributions to Croatian matters by making several changes in the administrative control of the Military Frontier, the feudal and tax system. She also gave the independent port of Rijeka to Croatia in 1776.

==Outcome==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
Charles VI spent the time of his reign preparing Europe for a female ruler, but he did not prepare his daughter, Maria Theresa. He would not read documents to her, take her to meetings or allow her to be introduced to ministers or have any preparation for the power she would receive in 1740. It is possible that the reason was that such instruction would imply an acceptance of his inability to produce a male heir.

Charles VI managed to get the great European powers to agree to the Pragmatic Sanction (for the time being) and died in 1740 with no male heirs. However, France, [[Prussia]], Bavaria, and Saxony broke their promises and contested the claims of his daughter Maria Theresa on his Austrian lands, and initiated the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], in which Austria lost [[Silesia]] to Prussia.

Further, the elective office of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was filled by Joseph I's son-in-law [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles Albert]] of Bavaria, marking the first time in several hundred years that the position was not held by a Habsburg. As Emperor Charles VII, he lost his own country, Bavaria, to the Austrian army of his wife's cousin Maria Theresa and then died. His son, [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria]], renounced claims on Austria in exchange for the return of his paternal duchy of Bavaria. Maria Theresa's husband was elected Holy Roman Emperor as [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] in 1745. The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], in 1748, finally recognized Maria Theresa's rule.

In the [[United States]] under the [[Securities Act of 1933]], any offer to sell [[securities]] must either be registered with the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) or meet certain qualifications to exempt them from such registration. '''Regulation D''' (or '''Reg D''') contains the rules providing exemptions from the registration requirements, allowing some companies to offer and sell their securities without having to register the securities with the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/answers/regd.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A Regulation D offering is intended to make access to the capital markets possible for small companies that could not otherwise bear the costs of a normal SEC registration. Reg D may also refer to an [[investment strategy]], mostly associated with [[hedge fund]]s, based upon the same regulation. 
The regulation is found under Title 17 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], part 230, Sections 501 through 508. The legal citation is 17 C.F.R. §230.501 ''et seq.''

On July 10, 2013, the SEC issued new final regulations allowing public advertising and solicitation of Regulation D offers to accredited investors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2013/2013-124-item1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Reg D is composed of various rules prescribing the qualifications needed to meet exemptions from registration requirements for the issuance of securities. Rule 501 of Reg D contains definitions that apply to the rest of Reg D. Rule 502 contains the general conditions that must be met to take advantage of the exemptions under Regulation D. Generally speaking, these conditions are (1) that all sales within a certain time period that are part of the same Reg D offering must be "integrated", meaning they must be treated as one offering, (2) information and disclosures must be provided, (3) there must be no "general solicitation", and (4) that the securities being sold contain restrictions on their resale. Rule 503 requires issuers to file a [[Form D]] with the SEC when they make an offering under Regulation D. In Rules 504 and 505, Regulation D implements §3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (also referred to as the '33 Act), which allows the SEC to exempt issuances of under $5,000,000 from registration. It also provides (in Rule 506) a "safe harbor" under §4(2) of the '33 Act (which says that non-public offerings are exempt from the registration requirement). In other words, if an issuer complies with the requirements of Rule 506, it can be assured that its offering is "non-public," and thus that it is exempt from registration. Rule 507 penalizes issuers who do not file the [[Form D]], as required by Rule 503. Rule 508 provides the guidelines under which the SEC enforces Regulation D against issuers.

==Exemptions==
Regulation D establishes three exemptions from Securities Act registration.

===Rule 504===
Rule 504 provides an exemption for the offer and sale of up to $5,000,000 of securities in a 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer-small-entity-compliance.html&lt;/ref&gt; The company may use this exemption so long as it is not a [[blank check company]] and is not subject to Exchange Act of 1934 reporting requirements. General offering and solicitations are permitted under Rule 504 as long as they are restricted to accredited investors.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2015}}  The issuer need not restrict purchaser's right to resell securities.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2015}}

Rule 504 allows companies to sell securities that are not restricted if one of the following conditions is met:

*The offering is registered exclusively in one or more states that require a publicly filed registration statement and delivery of a substantive disclosure document to investors;
*The registration and sale takes place in a state that requires registration and disclosure delivery, and the buyer is in a state without those requirements, so long as the disclosure documents mandated by the state in which you registered to all purchasers are delivered; or
*The securities are sold exclusively according to state law exemptions that permit general solicitation and advertising and you are selling only to accredited investors. However, accredited investors are only needed when sold exclusively with state law exemptions on solicitation.

===Rule 505===
On October 26, 2016, the Commission repealed Rule 505.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-226.html&lt;/ref&gt; It previously provided an exemption for offers and sales of securities totaling up to $5 million in any 12-month period. Under this exemption, securities could be sold to an unlimited number of "accredited investors" and up to 35 "unaccredited investors".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-226.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rule 505 exemption was phased out and its provisions integrated into the Rule 504 exemption. Rule 504's capital limit increased to $5 million and Rule 505's "Bad Actor" provision was added to Rule 504.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-226.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer-small-entity-compliance.html#_ftn2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule 506===
A company that satisfies the following standards may qualify for an exemption under this rule:

*Can raise an unlimited amount of capital;
*Seller must be available to answer questions by prospective purchasers;
* Financial statement requirements as for Rule 505; and
* Purchasers receive restricted securities, which may not be freely traded in the secondary market after the offering.
The rule is split into two options based on whether the issuer will engage in general solicitation or advertising to market the securities.

If the issuer will not use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities then the sale of securities can be issued under Rule 506(b) to an unlimited number of accredited investors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 506 of Regulation D|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/rule506.htm|author=Securities and Exchange Commission|date=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 35 other purchasers. Unlike Rule 505, all non-accredited investors, either alone or with a purchaser representative, must be sophisticated – that is, they must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment.

In July 2013, the SEC issued new regulations as required by 2012 [[Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2013/2013-124-item1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These new regulations add Rule 506(c) to allow general solicitation and advertising for a private placement offering. However, in a Rule 506(c) private offering all of the purchasers must be [[accredited investors]] and the issuer must take reasonable steps to determine that the purchaser is an [[Accredited investors|accredited investor]].&lt;ref&gt;FACT SHEET: Eliminating the Prohibition on General Solicitation and General Advertising in Certain Offerings https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2013/2013-124-item1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accredited investor exemption===
Section 4(5) of the '33 Act exempts from registration offers and sales of securities to [[accredited investors]] when the total offering price is less than $5 million and no public solicitation or advertising is made. However, Regulation D does not address the offering of securities under this section of the '33 Act. This definition is also used in defining the size of investment allowed under [[Regulation A]].

==Other countries==
In Canada, comparables to Reg D securities are termed [[exempt market securities]] and fall under National Instrument 45-106.

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Restorative justice''' is an approach to [[justice]] in which the response to a [[crime]] is to organize a mediation between the victim and the offender, and sometimes with representatives of a wider community as well. The goal is to negotiate for a resolution to the satisfaction of all participants. This may include a restitution to be given from the offender to the victim, or to take steps to prevent the offender from causing future harm.

A restorative justice program aims to get offenders to take responsibility for their actions, to understand the harm they have caused, to give them an opportunity to redeem themselves and to discourage them from causing further harm. For victims, its goal is to give them an active role in the process.&lt;ref&gt;"A New Kind of Criminal Justice", ''Parade'', October 25, 2009, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Restorative justice is founded on an alternative theory to the traditional methods of justice, which often focus on [[Retributive justice|retribution]]. However, restorative justice programs can complement traditional methods.

Academic assessment of restorative justice is positive. Most studies suggest it makes offenders less likely to reoffend. A 2007 study also found that it had the highest rate of victim satisfaction and offender accountability of any method of justice.&lt;ref name="sas.upenn.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iirp.edu/pdf/RJ_full_report.pdf|author1=Lawrence W Sherman  |author2=Heather Strang  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Restorative Justice: The Evidence |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use has seen worldwide growth since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|author=Joanna Shapland| date=December 2013|accessdate=12 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Restorative justice inspired and is part of the wider study of [[restorative practices]].

==Definition==
According to [[John Braithwaite (criminologist)|John Braithwaite]], restorative justice is:&lt;ref name="Braithwaite0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Restorative Justice and De-Professionalization|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/good_society/v013/13.1braithwaite.html|journal = The Good Society|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 1538-9731|pages = 28–31|volume = 13|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/gso.2004.0023|first = John|last = Braithwaite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...a process where all stakeholders affected by an injustice have an opportunity to discuss how they have been affected by the injustice and to decide what should be done to repair the harm. With crime, restorative justice is about the idea that because crime hurts, justice should heal. It follows that conversations with those who have been hurt and with those who have inflicted the harm must be central to the process.}}
Although law professionals may have secondary roles in facilitating the restorative justice process, it is the citizens who must take up the majority of the responsibility in healing the pains caused by crime.&lt;ref name="Braithwaite0" /&gt; The process of restorative justice thus shifts the responsibility for addressing crime.

In 2014, Carolyn Boyes-Watson from [[Suffolk University]] defined restorative justice as:
{{quote|...a growing social movement to institutionalize peaceful approaches to harm, problem-solving and violations of legal and human rights. These range from international peacemaking tribunals such as the South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission to innovations within the criminal and juvenile justice systems, schools, social services and communities. Rather than privileging the law, professionals and the state, restorative resolutions engage those who are harmed, wrongdoers and their affected communities in search of solutions that promote repair, reconciliation and the rebuilding of relationships. Restorative justice seeks to build partnerships to reestablish mutual responsibility for constructive responses to wrongdoing within our communities.  Restorative approaches seek a balanced approach to the needs of the victim, wrongdoer and community through processes that preserve the safety and dignity of all."&lt;ref&gt;Boyes-Watson, C. (2014). Suffolk University, College of Arts &amp; Sciences, Center for Restorative Justice&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Difference from other approaches ===
According to [[Howard Zehr]], restorative justice differs from traditional criminal justice in terms of the guiding questions it asks. In restorative justice, the questions are:
# Who has been hurt?
# What are their needs?
# Whose obligations are these?
# What are the causes?
# Who has a stake in the situation?
# What is the appropriate process to involve stakeholders in an effort to address causes and put things right?&lt;ref&gt;Zehr, Howard. Changing Lenses – A New Focus for Crime and Justice. Scottdale PA: 2005 (3rd ed), 271.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, traditional criminal justice asks:
# What laws have been broken?
# Who did it?
# What do the offender(s) deserve?&lt;ref&gt;Zehr, Howard. ''The Little Book of Restorative Justice'', Intercourse, PA: Good Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Restorative justice is also different from the [[Adversarial process|adversarial legal process]] or that of [[Civil law (common law)|civil litigation]].

As Braithwaite writes, "Court-annexed ADR ([[alternative dispute resolution]]) and restorative justice could not be philosophically further apart". While the former seeks to address only legally relevant issues and to protect both parties' rights, restorative justice aims at "expanding the issues beyond those that are legally relevant, especially into underlying relationships."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pjAd2u2j3DMC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=%22restorative+justice%22+%22civil+law%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eHMe7z80sU&amp;sig=R6udg56XDHU4Km0sFz0gOSHkgb0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result Braithwaite, J. ''Restorative Justice &amp; Responsive Regulation'' 2002], Oxford University Press, at 249. {{ISBN|0-19-515839-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== History of the term ===
The phrase "restorative justice" has appeared in written sources since the first half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/53264449/Restorative_Justice_and_the_South_African_Truth_and_Reconciliation_Process.pdf |title=See pages 13–18 in Gade, C.B.N. 2013. Restorative Justice and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Process, ''South African Journal of Philosophy'' 32(1), 10–35 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern usage of the term dates from 1977 Albert Eglash the modern definition in 1977. Eglash distinguished between three approaches to justice:
# "retributive justice", based on punishment;
# "distributive justice", involving therapeutic treatment of offenders;
# "restorative justice", based on restitution with input from victims and offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ness, Daniel W., Karen Heetderks Strong. ''Restoring Justice – An Introduction to Restorative Justice''. 4th ed. New Province, N.J.: Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc., 2010: 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors in indigenous groups===
According to Howard Zehr, "Two peoples have made very specific and profound contributions to practices in the field – the [[First Nations]] people of [[Canada]] and [[United States|the U.S]]., and the [[Māori people|Maori]] of [[New Zealand]]... [I]n many ways, restorative justice represents a validation of values and practices that were characteristic of many indigenous groups," whose traditions were "often discounted and repressed by western colonial powers".&lt;ref&gt;Zehr, Howard. ''Changing Lenses – A New Focus for Crime and Justice''. Scottdale PA: 2005, 268–69.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in New Zealand/[[Aotearoa]], prior to European contact, the Maori had a well-developed system called [[Utu (Māori concept)|Utu]] that protected individuals, social stability and the integrity of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/publications-archived/2001/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/utu |title=Utu |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice, New Zealand]] |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restorative justice (sometimes known in these contexts as ''circle justice'') continues to be a feature of indigenous justice systems today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Justin Blake Richland|author2=Sarah Deer|title=Introduction to Tribal Legal Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwpZRZKncbcC|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7591-1211-7|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VwpZRZKncbcC&amp;pg=PA347 347]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of theory ===
Howard Zehr's book ''Changing Lenses–A New Focus for Crime and Justice'', first published in 1990, is credited with being "groundbreaking",&lt;ref&gt;Dorne, Clifford K. ''Restorative Justice in the United States''. N.J.: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008: 167.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being one of the first to articulate a theory of restorative justice.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ness, Daniel W., Karen Heetderks Strong. ''Restoring Justice – An Introduction to Restorative Justice''. 4th ed. New Province, N.J.: Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc., 2010: 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of this book refers to providing an alternative framework for thinking about – or new lens for viewing – crime and justice.&lt;ref&gt;Dorne, Clifford K. ''Restorative Justice in the United States''. N.J.: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Changing Lenses'' juxtaposed a "retributive justice" framework, where crime is viewed as an offense against the state, with a restorative justice framework, where crime is viewed as a violation of people and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Gerry, Daniel W. Van Ness. Handbook of Restorative Justice. Devon, UK: Willan Publishing, 2007: 55 (footnote).&lt;/ref&gt; The book made reference to the positive results of efforts in the late 1970s and 1980s at victim-offender mediation, pioneered in the United States by Howard Zehr, Ron Claassen and Mark Umbreit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Van Ness, Daniel W., Karen Heetderks Strong. ''Restoring Justice–An Introduction to Restorative Justice''. 4th ed. New Province, N.J.: Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc., 2010: 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the 1990s, the expression "restorative justice" had become popular, evolving to widespread usage by 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Gerry, Daniel W. Van Ness. Handbook of Restorative Justice. Devon, UK: Willan Publishing, 2007: 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The restorative justice movement has attracted many segments of society, including "police officers, judges, schoolteachers, politicians, juvenile justice agencies, victim support groups, aboriginal elders, and mums and dads."&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Gerry, Daniel W. Van Ness. Handbook of Restorative Justice. Devon, UK: Willan Publishing, 2007: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Restorative justice is a fast-growing state, national, and international social movement that seeks to bring together people to address the harm caused by crime," write Mark Umbreit and Marilyn Peterson Armour. "Restorative justice views violence, community decline, and fear-based responses as indicators of broken relationships. It offers a different response, namely the use of restorative solutions to repair the harm related to conflict, crime, and victimization."&lt;ref&gt;Umbreit, Mark, Marilyn Peterson Armour. ''Restorative Justice Dialogue – An Essential Guide for Research and Practice''. New York: Springer Publishing Co., 2011: 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of practice===
In North America, the growth of restorative justice has been facilitated by NGOs dedicated to this approach to justice, such as the Victim Offender Mediation Association, as well as by the establishment of academic centers, such as the [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] at [[Eastern Mennonite University]] in Virginia, the [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Restorative Justice and Peacemaking, the Community Justice Institute at [[Florida Atlantic University]], the Center for Peacemaking and Conflict Studies at [[Fresno Pacific University]] in California, and the Centre for Restorative Justice at [[Simon Fraser University]] in British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Gerry, Daniel W. Van Ness. ''Handbook of Restorative Justice''. Devon, UK: Willan Publishing, 2007: 512.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Mennonite]]s and the social-action arm of their church-community, [[Mennonite Central Committee]], were among the early proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Dorne, Clifford K. ''Restorative Justice in the United States''. N.J.: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008: 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, Gerry, Daniel W. Van Ness. Handbook of Restorative Justice. Devon, UK: Willan Publishing, 2007: 512.&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he antinomian groups advocating and supporting restorative justice, such as the Mennonites (as well as Amish and Quaker groups), subscribe to principled pacifism and also tend to believe that restorative justice is much more humane than the punitive juvenile and criminal justice systems."&lt;ref&gt;Dorne, Clifford K. ''Restorative Justice in the United States''. N.J.: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008: 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of restorative justice in continental Europe, especially the German speaking countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, is somewhat different from the Anglo-Saxon experience. For example, victim-offender mediation is just one model of restorative justice, but in the present European context it is the most important one.&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan, Christa/Trenczek, Thomas: Victim-offender mediation and Restorative Justice - the European landscape, in Sullivan, D./Tifft, L.

Restorative justice may be moving towards restorative practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trenczek]], T. Restorative justice: new paradigm, sensitising theory or even practice?.

==Application==
===In system-wide offences===
The [[South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] shows how restorative justice can be used to address system-wide offenses that affect broad swaths of a group or a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leebaw|first=Bronwyn|title=Legitimation or Judgment? South Africa's Restorative Approach to Transitional Justice|journal=Polity|year=2003|volume=36|issue=1|pages=23–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In criminal cases===
In criminal cases, victims can testify about the crime's impact upon their lives, receive answers to questions about the incident, and participate in holding the offender accountable. Meanwhile, offenders can tell their story of why the crime occurred and how it has affected their lives. They are given an opportunity to compensate the victim directly – to the degree possible.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Zaibert, ''Punishment And Retribution'' (Ashgate Publishing 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal cases, this can include money, community service in general and/or specific to the offense, education to prevent recidivism, and/or expression of remorse.

A courtroom process might employ pretrial diversion, dismissing charges after restitution. In serious cases, a sentence may precede other restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/ProbationPretrialServices/FederalProbationJournal/FederalProbationJournal.aspx?doc=/uscourts/FederalCourts/PPS/Fedprob/2009-06/index.html |title=Pono Kaulike: A Hawaii Criminal Court Provides Restorative Justice Practices for Healing Relationships |publisher=Uscourts.gov |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301023628/http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/ProbationPretrialServices/FederalProbationJournal/FederalProbationJournal.aspx?doc=%2Fuscourts%2FFederalCourts%2FPPS%2FFedprob%2F2009-06%2Findex.html |archivedate=2015-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the community, concerned individuals meet with all parties to assess the experience and impact of the crime. Offenders listen to victims' experiences, preferably until they are able to empathize with the experience. Then they speak to their own experience: how they decided to commit the offense. A plan is made for prevention of future occurrences, and for the offender to address the damage to the injured parties. All agree. Community members hold the offender(s) accountable for adherence to the plan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=as presented, this seems ludicrous. What if not all agree? What if the offender claims to be innocent? What if the offender has no remorse?}}

While restorative justice typically involves an encounter between the offender and the victim, some organizations, such as the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] Canada, emphasize a program's values over its participants. This can include programs that only serve victims (or offenders for that matter), but that have a restorative framework. Indigenous groups are using the restorative justice process to try to create more community support for victims and offenders, particularly the young people. For example, different programs are underway at [[Kahnawake]], a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] reserve in Canada, and at the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] of the [[Oglala Lakota]] nation, within the United States.

===In prisons===
Besides serving as an alternative to civil or criminal trial, restorative justice is also thought to be applicable to offenders who are currently incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;Toews, Barb. ''The Little Book of Restorative Justice for People in Prison–Rebuilding the Web of Relationships," Good Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of restorative justice in prisons is to assist with the prisoner's [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], and eventual [[Social integration|reintegration]] into society. By repairing the harm to the relationships between offenders and victims, and offenders and the community that resulted from the crime, restorative justice seeks to understand and address the circumstances which contributed to the crime. This is thought to prevent [[recidivism]] (that is, that the offender repeats the undesirable behavior) once the offender is released.

The potential for restorative justice to reduce recidivism is one of the strongest and most promising arguments for its use in prisons. However, there are both theoretical and practical limitations, which can make restorative justice unfeasible in a prison environment. These include: difficulty engaging offenders and victims to participate in mediation; the controversial influence of family, friends, and the community; and the prevalence of mental illness among prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albrecht|first=Berit|title=The Limits of Restorative Justice in Prison|journal=Peace Review|year=2011|volume=23|issue=3|pages=327–34|doi=10.1080/10402659.2011.596059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In social work===
In social work cases, impoverished victims such as [[Foster care|foster children]] are given the opportunity to describe their future hopes and make concrete plans to transition out of state custody in a group process with their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Lorenn|location=|url=http://www.voma.org/connect.shtml |title=E Makua Ana Youth Circles: A Transition Planning Process for Youth Exiting Foster Care |date=Fall 2005 |journal=VOMA Connections | number=21 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In social justice cases, restorative justice is used for problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, J., Restorative Justice and Responsive Regulation, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In schools===
Restorative justice has also been implemented in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iirp.org |title=The International Institute for Restorative Practices |publisher=Iirp.org |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.six.somerset.gov.luofuk/eis/view_folder.asp?folderid=6456&amp;depth=3&amp;rootid=6456&amp;level2id=&amp;level1=6456&amp;level2=6510&amp;level3=6548 Restorative Justice in Somerset]&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a similar model to programs used by the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jeanne Stinchcomb; Gordon Bazemore; Nancy Riestenberg|date=April 2006|title=Beyond Zero Tolerance: Restoring Justice in Secondary Schools|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=234985|journal= Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice|volume=4|issue=2|pages=123–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restorative practices can "also include preventive measures designed to build skills and capacity in students as well as adults."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punitive or Restorative: The Choice Is Yours|last=Smith|first=D|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of preventative measures in restorative practices might include teachers and students devising classroom expectations together or setting up community building in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Restorative justice also focuses on justice as needs and obligations, expands justice as conversations between the offender, victim and school, and recognizes accountability as understanding the impact of actions and repairing the harm.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=alvis|first=m|date=2015|title=Teachers' perceptions about using restorative practices based on programs in school|url=|journal=The College at Brockport: State of University of New Yor|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, teachers, students and the community can reach agreements to meet all stakeholders’ needs.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Collectivity is emphasized as the group must create an action plan to heal the harm and find a way to bring the offender back into the community.&lt;ref name="Robbins 2014 1–60"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Brian|date=2014|title=A study of the implementation of restorative justice at a public high school in southern California|url=|journal=Claremont College|volume=|pages=1–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the focus is in making the victim(s) whole, the added benefit of restorative justice programs are a reduction in disciplinary actions such as suspensions and expulsions, and more effective reformative and/or reconciliatory  actions imposed, such as writing apology letters, performing community service or- for example, in cases of bullying- composing a research paper on the negative effects of bullying.  
This approach develops and fosters empathy, as participating parties must come to understand the needs of all stakeholders in order for the conflict to be fully rectified.  Both the offending party and the wronged/victimized party can address and begin to resolve their obstacles to achieving their education, with the aid of the restorative justice partners.  Behavioral problems stemming from grief, for example, may be recognized and acknowledged within restorative justice programs; as a result, the party would be referred to a counselor to receive grief counseling.     
By approaching student discipline with restorative justice in the forefront, conflicts may be resolved to meet the funding needs of the school district- by way of reduced student absenteeism, rehabilitate the offending party, and to restore justice and make whole the wronged party. Collectivity and empathy are further developed by having students participate in restorative justice circles in administering roles such as mediators or jurors.

==Methods==
Restorative justice requires a form of meeting between the offender and the victim. A 2013 Cochrane review stressed the need for the offender to meet the victim face-to-face.&lt;ref name="Cochrane"/&gt; In addition, the meeting may include people representing the wider community.

Suggested reasons for why it can be effective include:
*The offender has to learn about the harm they have caused to their victim, making it hard for them to justify their behavior.
*It offers a chance to discuss moral development to offenders who may have had little of it in their life.
*Offenders are more likely to view their punishment as legitimate.
*The programs tend to avoid shaming and stigmatizing the offender.&lt;ref name="cop-ww"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatworks.college.police.uk/toolkit/Pages/Intervention.aspx?InterventionID=24|title=Restorative Justice - What Works|publisher=[[College of Policing]]|accessdate=2018-05-25|date=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many restorative justice systems, especially victim-offender mediation and family group conferencing, require participants to sign a [[confidentiality agreement]]. These agreements usually state that conference discussions will not be disclosed to nonparticipants. The rationale for confidentiality is that it promotes open and honest communication.

===Victim-offender mediation===
Victim-offender [[mediation]], (VOM, also called victim-offender dialogue, victim-offender conferencing, victim-offender reconciliation, or restorative justice dialogue), is usually a meeting, in the presence of a trained mediator, between victim and offender. This system generally involves few participants, and often is the only option available to incarcerated offenders. VOM originated in Canada as part of an alternative [[court sanction]] in a 1974 [[Kitchener, Ontario]] case involving two accused vandals who met face-to-face with their many victims.&lt;ref&gt;Peachey, D. (1989) ‘The Kitchener experiment,’ min M. Wright and B. Galaway (eds.) Mediation and Criminal Justice; victims, offenders and community, London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family group conferencing===
Family group conferencing (FGC) has a wider circle of participants than VOM, adding people connected to the primary parties, such as family, friends and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doolan |first=M. |date=August 7, 1999 |title=The family group conference – 10 years on. Paper presented at "Building Strong Partnerships for Restorative Practices Conference" |location=Burlington, VT|url=http://www.restorativepractices.org/library/vt/vt_doolan.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; FGC is most commonly used for juvenile cases, due to the important role of the family in a juvenile offender's life. Examples can be found in [[New South Wales]] ([[Australia]]) under the 1997 Young Offenders Act, and in New Zealand under the 1989 Children, Young Persons, and their Families Act. The New South Wales scheme has been favorably evaluated by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research.

Fiji utilises this form of mediation when dealing with cases of child sexual assault. While it may be seen as beneficial to involve the victim's family in the process, there are multiple issues stemming from this. For example, the vast majority of offenders are known to the victims in these cases. In a Fijian context, the notion of family extends wider than that of the normative Western idea. Therefore, involving the family in these cases may become complicated, for the family may not necessarily side with the victim or the process itself could cause rifts in within the clan. Furthermore, the process as a whole places much emphasis on the victim forgiving the offender, as opposed to the offender making amends with the victim. This is because Fijian culture greatly values community harmony. Overall, the current process has the potential to cause great trauma and revictimise the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304495447_Child_Sexual_Abuse_in_Fiji_Authority_Risk_Factors_and_Responses|author=Whitehead, John and Roffee, James. |title=Child sexual abuse in Fiji: Authority, risk factors and responses |journal=Current Issues in Criminal Justice|volume= 27|issue= 3|date= Mar 2016|pages =323–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restorative conferences===
Restorative conferences (RC) involves a wider circle of participants than VOM and FGC. There are many different names and procedures of operation for these community-based meetings. They are also referred to as ''Restorative Circles'', ''Restorative Justice Conferences'', ''Community Restorative Boards'' or ''Community Accountability Conferences''. Specific programs have their own names, such as ''Community Justice Committees'' in Canada and ''Referral Order Panels'' in England &amp; Wales. Restorative Circles refers to restorative justice conferences in Brazil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iirp.edu/pdf/brazil.pdf |title=Toward Peace and Justice in Brazil Dominic Barter and Restorative Circles |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10402659.2011.548248 |title=A restorative approach to interpersonal racial conflict |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-03-01 |doi=10.1080/10402659.2011.548248 |volume=23 |journal=Peace Review |pages=37–44|last1=Lyubansky |first1=Mikhail |last2=Barter |first2=Dominic }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hawaii]],&lt;ref&gt;Restorative Circles—A Reentry Planning Process for Hawaii Inmates [http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/FederalCourts/PPS/Fedprob/2010-06/06_restorative_circles.html Restorative circles]&lt;/ref&gt; though can have a wider meaning in the field of [[restorative practices]].

A conference will typically include the victim, the offender and members of the local community, who have typically received some training.&lt;ref name="mineslaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mineslaw.com/node/152|title=Restorative Justice: An Alternative to Court|work=mineslaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family and friends of the offender and victim are frequently invited. RC is explicitly victim-sensitive.&lt;ref name=OWW99&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Connell |first1=Terry |last2=Wachtel |first2=Ben |last3=Wachtel |first3=Ted |title=Conferencing Handbook: The New Real Justice Training Manual |year=1999 |location=Pipersville, PA |publisher=The Piper's Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Morris |first1=A. |last2=Maxwell |first2=G. |year=2001 |chapter=Restorative conferencing |editor1-last=Bazemore |editor1-first=G. |editor2-last=Schiff |editor2-first=M. |title=Restorative community justice: Repairing harm and transforming communities |pages=173–97 |location=Cincinnati, OH |publisher=Anderson Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community members discuss the nature and impact of the offense with the offender. The discussion continues until restitution is agreed; they may also see that the agreement is fulfilled.

The largest restorative justice conference in history took place in the course of a reconciliation campaign that ended the blood feuds among ethnic Albanians in [[Kosovo]] at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which was attended by between 100,000 and 500,000 participants.&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconciliation campaign was led by [[Anton Çetta]]. Over a period of three years (1990-1992) approximately one third of the entire population of Kosovo were documented to be actively involved in restorative justice conferences to end the blood feuds.&lt;ref name="BJC2017"/&gt;

===Circles of Support and Accountability===
{{main|Circles of Support and Accountability}}
''Circles of Support and Accountability'' (CoSA) originated as a project of the "Welcome In", a Mennonite church in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. This approach has demonstrated the capacity to enhance the safe integration of otherwise high-risk sex offenders with their community. Canada judges some sex offenders too dangerous for any form of conditional release, "detaining" them until they serve their entire sentence. A subsequent conviction often leads to designation as a "Dangerous Offender".

Prior to 1994, many such offenders were released without any support or observation beyond police surveillance. Between 1994 and 2007, CoSA assisted with the integration of well over 120 such offenders. Research indicated that surrounding a 'core member' with 5–7 trained volunteer circle members reduced recidivism by nearly 80%.&lt;ref name="cosa"&gt;"Circles of Support &amp; Accountability:A Canadian National Replication of Outcome Findings" Robin J. Wilson, Franca Cortoni, Andrew J. McWhinnie, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Further, recidivist offences were less invasive and less brutal than without the program. CoSA projects now exist in every Canadian province and every major urban centre. CoSA projects are also operational in several U.S. states (Iowa, California, Minnesota, Oregon, Ohio, Colorado, Vermont) as well as in several United Kingdom regions (Cornwall, Devon, Hampshire, Thames Valley, Leicestershire, North Wales, North Yorkshire, and Manchester).

===Sentencing circles===
''Sentencing circles'' (sometimes called peacemaking circles) use traditional circle ritual and structure to involve all interested parties. Sentencing circles typically employ a procedure that includes: (1) application by the offender; (2) a healing circle for the victim; (3) a healing circle for the offender; (4) a sentencing circle; and (5) follow-up circles to monitor progress.

==Other social movements==
=== Positive criminology and positive victimology ===
[[Positive criminology]] and positive victimology are conceptual approaches, developed by the Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that are well connected to restorative justice theories and practice. Positive criminology and victimology both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people’s lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and victimology argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions – social integration, emotional healing and spirituality – that constitute positive direction indicators.

===Prison abolition===
[[Prison abolition movement|Prison abolition]] not only calls for the eradication of cages, but also new perspectives and methodologies for conceptualizing crime, an aim that is shared by restorative justice. In an abolitionist style of restorative justice, participation is voluntary and not limited by the requirements of organizations or professionals, the process includes all relevant stakeholders and is mediated by an independent third party. The emphasis is on meeting the needs of and strengthening the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruggiero|first=Vincenzo|title=An Abolitionist View of Restorative Justice|journal=International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice|year=2011|volume=39|issue=2|pages=100–10|doi=10.1016/j.ijlcj.2011.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A 2007 meta-study of all research projects concerning restorative justice conferencing published in English between 1986 and 2005 found positive results, specifically for victims:&lt;ref name="sas.upenn.edu"/&gt;
* Greater ability to return to work, to resume normal daily activities, and to sleep
* No cases of offenders verbally or violently abusing victims
* Reduced fear of the offender (especially for violence victims); lower perceived likelihood of another offense; increased sense of security; reduced anger towards the offender; greater sympathy for the offender and the offender's supporters; greater feelings of trust in others; increased feelings of self-confidence; reduced anxiety

Other findings included:
* The only principled basis for selectively allowing, or banning, RJ is harm reduction.
* Limited public familiarity and misconceptions about RJ
* Greater availability, together with information about victims' positive views is likely to increase the proportion of victims willing to participate.

In July 2011, the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] published a report entitled "To Live as Other Kenyans do: A Study of the Demands of Kenyan Victims of Human Rights Violations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=ICTJ |author2=Simon Robins |url=http://ictj.org/publication/live-other-kenyans-do-study-reparative-demands-kenyan-victims-human-rights-violations |title="To Live as Other Kenyans Do": A Study of the Reparative Demands of Kenyan Victims of Human Rights Violations &amp;#124; International Center for Transitional Justice |publisher=Ictj.org |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings are based on individual and group interviews of victims of human rights abuses from Kenya's 2007 post-election violence. It highlights the importance of a victim-centered approach to determine the most effective mode of implementation for a comprehensive reparations program.  The main finding of the report is that victims demand tangible basic benefits lost as a product of violence, such as food and shelter.  It also acknowledges the need for symbolic reparations, such as formal apologies. The provision of reparations will in a sense create a restoration of the way life was before violence, and also signal the moving forward of a society through institutional change.

The COREPOL Project (Conflict Resolution, Mediation and Restorative Justice and the Policing of Ethnic Minorities in Germany, Austria and Hungary) tries to broaden the fundament of knowledge concerning applied Restorative Justice concepts in Germany, Austria and Hungary. COREPOL uses a comparative design (Germany, Austria, Hungary) to establish whether better police – minority relations can be achieved through means of a Restorative Justice (RJ) approach. The extent and cultural particularities of RJ programs and their affiliation to the criminal justice system is ascertained. Then specific minority populations (Turks in Germany, Roma in Hungary, Africans in Austria) will be examined in regard to the country's security context. The involvement of police in RJ programs for minority populations will be explored. Finally, the proposed research will exemplify the scope of RJ approaches for the improvement of police – minority communication and interaction. Based on the legality principle and on an inquisitorial civil law tradition of policing and criminal justice, the partner countries' legal and policing systems differ substantially from the Anglo-American-Australian hemisphere of restorative justice. The findings will have a wider impact on the Middle and Eastern EU situation. The research will include open questions of gender, age and cultural compatibility of RJ. With positions at police universities the researchers are well grounded in police science and have carried out previous work on minorities. This grants them access to the field and to practical areas of police work and management. Their principal involvement in B.A./ M.A. programs for police officers and in further European research secures dissemination into police and the scientific community. COREPOL is coordinated by the German Police University and funded through the European Commission´s Seventh Framework Program (FP7).

===Recidivism===
Reduction of recidivism is also a goal of RJ,&lt;ref name=hayes&gt;Hennessey Hayes, "Assessing Reoffending in Restorative Justice Conferences" (2005) 38(1) ''[[Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology]]'' 77&lt;/ref&gt; secondary to the restoration of offenders.&lt;ref name=beven&gt;Jaimie Beven et al., "Restoration or Renovation: Evaluating Restorative Justice Outcomes" (2005) 12(1) ''Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'' 194&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that it can prevent reoffending&lt;ref name=hayes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sbicca |first1=Joshua |year=2016 |title= These Bars Can't Hold Us Back: Plowing Incarcerated Geographies with Restorative Food Justice |journal= Antipode |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages= 1359–79 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anti.12247/abstract |doi=10.1111/anti.12247}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deter other potential criminals.&lt;ref name=braithwaite&gt;John Braithwaite, "Restorative Justice: assessing optimistic and pessimistic accounts" in Michael Tonry (ed), ''Crime and Justice: A Review of Research'' (Volume 25, 1999) 1&lt;/ref&gt; Critics counter that RJ does not significantly influence crime rates.&lt;ref name=beven/&gt;&lt;ref name=braithwaite/&gt;

While some older studies showed mixed results, as of 2013, studies that compared recidivism rates have become more definitive and in favor of Restorative Justice.&lt;ref name=hayes/&gt;&lt;ref name=braithwaite/&gt; Some studies claim modest, relative reductions,&lt;ref name=basire&gt;Katherine Basire, "Taking Restorative Justice Seriously" (2004) 13 ''Canterbury Law Review'' 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bonta&gt;James Bonta et al., "Restorative Justice and Recidivism: Promises Made, Promises Kept?" in Dennis Sullivan and Larry Tifft (eds), ''Handbook of Restorative Justice: A Global Perspective'' (2006) 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voma.org/docs/connect3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Participation in Victim-Offender Mediation Reduces Recidivism|author1=William R. Nugent |author2=Mark S. Umbreit |author3=Lizabeth Wiinamaki |author4=Jeff Paddock |work=VOMA Connections (summer 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6330657.stm |title=Crime meetings 'cut re-offences' |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-02-05 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent studies are finding significant and meaningful reductions in recidivism rates (see below).

A 1998 meta-analysis by Bonta et al. found that restorative justice programs caused mild reductions in reoffending rates.&lt;ref name="lmd05"/&gt; Latimer, Dowden and Muise carried out a meta-analysis that provided a more precise definition.&lt;ref name="lmd05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/vaughnstudy/articles/corrections/Latimer.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Latimer|first1=Jeff |last2=Dowden|first2=Craig|last3=Muise|first3=Danielle|year=2005|title=The Effectiveness of Restorative Justice Practices: A Meta-Analysis" The Prison Journal. 85(2):127–44.}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted the second meta-analysis on the effectiveness of RJ. This study is important because it addresses the [[Publication bias|file-drawer problem]]. Also, some of the studies analyzed implemented a [[randomized controlled trial]] (a gold standard in research methods), although this does not represent the majority of studies included. This meta-analysis lends empirical support for the effectiveness of RJ to lower recidivism rates and increase compliance and satisfaction rates. However, the authors caution that a [[self-selection bias]] is rife through most studies of restorative justice. They reference authors from one study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=McCold |first1=Paul |last2=Wachtel |first2=Benjamin |date=May 1998 |title=Restorative policing experiment: the Bethlehem Pennsylvania police family group conferencing project |location=Pipersville, PA |institution=Community Service Foundation |url=http://rjusticesbc.pbworks.com/f/Bethleham+RJ+Study+1998.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found no evidence that restorative justice has a treatment effect on recidivism beyond a self-selection effect.

The third meta-analysis on the effectiveness of RJ was conducted by Bradshaw, Roseborough, and Umbreit (2006). The results of this meta-analysis add empirical support for the effectiveness of RJ in reducing juvenile recidivism rates.

Since then Baffour (2006) and Rodriguez's (2007) studies also supports the use of RJ over the traditional justice system when it comes to recidivism rates. Bergseth and Bouffard (2007, 2012) supports these findings and also concludes that there may be some long-term effects of RJ over the traditional justice system; as well as RJ being more effective with serious crimes. RJ participants are less likely to commit serious crimes if they do re-offend and they go longer without re-offending. All of these studies found that RJ is equally effective regardless of race.

Sherman &amp; Strang's (2007) book is a review of the previous literature and they conclude that in no way can RJ be more harmful than the traditional justice system. It is at least equally as effective as the traditional justice system in all cases. In most cases (especially with more serious offenses and with adult offenders) it is significantly more effective than the traditional justice system at lowering recidivism rates. These authors conclusions are as follows... 1) Substantially reduced repeat offending for some offenders, but not all. 2) Doubled (or more) the offenders brought to justice as diversion from CJ [Conventional Justice or traditional justice]. 3) Reduced crime victims' post-traumatic stress symptoms and related costs. 4) Provided both victims and offenders with more satisfaction with justice than CJ. 5) Reduced crime victims' desire for violent revenge against their offenders. 6) Reduced the costs of criminal justice, when used as diversion from CJ. 7) Reduced recidivism more than prison (adults) or as well as prison (youths). (Sherman &amp; Strang, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4).

A recent meta-analysis by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] (2013) on the effect of youth justice conferencing on recidivism in young offenders found that there was no significant effect for restorative justice conferencing over normal court procedures for number re-arrested, nor monthly rate of reoffending. They also noted a lack of high quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of restorative justice conferencing for young offenders.&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008898.pub2/abstract|title=Restorative justice conferencing for reducing recidivism in young offenders (aged 7 to 21) | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008898.pub2 | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2013 |last1=Livingstone |first1=Nuala |last2=MacDonald |first2=Geraldine |last3=Carr |first3=Nicola }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Theoretical===
According to Morris, the following are some of the most common criticisms that are used against the practicality or realism of restorative justice:

{{quote|...restorative justice erodes legal rights; restorative justice results in net-widening; restorative justice trivializes crime (particularly men's [[violence against women]]); restorative justice fails to "restore" victims and offenders; restorative justice fails to effect real change and to prevent recidivism; restorative justice results in discriminatory outcomes; restorative justice extends police powers; restorative justice leaves power imbalances untouched; restorative justice leads to [[vigilantism]]; restorative justice lacks legitimacy; and restorative justice fails to provide "justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris|first=Allison|title=Critiquing the Critics: A Brief Response to Critics of Restorative Justice|journal=The British Journal of Criminology: an International Review of Crime and Society|year=2002|volume=42|issue=3|pages=596–615|doi=10.1093/bjc/42.3.596}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another critique of restorative justice suggests that professionals are often left out of the restorative justice conversation. Albert W. Dzur and Susan M. Olson argue that this sector of justice cannot be successful without professionals. They claim that professionals can aid in avoiding problems that come up with informal justice and propose the theory of democratic professionalism, where professionals are not just agents of the state – as traditional understandings would suggest – but as mediums, promoting community involvement while still protecting individuals' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dzur|first=Albert W.|author2=Susan M. Olson |title=Revisiting Informal Justice: Restorative Justice And Democratic Professionalism|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|year=2004|volume=38|issue=1|pages=139–76|doi=10.1111/j.0023-9216.2004.03801005.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some critics like Gregory Shank and Paul Takagi see restorative justice as an incomplete model in that it fails to fix the fundamental, structural inequalities that make certain people more likely to be offenders than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shank|first=Gregory|author2=Paul Takagi |title=Critique of Restorative Justice|journal=Social Justice|year=2004|volume=31|issue=3|pages=147–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They and others question the structure of society and the fairness of institutional systems at their very core, pushing for addressing the root causes of many one-on-one offenses as well as for creating a socio-economic system that will be more conducive to harmonious, healthy living in general.&lt;ref&gt;Lofton, Bonnie Price. "Does Restorative Justice Challenge Systemic Injustices?" in Critical Issues in Restorative Justice (2004), edited by Howard Zehr and Barb Toews.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, some researchers agree that more research must be conducted to support the validity of restorative justice in schools, specifically in how its implemented.&lt;ref name="Robbins 2014 1–60"/&gt; More exactly, restorative justice practices that are inconsistent, insufficient, or run out of funding tend to have the worst reputations for success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armour|first=M|date=2013|title=Restorative Justice in School Communities:Successes, Obstacles, and Areas for Improvement|url=|journal=The University of Texas School of Social Wor|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many research studies support positive findings in restorative justice, continuing studies are still needed.

===Limitations and issues in practice===
Some judicial systems only recognize monetary restitution agreements. For instance, if victim and offender agree that the offender would pay $100 and mow the victim's lawn five times, the court would only recognize the $100 as restitution.  Some agreements specify a larger monetary amount (e.g., $200) to be paid if the non-monetary restitution is not completed.

Many jurisdictions cap the amount which a juvenile offender can be required to pay. [[Labor law|Labor regulations]] typically limit the personal service tasks that can be performed by [[Minor (law)|minors]]. In addition, personal service usually must be approved by the juvenile's parents.

According to the Victim Offender Mediation Association, victims are not allowed to profit from restitution (the equivalent of [[punitive damages]]); only [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket losses]] ([[actual damages]]) can be recovered. Courts can disallow unreasonable compensation arrangements.

==In the media==
Studies by Kelly M. Richards have shown that the general public would be open to the idea of alternative forms of justice, though only after the idea has been explicitly explained to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richards|first=Kelly M.|title=Unlikely Friends? Oprah Winfrey And Restorative Justice|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology|year=2005|volume=38|issue=5|pages=381–99|doi=10.1375/acri.38.3.381}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other studies performed by Vicky De Mesmaecker, in order for restorative justice to become publicly accepted, there must be an effective public relations collaboration between the media and the criminologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Mesmaecker|first=Vicky|title=Building Social Support For Restorative Justice Through The Media: Is Taking the Victim Perspective The Most Appropriate Strategy?|journal=Contemporary Justice Review|year=2010|volume=13|issue=3|pages=239–67|doi=10.1080/10282580.2010.498225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[forgiveness]] as a tool has in the restorative justice programs, run for victims and perpetrators of [[Rwandan genocide]], the violence in [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and [[Northern Ireland conflict]], has also been documented in film, ''[[Beyond Right and Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The key to forgiveness is the refusal to seek revenge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belief/2013/feb/08/key-forgiveness-refusal-seek-revenge |publisher=The Guardian |date=8 February 2013|accessdate=Feb 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond Right &amp; Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness|url=http://theforgivenessproject.com/beyond-right-wrong-stories-of-justice-and-forgiveness/ |date=February 1, 2013 |publisher=Forgiveness Project|accessdate=Feb 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tribal form of restorative justice is portrayed in the book ''Touching Spirit Bear'' by [[Ben Mikaelsen]].

The 2017 documentary ''[[A Better Man (film)|A Better Man]]'' follows a meeting between a woman who is recovering from [[domestic violence]] and the ex-partner.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta-Scott, T., (2017).

The '''School Infrastructure Local Option''' (SILO) is a 1% local option [[sales tax]] adopted on a county by county basis in [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. Although the tax is collected by county, state mandate says the total amount collected is to be pooled and shared between the school districts. SILO was developed in 1998 by the [[Iowa General Assembly]] to give school districts a revenue options other than the [[property tax]]. The tax can be enacted for up to 10 years at a time. As of late 2005, only [[Linn County, Iowa|Linn]] and [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]] counties in Iowa had not enacted a SILO tax. In the spring of 2006 the Iowa legislature encouraged the two remaining counties to join the other 97 counties which had enacted this tax by offering an incentive provided the tax was enacted by July 1, 2008, allowing the districts to keep 100% of the money generated for the first half of the time it is collected instead of pooling it statewide. A vote was scheduled in both counties for February 13, 2007 where it was approved, 58% to 42% in Linn County and 67% to 33% in Johnson County. The tax for both counties went into effect on July 1, 2007 for a period of 10 years, making it a statewide tax. Iowa currently has a 5% state sales tax rate in addition to the 1% SILO tax and any other Local Option Sales Taxes (LOST) which may be in effect in each county, often an additional 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School Infrastructure Local Option Sales Tax |url=https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/IR/6423.pdf |publisher=Iowa Legislative Services Agency Fiscal Services |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shouwang Church''' (守望教会) is a [[Protestant]] [[house church (China)|house church]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and almost the biggest of about 3,000 of such  congregations in the city. The word ''shouwang'' means "to keep watch" in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].&lt;ref name=Gauthier&gt;{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Ursula|title=Why Do Christian Groups in China Put Authorities on Red Alert?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2075386,00.html|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and membership==
The church was founded in 1993 by Jin Tianming, a chemical engineering graduate of [[Tsinghua University]] of [[Koreans in China|Korean]] ethnicity.&lt;ref name="duihua.org"&gt;''Dui Hua'', issue 46, Winter 2012: ''[http://duihua.org/wp/?p=5313 Uncovering China’s Korean Christians]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of its members has increased from 10 to 1,000 as of June 2011.&lt;ref name=Gauthier /&gt;

The services are conducted at members' homes or in rented conference rooms; its other activities include 40 [[biblical]] reading groups, [[choir]] practice and [[catechism]]. Shouwang members typically belong to the middle and upper classes, and include professors, doctors, lawyers, students and [[Communist Party of China|Party]] members.&lt;ref name=Gauthier /&gt;

==Persecution==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13286">'''State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5''' ({{zh|s=国家宗教事务局令第5号|t=國家宗教事務局令第5號}}), officially named '''Measures on the Management of the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas''' ({{zh|s=藏传佛教活佛转世管理办法|t=藏傳佛教活佛轉世管理辦法}}), is an order from the [[State Administration for Religious Affairs]],&lt;ref name="gov.cn"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:国家宗教事务局令（第5号）藏传佛教活佛转世管理办法|trans-title=State Religious Affairs Bureau Order (No. 5) Measures on the Management of the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas|publisher=[[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China]]|url=http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2008/content_923053.htm|date=n.d.|accessdate=May 4, 2014|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of China]]'s agency charged with keeping religion under state control. Order No. 5 states that a Reincarnation Application must be filed by all Buddhist temples in that country before they are allowed to recognize individuals as [[tulku]]s ([[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] teachers).

[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] believe [[lama]]s and other religious figures can consciously influence how they are reborn, and often are reborn many times so they can continue their religious pursuits. These [[tulku]]s are referred to in sources translated from Chinese as ''living Buddhas''. In 2007, the Chinese government passed a decree, to take effect September 1, that each of these people who plan to be reborn must complete an application and submit it to several government agencies for approval.

== Decree ==
On August 3, 2007, China's [[State Administration for Religious Affairs]] issued a decree that all the reincarnations of tulkus of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] must get government approval, otherwise they are "illegal or invalid". The decree states, "It is an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas. The selection of reincarnates must preserve national unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups and the selection process cannot be influenced by any group or individual from outside the country." It also requires that temples which apply for reincarnation of a living Buddha must be "legally-registered venues for Tibetan Buddhism activities and are capable of fostering and offering proper means of support for the living Buddha."&lt;ref name="gov.cn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-08/04/content_5448242.htm|date=August 4, 2007|title=Reincarnation of living Buddha needs gov't approval|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reincarnation Applications have to be submitted to four governmental bodies for approval, specifically the religious affairs department of the provincial-level government, the provincial-level government, State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the State Council.&lt;ref name="gov.cn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Red"/&gt;

=== Regulation ===
The regulations are composed of 14 articles, including the principle, conditions, approval procedures, the duties and responsibilities of religious groups for reincarnation as well as punishment for those violating the regulations. They allegedly guarantee normal religious activities of Tibetan Buddhism and protect the religious belief of Tibetan Buddhism followers according to law.&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;

The State Administration for Religious Affairs said, "The government only administrate religious affairs related to state and the public interests and will not interfere in the pure internal religious affairs".&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;

=== Impact ===
The official [[Xinhua News Agency]] said the new rules are "an important move to institutionalise management of reincarnation of living Buddhas". Tulkus are indeed an important element in Tibetan Buddhism, forming a clergy of influential religious figures. It is believed they are continuously reincarnated to take up their positions anew. Often there is more than one candidate competing to be recognised as the actual reincarnation, and the authority to decide who is the true claimant carries significant power.&lt;ref name="Red"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22185282-663,00.html|publisher=Melbourne Herald|title=Buddhas' reincarnation red tape|accessdate=August 9, 2007|date=August 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decree was implemented in response to clergy's protests about the reincarnation of living Buddhas "against religious ritual and historical convention", according to the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="rule"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-12/27/content_6351750.htm|title=Rule on living Buddhas aids religious freedom|date= 27 December 2007 |accessdate= 8 July 2015|publisher=[[China Daily]]|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101120603/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-12/27/content_6351750.htm | archivedate = 1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most high-profile dispute about living Buddhas happened between the [[Dalai Lama]] and the Chinese government about the selection of the 1995 [[Panchen Lama]], whose influence in Tibetan Buddhism is second only to the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Red"/&gt; Over 1,000 living Buddhas have been reincarnated through this legal channel in Tibet and other areas in China since 1991.&lt;ref name="rule"/&gt;

== Historical precedents ==
The [[Golden Urn]] was established by the Qing [[Qianlong Emperor]] to allow the [[Qing dynasty]] [[Emperor of China]] to determine the reincarnation of the [[Dalai Lama]] and the [[Panchen Lama]] in case of a dispute. There are two Golden Urns issued by the Qianlong Emperor. One is enshrined in [[Jokhang Temple]] in Lhasa for choosing Dalai and Panchen Lama reincarnations, the other is in [[Yonghe Temple]] in [[Beijing]] for choosing Mongolian [[Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]] reincarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2008, pg. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th Panchen Lama, [[Palden Tenpai Nyima]], used the Golden Urn for the first time in 1822 to choose the 10th Dalai Lama, [[Tsultrim Gyatso]].

Most recently, in November 1995 the Golden Urn was controversially used to name [[Qoigyijabu]] (Gyancain Norbu) as the [[11th Panchen Lama]]. This action was approved by the Chinese government, but opposed by the [[Central Tibetan Administration|Government of Tibet in Exile]]. In May of the same year, the 14th Dalai Lama, [[Tenzin Gyatso]] had named [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] as the [[11th Panchen Lama controversy|11th Panchen Lama]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein1029"&gt;Goldstein 1997, pp. 102-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Khalkha]] Mongol nobles' power was deliberately undermined by Qianlong when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal family of the eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]] Lama instead of the Khalkha Mongol which they wanted to be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Emptiness: Buddhist Art and Political Authority in Qing China|first=Patricia Ann|last=Berger|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BsyFU9FwCIkC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0824825632|accessdate=10 March 2014| page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor, but Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Emptiness: Buddhist Art and Political Authority in Qing China|first=Patricia Ann|last=Berger|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BsyFU9FwCIkC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0824825632|accessdate=10 March 2014| page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols.&lt;ref name="Man2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Man|title=The Great Wall: The Extraordinary Story of China's Wonder of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFlOQRpOiEcC&amp;pg=PT284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=4 August 2009|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7867-3177-0|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10th Panchen Lama [[Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama|Choekyi Gyaltsen]] was born Gonpo Tseten on 19 February 1938 in today's [[Xunhua Salar Autonomous County]] of [[Qinghai]], to Gonpo Tseten and Sonam Drolma. When the [[Thubten Chökyi Nyima|Ninth Panchen Lama]] died in 1937, two simultaneous searches for the tenth Panchen Lama produced two competing candidates, with the government in [[Lhasa]] (who had selected a boy from [[Xikang]]) and the Ninth Panchen Lama's officials (who picked Tseten) in conflict.&lt;ref name="lin"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West |author=Lin, Hsiao-ting |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=2010 |pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government, then embroiled in the [[Chinese Civil War]], declared its support for Tseten on 3 June 1949. [[Guan Jiyu]], the head of the [[Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission]], joined [[Kuomintang]] Governor of Qinghai [[Ma Bufang]] in presiding over Tseten's enthronement on 11 June as Choekyi Gyaltsen at [[Kumbum Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTFjMoAUfcgC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ma+bu-fang+the+governor+has+not+seen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X8zlTZijLYTL0AHI3-n1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chongqing%20kumbum%20installed%20chiang%20nanjing&amp;f=false |title=From conflict to conciliation: Tibetan polity revisited : a brief historical conspectus of the Dalai Lama-Panchen Lama Standoff, ca. 1904–1989 |author=Parshotam Mehra |year=2004 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |location= |page=87 |ISBN=3-447-04914-6 |accessdate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224028/http://books.google.com/books?id=OTFjMoAUfcgC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ma+bu-fang+the+governor+has+not+seen&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X8zlTZijLYTL0AHI3-n1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chongqing%20kumbum%20installed%20chiang%20nanjing&amp;f=false |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama's government in Lhasa still refused to recognize Gyaltsen.&lt;ref name="mckay222"&gt;Melvyn C. Goldstein, in McKay 2003, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panchen Lama supported China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet, and China's reform policies for Tibet.&lt;ref name="mckay222"/&gt; [[Radio Beijing]] broadcast the religious leader's call for Tibet to be "liberated" into Tibet, which created pressure on the Lhasa government to negotiate with the People's Republic.&lt;ref name="lin"/&gt; In 1951, the Panchen Lama was invited to Beijing as the Tibetan delegation was signing the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|17-Point Agreement]] and telegramming the Dalai Lama to implement the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2001&amp;m=8&amp;p=6_2 "The Tenth Panchen Lama"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610100616/http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2001&amp;m=8&amp;p=6_2 |date=10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was recognized by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] when they met in 1952.

The [[7th Dalai Lama]] Kelzang Gyatso was born in [[Litang County|Lithang]] of Eastern Tibet, in the present-day [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] of present-day [[Sichuan]] province.  At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by [[Yeshe Gyatso|Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso]], who had been installed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] as "the real 6th Dalai Lama" in place of [[Tsangyang Gyatso, 6th Dalai Lama|Tsangyang Gyatso]].  Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the [[Nechung Oracle]], identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso.  Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child.  Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training.  In 1715, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into [[Kumbum Monastery]].  This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Mullin27682"&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 276-82&lt;/ref&gt;  He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen.&lt;ref name="Namgyal"&gt;[http://www.namgyalmonastery.org/the-dalai-lamas/his-holiness-the-seventh-dalai-lama-kelsang-gyatso/ Seventh Dalai Lama Kelsang Gyatso]&lt;/ref&gt; His reign started when he was 12.

The '''Statement of 99''' was a statement made by 99 Syrian intellectuals on 27 September 2000, during the [[Damascus Spring]] that followed [[Hafez al-Assad]]'s death in June of the same year. The intellectuals called for the [[state of emergency]] to be ended, for [[political prisoner]]s to be pardoned, for deportees and exiles to be allowed to return, for legal protection for [[free speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]], and to "free public life from the laws, constraints and various forms of surveillance imposed on it".&lt;ref name="alHayat_statementof99" /&gt; Prominent signers included [[Abdulrazak Eid]], [[Anwar al-Bunni]], [[Mamdouh Adwan]], [[Haidar Haidar]] and [[Michel Kilo]].&lt;ref name="alHayat_statementof99" /&gt;
After his death, it became known that Syrian renowned documentary filmmaker [[Omar Amiralay]] wrote the first draft of the statement, and developed it in collaboration with fellow filmmaker [[Usama Muhammad]] and writer/politician [[Mouaffaq Nyrabia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18410">'''Sustainable Development Goal 16''' (Goal 16, SDG16 or SDG 16) - peace, justice and strong institutions - is one of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the [[United Nations]] in 2015. It "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations official website on SDGs: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16&lt;/ref&gt; The Goal has 12 targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards targets will be measured by 23 indicators. [[File:Sustainable Development Goal 16.png|thumb|SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions]]

== Background ==

=== The Sustainable Development Goals ===
{{See also|Sustainable Development Goals}}
The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the [[United Nations]]. The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets to achieve. The total number of targets is 169. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[climate change]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDGs replace the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2002 to end poverty, achieve universal [[education]], [[Women's empowerment|empower women]], reduce [[child mortality]], improve [[maternal health]], combat diseases such as [[HIV]], ensure environment sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Outcome Document of the UN Summit on the 2030 Agenda, ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, includes an emphasis on the importance of achieving progress on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and rule of law, and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual report is prepared by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] evaluating the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2017 report: http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2017/66&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt; SDG 16 is going to be reviewed at the High-Level Political Forum in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf|title=High-level Political Forum .:.

Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Links with other SDGs ==
The Sustainable Development Goals are not taken as being completely independent one from the other, but rather as being closely linked. In this way, [[media development]] enhances freedom of speech, peace, but also contributes to [[sustainability]], poverty eradication and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/fostering-freedom-expression|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fostering peace and inclusive societies can help reduce inequalities (SDG10) and help economies prosper (SDG8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/background.html|title=Background of the Sustainable Development Goals|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 outcome document of the United Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda considers that sustainable development can not be achieved without building peaceful, just and inclusive societies and addressing issues of corruption, poor governance, insecurity and injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some SDGs can be considered as cross-cutting as a whole. It is the case for [[gender equality]] and [[Africa]], which are considered a global priority for UNESCO and a "critical factor for the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/africa/

http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/gender-equality/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==

=== UNDP ===
The [[United Nations Development Programme]] is the United Nations [[International development|global development]] network who is also concerned with SDG 16 as the Programme focuses on [[Democracy|democratic governance]] and peace building.&lt;ref&gt;See official website: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding.html&lt;/ref&gt; The UNDP also works on conflict prevention by supporting empowering women and youth, and supporting regulatory frameworks and mechanisms and by acting as mediators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/conflict-prevention.html|title=Conflict prevention - UNDP|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNDP has provided electoral assistance in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/|title=EC-UNDP Joint Task Force - Partnership on Electoral Assistance|website=www.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
UNESCO’s work on freedom of expression and the [[Safety of Journalists|safety of journalists]] contributes to Goal 16. UNESCO’s approach to media development tries to be knowledge-driven and context-sensitive. The Organization also wants to take into account the new challenges and opportunities of the media environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sdgs/ci|title=Sustainable Development Goals for Communication and Information|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO's communication and information sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/|title=Communication and Information - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for targets 16.3 (access to justice), 16.5 (anti-corruption and transparent and accountable institutions). It aims to: "foster intercultural dialogue, culture of peace and non-violence, and prevent [[violent extremism]] through global citizenship education; support free, independent and pluralistic media, ensure the safety of journalists; protect cultural and natural heritage, strengthen [[Multi-stakeholder governance|governance]] systems for culture and enhance fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247785e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preventing violent extremism ====
Preventing [[violent extremism]] is a way to promote, in official wording, a "culture of peace and non-violence" for UNESCO. The Organization aims to prevent violent extremism by using education as a tool to strengthen [[global citizenship]], by mobilizing youth, women and other stakeholders - such as [[policy]]-makers, researchers and media actors -  to take actions, online and offline, to prevent and respond to violent extremism and [[radicalization]] on the Internet&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002603/260382e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and to promote cultural diversity to foster more fair, inclusive and peaceful societies, through the #Unite4Heritage campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unite4heritage.org/|title=#Unite4Heritage – Celebrating &amp; Safeguarding Cultural Heritage - u4h|website=www.unite4heritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Educational Programmes on Heritage and Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity|title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco.org1"/&gt;

==== Freedom of expression ====
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or sanction.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1859 |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html |chapter=Introductory |url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/ |title=On Liberty |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Longman, Roberts &amp; Green |publication-date=1869 |at=para. 5 |quote=Society can and does execute its own mandates ... it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.

{{Use American English|date=August 2018}}
{{As of|since=y|2015|post=,}} [[Township High School District 211]] (D211), a public school district of the [[Chicago suburbs]], has been the epicenter of multiple controversies surrounding its policies toward transgender student locker room access. D211 was the first school district to be found in violation of civil rights law on the basis of transgender issues by the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/settlement-reached-palatine-ill-township-high-school-district-211-remedy-transgender-discrimination|title=Settlement Reached with Palatine, Ill., Township High School District 211 to Remedy Transgender Discrimination {{!}} U.S. Department of Education|website=www.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit involving D211's policies toward transgender students was the first legal challenge to the [[Obama Administration]]'s interpretation of [[Title IX]] as allowing [[transgender]] students to use the locker room and bathroom facilities corresponding to their gender identity.&lt;ref name = "wapo sue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/ill-group-sues-obama-administration-over-transgender-students-bathroom-access/2016/05/04/5c57ad12-1206-11e6-93ae-50921721165d_story.html|title=Illinois group sues Obama administration over transgender students’ bathroom access|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
{{further|Title IX|Gender identity under Title IX}}
On June 23, 1972, Richard Nixon signed the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] into law, regarding the federal government's policies toward institutions of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3473|title=Richard Nixon: Statement on Signing the Education Amendments of 1972.|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IX of the act states:
{{Quote|text=No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...|sign=|source=20 U.S.C. §§ 1681}}

Congress gave the executive branch wide purview in enforcing Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;20 U.S.C. §§ 1682&lt;/ref&gt; While Title IX explicitly prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs and activities (including school athletic programs) which receive federal funding, it did not enumerate specific ways in which this was to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act|title=The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "title ix"&gt;20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Education has therefore historically created sub-regulatory guidance to enforce Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/reg/ocr/edlite-34cfr106.html|title=34 C.F.R. Part 106|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules must be followed by all educational institutions receiving federal dollars, including 16,500 school districts and 7,000 colleges, universities, and other post-secondary schools.&lt;ref name = "OCR about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html?exp=0|title=Title IX and Sex Discrimination|date=2015-10-15|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office for Civil Rights, which is responsible for implementing Title IX within the Department, issued several "[[Dear colleague letter (United States)|Dear Colleague]]" letters under the Obama Administration detailing public policy regarding LGBT students. In 2010, OCR released one such letter stating that while Title IX did not prohibit LGBT-based discrimination, it did prohibit discrimination toward LGBT students based wholly or in-part on sex.&lt;ref name = "OCR 2010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.pdf|title="Dear Colleague" letter from Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Russlynn Ali (PDF).|last=Ali|first=Russlyn|date=October 26, 2010|website=Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 document from the OCR stated that Title IX covered gender identity and gender nonconformity based discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Education, Office for Civil Rights, [http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence], April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===OCR investigation===
In December 2013, a student from [[William Fremd High School]], a part of District 211, filed a complaint under Title IX with the Office for Civil Rights. The student, named only as "Student A," was born male but identified as female at an early age. From the filing of the complaint onward, she was represented by the [[ACLU]] of Illinois.&lt;ref name = "daily herald 1601"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160115/news/160119309/|title=Transgender student gains locker room access at Fremd High School|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "OCR letter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/02/us/document-letter-from-the-us-dept-of-education-to-daniel-cates.html|title=Letter From the Office for Civil Rights|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student A's complaint alleged that the district had discriminated against her because she was denied use of the girls' locker room and was required to dress in a separate, private bathroom. D211 said that in making their decision to deny access, they weighed Student A's rights with the right of other students to privacy. D211 determined that they could not allow Student A access because it would result in students of opposite biological sex viewing each other's bodies. OCR found the concerns to be "unavailing." OCR told the district in July 2015 that it had violated Title IX because it discriminated against Student A on the basis of sex. Neither OCR nor Student A alleged that there was a hostile environment or that the district's discrimination went beyond locker room access. In October 2015, the district installed privacy curtains in the girls' locker room and stated that it would not allow Student A to change in the locker room unless she was required to use the privacy curtains. Student A said she would use the curtains if available. OCR disagreed with the district's stated policy of requiring Student A to change behind the curtains because "those female students wishing to protect their own private bodies from exposure... could change behind a privacy curtain."&lt;ref name = "OCR letter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pre herald"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20151012/news/151019750/|title=Dist. 211 setting up private changing room for transgender student|last=Silverberg|first=Melissa|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nyt mid"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/us/illinois-district-violated-transgender-students-rights-us-says.html|title=Illinois District Violated Transgender Student’s Rights, U.S. Says|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing Student A access to the girls' locker room with the requirement that she change in private was not an acceptable solution to OCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/us/illinois-school-district-transgender-ruling/index.html|title=Illinois district must give full locker room access to transgender student - CNN|last=CNN|first=Ed Payne and John Newsome,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCR and D211 engaged in negotiations nine times to resolve the Title IX violation. On October 12, 2015, the district stated that it would not resolve the issue voluntarily following a collective decision by the school board and district administration. On November 2, 2015, OCR sent a letter to D211 superintendent Dr. Daniel Cates to inform him that if an agreement was not reached in 30 days, it would enforce Title IX.&lt;ref name = "OCR letter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pre herald"/&gt; Enforcement could have jeopardized the yearly $6 million in federal funding which D211 received. At the time, the district's budget was $240 million.&lt;ref name = "pre herald"/&gt; Superintendent Cates viewed the decision as an overreach.&lt;ref name = "nyt mid"/&gt;

===D211 response===
On December 2–3,{{efn|name="midnight"|The meeting began at 7:30 PM December 2 and concluded at 12:37 AM the next day.}} 2015, the last days before OCR would enforce Title IX, D211 held a school board meeting to determine what action should be taken. In the preceding month, the district had negotiated with OCR and reached a resolution agreement approved by OCR but requiring a vote by the school board. The agreement was summarized as follows:&lt;ref name = "tribune meeting"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/schaumburg-hoffman-estates/news/ct-transgender-student-district-211-vote-met-20151202-story.html#|title=District 211 votes to give transgender student access to girls' locker room|last=Eldeib|first=Duaa|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "board minutes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adc.d211.org/cms/lib/IL49000007/Centricity/Domain/47/December-2-Board-Minutes.pdf|title=December-2-Board-Minutes.pdf|last=|first=|date=December 2, 2015|website=D211|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|
* Based on the representation of the individual student who filed the OCR complaint that the student will change in private changing stations, the district agrees to provide the student with access to locker room facilities designated for the student's identified gender;
* Any student will have access to privacy accommodations in the locker room through a variety of individual options;
* This agreement pertains solely to this individual student and does not require a district-wide policy;
* The agreement makes no reference to the District violating any regulation or law and reiterates that the District categorically refutes the notion of any violation of law or form of discrimination.

The board meeting included a two-hour period for public comment. Parents and students addressed the board with their views regarding Student A's use of the locker room. A majority of comments were against the settlement.&lt;ref name = "tribune meeting"/&gt;

After a three-hour closed-door meeting, the school board voted 5–2 to accept the agreement with OCR.&lt;ref name = "tribune meeting"/&gt; Mike Scharringhausen, Anna Klimkowicz, Robert LeFevre, Will Hinshaw, and Mucia Burke voted for the resolution. Lauanna Recker and Peter Dombrowski voted against.&lt;ref name = "board minutes"/&gt;

====Disagreement over the agreement====
The agreement between D211 and OCR included language which stated that the district would allow Student A girls' locker room access "based on Student A’s representation that she will change in private changing stations."&lt;ref name = "agreement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/township-high-211-agreement.pdf|title=Agreement: Township High School District 211, Palatine, Illinois: OCR Case #05-14-1055 -- December 3, 2015|last=|first=|date=December 3, 2015|website=Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement did not state specifically that Student A would be required to change in a privacy stall.&lt;ref name = "tribune 7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-transgender-student-district-211-settlement-update-met-20151207-story.html|title=District 211 keeps deal on transgender student after heated debate|last=Eldeib|first=Duaa|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district would also have to take a number of other measures as part of the resolution, including providing a "reasonable alternative" to any student who requested additional privacy.&lt;ref name = "tribune post post"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/schaumburg-hoffman-estates/ct-transgender-student-settlement-district-211-met-20151203-story.html|title=Transgender student locker room case settled, but controversy remains|last=Eldeib|first=Duaa|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; District officials had said that the terms of the agreement with OCR only applied to Student A. On December 3, after the board voted to accept the resolution, [[Catherine E. Lhamon|Catherine Lhamon]] of OCR said that it was "facially inconsistent with the terms of the agreement" for the district to adopt this view, adding that OCR would continue to enforce Title IX in any case where the district refused locker room access. In addition, Lhamon said that the agreement allowed Student A unrestricted access to the locker room.&lt;ref name = "herald post post"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20151207/news/151209129/|title=Dist. 211 reaffirms transgender locker room deal|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "tribune post post"/&gt; On December 4, Superintendent Cates released a statement in response to Lhamon which reiterated the district's view that the agreement only applied to Student A. In that statement, Cates also said that if Student A's actions did not match her representation that she would change in private, the district would revoke her girls' locker room access. A statement later released by the ACLU spokesman Ed Yohnka agreed with OCR's view that the agreement did not require Student A to change in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20151204/news/151209388/|title=District 211 threatens to abandon transgender agreement|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yohnka also said that it would seem unreasonable for OCR not to defend any other transgender student who should request locker room access consistent with gender identity. On December 7, the district received a letter from Lhamon which stated that the agreement provisions specific to locker room access did not apply district-wide. Furthermore, Lhamon said that D211 agreeing to allow Student A access to the girl's locker room "is based on the student's representation that she will change in private changing stations."&lt;ref name = "herald post post"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "tribune 7"/&gt;—language very similar to the terminology already at issue in the agreement.&lt;ref name = "agreement"/&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' noted that both OCR and D211 seemed to agree that the provisions regarding locker room access applied in one case, while the other provisions of the resolution applied district-wide.&lt;ref name = "tribune 7"/&gt;

D211 held a school board meeting on December 7, four days after they had accepted the resolution, to reassess the district's standing relative to the agreement. As before, the district had a period for public comment, which was significantly more supportive of Student A's case than the previous one. After a lengthy closed-door meeting, the school board announced that it would not overturn the agreement.&lt;ref name = "tribune 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "7 meeting"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adc.d211.org/cms/lib/IL49000007/Centricity/Domain/47/Approval-of-Minutes-Special-Meeting-of-December-7-2015.pdf|title=Approval of Minutes -- Special Meeting of December 7 2015|last=|first=|date=December 7, 2015|website=D211|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy changes===
On May 13, 2016, the Department of Education and Department of Justice issued a "Dear Colleague" letter which updated the federal government's official view on Title IX. In general, the letter stated that discrimination based on transgender status or gender identity is sex discrimination, and is therefore prohibited under Title IX.{{efn|name="overturned"|As mentioned above, after the Obama administration, OCR under President Trump issued another "Dear Colleague" letter in 2017 which overturned these provisions. See [[#Background 2|§§ Background]] under [[#Nova Maday|§ Nova Maday]].}} The letter spoke specifically on transgender student use of bathrooms and locker rooms, citing Student A's case resolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf|title=Archived: Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students|last=|first=|date=May 13, 2016|website=Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit===
On May 4, 2016, a group of D211 students and parents sued the district, Department of Education, and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in federal court, alleging that allowing Student A access to the girls' locker room was a violation of their civil rights.&lt;ref name = "wapo sue"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "herald first sue"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160504/news/160509515/|title=District 211 sued over transgender student's locker room access|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, Parents for Privacy (sometimes called D211 Parents for Privacy, Students and Parents for Privacy, or simply PFP), said that the federal government violated the students' privacy rights as well as the parents' constitutional rights to "instill moral standards and values in their children." The Thomas More Society and the Alliance Defending Freedom supported PFP in the suit.&lt;ref name = "wapo sue"/&gt;

On May 26, 2016, Student A, two younger transgender students (called Students B and C), and the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance filed a [[Intervention (law)|motion to intervene]] in the PFP lawsuit. Student B and Student C both attended feeder schools to D211.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160526/news/160529098/|title=Student at center of District 211 transgender debate hopes to join lawsuit|last=Hegarty|first=Erin|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three students were represented by the ACLU. In June, [[Judge Jorge Alonso]] granted the motion. The district did not oppose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160615/news/160619315/|title=Judge: ACLU can intervene in District 211 transgender lawsuit|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, PFP sought an [[injunction]] which would temporarily prevent transgender students from any access to the school locker rooms which matched their gender identity. In October 2016, Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Gilbert recommended that the injunction be denied because high school students "do not have a constitutional right not to share restrooms or locker rooms with transgender students whose sex assigned at birth is different than theirs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-transgender-student-locker-room-palatine-20161018-story.html|title=Judge sides against parents who want to ban transgender student from locker room in District 211|last=Eldeib|first=Duaa|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Student A graduated from William Fremd High School. The lawsuit was not dropped because the case was considered "[[capable of repetition, yet evading review]]."&lt;ref name = "graduation no"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20170522/transgender-studentx2019s-graduation-wonx2019t-end-district-211-lawsuit|title=Transgender student's graduation won't end District 211 lawsuit|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, PFP dropped the Department of Education and Department of Justice as defendants because under the Trump Administration they had rescinded the Obama-era policies which interpreted Title IX as requiring schools to provide locker room access based on gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20170710/federal-defendants-dropped-from-district-211-transgender-lawsuit|title=Federal defendants dropped from District 211 transgender lawsuit|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Judge Alonso denied PFP the injunction they had filed for in August 2016, agreeing with the preliminary decision made by Magistrate Judge Gilbert. Alonso said that there was "no indication that anything has negatively impacted" the education of the PFP students. At the time, PFP's attorneys said they were reviewing options to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-met-palatine-school-transgender-ruling-20180102-story.html|title=Judge refuses to order Palatine school district to suspend transgender policy|last=services|first=Chicago Tribune, wire|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nova Maday==
===Background===
On February 22, 2017, OCR and the Department of Justice released another "Dear Colleague" letter on transgender students. This letter withdrew the 2016 letter released under President Obama which had generally stated that discrimination based on gender identity and transgender status were prohibited under Title IX. Under these guidelines, OCR would not require schools to give gender identity-based bathroom and locker room access to transgender students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.pdf|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students|last=|first=|date=February 22, 2017|website=Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title IX does not expressly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, but it does expressly prohibit discrimination based on sex in schools receiving federal funding. The Obama Administration was able to extend Title IX protection to gender identity because Congress gave the executive branch some power in interpreting and implementing Title IX. For the same reason, the Trump Administration was able to implement Title IX in a way which does not cover gender identity.&lt;ref name = "title ix"/&gt; Unlike Title IX, the State of Illinois explicitly prohibits discrimination based on both sex and gender identity in public high schools. The State also allows certain private facilities such as bathrooms and locker rooms to be exempted from restrictions on sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"Sec. 5-102. Civil Rights Violations: Public Accommodations. It is a civil rights violation for any person on the basis of unlawful discrimination to: (A) Enjoyment of Facilities, Goods, and Services. Deny or refuse to another the full and equal enjoyment of the facilities, goods, and services of any public place of accommodation"; the act includes "non-sectarian secondary schools" as public places of accommodation and includes sexual orientation (including gender identity) based discrimination in its definition of unlawful discrimination. {{Cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=2266|title=Illinois Human Rights Act|website=www.ilga.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Student A graduated from D211, terminating the agreement with OCR. Although the agreement's provisions specific to locker room access applied only to Student A, the district allowed other transgender students gender identity-based locker room access under similar terms.&lt;ref name = "graduation no"/&gt;

===Case===
On November 30, 2017, Nova Maday, a transgender senior at [[Palatine High School]], filed a state lawsuit against D211 with the help of the ACLU and a Chicago law firm. She alleged that the district had discriminated against her by denying her full use of the girls' locker room. Maday said that the district had initially refused her any access to the girls' locker room and then granted her limited access on the pretense that she would change in private. According to the lawsuit, this requirement was not implemented for other students and negatively impacted Maday's mental health and grade in physical education. She contended that this was a violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act and sought gender identity-based locker room access for all students as well as damages for emotional distress and loss. Superintendent Cates said that Maday's lawsuit misrepresented the accommodations the district had made for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-met-palatine-transgender-student-sues-20171130-story.html|title=Lawsuit: 2nd transgender student fights for locker room access at Palatine district|last=Lourgos|first=Angie Leventis|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, PFP and the Thomas More Society successfully intervened in Maday's lawsuits as defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180118/judge-citizens-group-can-intervene-in-district-211-transgender-suit|title=Judge: Citizens group can intervene in District 211 transgender suit|last=Peterson|first=Eric|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maday sought an injunction which would temporarily remove the requirement that she change in private in the girls' locker room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/palatine-transgender-student-locker-room-access-private-changing-area/|title=Transgender student in Palatine denied unrestricted locker room access|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, 2018, Judge Thomas Allen denied her request because the Illinois Human Rights Act  required only "access" to school facilities, instead of "full and equal access" which was removed from the final draft of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-met-transgender-student-lawsuit-palatine-20180125-story.html|title=Transgender student who sued Palatine school district over locker room access loses round in court|last=Schmadeke|first=Steve|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maday appealed the ruling of Judge Allen. Although Maday graduated in May 2018, the appellate court took her case under consideration because it was likely to repeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-transgender-palatine-high-lawsuit-20180625-story.html|title=Appellate court considers locker room case from former Palatine High transgender student|last=Cherney|first=Elyssa|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''trial court''' or '''court of first instance''' is a [[court]] having [[original jurisdiction]], in which [[trial]]s take place.

== In the United States ==
A trial court of [[general jurisdiction]] is authorized to hear some type of [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[Legal case|case]] that is not committed exclusively to another court. In the [[United States]], the [[United States district court]]s are the trial courts of general jurisdiction of the [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]]; each [[U.S. state]] has a [[State court (United States)|state court]] system establishing trial courts of general jurisdiction, such as the [[Florida Circuit Courts]] in [[Florida]], the [[Superior Courts of California]] in [[California]], and the [[New York Supreme Court]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. 

Not all cases are heard in trial courts of general jurisdiction. A trial court of [[limited jurisdiction]] is authorized to hear only specified types of cases. Trial courts of limited jurisdiction may be limited in [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] (such as [[Juvenile court|juvenile]], [[probate]], and [[family court]]s in many U.S. states, or the [[United States Tax Court]] in the federal judiciary) or by other means, such as [[small claims court]]s in many states for civil cases with a low [[amount in controversy]]. Other trials do not take place in courts at all, but in [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial bodies]] or in [[administrative agencies]] with [[Adjudication|adjudicatory]] power created by [[statute]] to make binding determinations with simplified procedural practices, such as [[arbitration]].  

Because different U.S. states apply different names to their courts, it is often not evident whether a court has general or limited [[jurisdiction]]. For instance, the Maine District Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, but the [[Nevada District Courts]] are courts of general jurisdiction.

In the trial court, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] and [[testimony]] are admitted under the [[rules of evidence]] established by applicable [[procedural law]] and determinations called ''findings of fact'' are made based on the evidence. The court, presided over by one or more [[judge]]s, makes ''findings of law'' based upon the applicable law. In most [[common law]] jurisdictions, the trial court often sits with a [[jury]] and one [[judge]]; in such [[jury trial]]s, the jury acting as [[trier of fact]]. In some cases, the judge or judges act as triers of both fact and law, by either statute, custom, or agreement of the parties; this is referred to as a [[bench trial]]s.  In the case of most judges hearing cases through the [[bench trial]] process, they would prefer that all parties are given an opportunity to offer a vigorous and robust case presentation, such that, errors in [[testimony]], procedures, statutes, etc., do not grow "crab legs" -- meaning compounded errors -- and are [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] or returned to their court on [[appeal]]. 

[[Appeal]]s from the decisions of trial courts are usually made by higher courts with the power of appellate review ([[appellate court]]s). Most trial courts are [[Court of record|courts of record]], where the record of the presentation of evidence is created and must be maintained or transmitted to the appellate court. The record of the trial court is certified by the [[Court clerk|clerk of the trial court]] and transmitted to the appellate body. Most appellate courts do not have the authority to hear testimony or take evidence, but instead rule solely on matters of law.

{{Politics of Turkey}}
The '''Constitution of 1961''', officially titled the '''Constitution of the Republic of Turkey''' ({{lang-tr|Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Anayasası}}), was the [[constitution|fundamental law]] of [[Turkey]] from 1961 to 1982. It was introduced following the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 ''coup d'état'']], replacing the earlier [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|Constitution of 1924]]. It was approved in a referendum held on 9 July 1961,&lt;ref name="Palabiyik2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Palabiyik |first=Hamit |title=Turkish public administration: from tradition to the modern age |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWceNjwTggUC&amp;pg=PA46 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=USAK Books |isbn=978-605-4030-01-9 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 61.7% of the nation voting in favor. It remained in force until the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 ''coup d'état'']], following which it was replaced by a new document, the [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution of 1982]], which remains in force today.

==General principles==
===I. Form of the state===
Article 1 - The Turkish State is a republic.

===II. Characteristics of the Republic===
Article 2 - The Turkish Republic is a nationalistic, democratic, secular and social state, governed by the rule of law, based on human rights and fundamental tenets set forth in the preamble.

===III. Indivisibility of the State, its official language and its seat of government===
Article 3 - The Turkish State is an indivisible whole comprising its territory and people. Its official language is Turkish. Its capital is the city of Ankara.

===IV. Sovereignty===
Article 4 - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without reservation and condition. The nation shall exercise its sovereignty through the authorized agencies as prescribed by the principles laid forth in the Constitution. The right to exercise such sovereignty shall not be delegated to any one person, group or class. No person or agency shall exercise any state authority, which does not derive its origin from the Constitution.

===V. Legislative Power===
Article 5 - Legislative power is vested in the Grand National Assembly. This power shall not be delegated.

===VI. Executive Function===
Article 6 - The executive function shall be carried out by the President of the Republic and the Council of Ministers within the framework of law.

===VII. Judicial Power===
Article 7 - Judicial power shall be exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation.

===VIII. Supremacy and the binding force of the Constitution===
Article 8 - Laws shall not be in conflict with the Constitution. The provisions of the Constitution shall be the fundamental legal principles binding the legislative, executive and judicial organs, administrative authorities and individuals.

===IX. Irrevocability of the form of the State===
Article 9 - The provision of the Constitution establishing the form of the state as a republic shall not be amended nor shall any motion therefore be made.

==Difference between 1924 and 1961 constitutions==
{{further|Constitutional History of Turkey}}
Unlike the former constitution, the new constitution was based on human rights; with Article 11, the individual's freedom was secured at all times. The phrase ''social state'' was included in this Constitution for the first time. The new constitution also introduced the Senate, to form a [[bicameral]] system with the National Assembly.

The [[Grand National Assembly]] was formed of the National Assembly and Senate of the Republic. The National Assembly and the majority of senators were elected by the nation, but 15 senators were chosen by the President among former presidents and members of the [[Committee of National Unity]], which had organised the ''coup d'état''

A '''Universal Monarchy''' is a concept and a political situation where one monarchy is deemed to have either sole rule over everywhere (or at least the predominant part of a [[geopolitical]] area or areas) or to have a special supremacy over all other states (or at least all the states in a geopolitical area or areas).

==Concept==

Universal Monarchy is differentiated from ordinary [[monarchy]] in that a Universal Monarchy is beholden to no other state and asserts a degree of total sovereignty over an area, or predominance over other states.

The concept has arisen in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. The concept is linked to that of [[Empire]], but implies more than simply possessing ''[[imperium]]''.

The Latin phrase ''Dominus Mundi'', Lord of the World, encapsulates the concept. Though in practice no Universal Monarchy ever held rule over the whole world, it may have appeared to many people, particularly pre-modern, that it did.

Critical of the concept in Europe in the Middle Ages were philosophers such as [[Nicole Oresme]]&lt;ref&gt;Mastnak, Tomaž ''Crusading peace: Christendom, the Muslim world, and Western political order'' University of California Press (2002) p329&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erasmus]];&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Hans-Åke &amp;  Stråth, Bo ''Reflections on Europe: defining a political order in time and space'' Peter Lang (2007) pp51-52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Dante]] and [[Guillaume Postel]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Marion Leathers ''Guillaume Postel, prophet of the restitution of all things: his life and thought'' Springer (1981) p171&lt;/ref&gt; were more favourable. Later, [[Protestants]] would seek to reject the concept, identifying it with [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Brendan &amp; Riotte, Torsten (Editors) ''The Hanoverian dimension in British History, 1714-1837'' Cambridge University Press (2007) pp168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Europe===
In Europe the expression of a Universal Monarchy as actual total ''imperium'' can be seen in the [[Roman Empire]], and as the predominate ‘sole sovereign’ state during its [[Byzantine]] period, where the Emperor by virtue of being the head of [[Christendom]] claimed a sovereignty over all other kings even though in practice this could not be enforced. The Byzantine conception went through two phases, initially as expounded by [[Eusebius]] that just as there was one God so there could only be one Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, D.M. ''Byzantine political thought'' in Burns, J. H.  ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350-c. 1450'' Cambridge University Press 1988 pp52-53&lt;/ref&gt; which developed in the 10th century into the conception of the Emperor as the ''[[paterfamilias]]'' of a family of kings who were the other rulers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, D.M. ''Byzantine political thought'' in Burns, J. H.  ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350-c. 1450'' Cambridge University Press 1988 p57&lt;/ref&gt;  Such concepts were a feature of the [[Ottoman Empire]] successor state, particularly when military rule was augmented by the [[Caliphate]].

The idea of a sole sovereign Emperor would re-emerge in the West with [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, James ''The Holy Roman Empire'' p209&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of the Holy Roman Empire possessing a special sovereignty as a Universal Monarchy was respected by the surrounding powers and subject states, even when that Empire had undergone severe fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Brissaud, Jean ''A History of French Public Law'' John Murray (1915) p77&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbolism of the [[A.E.I.O.U.]] phrase of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] can be seen as an expression of the idea of all states being subject to one monarchy.

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]’s empire, encompassing much of western Europe and the Americas “was the nearest the post-classical world would come to seeing a truly world-wide monarchy, and hence the closest approximation to universal imperium” since the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000) p32&lt;/ref&gt; It was envisaged by its supporters as a world empire that could be religiously inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Ocker, Christopher,  Printy ,Michael &amp;  Starenko, Peter (Editors) ''Politics and Reformations: Communities, Politics, Nations, and Empires'' Brill Academic Publishers (2007), 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the idea of a Universal Monarchy based on predominance rather than actual total rule would become synonymous with France attempting to establish hegemony over western Europe, particularly under [[Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Brendan &amp; Riotte, Torsten (Editors)''The Hanoverian dimension in British History, 1714-1837'' Cambridge University Press (2007) p168&lt;/ref&gt; exemplified by the concept of Louis XIV as the 'Sun King' around which all the other monarchs became subordinate satellites. In 1755, during the reign of Louis XIV's successor [[Louis XV]], Duke [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles]], a member of the Council of State and formerly a key foreign policy advisor to the king, warned of a British challenge for "the first rank in Europe" through the domination of Atlantic commerce. Noailles wrote "However chimerical the project of universal monarchy might be, that of a universal influence by means of wealth would cease to be a chimera if a nation succeeded in making itself sole mistress of the trade of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shovlin |first=John |date=2010 |title=Selling American Empire on the Eve of the Seven Years War: The French Propaganda Campaign of 1755-1756 |journal=Past and Present |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=121–149 |doi=10.1093/pastj/gtp046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal Monarchy would flourish at either end of Europe, in Britain and Russia. The Russian Universal Monarchy was [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and possessed a vast contiguous empire throughout Europe and Asia and can be seen to have similarities and differences with Byzantine rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gavrov, Sergey [http://ru.wikipedia.org/?oldid=48502217]''Modernization of the Empire. Social and Cultural Aspects of Modernization Processes in Russia'' URSS (2004) p50&lt;/ref&gt; The British Universal Monarchy was “[[Protestant]], commercial, maritime and free”&lt;ref&gt;see Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and was not composed of contiguous territory. It had both similarities and difference with the [[Spanish Empire]]. Whereas [[Catholicism]] provided ideological unity for the Spanish Empire, British Protestant diversity would lead to “disunity rather than unity”.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000) p66&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only later that [[federalism]] and economic control was seen as a means to provide unity where religious diversity could not, as with the idea of [[Imperial Federation]] as promoted by [[Joseph Chamberlain]].

[[Napoleon]] came close to creating something akin to a Universal Monarchy with his [[continental system]] and [[Napoleonic Code]], but he failed to conquer all of Europe. The last attempt to create a European Universal Monarchy was that attempted by [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]]. If Germany had been victorious, the German Kaiser would have been suzerain over most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fritz. ''Germany's Aims in the First World War''. (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niall, Ferguson, ''Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
A parallel process occurred in Asia. Whereas in the West the title of Emperor had by the 19th century largely been stripped of religious connotations and had come to be seen purely in political terms, the title in eastern Asia is almost entirely a religious one, commonly stated as "the [[son of heaven]]". Here the title denotes a higher, "heavenly" rule ("celestial empire"), in contrast to kings who rule between heaven and earth, and by extension today to presidents who are mere base earthly rulers. Imperial China was a Universal Monarchy where all other monarchs were regarded as tributary. The concept was taken up by the Mongols,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Robert''Storm from the East: from Genghis Khan to Khubilai Khan'' University of California Press (1993)p156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicker, Martin ''The Islamic world in ascendancy: from the Arab conquests to the siege of Vienna'' Greenwood Press (2000) p107&lt;/ref&gt; who under [[Genghis Khan]] were able to enforce this concept more widely than China. The Japanese attempt to unify South East Asia in the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] under the [[Shōwa emperor]] follows the model set by Imperial Germany and Joseph Chamberlain of imperial rule based on economic union, matched with Japanese religious ideas.

The Hindu/Buddhist concept of the [[Chakravartin]] is a perfect illustration of the ideal of a Universal Monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Bhandarkar, D. R. ''Lectures on the Ancient History of India from 650–325 B.C.'' University of Calcutta (1919) pp85–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beér, Robert ''The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs'' Serindia Publications 2nd Revised edition(2004) pp160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp.''''', 382 U.S. 172 (1965), was a 1965 decision of the United States Supreme Court that held, for the first time, that enforcement of a fraudulently procured patent violated the antitrust laws and provided a basis for a claim of treble damages if it caused a substantial anticompetitive effect.

==Background==

Food Machinery sued Walker for patent infringement for aeration equipment for [[sewage treatment]] systems. Walker filed a counterclaim for treble damages under the antitrust laws, asserting that Food Machinery had "illegally monopolized interstate and foreign commerce by fraudulently and in bad faith obtaining and maintaining .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. its patent . . . well knowing that it had no basis for .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. a patent." Walker alleged that Food Machinery had fraudulently sworn to the Patent Office (in an oath that the patent statute requires of applicants) that it neither knew nor believed that its invention had been in public use in the United States for more than one year prior to filing its patent application when, in fact, Food Machinery was itself a party to such prior use. Walker further asserted that the existence of the patent damaged Walker by depriving it of business that it would have otherwise enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. at 173-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court granted Food Machinery's motion to dismiss the counterclaim, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, on the grounds that no affirmative claim for relief existed based on fraud on the patent office. It was only a defense to an infringement claim.&lt;ref&gt;335 F. 2d 315 (7th Cir. 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

===Majority opinion===

[[File:Tom C. Clark.gif|right|175px|thumb|Tom C. Clark]]

In an opinion by Justice [[Tom C. Clark]], the Court reversed. It held: "We have concluded that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may be violative of §&amp;nbsp;2 of the Sherman Act provided the other elements necessary to a §&amp;nbsp;2 case are present. In such event the treble damage provisions of §&amp;nbsp;4 of the Clayton Act would be available to an injured party."

The Court began by stating that proof that Food Machinery intentionally misrepresented facts to the patent office "would be sufficient to strip Food Machinery of its exemption from the antitrust laws" when it brought an infringement suit. By the same token, however, "Food Machinery's good faith would furnish a complete defense." This defense would apply to "an honest mistake as to the effect of prior installation upon patentability."
&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. at 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

But while there can be liability it is not automatic. To establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize a part of trade or commerce under §&amp;nbsp;2 of the Sherman Act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t would then be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal patent claim in terms of the relevant market for the product involved. Without a definition of that market there is no way to measure Food Machinery's ability to lessen or destroy competition. It may be that the device—knee-action swing diffusers—used in sewage treatment systems does not comprise a relevant market. There may be effective substitutes for the device which do not infringe the patent. This is a matter of proof&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. at 177-78]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, Walker is entitled to an opportunity to prove its case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trial court dismissed its suit not because Walker failed to allege the relevant market, the dominance of the patented device therein, and the injurious consequences to Walker of the patent's enforcement, but rather on the ground that the United States alone may "annul or set aside" a patent for fraud in procurement. The trial court has not analyzed any economic data. Indeed, no such proof has yet been offered because of the disposition below. In view of these considerations, as well as the novelty of the claim asserted and the paucity of guidelines available in the decided cases, this deficiency cannot be deemed crucial. Fairness requires that on remand Walker have the opportunity to make its §&amp;nbsp;2 claims more specific, to prove the alleged fraud, and to establish the necessary elements of the asserted §&amp;nbsp;2 violation.&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. at 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Concurring opinion===

[[File:John Marshall Harlan II.jpg|thumb|175px|right|John Marshall Harlan II]]

Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] concurred. He wrote separately to emphasize the limits of the holding. No treble damage case would be established, he said, if:
# the antitrust claimant merely showed that the patent was obvious;
# there was fraudulent procurement, but the defendant had no knowledge of the fraud;
# the antitrust claimant failed to prove the remaining elements of a §&amp;nbsp;2 charge.&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. at 179.&lt;/ref&gt;
Justice Harlan insisted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]o hold, as we do not, that private antitrust suits might also reach monopolies practiced under patents that for one reason or another may turn out to be voidable under one or more of the numerous technicalities attending the issuance of a patent, might well chill the disclosure of inventions through the obtaining of a patent because of fear of the vexations or punitive consequences of treble-damage suits. Hence, this private antitrust remedy should not be deemed available to reach § 2 monopolies carried on under a nonfraudulently procured patent.&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. at 180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

One of the points not developed in detail in the ''Walker Process'' opinion was what "the fraudulent procurement of a patent" means.&lt;ref&gt;The quoted phrase appears at 382 U.S. at 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Because most ''Walker Process'' claims are brought by defendants accused of patent infringement, most such cases are now appealed to the Federal Circuit (since that court's formation in 1982), and thus that court has been enormously influential in subsequent developments of the ''Walker Process'' doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;All appeals from judgments in patent infringement cases go to the Federal Circuit. 28 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1295(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is what is enforcement—must there be an actual infringement suit or is a threat to a competitor or its customer sufficient?&lt;ref&gt;Some lower courts have suggested, in dicta, that threats of enforcement are enough. See, e.g., ''Indium Corp. of Am. v. Semi-Alloys, Inc.'', 566 F. Supp. 1344, 1352-53 (N.D.N.Y. 1983) (holding that a ''Walker Process'' claimant “must at least be able to allege facts that indicate that the defendant has enforced, or has sought to enforce, or has threatened to enforce its fraudulently obtained patent against the plaintiff itself”).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Federal Circuit cases===

In ''Beckman Instrument, Inc. v. Chemtronics, Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;428 F.2d 555 (5th Cir. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; the Fifth Circuit held Beckman's patent claiming a polarographic cell for making quantitative analysis of blood invalid because of fraud on the Patent Office (later renamed the Patent &amp; Trademark Office). The district court had upheld the patent as valid, although not infringed.&lt;ref&gt;160 U.S.P.Q. 619 (W.D. Tex. 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; But the Fifth Circuit reversed because Beckman knew about a similar Stow device but decided not to disclose its existence to the Patent Office. The Fifth Circuit ruled that "Beckman had an 'uncompromising duty' of disclosure of the Stow reference to the Patent Office." According to the Fifth Circuit, the Stow device anticipated Beckman's device, so that the Beckman patent was invalid on two grounds: anticipation and fraudulent failure to disclose Stow when prosecuting the patent.&lt;ref&gt;The Fifth Circuit has been criticized for "misapprehend[ing] the
effect of a finding of fraud on the Patent Office." If Stow anticipated, then the patent is invalid for anticipation by Stow. But intentional deception of the Patent Office, it is said, does not invalidate a patent. Rather, it renders the patent permanently unenforceable for non-purgeable misuse. See Donald R. Dunner, James B, Gambrell, and Irving Kayton, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/annam1970&amp;id=433&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=fraud|Monsanto|PATENT|Patent&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor= ''Patent Law (1969-70)''], in [1970] {{smallcaps|Ann. Surv. Am. L.}} 395, 425 n.140 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; The court did not say whether Stow was closer than the prior art that the Patent Office considered, but it was close enough to anticipate. The Fifth Circuit said that there is a clear duty to disclose known prior art that is close to the claimed invention: ""[Ilt is clear that Beckman's patent employees understood the significance of Stow's invention and knew that it presented a serious threat to the validity of the patent they were trying to secure."&lt;ref&gt;428 F.2d at 565.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the things Beckman did to avoid the effect of Stow was to tailor its claims so that they did not directly cover the Stow device, but the court said this did not relieve Beckman of its duty of disclosure.

In ''[[Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d 592 (3d Cir. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; the Third Circuit addressed issues not discussed in ''Walker Process'' when invalidating a patent for fraud. Monsanto had persuaded the Patent Office to withdraw an obviousness rejection of a patent on a herbicide by submitting test data showing that the claimed compound (3,4-DCPA) had surprisingly superior herbicidal efficacy compared to compounds with a very similar molecular structure. Monsanto had tested a number of these compounds, some of which did have similar efficacy to that of 3,4-DCPA and some of which did not. Monsanto intentionally submitted to the Patent Office only the data showing lack of similar efficacy.

The Third Circuit rejected the argument that Monsanto was only putting its best foot forward and was therefore innocent of fraud. The court held that omitting such highly material information in a submission to the Office was equivalent to an affirmative misrepresentation that products with similar efficacy did not exist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]n examination of the report permits, if not compels, the misleading inference that it constituted a complete and accurate analysis of all the testing instead of an edited version thereof. Concealment and nondisclosure may be evidence of and equivalent to a false representation, because the concealment or suppression is, in effect, a representation that what is disclosed is the whole truth.&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court added, "Monsanto was obliged to disclose more information as to the herbicidal properties of related compounds to the Patent Office than it did." The reason is that "what is at issue is not merely a contest between the parties but a public interest" that spurious patents should not issue.

===Federal Circuit case law on elements of ''Walker Process'' claim===

The Federal Circuit decided, in ''Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;141 F.3d 1059, 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; that the falsity triggering a ''Walker Process'' claim must be "material," meaning that the patent being enforced "would not have issued but for the misrepresentation or omission” that is challenged as fraudulent. In addition, the Federal Circuit held that "knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts to the Patent Office" must be alleged, as Walker alleged in the ''Walker Process'' case,&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. at 177.&lt;/ref&gt; and it must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Nobelpharma'', 141 F.3d at 1071.&lt;/ref&gt; These two elements of guilty knowledge and strong proof have been supplemented by the further two elements that the patentee must have acted with specific intent to deceive the PTO, and that the PTO justifiably relied on the misrepresentation or omission.&lt;ref&gt;''Nobelpharma'', 141 F.3d at 1069-70; accord ''C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Sys., Inc.'', 157 F.3d 1340, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1998). As to specific intent see ''American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co. v. Sowa &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 725 F.2d 1350, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (stating that in a ''Walker Process'' claim based on attempt to monopolize, “a specific intent, greater than an intent evidenced by gross negligence or recklessness, is an indispensable element”).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to imposing these requirements, in 1998 the Federal Circuit announced that it would no longer follow the law of regional circuits in ''Walker Process'' cases, but would instead establish a uniform "patent case" rule for judging conduct before the PTO, based on Federal Circuit precedent.&lt;ref&gt;''Nobelpharma'', 141 F.3d at 1067-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Circuit separated the affirmative defense aspect of a ''Walker Process'' claim from the antitrust counterclaim aspect by renaming the former "inequitable conduct," and for a time allowing a lesser standard of proof for inequitable conduct than ''Walker Process'' antitrust claims. In ''Dippin’ Dots, Inc. v. Mosey'',&lt;ref&gt;476 F.3d 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Circuit held that the same intent evidence that established a defense of inequitable conduct did not support an antitrust counterclaim. The Federal Circuit declared, "To demonstrate ''Walker Process'' fraud, a claimant must make higher threshold showings of both materiality and intent than are required to show inequitable conduct."&lt;ref&gt;''Dippin' Dots'', 476 F.3d at 1346.&lt;/ref&gt; It then held that the intent evidence against patentee Dippin' Dots was sufficient to support a conclusion of inequitable conduct but was insufficient for ''Walker Process'' fraud.&lt;ref&gt;''Dippin' Dots'', 476 F.3d at 1349. The Federal Circuit said it was not enough for the jury to disbelieve the patentee's explanations; there must be affirmative evidence of intent to deceive.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Federal Circuit subsequently raised the legal standards for proving inequitable conduct so as to make it approximately equivalent to that for ''Walker Process'' fraud, in ''Therasense v. Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co.''&lt;ref&gt;649 F.3d 1276, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator remarked that this change has led to a "virtual alignment of inequitable conduct and ''Walker Process''  fraud that was accomplished by ''Therasense''."&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Mark and T. Leigh Anenson, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1465&amp;context=jbl ''Inequitable Conduct And Walker Process Claims After Therasense And The America Invents Act''], 16 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. J. Bus. Law}} 361, 402 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In reacting to the surge in the pleading of inequitable conduct and ''Walker Process'' fraud, the Federal Circuit remarked that "the habit of charging inequitable conduct in almost every major patent case has become an absolute plague."&lt;ref&gt;''Burlington Indus. v. Dayco Corp.'', 849 F.2d 1418, 1422 (Fed. Cir. 1988). See also Melissa Feeney Wasserman, [http://www.vjolt.net/vol13/issue4/v13i4_a7-Wasserman.pdf  ''Limiting the Inequitable Conduct Defense''], 13 {{smallcaps|Va. J.L. &amp; Tech.}} 1, 8 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; This has suggested to some commentators that this reaction caused the Federal Circuit to tighten up the requirements for ''Walker Process'' and inequitable conduct claims and to favor greater leniency for patentees, as is described above.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Wasserman, at 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Handgards'' case===

In ''Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;601 F.2d 986 (9th Cir. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; the Ninth Circuit decided that the enforcement of a knowingly invalid patent could give rise to antitrust liability.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon'', 743 F.2d 1282, 1289 (9th Cir. 1984) (upholding treble damage jury verdict).&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar type of claim is enforcing a valid patent against a defendant that the plaintiff knows is not infringing the patent.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Loctite Corp. v. Ultraseal Ltd.'', 781 F.2d 861, 877 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (applying the ''Handgards'' bad faith standard to situation where patentee knew there was no infringement but nonetheless enforced patent).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal prosecution===

In ''United States v. Union Camp Corp.'', the government brought a criminal case against a company that filed a patent infringement action against another company under a patent that it knew was invalid, because it had publicly sold the patented product more than a year before the filing of the patent application.&lt;ref&gt;1969 Trade Cas. ¶ 72,689 (E.D. Va. 1969) (consent decree). In that case the company's patent counsel warned the company's president of the problem and suggested caution against suing another company that had hired an ex-employee of the patentee who knew the facts. The company and its officials pleaded ''nolo contendere''. For the indictment, see ''United States v. Union Camp Corp.'', Crim. Action No. 4558 (E.D. Va. Nov. 30, 1967). For the complaint in the related civil action, alleging fraudulent procurement, see ''United States v. Union Camp Corp.'', Civ. No. 5005A, (E.D. Va. Nov. 4, 1968). The criminal case also involved a mandamus action in the Fourth Circuit. ''Union Camp Corp. v. Lewis'', 385 F.2d 143 (4th Cir. 1967) (mandamus denied).
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The facts concerning this case are summarized in a paper titled ''The Antitrust Consequences of Fraudulent Procurement and Enforcement of Patents'', contained in 15 {{smallcaps|Antitrust Bull.}} 663 (1970) and in [http://www.ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/patents/Patent%20Law%20Revision,%20Subcomm.%20%28May%2013,%201971%29.pdf ''Patent Law Revision''], Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., Pursuant to S. Res. 32 on S. 643, S. 1253 and S. 1255, Part 2 and Appendix (May 13, 1971) at 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that "a conspiracy to procure a patent by means of fraud constitutes, independently of the Sherman Act, a violation of the general federal conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;371)."&lt;ref&gt;See ''id''. at 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''United States v. Markham'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11849954359299705604&amp;q=%22537+f.2d+187%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006&amp;as_vis=1 537 F.2d 187] (5th Cir. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant was indicted and convicted under the federal false statement statute (18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1001) for fraudulent patent procurement—"attempt[ing] to conceal from the Patent Office the true inventor of the process for which a patent was sought."&lt;ref&gt;537 F.2d at 188-89.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case one Klein, a business partner of the defendant Markham, invented a process for building houses. Markham and Klein fell out, and Markham filed a patent application falsely naming two other men as the inventors rather than Klein.&lt;ref&gt;537 F.2d at 192-95.&lt;/ref&gt; When the facts eventually came out, Markham was indicted and convicted; the court of appeals affirmed the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;537 F.2d at 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whitewash Resolution''' is a proposed resolution for the waiver of rights of independent [[shareholder]]s to receive a mandatory [[takeover]] from the [[investor]] and its concert parties for the [[voting share|ordinary share]]s of the [[company]] not already owned or controlled by them.

A whitewash waiver is a [[corporate law]] concept originating in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].  In some cases an investor will apply to the Executive for the Whitewash Waiver, which, if granted, will be subject to the approval of independent shareholders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">'''William Moraley''' (1698–1762) was an [[Englishman]] who emigrated to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1729 as an [[indentured servant]]. In his  [[autobiography]], ''The Infourtunate: or the Voyage and Adventures of William Moraley, Written by Himself'', originally published in 1743, Moraley gives a different view of colonial America, commenting on the lives of slaves, servants and Native Americans, topics not often mentioned by other writers of the time.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6229/|title="A Person Like Me, Oppress'd By Dame Fortune, Need Not Care Where He Goes": The "Infortunate" William Moraley Tries His Luck in America, 1729.|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is used in college history courses, contrasting the lives of wealthy landowners and government figures with the lives  of common people. It is often taught in conjunction with ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''. Moraley describes flora, fauna and life in general as a commoner would, with a non-esoteric vernacular and  little respect for scientific details.

An edition of this book published in 1992 and edited by Susan E. Klepp and Billy G. Smith has an extensive introduction with biographical information, and commentary on the contrast between this work and others of the era.
