The '''MT ''Hebei Spirit'' oil spill''' was a major [[oil spill]] in [[South Korea]] that began on the morning of 7 December 2007 local time, with ongoing environmental and economic effects. Government officials called it South Korea's worst oil spill ever, surpassing a spill that took place in 1995.&lt;ref name="Worst Oil Spill"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2007/12/202_15206.html| title = Worst Oil Spill| publisher = ''[[Korea Times]]''| date = 2007-12-09|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110520091038/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2007/12/202_15206.html |archivedate = 20 May 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Channel Newws Asia"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/316137/1/.html | title = South Korea battles worst oil spill ever: officials| publisher = [[Channel News Asia]]| date = 2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oil spill was about one-third of the size of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7135896.stm | work=BBC News | title=South Korea fights huge oil spill | date=2007-12-10 | accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At about 7:30 local time on 7 December 2007 (2230 UTC on 6 December 2007), a [[Crane vessel|crane barge]] owned by [[Samsung Heavy Industries]] being towed by a tug collided with the anchored [[Hong Kong]] registered [[Petroleum tanker#Merchant tankers|crude carrier]] ''Hebei Spirit'' ({{zh|c=河北精神號}}), carrying {{convert|260000|t|ST|lk=on}} of crude oil. The incident occurred near the port of Daesan on the [[Yellow Sea]] coast of [[Taean]] County. The barge was floating free after the cable linking it to the tug snapped in the rough seas.

Although no casualties were reported, the collision punctured three of the five tanks aboard the ''Hebei Spirit'' and resulted in the leaking of some {{convert|10800|t|ST}} of oil.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera - 07/12"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/8FFD07BA-FC96-4272-A88F-016EB6BFD8C2.htm |title=Tanker oil spill off S Korea coast |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2007-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209183511/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/8FFD07BA-FC96-4272-A88F-016EB6BFD8C2.htm |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera - 09/12"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/4B8CD7E8-4A7E-4723-AEB2-1FD8A8CDCE51.htm |title=S Korea fights worst oil spill ever |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2007-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210063213/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/4B8CD7E8-4A7E-4723-AEB2-1FD8A8CDCE51.htm |archivedate=2007-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining oil from the damaged tanks was pumped into the undamaged tanks and the holes were sealed.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jmxiCRp0tXcdprM3rl4eVTzRDRnw |title=SKorea oil spill fight to last months: minister |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=2007-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213174919/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jmxiCRp0tXcdprM3rl4eVTzRDRnw |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC World"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7134967.stm| title = S Korea declares slick 'disaster'| publisher = [[BBC World]]| date = 2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spill occurred near Mallipo Beach (in Taean County), considered one of South Korea's most beautiful and popular beaches.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/09/skorea.spill.ap/index.html |title=South Korea faces 'sea of oil' |publisher=[[CNN International]] |date=2007-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210074523/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/09/skorea.spill.ap/index.html |archivedate=December 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The region affected by the spill is  home to one of Asia's largest wetland areas, used by migratory birds, and also contains a national maritime park and 445 sea farms.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera - 09/12"/&gt;

==Effects==
It was initially believed the oil spill would not spread due to the cold winter temperatures. However, unseasonably warm weather, combined with strong waves and unexpected wind directions, caused the spill to expand beyond initial expectations.&lt;ref name="Korean Times-09/12"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2007/12/113_15224.html
| title = Clearing Oil Contamination to Take at Least Two Months| publisher = [[Korea Times]]| date = 2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December it was reported that the oil slick was already {{convert|33|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on|0}} thick in some areas.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera - 09/12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC World"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korean Times-09/12"/&gt; It was also reported that at least 30 beaches have been affected and over half of the region's sea farms are believed to have lost their stocks due to the spill. [[DuWoong wetland|Sinduri Dune]], a [[National Treasures of South Korea|South Korean natural treasure]],&lt;!-- Please don't change this to national treasure, our current ref calls it a natural treasure so until a better ref is found we should follow the ref--&gt; is reported to have been saturated by the spill.&lt;ref name="Korean Times-09/12"/&gt;

Although most [[migratory bird]]s had not yet arrived in the region, [[seagull]]s, [[mallard duck]]s and other sea life were found tarred by the oil.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korean Times-09/12"/&gt;

On 14 December, the oil balls had arrived at Anmyeon-do&lt;ref&gt;http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264575&lt;/ref&gt; (安眠島; Anmyeon Island), resulting in at least five beaches being contaminated with large tar lumps. It was believed that the oil belt was not going to go down to Anmyeon-do, but bad, windy weather was responsible for it. On 15 December, the tar lumps had also floated to [[Boryeong]] (mostly around Wonsan Island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maplandia.com/korea-south/chungchongnam-do/wonsando-ri/|title=Wonsando-ri Map - South Korea Google Satellite Maps|first=Maplandia.com|last=Team|website=www.maplandia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sapsi Island of Boryeong) and to [[Gunsan]] in [[North Jeolla]] province as well.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Yonhap News"/&gt;--&gt;

==Response==
The South Korean government declared a state of disaster in the region. The cost of cleanup has been estimated at 300 billion [[South Korean won]] (US$330 million). The cleanup involved 13 helicopters, 17 airplanes and 327 vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/dec2007/2007-12-31-02.asp|title=Rehab Prospects Good After Korea's Worst Oil Spill|first=|last=staff|website=www.ens-newswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been estimated the cleanup will take at least two months.&lt;ref name="Worst Oil Spill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korean Times-09/12"/&gt; Hundreds of thousands of volunteers and celebrities including South Korean actress [[Park Jin-hee]] helped to clean up the beaches in the campaign.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} As of 4 January 2008, the Navy had deployed 229 vessels and some 22,000 military personnel to help clean up the spill, in addition to civilian aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://korea.net/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20080104005 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101201253/http://korea.net/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20080104005 |archivedate=2017-01-01 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2008, the number of volunteers topped the 1-million mark to reach 1,037,000 people, 33 days after the accident occurred on 7 December, according to the South Chungcheong provincial government.&lt;ref name="kois1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kois.go.kr/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no%3D20080111033 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516130658/http://www.kois.go.kr/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20080111033 |archivedate=2011-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taean office for emergency operations reported that the volunteers included 580,000 ordinary civilians, 186,700 local residents, 127,000 soldiers and policemen, and 57,143 public officials. According to the emergency office, an average of 20,000 people volunteered during weekdays and 3,000 volunteered over the weekends.&lt;ref name="koreatimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/01/117_17071.html |title=Number of Oil Cleanup Volunteers Top 1 Mil. |accessdate=April 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224221028/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/01/117_17071.html |archivedate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2008, approximately 4,153 tons of crude oil spilled had been collected by utilizing some 268,710 kilograms of oil absorbents and other cleanup devices.&lt;ref name="koreatimes1"/&gt; Financial contributions combined to 27.76 billion [[South Korean won]] (about 20 million euro) in donations, as well as food and clothing. The Taean emergency center said more than seven billion won in donations have come from about 4,200 organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="kois1"/&gt;

Internationally, the Regional Oil Spill Contingency Plan under the [[Northwest Pacific Action Plan]] (NOWPAP) was activated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowpap.org/|title=NOWPAP-Northwest Pacific Action Plan|website=www.nowpap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a request of the South Korean government. Among the emergency supplies available in the other three NOWPAP members (China, Japan and Russia), South Korean government, taking into account logistical issues, accepted kind offers of 50 and 10 tonnes of sorbents from China and Japan respectively. Japan has also dispatched a team of experts in addition to the teams from the Joint UNEP/OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs&lt;ref&gt;http://ochaonline.un.org/OchaLinkClick.aspx?link=ocha&amp;docId=1084754/&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) Environment Unit and the European Commission Monitoring Information Center, [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (AUB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=523&amp;ArticleID=5728&amp;l=en/|title=Press Releases December 2007 – UNEP deploys team of experts to help with oil spill in Republic of Korea – United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility==
[[File:Manripo071210 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Volunteers cleaning up]]
It has been reported that the regional office of the [[Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries|Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries]] had twice tried to warn the barge captain that the barge was too close to the tanker two hours before the incident but was unable to do so.&lt;ref name="Worst Oil Spill"/&gt; The barge captain is also under investigation for moving through the area in rough weather.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; The tanker is reported to have been at anchor when it was hit by the barge, which had broken free from its towing lines.&lt;ref name="BBC World" /&gt;

The South Korean [[Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries|Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries]] and police admitted to having not provided sufficient amount of oil absorbent material to fishermen and residents as well as not having paid enough attention to the wind direction.&lt;ref name="Korean Times-09/12"/&gt;

According to a recent report, compensation will be mostly paid by China Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association (China P&amp;I) and [[Assuranceforeningen Skuld|Skuld P&amp;I]], which are insurers for the ''Hebei Spirit'', and some paid by [[Samsung Fire]] and Lloyd P&amp;I.&lt;ref name="대산항 해양오염 발생현황"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newswire.co.kr/read_sub.php?id=303615| script-title=ko:대산항 해양오염 발생현황| publisher = NewsWire| date = 2007-12-09 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Oil Pollution Funds (IOPC) will be responsible to pay if China P&amp;I and Skuld P&amp;I become unable to pay for the cost or if the damages exceed the shipowners limitation of liability set under an international convention.

On 20 December, the South Korean coast guard completed an initial investigation. According to their conclusions, blame is shared between the tug captains, the barge captain, and the captain of the Hebei Spirit. The tug captains and the barge captain are charged with negligence and violating the marine pollution prevention law. The captain of the Hebei Spirit has been charged with violating marine law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2884189 INSIDE JoongAng Daily]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608030841/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2884189 |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June, the trial concluded. The two tug captains were found guilty, while the personnel on the barge and on Hebei Spirit were exonerated. Samsung Heavy Industries was also fined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200806/200806240014.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626231742/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200806/200806240014.html |date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over continued detention of crew==
However, the Hebei Spirit's two most senior officers, Master Jasprit Chawla and chief officer Syam Chetan, continue to be detained in South Korea.
They were found guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced to serve time in jail for 18 months (Master Jasprit Chawla) and 8 months (C.O. Syam Chetan). South Korea's detention of the crew has generated much controversy and protests from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Transportation/Shipping__Transport/Protests_against_piracy_detention_of_seamen/articleshow/3588048.cms|title=Protests against piracy, detention of seamen|date=13 October 2008|publisher=|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressbuzz.com/edition/story.aspx?artid=/HM/o8XRBJI=&amp;Title=Mariners+hold+silent+march+in+the+City&amp;SectionID=lifojHIWDUU=&amp;MainSectionID=ngGbWGz5Z14=&amp;SectionName=rSY|6QYp3kQ=&amp;SEO=SOUTH,KOREA,CAPTAIN,MARINERS,RELEASE India Express: Mariners hold silent march in the City, Expressbuzz.com, 6 Oct 2008] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been strong protests from the shipping world and demands for the crews release, including from organizations like the International Transport Workers’ Federation, International Group of P&amp;I Clubs, BIMCO, International Chamber of Shipping / International Shipping Federation, [[International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners]] (INTERCARGO), International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (INTERTANKO) and the Hong Kong Shipowners' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinenorway.etp.no/sider/tekst.asp?side=3405|title=eRedaktør publiseringsløsning|first=|last=eredaktor|website=marinenorway.etp.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of Samsung, prosecutors collusion in appeal case==
According to Lloyd's List and other media reports, South Korean maritime officials, prosecutors and Samsung lawyers have been accused of colluding in the retrial of the two senior officers. Roberto Giorgi, president of management firm V.Ships, visited South Korea to meet with the detained Hebei Spirit crew.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/viewArticle.htm?articleId=20017574484 {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the press that he is concerned at recent developments "which point to collusion" between the South Korean authorities, prosecutors and Samsung Heavy Industries, operators of a drifting barge that collided with the oil tanker and that efforts of Samsung and prosecutors "look to be designed to ensure that the master and chief officer are found guilty on appeal," Giorgi said. "I am worried that the captain and chief officer may not get a fair trial this time around."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/en/20080924-firm-says-it-suspects-collusion-skorea-oil-spill-case  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''air purifier''' or '''air cleaner''' is a device which removes [[contaminant]]s from the air in a room. These devices are commonly marketed as being beneficial to [[allergy]] sufferers and [[asthma]]tics, and at reducing or eliminating [[passive smoking|second-hand tobacco smoke]]. The commercially graded air purifiers are manufactured as either small stand-alone units or larger units that can be affixed to an air handler unit (AHU) or to an [[HVAC]] unit found in the medical, industrial, and commercial industries. Air purifiers may also be used in industry to remove impurities such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from air before processing. [[Pressure swing adsorption|Pressure swing adsorbers]] or other adsorption techniques are typically used for this.

==History==
In 1830, a patent was awarded to [[Charles Anthony Deane]] for a device comprising a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long leather hose attached to the rear of the helmet was to be used to supply air, the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double [[bellows]]. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was to be constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Newton | first = William | last2 = Partington | first2 = Charles Frederick | title = Charles Anthony Deane - 1823 patent | journal = Newton's London Journal of Arts and Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 341 | year = 1825 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=IwA1AAAAMAAJ | doi = | id = | publisher = W. Newton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, [[John Stenhouse]] filed two patents applying the absorbent properties of [[Charcoal|wood charcoal]] to air purification (patents 19 July 1860 and 21 May 1867), thereby creating the first practical [[respirator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stenhouse, John|journal=Dictionary of National Biography|date=1885–1900|volume=54|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Stenhouse,_John_(DNB00)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, [[John Tyndall]] invented an improvement to the fireman's respirator, a hood that filtered smoke and noxious gas from air (1871, 1874).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Taggart [http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/gasmask/page.html History of air-purifying type gas-masks in the 19th-century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502145330/http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/gasmask/page.html |date=2013-05-02 }}. John Tyndall (1871), [https://archive.org/stream/fragmentsscienc10tyndgoog#page/n318/mode/2up ''Fireman's Respirator''], and {{cite journal|jstor=112853 |author=John Tyndall |title=On Some Recent Experiments with a Fireman's Respirator |doi=10.1098/rspl.1873.0060 |url=https://archive.org/details/philtrans07303711 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=22 |year=1874 |pages=359–361 |issue=148–155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[HEPA]] filters were commercialized as highly efficient air filters, after being put to use in the 1940s in the United States' [[Manhattan Project]] to control airborne [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtXJzogLCecC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=HEPA+filter+manhattan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHybWO0P7QAhVJzoMKHTdQBQ0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=HEPA%20filter%20manhattan&amp;f=false|title=Green Health: An A-to-Z Guide|last=Ogunseitan|first=Oladele|date=2011-05-03|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412996884|location=|page=13|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSNfCrpcSCAC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=HEPA+filter+registered+trademark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwtuC80P7QAhWr7IMKHZudCQ0Q6AEIMjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=HEPA%20filter%20registered%20trademark&amp;f=false|title=The Vacuum Cleaner: A History|last=Gantz|first=Carroll|date=2012-09-21|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786493210|location=|page=128|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and benefits of purifiers==
[[Dust]], [[pollen]], pet [[dander]], [[mold]] [[spore]]s, and [[dust mite]] [[feces]] can act as [[allergens]], triggering [[allergies]] in sensitive people. Smoke [[particulate|particles]] and [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) can pose a risk to health. Exposure to various components such as VOCs increases the likelihood of experiencing symptoms of [[sick building syndrome]].&lt;ref name="ang"&gt;H.M. Ang, M Tade, S Wang. (2007). "Volatile organic compounds in the indoor environment and photo-catalytic oxidation: state of the art". Environmental International 33: 694-705.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purifying techniques==
[[File:パナ エコナビ ナノイー 空気清浄機 2016 (29772555192).jpg|thumb|An air purifier placed under a table]]
There are two types of air purifying technologies, Active and Passive. Active [[air purifier]] use ionisation for cleaning the air. Passive air purification units on the other hand use air filters to remove [[Pollutant|pollutants]]. They are more efficient since all [[dust]] and [[Particulate matter|Particulate Matter]] is permanently removed from the air and collected in the filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.honeywellsmarthomes.com/blog/what-kind-of-filters-are-required-for-an-air-purifier-to-work-efficiently/|title=Types and Function of Air Filters {{!}} Air Filtration System For Home, Office and Car|date=2017-09-04|work=Official Blog Updates - Honeywell Air Purifiers|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different processes of varying effectiveness can be used to purify air.

*Thermodynamic sterilization (TSS) - This technology uses heat sterilization via a ceramic core with micro capillaries, which are heated to {{convert|200|°C}}. It is claimed that 99.9% of microbiological particles - bacteria, viruses, dust mite allergens, mold and fungus spores - are incinerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Insect Research Institute UK |url=http://www.airfree.uk.com/Files/Billeder/AirFree/Testes/Insect%20Research%20Institute%20UK.pdf |website=Airfree |date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air passes through the ceramic core by the natural process of [[convection|air convection]], and is then cooled using heat transfer plates and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Most effective air purification method or mechanism |url=http://www.olansi.net/ |website=Olasi Healthcare Co. |date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSS is not a filtering technology, as it does not trap or remove particles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airfree.uk.com/Files/Billeder/AirFree/371106146.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; TSS is claimed not to emit harmful by-products (although the byproducts of partial [[pyrolysis|thermal decomposition]] are not addressed) and also reduces the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swedish National Testing and Research Institute Ozone |url=http://www.breathingspace.co.uk/downloads/1409654777SP_Swedish_National_Testing_and_Research_Institute_Ozone.pdf |website=Breathing Space |date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]] - UVGI can be used to sterilize air that passes UV lamps via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drainpan of cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed in the center of the duct and parallel to the air flow.
*[[Air filter|Filter]] - based purification traps airborne particles by size exclusion. Air is forced through a filter and particles are physically captured by the filter.
:High-efficiency particulate arrestance ([[HEPA]]) filters remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles and are usually more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a [[clean room]], must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in course of operation.
:Filter HVAC at [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|MERV]] 14 or above are rated to remove airborne particles of 0.3 micrometers or larger. A high efficiency MERV 14 filter has a capture rate of at least 75% for particles between 0.3 to 1.0 micrometers. Although the capture rate of a MERV filter is lower than that of a HEPA filter, a central air system can move significantly more air in the same period of time. Using a high-grade MERV filter can be more effective than using a high-powered HEPA machine at a fraction of the initial capital expenditure. Unfortunately, most furnace filters are slid in place without an [[hermetic seal|airtight seal]], which allows air to pass around the filters. This problem is worse for the higher-efficiency MERV filters because of the increase in [[drag (physics)|air resistance]]. Higher-efficiency MERV filters are usually denser and increase air resistance in the central system, requiring a greater [[air pressure]] drop and consequently increasing energy costs.

*[[Activated carbon]] is a [[porosity|porous]] material that can [[adsorption|adsorb]] volatile chemicals on a molecular basis, but does not remove larger particles. The adsorption process when using activated carbon must reach equilibrium thus it may be difficult to completely remove contaminants.&lt;ref name="zeltner" /&gt; Activated carbon is merely a process of changing contaminants from a gaseous phase to a solid phase, when aggravated or disturbed contaminants can be regenerated in indoor air sources.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ao | first1 = C. H. | last2 = Lee | first2 = S. C. | doi = 10.1016/S1010-6030(03)00276-4 | title = Combination effect of activated carbon with TiO2 for the photodegradation of binary pollutants at typical indoor air level | journal = Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry | volume = 161 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 131 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activated carbon can be used at room temperature and has a long history of commercial use. It is normally used in conjunction with other filter technology, especially with HEPA. Other materials can also absorb chemicals, but at higher cost.

*Polarized-media electronic air cleaners use active electronically enhanced media to combine elements of both electronic air cleaners and passive mechanical filters. Most polarized-media electronic air cleaners use safe 24-volt DC voltage to establish the polarizing electric field. Airborne particles become ionized, or charged, as they pass through the electric field and adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic air cleaners increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
*Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is an emerging technology in the HVAC industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesisair.com/documents/PhotocatalysisIAQSensitive.pdf Photocatalysis: Considerations for IAQ-Sensitive Engineering Designs], David J Branson, P.E.., ''Engineered Systems'', April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs. As of May 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesisair.com/documents/FormaldehydeTestReportApril2009.pdf], Formaldehyde Test Report: Genesis Air Populated Catalyst Panel RTI Report Number: A03230901 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesisair.com/documents/OfficeMixTestReportMay2009.pdf], Office VOC Mixture Test Report: Genesis Air Populated Catalyst Panel RTI Report Number: A03230902, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; there was no more disputable concern raised by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory data that PCO may significantly increase the amount of formaldehyde in real indoor environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allergyclean.com/news/uvpcoformaldehyde.htm |title=Study on Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) Raises Questions About Formaldehyde as a Byproduct in Indoor Air |work=allergyclean.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426065810/http://allergyclean.com/news/uvpcoformaldehyde.htm |archivedate=2015-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other advanced technologies, sound engineering principles and practices should be employed by the HVAC designer to ensure proper application of the technology. [[Photocatalysis|Photocatalytic]] oxidation systems are able to completely oxidize and degrade organic contaminants. For example, Volatile Organic Compounds found low concentrations within a few hundred ppmv or less are the most likely to be completely oxidized.&lt;ref name="zeltner"&gt;W.A. Zeltner, D.T. Tompkins. (2005). "Shedding light on photo catalysis". ASHRAE Transactions 3: 523-534.&lt;/ref&gt;(PCO) uses short-wave [[ultraviolet]] light (UVC), commonly used for [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], to energize the catalyst (usually titanium dioxide (TiO2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/residair.html#Photocatalytic_Oxidation_Cleaners|title=Residential Air Cleaners (Second Edition) - Indoor Air - US Environmental Protection Agency|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and oxidize [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oildiffuserzone.com/esl-hh-00-05-15.html The Application of Ultraviolet Germicidal Technology in HVAC Systems]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, Michael J. Taylor, Product Manager, Carrier Corporation, Syracuse, NY&lt;/ref&gt; PCO in-duct units can be mounted to an existing forced-air [[HVAC]] system. PCO is not a filtering technology, as it does not trap or remove particles. It is sometimes coupled with other filtering technologies for air purification. UV sterilization bulbs must be replaced about once a year; manufacturers may require periodic replacement as a condition of [[warranty]]. Photocatalytic Oxidation systems often have high commercial costs.&lt;ref name="zeltner" /&gt;
:A related technology relevant to air purification is photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO) [[Photoelectrochemical oxidation]]. While technically a type of PCO, PECO involves electrochemical interactions among the catalyst material and reactive species (e.g., through emplacement of cathodic materials) to improve quantum efficiency; in this way, it is possible to use lower energy UVA radiation as the light source and yet achieve improved effectiveness.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;D. Y. Goswami. (2006). "Photoelectrochemical air disinfection" US Patent 7,063,820 B2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Air ionizer|Ionizer purifiers]] use charged electrical surfaces or needles to generate electrically charged air or gas [[ion]]s. These ions attach to airborne particles which are then [[electrostatic]]ally attracted to a charged collector plate. This mechanism produces trace amounts of [[ozone]] and other oxidants as by-products.&lt;ref name="ang" /&gt; Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 [[parts per million|ppm]] of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.
*[[Immobilized Cell Technology|Immobilized cell technology]] removes microfine particulate matter from the air by attracting charged particulates to a bio-reactive mass, or bioreactor, which enzymatically renders them inert.
*[[Ozone generator]]s are designed to produce ozone, and are sometimes sold as whole house air cleaners. Unlike ionizers, ozone generators are intended to produce significant amounts of ozone, a strong [[oxidant]] gas which can oxidize many other chemicals. The only safe use of ozone generators is in unoccupied rooms, utilising "shock treatment" commercial ozone generators that produce over 3000&amp;nbsp;mg of ozone per hour. Restoration contractors use these types of ozone generators to remove smoke odors after fire damage, musty smells after flooding, [[mold remediation|mold]] (including [[toxic mold]]s), and the stench caused by decaying flesh which cannot be removed by bleach or anything else except for ozone. However, it is not healthy to breathe ozone gas, and one should use extreme caution when buying a room air purifier that also produces ozone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kent.co.in/air-purifiers/ozone/ Ozone Generators: air cleaners intentionally designed to generate ozone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104211545/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/house-domes/electron/cleaners-air-purificateurs-eng.php |date=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Titanium dioxide]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) technology - [[nanoparticles]] of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, together with [[Limestone|calcium carbonate]] to neutralize any [[acid]]ic gasses that may be adsorbed, is mixed into slightly porous paint. [[Photocatalysis]] initiates the decomposition of airborne contaminants at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Hogan |first = Jenny| title = Smog-busting paint soaks up noxious gases |journal = [[New Scientist]] |publisher = Reed Business Information |location = London |date = 4 February 2004 |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer concerns==
Other aspects of air cleaners are hazardous gaseous by-products, noise level, frequency of filter replacement, electrical consumption, and visual appeal. Ozone production is typical for air ionizing purifiers. Although high concentration of ozone is dangerous, most air ionizers produce low amounts (&lt; 0.05 ppm). The noise level of a purifier can be obtained through a customer service department and is usually reported in [[decibel]]s (dB). The noise levels for most purifiers are low compared to many other home appliances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Frequency of filter replacement and electrical consumption are the major operation costs for any purifier. There are many types of filters; some can be cleaned by water, by hand or by [[vacuum cleaner]], while others need to be replaced every few months or years. In the United States, some purifiers are certified as [[Energy Star]] and are [[efficient energy use|energy efficient]].

HEPA technology is used in portable air purifiers as it removes common airborne allergens. The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] has requirements manufacturers must pass to meet HEPA requirements. The HEPA specification requires removal of at least 99.97% of 0.3 micrometers airborne pollutants. Products that claim to be "HEPA-type", "HEPA-like", or "99% HEPA" do not satisfy these requirements and may not have been tested in independent laboratories.

Air purifiers may be rated on a variety of factors, including [[Clean Air Delivery Rate]] (which determines how well air has been purified); efficient area coverage; [[air changes per hour]]; energy usage; and the cost of the replacement filters. Two other important factors to consider are the length that the filters are expected to last (measured in months or years) and the noise produced (measured in [[decibel]]s) by the various settings that the purifier runs on. This information is available from most manufacturers.

==Potential ozone hazards==
As with other health-related appliances, there is controversy surrounding the claims of certain companies, especially involving [[air ioniser|ionic air purifiers]]. Many air purifiers generate some ozone, an energetic [[allotrope]] of three [[oxygen]] atoms, and in the presence of humidity, small amounts of [[nitrogen oxide|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Because of the nature of the ionization process, ionic air purifiers tend to generate the most ozone.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This is a serious concern, because ozone is a [[criteria air pollutant]] regulated by health-related US federal and state standards. In a controlled experiment, in many cases, ozone concentrations were well in excess of public and/or industrial safety levels established by US Environmental Protection Agency, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Quantification of Ozone Levels in Indoor Environments Generated by Ionization and Ozonolysis Air Purifiers|author1=Britigan, Nicole |author2=Alshawa, Ahmad |author3=Nizkorodov, Sergey A. | journal=Journal of the Air &amp; Waste Management Association|date=May 2006| volume=56| pages=601–610| ISSN=1047-3289| pmid=16739796| issue=5| doi=10.1080/10473289.2006.10464467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can damage the lungs, causing chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and throat irritation. It can also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and compromise the ability of the body to fight respiratory infections—even in healthy people. People who have asthma and allergy are most prone to the adverse effects of high levels of ozone.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Effects of Ozone in Patients with Asthma |url=http://www.epa.gov/o3healthtraining/effects.html |work=US Environmental Protection Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608003704/http://www.epa.gov/o3healthtraining/effects.html |archivedate=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, increasing ozone concentrations to unsafe levels can increase the risk of asthma attacks.

[[Ozone]] generators used for shock treatments (unoccupied rooms) which are needed by smoke, mold, and odor remediation contractors as well as crime scene cleanup companies to oxidize and permanently remove smoke, mold, and odor damage are considered a valuable and effective tool when used correctly for commercial and industrial purposes. However, there is a growing body of evidence that these machines can produce undesirable by-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozone Generators that are Sold as Air Cleaners|url=http://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/ozone-generators-are-sold-air-cleaners|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the California Air Resources Board announced a ban of indoor air cleaning devices which produce ozone above a legal limit. This law, which took effect in 2010, requires testing and certification of all types of indoor air cleaning devices to verify that they do not emit excessive ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/aircleaners/aircleaners.htm|title=AB 2276 Air Cleaner Regulation|access-date=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=AB-2276 Ozone: indoor air cleaning devices. |type=Act |number=2276 |date=29 September 2006 |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200520060AB2276 |accessdate=2016-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amoco Cadiz 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Amoco Cadiz'' and coast of Brittany.]]
The [[oil tanker]] ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'' ran aground on [[Portsall|Portsall Rocks]], {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} from the coast of [[Brittany]], France, on 16 March 1978, and ultimately split in three and sank, all together resulting in the [[largest oil spill]] of its kind in history to that date.&lt;ref name="ctx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aukevisser"&gt;{{cite web | author=Auke Visser | title=Amoco Cadiz | url=http://www.aukevisser.nl/supertankers/part-1/id532.htm | publisher=International Super Tankers | date=26 August 2010 | accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NOAA]] estimates that the total oil spill amounted to 220,880 metric tonnes of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil spill - Amoco Cadiz|url=https://incidentnews.noaa.gov/incident/6241|website=incidentnews.noaa.gov|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequence of events==
En route from the [[Persian Gulf]] to [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]], via a scheduled stop at [[Lyme Bay]], Great Britain, the ship encountered stormy weather with gale conditions and high seas while in the [[English Channel]]. At around 09:45, a heavy wave slammed into the ship's [[rudder]] and it was found that she was no longer responding to the helm. This was due to the shearing of [[British Standard Whitworth|Whitworth thread]] studs in the Hastie four ram steering gear, built under licence in Spain, causing a loss of [[hydraulic fluid]]. Attempts to repair the damage and regain control of the ship were made but proved unsuccessful. While the message "no longer manoeuvrable" and asking other vessels to stand by was transmitted at 10:20, no call for [[Tugboat|tug]] assistance was issued until 11:20.&lt;ref name="ctx"&gt;{{cite web|  title=''Amoco Cadiz'' (IMO 7336422): Summary for Casualty ID 19780316_001| url=http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/precis.php5?key=19780316_001 | work=Casualty Database| publisher=Center for Tankship Excellence| accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lagadec"&gt;{{cite book | author=Patrick Lagadec | title=Major Technological Risk - An Assessment of Industrial Disasters | year=1982 | format=Oxford; New York | publisher=Pergamon Press | url=http://www.patricklagadec.net/fr/pdf/Amoco_Cadiz_EN.pdf  | isbn=0-08-028913-4  | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German tug ''Pacific'' responded to ''Amoco Cadiz'' at 11:28, offering assistance under a [[Lloyd's Open Form]] (see below). It arrived on the scene at 12:20, but because of the stormy sea, a tow line was not in place until 14:00, and broke off at 16:15. Several attempts were made to establish another tow line and ''Amoco Cadiz'' dropped its anchor trying to halt its drift. A successful tow line was in place at 20:55,&lt;ref name="Lagadec"/&gt; but this measure proved incapable of preventing the supertanker from drifting towards the coast because of its huge mass and [[Beaufort scale|Force 10]] storm winds.&lt;ref name="pandora"&gt;{{cite web | author=Boileau, David |author2=Allen, Tony|author3= Claes, Johnny | title=Amoco Cadiz (+1978) | url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?10339 | work=The Wrecksite Archive | date=4 July 2009 | accessdate=11 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924094606/http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?10339|archivedate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 21:04 ''Amoco Cadiz'' ran aground the first time, flooding its engines, and again at 21:39, this time ripping open the hull and starting the oil spill. Her crew was rescued by [[French Naval Aviation]] helicopters at midnight, and her captain and one officer remained aboard until 05:00 the next morning.&lt;ref name="Lagadec"/&gt;

At 10:00 on 17 March the vessel broke in two, releasing its entire cargo of {{convert|1.6|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil, and broke again eleven days later from the buffeting of high stormy seas. The wreckage was later completely destroyed with depth charges by the [[French Navy]].&lt;ref name="pandora"/&gt;

==Lloyd's Open Form==
An argument arose between the captain of ''Amoco Cadiz'', Pasquale Bardari, and that of the captain of the German tug ''Pacific'', Hartmut Weinert, on the issue of [[Lloyd's Open Form]] (LOF).  Captain Weinert thought this a classic LOF case, an oil tanker with damage to its steering gear, rough weather and getting closer to the shore by the minute.

At the time of the accident, the ship and the cargo were valued at about {{US$|40 million}}, so Captain Weinert's company could, in the event of success, have received a large award.  Captain Bardari of the Cadiz, on the instructions of his owners, wanted "....towage rate to Lyme Bay."

The argument dragged on from 11:28 when ''Pacific'' first made contact with ''Amoco Cadiz'' until 16:00 when Captain Bardari finally received approval to accept the LOF from the ship's owners in [[Chicago]]. However, this dispute did not delay the salvage operation significantly, because tugging preparations had already started. Captain Weinert was aware that if he were to succeed in bringing the tanker into Lyme Bay on the English coast, his owners could arrest the ship in the English High Court in pursuit of a claim for salvage.

It was incorrectly reported in the press at the time that, after long negotiations on financial terms between the ship's captain and the master of a West German tugboat and two unsuccessful towing attempts, the towline finally broke during the argument and the ship drifted onto the rocks. This version of events became fixed in the public mind although in fact delay was caused by Captain Bardari of ''Amoco Cadiz'' contacting her owners in Chicago for instructions. The delay in sending a distress message meant that the larger tug ''Seefalke'', which might have been in range an hour earlier, was no longer nearby when the distress call was made.&lt;ref name="ctx"/&gt;

==Oil spill==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2014}}
''Amoco Cadiz'' contained 1,604,500 [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] (219,797 tons) of [[light crude oil]] from [[Ras Tanura]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kharg Island]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="pandora"/&gt; Additionally, she had nearly 4,000 tonnes bunker oil. Severe weather resulted in the complete breakup of the ship before any oil could be pumped out of the wreck, resulting in its entire cargo of crude oil (belonging to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]) and 4,000 tons of [[fuel oil]] being spilled into the sea.&lt;ref name ="Helgoland Marine Research"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hartog | first=C. den | last2=Jacobs |first2=R. P. W. M. | title=Effects of the ''Amoco Cadiz'' Oil Spill on an Eelgrass Community at Roscoff (France) with special reference to the mobile benthic fauna  | journal=Helgoland Marine Research | publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg | volume=33 | issue=1-4 | pages=182–191 | doi=10.1007/BF02414745 |date = March 1980| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x427513224718740/ | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{convert|12|mi|abbr=on}} long slick and heavy pools of oil spread onto {{convert|45|mi|abbr=on}} of the French shoreline by northwesterly winds. Prevailing westerly winds during the following month spread the oil approximately {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} east along the coast. One week after the accident, oil had reached [[Côtes d'Armor]].

Oil penetrated the sand on several beaches to a depth of {{convert|20|in|mm|-2}}. Sub-surface oil separated into two or three layers due to the extensive sand transfer that occurred on the beaches during rough weather. Piers and slips in the small harbors from [[Porspoder]] to [[Île-de-Bréhat|Brehat Island]] were covered with oil. Other affected areas included the pink granite rock beaches of [[Trégastel]] and [[Perros-Guirec]], as well as the tourist beaches at [[Plougasnou]]. The total extent of oiling one month after the spill included approximately {{convert|200|mi|km}} of coastline. Beaches of 76 different [[Brittany|Breton]] communities were oiled.

Oil persisted for only a few weeks along the exposed rocky shores that experienced moderate to high wave action. In the areas sheltered from wave action, however, the oil persisted in the form of an asphalt crust for several years.

[[File:Amoco Cadiz impact.jpg|thumb|right|Oiled beach in Brittany.]]
The isolated location of the grounding and rough seas hampered cleanup efforts for the two weeks following the incident.

As mandated in the "[[Polmar Plan]]", the [[French Navy]] was responsible for all offshore operations while the [[Civil Safety Service]] was responsible for shore cleanup activities. Although the total quantity of collected oil and water reached 100,000 tons, less than 20,000 tons of oil were recovered from this liquid after treatment in refining plants.

The nature of the oil and rough seas contributed to the rapid formation of a "chocolate mousse" [[emulsification]] of oil and water. This viscous emulsification greatly complicated the cleanup efforts. French authorities decided not to use dispersants in sensitive areas or the coastal fringe where water depth was less than {{convert|50|m|ft}}. Had dispersant been applied from the air in the vicinity of the spill source, the formation of mousse might have been prevented.

At the time, ''Amoco Cadiz ''incident resulted in the largest loss of marine life ever recorded from an oil spill. Mortalities of most animals occurred over the two months following the spill. Two weeks following the accident, millions of dead [[mollusc]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and other bottom dwelling organisms washed ashore.

Diving birds constituted the majority of the nearly 20,000 dead birds that were recovered. The [[oyster]] mortality from the spill was estimated at 9,000 tons. Fishermen in the area caught fish with skin ulcerations and tumors.

Some of the fish caught in the area reportedly had a strong taste of petroleum. Although [[echinoderm]] and small [[crustacean]] populations almost completely disappeared, the populations of many species recovered within a year. Cleanup activities on rocky shores, such as pressure-washing, also caused habitat impacts.

The ''Amoco Cadiz'' spill was one of the most studied oil spills in history. Many studies remain in progress. This was the largest recorded spill in history and was the first spill in which [[estuarine]] tidal rivers were oiled. No follow-up mitigation existed to deal with asphalt formation and problems that resulted after the initial aggressive cleanup.

Additional erosion of beaches occurred in several places where no attempt was made to restore the gravel that was removed to lower the beach face. Many of the affected marshes, mudflats, and sandy beaches, were low-energy areas. Evidence of oiled beach sediments can still be seen in some of these sheltered areas. Layers of sub-surface oil still remain buried in many of the impacted beaches.

==Culture==
The ship and spill features in one of [[Steve Forbert]]'s songs about oil pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | subject=Steve Forbert | interviewer=Mike Ragogna | title=Oil and Music: Conversations With Steve Forbert and Tift Merritt | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emoil-and-musicem-convers_b_592938.html?view=print | type=Interview: transcript | work=The Huffington Post  | date=28 May 2010 | accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speedy J]] has a song named "Amoco Cadiz" on his album ''A Shocking Hobby''. French popstar [[Alain Barriere]] had a disco hit in France with a song called "Amoco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  | title=Discogs.com | url= http://www.discogs.com/Alain-Barriere-Amoco/release/4368118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal claims==
In 1978, it was estimated to have caused US$250 million in damage to fisheries and tourist amenities.  The French government presented claims totalling 1.9 billion french francs to United States courts (using the 1978 exchange rate and with interest added this came to at least US$1.6 billion). In 1984, U.S. District Court Judge Frank J. McGarr held that Amoco was liable for damages when he issued his trial verdict, after 3 1/2 years of legal proceedings. Further, the judge ruled that Amoco had put off needed maintenance on the vessel in order to keep it at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-01-12/business/8803210819_1_amoco-cadiz-mcgarr-french-law], http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-01-12/business/8803210819_1_amoco-cadiz-mcgarr-french-law (accessed May 15th 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, US oil giant Amoco has decided not to appeal against the US court order that it must pay US$200 million to the French government. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurance-times.net/article/amoco-agrees-pay-us230m], http://www.insurance-times.net/article/amoco-agrees-pay-us230m (accessed May 15th 2018). &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="508">An '''avalanche boulder tongue''' is an accumulation of debris produced by [[snow]] [[avalanches]]. Well developed avalanche boulder tongue usually develop below [[avalanche gullie]]s due to successive avalanches over a long time span. The avalanche boulder tongues were first intensively investigated by [[Anders Rapp]] in the areas of [[Abisko]] and [[Kebnekaise]] in [[Swedish Lappland]].

'''Black Sunday''' refers to a particularly severe [[dust storm]] that occurred on April 14, 1935, as part of the [[Dust Bowl]].&lt;ref name="nws"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Sunday Dust Storm of 14 April 1935|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=blacksunday|publisher=National Weather Service: Norman, Oklahoma Weather Forecast Office|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the worst dust storms in American history and it caused immense economic and agricultural damage.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Sunday: April 14, 1935|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-black-sunday|publisher=PBS|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated to have displaced 300 million tons of topsoil from the prairie area in the US.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Blizzard'', History Channel documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of April 14, the residents of the Plains States were forced to take cover as a dust storm, or "black blizzard", blew through the region. The storm hit the [[Oklahoma Panhandle]] and [[Northwestern Oklahoma]] first, and moved south for the remainder of the day.&lt;ref name="nws"/&gt; It hit [[Beaver, Oklahoma|Beaver]] around 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., [[Boise City, Oklahoma|Boise City]] around 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., and [[Amarillo, Texas]], at 7:20&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="nws"/&gt; The conditions were the most severe in the Oklahoma and [[Texas panhandle]]s, but the storm's effects were felt in other surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="nws"/&gt;

The storm was harsh due to the high winds that hit the area that day. The combination of drought, erosion, bare soil, and winds caused the dust to fly freely and at high speeds.&lt;ref name="ncdc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dust Bowl Drought|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/drought/drght_history.html|work=Drought: A Paleo Perspective -- 20th Century Drought|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Dust Bowl ==
{{Main|Dust Bowl}}
In North America, the term "Dust Bowl" was first used to describe a series of dust storms that hit the [[prairie]]s of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] during the 1930s,&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; and later to describe the area in the United States that was most affected by the storms, including western Kansas, eastern Colorado, northeastern New Mexico, and the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles.&lt;ref name="histevents"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dust Bowl 1931–1939|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3424800020/dust-bowl-1931-1939.html|work=Historic Events for Students: The Great Depression|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "black blizzards" started in the Eastern states in 1930, affecting agriculture from [[Maine]] to [[Arkansas]]. By 1934 they had reached the [[Great Plains]], stretching from North Dakota to Texas, and from the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River Valley]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watkins|first=T. H.|title=The Dust Bowl|year=2003|publisher=Greenhaven Press|chapter=Prosperity, Depression, and War: 1920–1945|pages=162–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Dust Bowl" (as an area) received its name following the disastrous "Black Sunday" storm in April 1935, when reporter Robert L. Geiger referred to the region as "The Dust Bowl" in his account of the storm.&lt;ref name="histevents"/&gt;

== Causes ==
{{Details|Dust Bowl#Causes}}

[[Cattle]] farming and [[Sheep husbandry|sheep ranching]] had left much of the West devoid of natural grass and shrubs to anchor the soil,&lt;ref name="histevents"/&gt; and over-farming and poor soil stewardship left the soil dehydrated and lacking in organic matter.&lt;ref name="watkins"/&gt; During a massive [[drought]] that hit the United States in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="histevents"/&gt; the lack of rainfall, snowfall, and moisture in the air dried out the top soil in most of the country's farming regions.

== Effects ==
The destruction caused by the dust storms, and especially by the storm on Black Sunday, killed multiple people {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} and caused hundreds of thousands of people to relocate&lt;ref name="watkins"/&gt;. Poor migrants from the American Southwest (known as "[[Okie]]s" - though only about 20 percent were from Oklahoma) flooded California, overtaxing the state's health and employment infrastructure.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trimarchi|first=Maria|title=What Caused the Dust Bowl?|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/dust-bowl-cause2.html|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, after the massive damage caused by these storms, Congress passed the [[Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936|Soil Conservation Act]], which established the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|Soil Conservation Service]] (SCS) as a permanent agency of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA Is Celebrating 150 Years|url=http://www.in.nrcs.usda.gov|publisher=Indiana NRCS|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCS was created in an attempt to provide guidance for land owners and land users to reduce soil erosion, improve forest and field land and conserve and develop natural resources.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRCS Fact Sheet |url=http://www.me.nrcs.usda.gov/about/FactSheet.html |publisher=Maine NCRS |accessdate=20 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214164232/http://www.me.nrcs.usda.gov/about/FactSheet.html |archivedate=14 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal accounts of Black Sunday and other dust storms ==
During the 1930s, many residents of the Dust Bowl kept accounts and journals of their lives and of the storms that hit their areas. Collections of accounts of the dust storms during the 1930s have been compiled over the years and are now available in book collections and online.

{{quote|text="People caught in their own yards grope for the doorstep. Cars come to a standstill, for no light in the world can penetrate that swirling murk…. The nightmare is deepest during the storms. But on the occasional bright day and the usual gray day we cannot shake from it. We live with the dust, eat it, sleep with it, watch it strip us of possessions and the hope of possessions."&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;|sign=Avis D. Carlson|source=[[The New Republic]]}}

Lawrence Svobida was a [[wheat]] farmer in Kansas during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="histevents"/&gt;  He experienced the period of dust storms, and the effect that they had on the surrounding environment and the society.&lt;ref name="histevents"/&gt; His observations and feelings are available in his memoirs, ''Farming the Dust Bowl''.&lt;ref name="histevents"/&gt; Here he describes an approaching dust storm:

{{quote|text="… At other times a cloud is seen to be approaching from a distance of many miles. Already it has the banked appearance of a cumulus cloud, but it is black instead of white and it hangs low, seeming to hug the earth. Instead of being slow to change its form, it appears to be rolling on itself from the crest downward. As it sweeps onward, the landscape is progressively blotted out. Birds fly in terror before the storm, and only those that are strong of wing may escape. The smaller birds fly until they are exhausted, then fall to the ground, to share the fate of the thousands of jack rabbits which perish from suffocation."&lt;ref name="histevents"/&gt;}}

The Black Sunday storm is detailed in the 2012 [[Ken Burns]] PBS documentary ''[[The Dust Bowl (film)|The Dust Bowl]]''.

== Media references ==

Musicians and songwriters began to reflect the Dust Bowl and the events of the 1930s in their music. [[Woody Guthrie]], a singer-songwriter from Oklahoma, wrote a variety of songs documenting his experiences living during the era of dust storms.&lt;ref name="nws"/&gt; Several were collected in his first album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]''. One of them, ''Great Dust Storm'', describes the events of Black Sunday.  An excerpt of the lyrics follows:

''On the 14th day of April of 1935,&lt;br /&gt;
''There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky.&lt;br /&gt;
''You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black,&lt;br /&gt;
''And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track.&lt;br /&gt;
''From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,&lt;br /&gt;
''Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,&lt;br /&gt;
''It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,&lt;br /&gt;
''We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.&lt;ref name="nws"/&gt;

Musician Kat Eggleston has written a play, ''The Cyclone Line'', about her father Al Eggleston's experiences growing up in 1930s Oklahoma, Black Sunday, and the Dust Bowl in general. Its first public performances were on [[Vashon, Washington|Vashon (Island), Washington]], where he lived most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vashonalliedarts.org/the-cyclone-line-a-play-by-kat-eggleston/|title=The Cyclone Line, a play by Kat Eggleston «  Vashon Center for the Arts|website=vashonalliedarts.org|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americana recording artist [[Grant Maloy Smith]] released an album in 2017 called ''Dust Bowl – American Stories'' that featured two songs that directly referenced Black Sunday. The song "Old Black Roller" is written from a first person perspective during the Black Sunday storm, and another song "Never Seen The Rain" has these chorus lyrics: "We worked the land to death, me and my brother | 'Til April 14, 1935 | Oklahoma, you were like our mother - oh, my"

American recording artist [[Gillian Welch]] refers to the storm and other historical events in a two-part song on her 2001 album ''[[Time (The Revelator)]]'': "April the 14th Part I" and "Ruination Day Part II".

'''''Boom Town''''' is a 1940 American [[adventure film]] directed by [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]] and starring [[Clark Gable]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Claudette Colbert]], and [[Hedy Lamarr]]. The supporting cast features [[Frank Morgan]], [[Lionel Atwill]], and [[Chill Wills]]. A story written by [[James Edward Grant]] in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine entitled "A Lady Comes to [[Burkburnett, Texas|Burkburnett]]" provided the inspiration for the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/heb14 "Burkburnett, TX"] on the Texas State Historical Association website&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced and released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].

==Plot==
"Big John" McMasters ([[Clark Gable]]) and "Square John" Sand ([[Spencer Tracy]]) are two down-on-their-luck oil [[Wildcatter|wildcat]]ters who join forces. Without enough money, they steal drilling equipment from a skeptical Luther Aldrich ([[Frank Morgan]]). Their well proves a bust and they have to hastily depart when Aldrich shows up with the sheriff to take back his property. The two oilmen team up and make enough money to partially pay Aldrich. To get him to back them for a second try, they cut him in for a percentage of the well. This time, they strike it rich.

When Elizabeth 'Betsy' Bartlett ([[Claudette Colbert]]) shows up, McMasters sweeps her off her feet (without knowing that Sand considers her his girl) and marries her. Sand accepts the situation, wanting Betsy to be happy. However, on their first anniversary, she catches her husband dancing with a barroom floozy. As a result, Sand quarrels with McMasters and they flip a coin for the entire oilfield. Betsy leaves too, but returns when she learns that her husband has lost almost everything to Sand and needs her.

Each man goes through booms and busts. Building on his renewed success as a wildcatter, McMasters moves to New York to expand into refineries and distribution, competing against former customer Harry Compton ([[Lionel Atwill]]). Seeking inside information about his rivals, he hires away Compton's adviser Karen Vanmeer ([[Hedy Lamarr]]), who uses her social contacts and womanly charms to gather industry information.

Meanwhile, Sand loses everything he has built up in South America to a revolution. When he meets McMasters at an oilmen's convention, the two finally reconcile, and Sand goes to work for his old friend. When he suspects that McMasters is carrying on an affair with Karen, he tries to save Betsy's marriage by offering to marry Karen. However, she deduces his motives and declines. When a miserable Betsy tries to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills, Sand decides that the only way to help her is to bankrupt McMasters. Sand loses his costly battle with his former friend and goes broke. It is only when he asks McMasters to give his wife a divorce that the married man finally comes to his senses. Later, McMasters is prosecuted by the government for violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] and loses his business. In the end, poor, but happier, Sand and McMasters team up again, with the blissful Betsy looking on. Aldrich supplies them with equipment and the whole cycle begins again.

'''Cast notes:'''
*Gable's father, William Gable, was an oil-well driller and as a teenager Gable himself worked for his father in [[Oklahoma]], so he was familiar with the subject of this film.&lt;ref name=tcmart&gt;D'Onofrio, Joseph. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/57/Boom-Town/articles.html "Boom Town (1940)"] on [[TCM.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] had been looking for a project set in the oil fields as a vehicle for Clarke Gable for some time. They optioned the short story "The Lady Comes to Burkburnett" in November 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Schallert, Edwin (November 18, 1938) "'Boom Town' Looms for Gable and Tracy" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' p.A7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (November 23, 1938) "Goldwyn Seeks to Buy 'The Raven' for Gary Cooper--Universal Engages Princess Baba for Comedy Of Local Origin" ''[[The New York Times]]'' p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

The actress originally considered for the female lead role was [[Myrna Loy]], for whom the part was written.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/57/Boom-Town/notes.html "Notes"] on [[TCM.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Douglas W. (November 18, 1939) "Madeleine Carroll Gets Lead in 'My Son, My Son,' and 'Northwest Mounted Police' Ruth Gordon in 'Disraeli' Gets Role of Queen Victoria Opposite Olivier -- 'Beasts of Berlin' at Globe Today Of Local Origin" ''[[The New York Times]]'' p.22&lt;/ref&gt; The role went to Claudette Colbert instead, the second, and last, pairing of Colbert and Gable, who had appeared together in ''[[It Happened One Night]]''.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt; Gable and Spencer Tracy had also worked together before, in two other films, ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'' and ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]''.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt; Eventually Tracy insisted on the same [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]] clause in his MGM contract that Gable enjoyed, effectively ending the pairing, though Tracy and Gable liked each other personally and enjoyed working together.

The movie was the first Gable made under a new seven-year contract with MGM.&lt;ref&gt;Scheur, Philip K. (January 26, 1940) "Metro Gives Gable New Seven-Year Contract: Tilton Sings in 'Irene' R.K.O., Massey in Deal Rutherford, Hunt Cast 'Embezzler' Announced Kosleck With Paramount" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Douglas W. (January 26, 1940) "Metro Signs Gable in $2,000,000 Deal: Actor's Seven-Year Contract Starts at $5,000 Weekly-- Calls for 52 Weeks a Year 'Fighting 69th' at Strand Opens Today Starring Cagney and O'Brien--'Brother Rat and a Baby' at the Roxy Ann Rutherford Gets Role Warners Buy Cain's Story Of Local Origin" ''[[The New York Times]]'' p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy, in fact, brooded over his second-billing status during the filming of ''Boom Town'' and was reportedly unpleasant to deal with.  He especially did not get along with either of the female leads.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;

Some of the location shooting for the film took place in [[Bakersfield, California]].&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt;

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the scenes involving the oil wells as exciting but found the human part of the story "peters out into repetitious wrangling along monotonous lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F01EEDF103EE432A25755C0A96F9C946193D6CF |title=Movie Review - Boom Town |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |authorlink=Bosley Crowther |date=September 6, 1940 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=December 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s review was positive, writing: "Unlike many large-budgeted productions carrying multistar setups that tend either to costume background or sophistication for limited appeal, this one breaks out with a dashing, rough-and-tumble yarn of modern adventure that carries all elements for widest audience appeal ... story is repetitious in its cutbacks to new oil fields and gushers, but this fact will be considered unimportant by the customers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=August 7, 1940 |title=Boom Town |url= |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |publisher=Variety, Inc. |page=14 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' accurately predicted that the film's star power would make it a big hit, but said the story was "only fairly good" and the plot "somewhat thin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 17, 1940 |title='Boom Town' with Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Claudette Colbert and Hedy Lamarr |url= |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |location= |publisher= |page=131 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Film Daily]]'' called the screenplay "excellent" and wrote that Conway "has furnished an outstanding job of directing, blending the action, love interest and comedy so that interest is held to the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=August 6, 1940 |title=Reviews of the New Films |url= |journal=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folk, Inc. |page=8 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] wrote a mixed review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', stating that "when the plot leaves the West and comes East, it grows rather feeble. Western bars, these boom towns and their peculiar architecture and their customs, and the spectacle of the great oil gushers themselves form a substantial background of interest, I should say, which a commonplace plot merely frames."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Mosher |first=John |authorlink=John Mosher (writer) |date=September 7, 1940 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |location=New York |publisher=F-R Publishing Corp. |page=61 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''Boom Town'' was second only to ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' in generating ticket sales for a Clark Gable picture.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} According to MGM records the film earned $3,664,000 in the US and Canada and $1,365,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,892,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

'''Brettstapel''' is a massive [[timber]] [[construction]] system, fabricated exclusively from [[softwood]] timber posts connected with [[hardwood]] timber [[dowel]]s. It is a relatively simple method of construction that exploits low grade timber, not normally suitable for use in construction, to form load bearing solid timber wall, floor and roof panels.

Brettstapel works by using hardwood dowels with a [[moisture content]] lower than that of softwood posts. Over time the dowels expand to achieve moisture equilibrium thus 'locking' the posts together and creating a structural [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] system.

It is one of a few construction methods that can be entirely fabricated from timber. Although some variations do still use [[glue]] and [[nail (fastener)|nail]]s, these are not necessary and avoiding these means a healthier indoor [[air quality]] can be achieved. The timber itself locks in vast amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] without emitting harmful [[toxin]]s found in other materials, benefiting both the user and the environment.

==History==
[[File:Types of Brettstapel Construction.jpg|thumb|Types of Brettstapel Construction]]
Brettstapel was invented in the 1970s by the German engineer [[Julius Natterer]]&lt;ref&gt;Essay on Julius Natterer in [http://www.elearning-iabse.org/EminentEng/Julius%20Natterer_2_2008.pdf English] and in [http://www.db-bauzeitung.de/files/db_essays/ing_portrait0405.pdf German], 2014 &lt;!-- the webpage 'www.natterer-bcn.com' cited here originally is not available anymore --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is now commonly used across [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]], whilst slowly emerging in the UK. Originally it consisted of low grade timber posts continuously nailed together to form panels strong enough to support mines and railways. In 1999 a German company developed a doweled system which relied on the varying moisture content to form solid structural panels however many companies introduced glue to the system to strengthen it. In 2001, a new variant of Brettstapel was developed where diagonal dowels replaced the perpendicular ones thus resolving separation issues and allowing for longer spans. Presently only one company uses the diagonal dowel system whilst all except for two (who still use nails) use perpendicular dowels, mostly without glue. There are now a range of companies producing CLT cross laminated timber (rotating layers of boards) using timber dowels based upon Brettstapel.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://brettstapel.org/Brettstapel/What_is_it.html Brettstapel.org]", 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Acharacle Primary School Exposed Brettstapel.jpg|thumb|Acharacle Primary School Exposed Brettstapel]]
Throughout the development of Brettstapel, low grade wood (predominantly [[spruce]] or [[fir]]) has remained the choice raw material for the posts where-as beech is more often used for the dowels. By ensuring natural defects, such as knots in the wooden posts are not adjacent to each other, poor quality timber can be utilised which makes for a highly economical way of using a fast-growing, underused resource, of which the UK and [[Scotland]] in particular, has an abundance.

Brettstapel is manufactured to three quality grades depending on how visible the final product will be: Industrial, Standard and Exposed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.brettstapel.at Brettstapel.at]" 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, the most rudimentary solution is to use unfinished timber where the panels are to be covered. Alternatively, the posts can be planed, [[chamfer]]ed and profiled to give a highly aesthetic finish and further still, the posts can be altered with hollow voids along the edge to enhance the acoustic performance. Brettstapel can also be combined with [[concrete]] and [[steel]] to form composite structures for more demanding projects such as large spans, bridges and trusses.

==Application==
Brettstapel is commonly produced as part of a prefabricated wall, ceiling or roof panel. The [[prefabrication]] takes place in dedicated factories using specialist [[machinery]] and an experienced team ensuring tight [[quality control]] and fast construction.

The structural panels are generally manufactured in 600mm wide sections, secured together using timber joints and further combined with sheathing board, [[Building insulation|insulation]], and a vapour barrier to form the completed panels. Structural openings are incorporated into the panels, and in some cases [[plumbing]] and electrical fittings can be too, whilst the external finish commonly varies between render and timber cladding which is applied on-site.

[[File:Brettstapel Wall Panel.jpg|thumb|Brettstapel Wall Panel]]

This high degree of prefabrication means buildings can be manufactured and erected extremely quickly and efficiently. It takes approximately five weeks from cutting dried timber to completing the fit-out of a house, whilst a house can be erected on site and made weather tight in a matter of days.

Structurally, [[manufacturer]]s can produce panels up to 12–15 metres in length, although a 7metre span is more readily achievable with a 210-250mm deep panel. Brettstapel trusses can be made to span more demanding distances, such as those required in large industrial units and [[bridge]]s.

The tallest building to use Brettstapel panels is currently the “E3” building in Germany at seven storeys tall.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.e3berlin.de E3 Building]" 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although this incorporates other timber elements, four storey buildings have been erected solely using Brettstapel for the structure. [[Fire regulations]] currently limit the height of a timber building, however these are being challenged by the massive timber systems and taller examples are emerging; a typical 120mm panel has a 60 minute rating whilst complete structural panels can achieve 90 minute ratings which more than matches concrete and steel construction methods.

Contemporary Brettstapel construction is also employed in the [http://www.iba-hamburg.de/en/projects/the-building-exhibition-within-the-building-exhibition/smart-material-houses/soft-house/projekt/soft-house.html IBA Soft House] in Hamburg, Germany. Whereas the timber skeleton of the E3 building is obscured by plaster, the [http://www.merklegruppe.de/merkle-holzbau/ Brettstapel panels] in the Soft House are exposed on the interior floors, walls, and ceilings. The building was then clad in layers of mineral wool insulation, a water barrier, and a larch wood rainscreen to ensure stability against the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/buildings/soft-house-designed-by-kennedy-violich-architecture_o|title = Soft House, designed by Kennedy &amp; Violich Architecture|date = 2014-08-11|website = Architect|access-date = 2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
* Carbon dioxide is one of the biggest contributors to [[global warming]]. Considering timber locks in 930 kilograms of carbon dioxide per cubic metre, (the equivalent to taking a car off the road for 2 months) a Brettstapel building sequesters significantly more carbon than a timber frame one.
* Brettstapel has excellent thermal properties and if used efficiently could reduce energy demands by up to 90%&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.passivhaus.org.uk Passivhaus Construction]", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; due to its low U-values, airtight construction and high [[thermal mass]], approximately five times higher than timber frame. Alone it has a [[thermal conductivity]] of 0.13W/mK and complete structural panels achieve U-values between 0.12 and 0.24 W/m2K.
* The ability to prefabricate buildings offsite and erect them quickly has practical and economical advantages to the British [[construction industry]], especially considering the poor climate.
* The reduced [[energy demand]], along with the shorter and less labour-intensive construction period, contributes significantly towards lower lifecycle costs of a building. This offsets the higher material cost; Brettstapel is approximately 20% more expensive than an equivalent area of timber frame construction.
* Specifying untreated, exposed Brettstapel, without glue and nails, helps to produce a healthy indoor environment that is free from potentially harmful compounds found in other materials; this is further enhanced by the [[hygroscopic]] nature of the prefabricated panels.

==British Industry==
[[File:Industrial Grade Brettstapel.jpg|thumb|Industrial Grade Brettstapel]]
Brettstapel projects are starting to be realised in the UK, [[Acharacle Primary School]] in Scotland being the first and setting a fitting precedent for others to follow. Some private and public [[housing project]]s are also being built in the Scottish borders and in [[London]]. Plummerswood Active House in the Scottish Borders has received the Scottish Home Award for Architectural Excellence 2012.

Currently Brettstapel is predominantly manufactured in Austria, Switzerland, Germany and [[Norway]] which has a negative effect on British users, due to increased [[transportation]] costs and a subsequently a higher [[embodied energy]]. British [[architect]]s and clients are however slowly starting to use massive timber systems more frequently, but for all the benefits this brings, the British [[timber industry]] has been missing out.

However as of Spring 2013 In-Wood Developments in EastSussex is believed to be the first UK manufacturer of Brettstapel Panels in the UK, bringing this construction opportunity to the UK market on a more competitive basis. The first showing of these UK manufactured panels was made at Ecobuild 2013.

Scotland produces the majority of UK timber, 65% of which is used for woodchips, fencing, packaging and sawdust,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-7aql5b Forestry Statistics]" 2009&lt;/ref&gt; this is timber that could be used in Brettstapel construction. British grown [[Sitka spruce]] is an ideal raw material to use for Brettstapel as it is a low coat timber that grows quickly and accounts for approximately third of all timber in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6AGGZW The Scottish Forestry Strategy]" 2006&lt;/ref&gt; If enough interest is generated, it is possible to conceive that the industry will soon have an incentive to produce more Brettstapel in the UK using Sitka spruce; this would be a highly profitable use of a resource that is currently predominantly used for cheaper products.

Increasing the use of British timber will have huge ecological and economical benefits to the global environment and to British industries. Ultimately however, specifying Brettstapel within the UK will contribute towards a higher quality of construction; a higher standard of living; an improved [[Environmental quality|environment]] and towards the increased health and well-being of future occupants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2225">'''British Coal Utilisation Research Association''' ('''BCURA''') was founded in 1938, with the first chairman being [[John G. Bennett]].  It is a non-profit association of industrial companies, registered as a charity.  According to its website "The aim of BCURA is to promote research and other activities concerned with the production, distribution, and use of coal and its derivatives".  The member companies provide funds for BCURA to make grants to academic institutions to support research projects.  The members are the UK power supply companies, coal producers, some large industrial users of coal and equipment manufacturers. It had a relationship with the now closed Coal Research Establishment at Stoke Orchard, Cheltenham, UK.

==Coal Bank==
The BCURA maintains a collection of 36 UK Coals, ranging from [[lignite]] to [[anthracite]], which are used as reference standards in research.

==People==
[[Rosalind Franklin]] worked on porosity of coal during World War II.

[[Victor Goldschmidt]] lectured on rare elements in coal ash during World War II.

[[Marcello Pirani]] was scientific consultant during 1941—1947, concerned with carbonaceous materials resistant to high temperatures.

The family of [[John G. Bennett]] have a web site that contains information about him and BCURA [https://archive.is/20130222005605/http://www.jgbennett.net/time.html]

Peter H. Given, Head of Organic Chemistry, went on to Pennsylvania State University, achieving distinction in U.S. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110210204914/http://www.eme.psu.edu/lecture_series.html]

In [[electrical power distribution]], a '''bus duct''' (also called '''busway'''), is a [[sheet metal]] duct containing either [[copper]] or [[aluminium]] [[busbar]]s for the purpose of conducting a substantial [[Electric current|current]] of electricity. It is an alternative means of conducting electricity to [[power cable]]s or cable bus.

Originally a '''busway''' consisted of bare [[copper]] [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s supported on inorganic insulators, such as [[porcelain]], mounted within a non-ventilated steel housing.&lt;ref name="The IEEE Standards Association 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=IEEE 3001.5-2013 - IEEE Recommended Practice for the Application of Power Distribution Apparatus in Industrial and Commercial Power Systems | website=The IEEE Standards Association | date=2013-12-11 | url=https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/3001.5-2013.html | access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Busways were produced due to request of the automotive industry in Detroit in the late 1920s. Since that time, busways improved and became an integrated part of [[secondary network]] for industrial plants.&lt;ref name="The IEEE Standards Association 2013"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Similar to [[cable tray]], bus ducts have thicker, [[cold-formed steel]] side rails and thinner [[sheet metal]] coverings. Busbars inside may be separated with distinct and even gaps between them, or “sandwiched” together.

Typically, individual busbars are wrapped or coated with a non-conducting, [[Covalent bond|covalent]] material, such as [[plastic]] or (in older systems) [[electrical tape]].

At the connection point, busbars flare out to enable connection to the next segment.



A plug-in bus duct system or busway can have disconnect switches and other devices mounted on it, for example, to distribute power along a long building. Many forms of busway allow plug-in devices such as switches and motor starters to be easily moved; this provides flexibility for changes on an assembly line,for example.&lt;ref name=AEH11&gt;Terrel Croft, Wilford Summers (ed)''American Electricians Handbook Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill 1987, {{ISBN|0-07013932-6}}, pages 9-114 through 9-132&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeder busway is used to interconnect equipment, such as between a transformer and a switchgear line up.  A variant type is low-impedance busway, which is designed to have lower voltage drop by virtue of close spacing of bus bars, which reduces inductive reactance. 
 
A trolley busway provides power to equipment that must be frequently moved.  The busway is open at the bottom, and a movable collector assembly "trolley" is used to connect between the fixed bus bars in the busway and the cable connected to moving equipment.&lt;ref name=AEH11/&gt;
Bus ducts are building service [[Penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrants]] that are required to be externally [[firestop]]ped where they penetrate fire separations required to have a [[fire-resistance rating]]. Any internal firestops that are supplied by the manufacturer may be tested as integral components to either [http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=857 UL857] or [https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/C37.23-2003.html IEEE C37.23] for [[North America]]n models, and then via [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E814.htm ASTM E814], [http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=1479_3 UL1479] or [http://canada.ul.com/ulcprograms/fireresistantandfirestopproductsandsystems/ ULC-S115]. Bus duct-internal [[firestop]]s mitigate the transmission of internal [[fire]]s, [[smoke]] and [[heat]] between [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|fire compartments]] through the combustion of bus duct-internal covalent wrappings, spacers and brackets.

The following article is a '''comparison of aerobic and [[anaerobic digestion]]'''. In both [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and anaerobic systems the growing and reproducing microorganisms within them require a source of elemental oxygen to survive.&lt;ref name="Aerobic and anaerobic respiration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~terry/Common/respiration.swf |title=Aerobic and anaerobic respiration |accessdate=24 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050520101159/http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~terry/Common/respiration.swf |archivedate=2005-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anaerobic system there is an absence of gaseous oxygen. In an anaerobic digester, gaseous oxygen is prevented from entering the system through physical containment in sealed tanks. Anaerobes access oxygen from sources other than the surrounding air. The oxygen source for these microorganisms can be the organic material itself or alternatively may be supplied by inorganic [[oxide]]s from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, then the 'intermediate' end products are primarily [[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[organic acid]]s plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide with trace levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref&gt;''Adapted from'' Beychok, M. (1967) [[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]], First edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.&lt;ref name="Fergusen, T. 2006 p49"&gt;Fergusen, T. &amp; Mah, R. (2006) Methanogenic bacteria in Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p49&lt;/ref&gt;

In an aerobic system, such as [[composting]], the microorganisms access free, gaseous oxygen directly from the surrounding atmosphere. The end products of an aerobic process are primarily carbon dioxide and water which are the stable, [[oxidised]] forms of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]]. If the biodegradable starting material contains [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], then the end products may also include their oxidised forms- [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[sulfate]].&lt;ref name="Aerobic and anaerobic respiration"/&gt; In an aerobic system the majority of the energy in the starting material is released as heat by their oxidisation into carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name="Fergusen, T. 2006 p49"/&gt;

Composting systems typically include organisms such as [[fungi]] that are able to break down [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]]s to a greater extent than anaerobic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/compost/calc/lignin.html |title=The effect of lignin on biodegradability |accessdate=2 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613115317/http://www.css.cornell.edu/compost/calc/lignin.html |archivedate=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this fact it is possible, following anaerobic digestion, to compost the anaerobic digestate allowing further volume reduction and stabilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/anaerobic_digestion.pdf Anaerobic digestion briefing], www.foe.co.uk, retrieved 2.11.07&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[solid state physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], the '''density of states''' ('''DOS''') of a system describes the number of states per an interval of energy at each energy level available to be occupied. It is mathematically represented by a [[Probability density function|density distribution]] and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. A high 'DOS' at a specific energy level means that there are many states available for occupation. A DOS of zero means that no states can be occupied at that energy level. The DOS is usually represented by one of the symbols ''g, ρ, D, n, or N''.  

Generally, the density of the states of matter is continuous. In [[isolated system]]s however, like atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the [[Probability density function|density distribution]] is [[Discrete distribution|discrete]] like a [[spectral density]]. 

Local
variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often called '''[[local density of states]]''' ('''LDOS'''). If the DOS of an undisturbed
system is zero, the LDOS can locally be non-zero due to the presence of a local potential.

==Introduction==

In quantum mechanical (QM) systems, waves, or wave-like particles, can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system. For example, in some systems, the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material could allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist. In other systems, the crystalline structure of a material could allow waves to propagate in one direction, while suppressing wave propagation in another direction. Often, only specific states are permitted. Thus, it can happen that many states are available for occupation at a specific energy level, while no states are available at other energy levels . 

For example, the density of states of electrons at the bandedge between the [[Valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] and the [[Valence and conduction bands|valence band]] in a semiconductor is shown in orange in Fig. 4 (in the subsequent section "Density of states and distribution functions"). For an electron in the conduction band, an increase of the electron energy causes more states to become available for occupation. Alternatively, the density of state is discontinuous for an interval of energy, which means that there are no states available for electrons to occupy within the bandgap of the material. This condition also means that an electron at the conduction band edge must lose at least the bandgap energy of the material in order to transition to another state in the valence band.

Depending on the quantum mechanical system, the density of states can be calculated for [[electron]]s, [[photon]]s, or [[phonon]]s, and can be given as a function of either energy or the [[wave vector]] ''k''. To convert between the DOS as a function of the energy and the DOS as a function of the wave vector, the system-specific energy dispersion relation between ''E'' and ''k'' must be known. 

In general, the topological properties of the system have a major impact on the properties of the density of states. The most well-known systems, like [[neutronium]] in [[Neutron star|neutron stars]] and [[Free electron model|free electron gases in metals]] (examples of [[degenerate matter]] and a [[Fermi gas]]), have a 3-dimensional [[Euclidean topology]]. Less familiar systems, like [[Two-dimensional electron gas|two-dimensional electron gases]] (2DEG) in [[graphite]] layers and the [[quantum Hall effect]] system in [[MOSFET]] type devices, have a 2-dimensional Euclidean topology. Even less familiar are [[carbon nanotubes]], the [[quantum wire]] and [[Luttinger liquid]] with their 1-dimensional topologies. Systems with 1D and 2D topologies are likely to become more common, assuming developments in [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] proceed.

==Definition==
In general the density of states, related to volume ''V'' and ''N'' countable energy levels, is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) = \frac{1}{V} \cdot \sum _{i=1}^N \delta \left(E - E\left({\vec{k}}_i\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt; 

Using &lt;math&gt; (\Delta k)^d = \left(\frac{2\pi}{L}\right)^d &lt;/math&gt; (the smallest allowed change of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for a particle in a box of dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) under the limit &lt;math&gt;L \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, one derives the volume-related density of states for continuous energy levels
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) := \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}{\frac{\mathrm{d}^d k}{(2\pi)^d}} \cdot \delta \left(E - E\left(\vec{k}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of the spatial dimension of the considered system and &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt; the wave vector.

Equivalently, the density of states can also be understood as the derivative of the microcanonical partition function &lt;math&gt; Z_m (E)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the energy:
:&lt;math&gt; D(E) = \frac {1}{V} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d} Z_m (E)}{\mathrm{d} E}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of states with energy &lt;math&gt; E' &lt;/math&gt; (degree of degeneracy) is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; g\left(E'\right) = \lim _{\Delta E\to 0} \int _{E'}^{E' + \Delta E} D(E) \mathrm{d} E = \lim _{\Delta E\to 0} D\left(E'\right) \Delta E,&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality only applies when the mean value theorem for integrals is valid.

==Symmetry==
[[File:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|260px|First Brillouin zone of the [[Cubic crystal system|FCC lattice]], a [[truncated octahedron]], showing symmetry labels for high symmetry lines and points]]
There is a large variety of systems and types of states for which DOS calculations can be done.

Some condensed matter systems possess a [[symmetry]] of its [[Crystal structure|structure]] on its microscopic scale which simplifies calculations of its density of states. In spherically symmetric systems, the integrals of function are one-dimensional because all variables in the calculation depend only on the radial parameter of the dispersion relation. [[Fluid]]s, [[glass]]es or [[amorphous solid]]s are example of a symmetric system whose [[dispersion relations]] has a rotational symmetry. 

[[File:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|150px|left|Octahedron.]]
Measurements on powders or polycrystalline samples require evaluation and calculation functions and integrals over the whole [[Domain of a function|domain]], most often a [[Brillouin zone]], of the dispersion relations of the system of interest. Sometimes the symmetry of the system is high, which causes the shape of the functions describing the dispersion relations of the system to appear many times over the whole domain of the dispersion relation. In such cases the effort to calculate the DOS can be reduced by a great amount when the calculation is limited to a reduced zone or [[fundamental domain]].&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;
{{cite book |author=Walter Ashley Harrison |title=Electronic Structure and the Properties of Solids |year= 1989 
|publisher=Dover Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2VqQgAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-486-66021-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Brillouin zone of the of a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic lattice]] (FCC) in the figure on the right has the 48-fold symmetry of the [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] ''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' with full [[Octahedral symmetry#Achiral octahedral symmetry|octahedral symmetry]]. This configuration means that the integration over the whole domain of the Brillouin zone can be reduced to a 48-th part of the whole Brillouin zone. As a [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|crystal structure periodic table]] shows, there are many elements with a FCC crystal structure, like [[diamond]], [[silicon]] and [[platinum]] and their Brillouin zones and dispersion relations have this 48-fold symmetry. Two other familiar crystal structures are the body-centered cubic lattice (BCC) and hexagonal closed packed structures (HCP) with cubic and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The BCC structure has the 24-fold [[Tetrahedral symmetry#Pyritohedral symmetry|pyritohedral symmetry]] of the point group ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''. The HCP structure has the 12-fold [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions#Examples|prismatic dihedral]] symmetry of the point group ''D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;''. A complete list of symmetry properties of a point group can be found in [[List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups#Character tables|point group character tables]].

In general it is easier to calculate a DOS when the symmetry of the system is higher and the number of topological dimensions of the dispersion relation is lower. The DOS of dispersion relations with rotational symmetry can often be calculated analytically. This result is fortunate, since many materials of practical interest, such as steel and silicon, have high symmetry.

In [[anisotropic]] condensed matter systems such as a [[single crystal]] of a compound, the density of states could be different in one crystallographic direction than in another. These causes the anisotropic density of states to be more difficult to visualize, and might require methods such as calculating the DOS for particular points or directions only, or calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) to a particular crystal orientation.

==''k''-space topologies==

[[File:K-space.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Figure 1: Spherical surface in ''k''-space for electrons in three dimensions.]]

The density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Volume&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; , in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Area&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; , in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Length&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is important to note that the volume being referenced is the volume of ''k''-space; the space enclosed by the [[constant energy surface]] of the system derived through a [[dispersion relation]] that relates ''E'' to ''k''. An example of a 3-dimensional ''k''-space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system itself will confine the momentum of particles inside the system.

===Density of wave vector states (sphere)===
The calculation for DOS starts by counting the ''N'' allowed states at a certain ''k'' that are contained within {{nowrap|[''k'',  ''k + dk'']}} inside the volume of the system. This procedure is done by differentiating the whole k-space volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{n, k}&lt;/math&gt; in n-dimensions at an arbitrary ''k'', with respect to ''k''. The volume, area or length in 3, 2 or 1-dimensional spherical ''k''-spaces are expressed by
: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n&lt;/math&gt;

for a n-dimensional ''k''-space with the topologically determined constants
: &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 2,\  c_2 = \pi,\  c_3 = \frac{4 \pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

for linear, disk and spherical symmetrical shaped functions in 1, 2 and 3-dimensional Euclidean ''k''-spaces respectively.

According to this scheme, the density of wave vector states ''N'' is, through differentiating &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{n,k}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''k'', expressed by
:&lt;math&gt;N_n(k) = \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_n(k)}{{\rm d}k} = n\; c_n\; k^{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

The 1, 2 and 3-dimensional density of wave vector states for a line, disk, or sphere are explicitly written as
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  N_1(k) &amp;= 2 \\
  N_2(k) &amp;= 2 \pi k \\
  N_3(k) &amp;= 4 \pi k^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One state is large enough to contain particles having wavelength λ. The wavelength is related to ''k'' through the relationship.
: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In a quantum system the length of λ will depend on a characteristic spacing of the system L that is confining the particles. Finally the density of states ''N'' is multiplied by a factor ''&lt;math&gt;s/V_k&lt;/math&gt;'', where ''s'' is a constant degeneracy factor that accounts for internal degrees of freedom due to such physical phenomena as spin or polarization. If no such phenomenon is present then &lt;math&gt;s = 1&lt;/math&gt;. ''V&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume in k-space whose wavevectors are smaller than the smallest possible wavevectors decided by the characteristic spacing of the system.

===Density of energy states===
To finish the calculation for DOS find the number of states per unit sample volume at an energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; inside an interval &lt;math&gt;[E, E+dE]&lt;/math&gt;. The general form of DOS of a system is given as
:&lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right) = \frac{{\rm d}\Omega_n(E)}{{\rm d}E}&lt;/math&gt;
The scheme sketched so far ''only'' applies to ''monotonically rising'' and ''spherically symmetric'' dispersion relations. In general the dispersion relation &lt;math&gt;E(k)&lt;/math&gt; is not spherically symmetric and in many cases it isn't continuously rising either. To express ''D'' as a function of ''E'' the [[Inverse function|inverse of the dispersion relation]] &lt;math&gt;E(k)&lt;/math&gt; has to be substituted into the expression of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of ''k'' to get the expression of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(E)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the energy. If the dispersion relation is not spherically symmetric or continuously rising and can't be inverted easily then in most cases the DOS has to be calculated numerically. More detailed derivations are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://britneyspears.ac/physics/dos/dos.htm Sample density of states calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_4.htm Another density of states calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispersion relations==

The dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the [[electronic band structure]].
 
The [[kinetic energy]] of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the [[wave vector]] ''k'', the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] in a [[Fermi gas]] is given by
: &lt;math&gt;E = E_0 + \frac{\left(\hbar k\right)^2}{2m} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]]. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily. 

[[File:Monoatomic chain phonon dispersion.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: Monatomic chain phonon dispersion relation]]
For longitudinal [[phonon]]s in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional ''k''-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E =  2 \hbar \omega_0 \left|\sin\left(\frac{ka}{2}\right)\right| &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{k_{\rm F} / m}&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillator frequency, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the atoms, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; the inter-atomic force constant and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; inter-atomic spacing. For small values of &lt;math&gt;k \ll \pi / a &lt;/math&gt; the dispersion relation is rather linear:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \hbar \omega_0 ka &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;k \approx \pi / a &lt;/math&gt; the energy is
:&lt;math&gt;E = 2 \hbar \omega_0 \left|\cos\left(\frac{\pi - ka}{2}\right)\right|&lt;/math&gt;

With the transformation &lt;math&gt;q = k - \pi/a &lt;/math&gt; and small &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; this relation can be transformed to 
:&lt;math&gt;E = 2 \hbar \omega_0 \left[1 - \left(\frac{qa}{2}\right)^2\right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Isotropic dispersion relations===
The two examples mentioned here can be expressed like
:&lt;math&gt;E = E_0 + c_k k^p&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is a kind of [[dispersion relation]] because it interrelates two wave properties and it is [[isotropy|isotropic]] because only the length and not the direction of the wave vector appears in the expression. The magnitude of the wave vector is related to the energy as:
:&lt;math&gt;k = \left(\frac{E - E_0}{c_k}\right)^\frac{1}{p} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, the volume of n-dimensional ''k''-space containing wave vectors smaller than ''k'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the isotropic energy relation gives the volume of occupied states
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_n(E) = \frac{c_n}{{c_k}^\frac{n}{p}}\left(E - E_0\right)^\frac{n}{p}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this volume with respect to the energy gives an expression for the DOS of the isotropic dispersion relation
:&lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right) = \frac {d}{dE}\Omega_n(E) = \frac{n c_n}{p {c_k}^\frac{n}{p}} \left(E - E_0\right)^{\frac{n}{p} - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

===Parabolic dispersion===
[[File:Free-electron DOS.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space]]
In the case of a parabolic dispersion relation (''p'' = 2), such as applies to free electrons in a Fermi gas, the resulting density of states, &lt;math&gt;D_n\left(E\right)&lt;/math&gt;, for electrons in a n-dimensional systems is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  D_1\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{c_k \left(E - E_0\right)}} \\
  D_2\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{c_k} \\
  D_3\left(E\right) &amp;= 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{E - E_0}{c_k^3}} \ .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;E &gt; E_0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;D(E) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;E &lt; E_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1-dimensional systems the DOS diverges at the bottom of the band as &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; drops to &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2-dimensional systems the DOS turns out to be independent of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Finally for 3-dimensional systems the DOS rises as the square root of the energy.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |author=Charles Kittel |page=Equation (37), p. 216 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-471-11181-8 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including the prefactor ''&lt;math&gt;s/V_k&lt;/math&gt;'', the expression for the 3D DOS is
:&lt;math&gt;N(E) = \frac {V}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{E - E_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the total volume, and &lt;math&gt;N(E-E_0)&lt;/math&gt; includes the 2-fold spin degeneracy.

===Linear dispersion===
In the case of a linear relation (''p'' = 1), such as applies to [[photon]]s, [[acoustic phonon]]s, or to some special kinds of electronic bands in a solid, the DOS in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional systems is related to the energy as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  D_1\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{1}{c_k} \\
  D_2\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{2 \pi}{c_k^2}\left(E - E_0\right) \\
  D_3\left(E\right) &amp;= \frac{4 \pi}{c_k^3}\left(E - E_0\right)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Distribution functions==
{{main article|Kinetic theory of solids}}
The density of states plays an important role in the [[kinetic theory of solids]]. The product of the density of states and the [[Distribution function (physics)|probability distribution function]] is the number of occupied states per unit volume at a given energy for a system in thermal equilibrium. This value is widely used to investigate various physical properties of matter. The following are examples, using two common distribution functions, of how applying a distribution function to the density of states can give rise to physical properties. 

[[File:Fermi-Dirac product with Density of States.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 4: The {{colorbox|#5e81B5}}{{nbsp}}Fermi-Dirac probability distribution, {{colorbox|#e19c24}}{{nbsp}}density of states, and {{colorbox|#8FB131}}{{nbsp}}their product for a semiconductor. The lower green lobe depicts ''hole'' energy, and thus uses &lt;math&gt;f(-x)&lt;/math&gt; as the distribution function.]]

[[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]: The Fermi–Dirac probability distribution function, Fig. 4, is used to find the probability that a fermion occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Fermion]]s are particles which obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons). The distribution function can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathrm{FD}}(E) = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{E - \mu}{k_\mathrm{B} T}\right) + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] (also denoted as E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and called the [[Fermi level]] when ''T''=0), &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates how the product of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the three-dimensional density of states for a semiconductor can give insight to physical properties such as carrier concentration and Energy band gaps.

[[Bose–Einstein statistics]]: The Bose–Einstein probability distribution function is used to find the probability that a boson occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. [[Boson]]s are particles which do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. phonons and photons). The distribution function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;f_{\mathrm{BE}}(E) = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{E - \mu}{k_{\rm B} T}\right) - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

From these two distributions it is possible to calculate properties such as the [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the number of particles &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, [[specific heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and [[thermal conductivity]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The relationships between these properties and the product of the density of states and the probability distribution, denoting the density of states by &lt;math&gt;g(E)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;D(E)&lt;/math&gt;, are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  U &amp;= \int E\, f(E)\, g(E)\,{\rm d}E \\
  n &amp;= \int f(E)\, g(E)\,{\rm d}E \\
  C &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \int E\, f(E)\, g(E) \,{\rm d}E \\
  k &amp;= \frac{1}{d}\frac{\partial}{\partial T} \int E f(E)\, g(E)\, \nu(E)\, \Lambda(E)\,{\rm d}E
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is dimensionality, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is sound velocity and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[mean free path]].

==Applications==
The density of states appears in many areas of physics, and helps to explain a number of quantum mechanical phenomena.

===Quantization===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DOS multdim.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Density of states for electrons in bulk semiconductors (3D; in blue), quantum wells (2D; red), quantum wires (1D; green) and quantum dots (0D; black).]] --&gt;
Calculating the density of states for small structures shows that the distribution of electrons changes as dimensionality is reduced. For [[quantum wires]], the DOS for certain energies actually becomes higher than the DOS for bulk semiconductors, and for [[quantum dots]] the electrons become quantized to certain energies.

===Photonic crystals===
The photon density of states can be manipulated by using periodic structures with length scales on the order of the wavelength of light. Some structures can completely inhibit the propagation of light of certain colors (energies), creating a photonic bandgap: the DOS is zero for those photon energies. Other structures can inhibit the propagation of light only in certain directions to create mirrors, waveguides, and cavities. Such periodic structures are known as [[photonic crystals]]. In nanostructured media the concept of [[local density of states]] (LDOS) is often more relevant than that of DOS, as the DOS varies considerably from point to point.

==Computational calculation ==

Interesting systems are in general complex, for instance compounds, biomolecules, polymers, etc. Because of the complexity of these systems the analytical calculation of the density of states is in most of the cases impossible. Computer simulations offer a set of algorithms to evaluate the density of states with a high accuracy. One of these algorithms is called the [[Wang and Landau algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Wang and Landau scheme any previous knowledge of the density of states is required. One proceeds as follows: the cost function (for example the energy) of the system is discretized. Each time the bin ''i'' is reached one updates
a histogram for the density of states, &lt;math&gt;g(i)&lt;/math&gt;, by

:&lt;math&gt; g(i) \rightarrow  g(i) + f&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is called the modification factor. As soon as each bin in the histogram is visited a certain number of times
(10-15), the modification factor is reduced by some criterion, for instance,

:&lt;math&gt; f_{n+1} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} f_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' denotes the ''n''-th update step. The simulation finishes when the modification factor is less than a certain threshold, for instance &lt;math&gt;f_n &lt; 10^{-8} &lt;/math&gt;.

The Wang and Landau algorithm has some advantages over other common algorithms such as [[multicanonical ensemble|multicanonical simulations]] and [[parallel tempering]]. For example, the density of states is obtained as the main product of the simulation. Additionally, Wang and Landau simulations are completely independent of the temperature. This feature allows to compute the density of states of systems with very rough energy landscape such as proteins.&lt;ref name="ojeda"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ojeda, P. |author2=Garcia, M. |title=Electric Field-Driven Disruption of a Native beta-Sheet Protein Conformation and Generation of a Helix-Structure  |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=595–599 |year=2010 |doi= 10.1016/j.bpj.2010.04.040 |pmid=20643079|bibcode = 2010BpJ....99..595O |pmc=2905109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically the density of states is formulated in terms of a tower of covering maps.&lt;ref&gt;

By modern definition, dynamic combinatorial chemistry is generally considered to be a method of facilitating the generation of new chemical species by the reversible linkage of simple building blocks, under thermodynamic control.&lt;ref name="pmid16967917" /&gt; This principle is known to select the most thermodynamically stable product from an equilibrating mixture of a number of components, a concept commonly utilised in synthetic chemistry to direct the control of reaction selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dynamic Covalent Chemistry|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3773(20020315)41:63.0.CO;2-E/abstract|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date = 2002-03-15|issn = 1521-3773|pages = 898–952|volume = 41|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20020315)41:63.0.CO;2-E|first = Stuart J.|last = Rowan|first2 = Stuart J.|last2 = Cantrill|first3 = Graham R.

Sanders then developed this early manifestation of dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a strategy for organic synthesis; the first example being the thermodynamically-controlled macrolactonisation of oligocholates to assemble cyclic steroid-derived macrocycles capable of interconversion via component exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = ?Living? macrolactonisation: thermodynamically-controlled cyclisation and interconversion of oligocholates|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=cc9960000319|journal = Chemical Communications|issue = 3|doi = 10.1039/cc9960000319|first = Paul A.|last = Brady|first2 = Richard P.|last2 = Bonar-Law|first3 = Stuart J.|last3 = Rowan|first4 = Christopher J.|last4 = Suckling|first5 = Jeremy K. M.|last5 = Sanders|pages=319–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early work by Sanders et al. employed transesterification to generate dynamic combinatorial libraries. In retrospect, it was unfortunate that esters were selected for mediating component exchange, as transesterification processes are inherently slow and require vigorous anhydrous conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid16967917" /&gt; However, their subsequent investigations identified that both the disulfide and hydrazone covalent bonds exhibit effective component exchange processes and so present a reliable means of generating dynamic combinatorial libraries capable of thermodynamic templation. This chemistry now forms the basis of much research in the developing field of dynamic covalent chemistry, and has in recent years emerged as a powerful tool for the discovery of molecular receptors.

=== Multi-protein approach ===
Although most applications of protein-directed DCC to date involved the use of single protein in the DCL, it is possible to identify protein ligands by using multiple proteins simultaneously, as long as a suitable analytical technique is available to detect the protein species that interact with the DCL components.&lt;ref name="pmid29917331"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Das, M. |author2=Tianming, Y. |author3=Jinghua, D. |author4=Prasetya, F. |author5=Yiming, X. |author6= Wong, K. |author7= Cheong, A. |author8= Woon, E.

== Other applications ==
DCC is useful in identifying molecules with unusual binding properties, and provides synthetic routes to complex molecules that aren't easily accessible by other means. These include [[smart material]]s, [[foldamers]], [[Molecular self-assembly|self-assembling molecules]] with interlocking architectures and new [[soft materials]].&lt;ref name="pmid16967917"/&gt; The application of DCC to detect [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[Biological activity|bioactive]] compounds, ''i.e.'' the amplification and sensing of [[scent]], was proposed in a concept paper.&lt;ref name="pmid22588709"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Herrmann, A.  | title = Dynamic Mixtures: Challenges and Opportunities for the Amplification and Sensing of Scents | journal = Chem.

An '''electrathon''' is a competition to go the farthest in one hour powered only by commercial [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] weighing no more than {{convert|73|lb|kg}} (two car batteries).  The record is {{convert|62.05|mi|km}} as of February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.electrathonamerica.org/ | title = Electrathon America | accessdate = 2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves three- or four-wheeled [[electric vehicle]]s, somewhat similar in overall appearance to a [[Go-Kart]] with an aerodynamic body, but powered by an [[electric motor]] and [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Electrathon class vehicles are principally defined and constrained by length and width (12 feet long and 4 feet wide or 3.6&amp;nbsp;m × 1.2&amp;nbsp;m maximum) and by battery weight and chemistry ({{convert|73|lb|disp=or}}, [[sealed lead acid]]). Discharged for one hour, this amounts to just under one kilowatt (1.3&amp;nbsp;hp). Driver's weight is ballasted to {{convert|180|lb|abbr=on}} for fairness, and the vehicles themselves may weigh from {{convert|80|to|150|lb}}. Safety regulations require features such as braking systems, roll bars, and electrical disconnects.

Electrathon racing started in England, spread to Australia, and arrived in the United States in 1990. The basic format is to determine which car can travel the furthest in one hour within the limitations of battery weight and other factors mentioned above. Design teams must compromise speed in order to gain distance. Success requires efficiency of both the machine and driving technique.

The relatively low cost of the electrathon racing has made the sport a popular activity for high school age students worldwide who learn skills related to design, problem-solving, teamwork, mathematics, physics, and electricity. Prizes are awarded for high school, college and open divisions, and there are separate classes for solar and advanced battery vehicles, but all generally race together under the same rules. 

Races are held on parking lots, road courses, and oval speedways, but size is a major factor, as cornering friction decreases efficiency. At present, the world record for distance travelled in one hour is {{convert|62.05|mi|km}}, set in July 2009 on the {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} oval at the Ford Michigan Proving Ground, by C. Michael Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evmaine.org/html/worldrecord.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122045520/http://evmaine.org/html/worldrecord.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-22 |title=Mainer sets new world record in battery electric car |accessdate=2011-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the USDOE conversion factors, this would be the equivalent of {{convert|2370|mpgus|km/l}}. A significant number of electrathons in the [[United_States | USA ]] are build with body-parts from Blue Sky Design LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blueskydsn.com/kit_aero.html | title = AEROCOUPE VEHICLE KIT | accessdate = 2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which sells aerodynamic body-parts specialized for electrathons.

== Land speed record ==
In 2007, the Utah Salt Flats Racing Association invited several Electrathon Competitors after adding an Electrathon class. It used the same vehicle design rules, but instead of a 60 minute endurance event, it's a straight line top speed event on a one mile course. Speed was/is measured using a 30 foot trap at the end of the 1 mile distance. The first record was set by Kirk Swaney, driving a carbon fiber streamliner designed &amp; built by [http://SHIFTev.com SHIFT Electric Vehicles LLC] (1.6&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.saltflats.com/Electric%20Rules.html | title = U.S.F.R.A. Bonneville Electrics Rules | accessdate = 2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current record is {{convert|110.258|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} set by Shannon Cloud in 2008, driving a streamliner designed &amp; built by Dave Cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.saltflats.com/results_130_9_18_08.htm | title = World of Speed--Sept 18, 2008 | accessdate = 2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changes ==
Before the 2010 season, the Electrathon America battery weight limit was {{convert|67|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyelectrathon.com/old/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?184 |title=EA to Vote on Electrathon Battery Rule Change |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714215821/http://nyelectrathon.com/old/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?184 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electricity Forward Agreement (calendar)''' (short: '''EFA system''') is a calendar used to specify load profiles when trading on the [[electricity market]]. It was officially only valid until October 2014, but is still abundantly used among [[commodity market|commodity]] [[Trader (finance)|traders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schofield|first1=Neil C.|title=Commodity derivatives markets and applications|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-1-119-99508-1|page=203}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 December 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Energyanalyst01&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avis|first1=Patrick|title=One EFA’ing confusing system|url=http://www.energyanalyst.co.uk/all-about-the-efa-day/|website=Energyanalyst|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features of the EFA calendar ==
One distinguishes between weekdays ''WD'' and weekend ''WE'' since the electricity consumption is clearly lower on Saturdays and Sundays.
A ''EFA day'' starts on 11pm local time and runs through to 11pm the next (astronomical) day. A EFA-week ''WK'' consists of five ''WD'' and two ''WE''-days.
A ''EFA month'' is defined differently to common months: March, June, September and December have five weeks, all other months are considered to have exactly four weeks. The two ''EFA seasons'' are winter (WK 40 – WK 13) and summer (WK 14 – WK 39), each having exactly 26 weeks. Due to the existence of [[leap year]]s, some EFA-Decembers have six weeks (e.g. 2004 and 2009), a strong difference from the commonly used [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendar system]] where February is the leap month.&lt;ref name=IceEfaCal&gt;{{cite web|title=The EFA Calendar|url=https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/EFA_Calendar.pdf|website=theice.com|publisher=Intercontinenal Exchange|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFA day is composed of six blocks of 4 hours each. For each block [[baseload]] products exist (i.e. WD 1/2/3/4/5/6 and WE 1/2/3/4/5/6). [[Peak load]] products only exit for ''WD3'', ''WD4'' and WD5'' (also on [[bank holiday]]s), and consequently off-peak products are only available for the remaining EFA blocks of each week. Blocks 1 and 2 are usually termed ''overnight blocks'', the other blocks are ''day blocks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avis|first1=Patrick|title=All about the EFA Day|url=http://www.energyanalyst.co.uk/all-about-the-efa-day/|website=energyanalyst.co.uk|accessdate=17 December 2015|date=11 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">The '''Ferndale Refinery''', owned by [[Phillips 66]], has 101,000 b/d capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/refinerycapacity/table3.pdf|title = EIA Table 3. Capacity of Operable Petroleum Refineries by State as of January 1, 2015.|date = January 1, 2015|accessdate = October 3, 2015|website = [[Energy Information Administration]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it, as of 2015, the 64th largest in the United States, and produces predominantly transportation fuels consumed in local markets. The plant is located in the Cherry Point Industrial Zone, west of [[Ferndale, Washington|Ferndale, WA]]. Its secondary processing facilities include a fluid catalytic cracker, an alkylation unit, hydotreating units and a naphtha reformer. The plant follows a 10-5-3-2 crack spread, meaning that for 10 barrels of crude feedstock the refinery produces 5 barrels of gasoline, 3 barrels of distillate and 2 barrels of fuel oil.

The Ferndale Refinery was the first of five currently operating in Washington state, built by [[General Petroleum Corporation|General Petroleum Corp]] in 1954. The original capacity was rated at 35,000 barrels per stream day. General Petroleum was a subsidiary of [[Socony]] (Standard Oil Company of New York) and was integrated into [[Mobil|Mobil Chemical Co]] when the company formed in 1960.

[[BP]] took control of the refinery in 1988 when its wholly owned subsidiary, [[Standard Oil of Ohio|Sohio]], received the plant from Mobil Oil in exchange for $152.5 million and crude oil inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = COMPANY NEWS; Mobil Oil to Sell Refinery to Sohio|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/21/business/company-news-mobil-oil-to-sell-refinery-to-sohio.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1988-10-21|access-date = 2015-10-03|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Tosco Corporation|Tosco Corp]], a California-based downstream and marketing corporation, bought the refinery from BP. The deal included BP’s retail stations and marketing assets across Washington and Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Login to access the Oil &amp; Gas Journal Subscriber Premium features.|url = http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-91/issue-40/in-this-issue/gas-processing/tosco-to-purchase-washington-state-refinery-from-bp.html|website = www.ogj.com|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; BP left the Northwest refining market only five years after entry.

[[Phillips Petroleum Company]] purchased Tosco for $7 billion in February 2001, and assumed control of the refinery thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oil Merger: Phillips Buys Tosco for $7B|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=88671&amp;page=1|website = ABC News|date = 2006-01-06|accessdate = 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the deal’s close, Phillips became the second largest refiner in the U.S. and obtained refineries on both coasts. Even after the Tosco purchase, Phillips sought further expansion. Phillips and [[Conoco Inc]] announced a merger in November 2001, forming [[ConocoPhillips]], the new controlling entity of the Ferndale Refinery. This new supermajor boasted the nation's largest downstream system (as of 2001). In 2012 ConocoPhillips spun off its downstream assets as a new independent energy company, Phillips 66, which still operates the Ferndale Refinery. ConocoPhillips became the second company to abandon the vertically integrated model, following [[Marathon Oil|Marathon Oil Corporation’s]] decision to spin off its downstream assets in 2011.

The Ferndale refinery receives a portion of its crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America, a concern of many environmentalists. In 2015 it was refining 989 barels per day of oil from the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Well to Wheel: The Social, Environmental, and Climate Costs of Amazon Crude|publisher=Amazon Watch|page=7|url=http://amazonwatch.org/news/2016/0928-from-well-to-wheel|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox germanium}}
'''Germanium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol&amp;nbsp;''Ge'' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white [[metalloid]] in the [[carbon group]], chemically similar to its group neighbors [[tin]] and [[silicon]]. Pure germanium is a [[semiconductor]] with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with [[oxygen]] in nature.

Because it seldom appears in high concentration, germanium was discovered comparatively late in the history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust]]. In 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predicted]] its existence and some of its properties from its position on his [[periodic table]], and called the element '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements#Ekasilicon and germanium|ekasilicon]]'''. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, [[Clemens Winkler]] found the new element along with [[silver]] and [[sulfur]], in a rare mineral called [[argyrodite]]. Although the new element somewhat resembled [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]] in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, [[German Empire|Germany]]. Today, germanium is mined primarily from [[sphalerite]] (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from [[silver]], [[lead]], and [[copper]] [[ore]]s.

Elemental germanium is used as a semiconductor in [[transistor]]s and various other electronic devices. Historically, the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based entirely on germanium. Today, the amount of germanium produced for semiconductor electronics is one fiftieth the amount of ultra-high purity silicon produced for the same. Presently, the major end uses are [[fibre-optic]] systems, [[infrared vision|infrared optics]], [[solar cell]] applications, and [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs). Germanium compounds are also used for [[polymerization]] catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of [[nanowire]]s. This element forms a large number of [[organometallic]] compounds, such as [[tetraethylgermane]], useful in [[organometallic chemistry]].

Germanium is not thought to be an essential element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral [[toxicity]]. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are [[nephrotoxic]], and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with [[halogen]]s and [[hydrogen]] are irritants and toxins.

In his report on ''The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements'' in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev predicted the existence of several unknown [[chemical element]]s, including one that would fill a gap in the [[group 14 element|carbon family]] in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between [[silicon]] and [[tin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Masanori|last=Kaji|title=D.

In mid-1885, at a mine near [[Freiberg, Saxony]], a new [[mineral]] was discovered and named ''[[argyrodite]]'' because of the high [[silver]] content.{{refn|From Greek, ''argyrodite'' means ''silver-containing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.handbookofmineralogy.org/pdfs/argyrodite.pdf|publisher=''Mineral Data Publishing''| format=PDF|title=Argyrodite—{{chem|Ag|8|GeS|6}}|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} The chemist [[Clemens Winkler]] analyzed this new mineral, which proved to be a combination of silver, sulfur, and a new element. Winkler was able to isolate the new element in 1886 and found it similar to [[antimony]]. He initially considered the new element to be eka-antimony, but was soon convinced that it was instead eka-silicon.&lt;ref name="Winkle2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isolation"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=210–211 |title=Germanium, Ge, a New Nonmetal Element |language=German |first=Clemens |last=Winkler |authorlink=Clemens Winkler |date=1887 |doi=10.1002/cber.18860190156 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark%3A/12148/bpt6k90705g/f212.chemindefer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207033757/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Disc-of-Germanium.html |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Winkler published his results on the new element, he decided that he would name his element ''neptunium'', since the recent discovery of planet [[Neptune]] in 1846 had similarly been preceded by mathematical predictions of its existence.{{refn|Just as the existence of the new element had been predicted, the existence of the planet [[Neptune]] had been predicted in about 1843 by the two mathematicians [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]], using the calculation methods of [[celestial mechanics]].

Meanwhile, the demand for germanium for [[fiber optics|fiber optic]] communication networks, infrared [[night vision]] systems, and [[polymerization]] [[catalysts]] increased dramatically.&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt; These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption in 2000.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; The US government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material, calling for a 146&amp;nbsp;[[Short ton|ton]] (132&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne|t]]) supply in the national defense stockpile in 1987.&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;

Germanium differs from silicon in that the supply is limited by the availability of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and [[quartz]]. While silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg,&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt; the price of germanium was almost $800 per kg.&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Under [[standard conditions]], germanium is a brittle, silvery-white, semi-metallic element.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; This form constitutes an [[allotrope]] known as ''α-germanium'', which has a metallic luster and a [[diamond cubic|diamond cubic crystal structure]], the same as [[diamond]].&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; At pressures above 120 [[bar (unit)|kbar]], it becomes the allotrope ''β-germanium'' with the same structure as β-[[tin]].&lt;ref name=HollemanAF/&gt; Like silicon, [[gallium]], [[bismuth]], [[antimony]], and [[water]], germanium is one of the few substances that expands as it solidifies (i.e. [[freezing|freezes]]) from the molten state.&lt;ref name=HollemanAF/&gt;

Germanium is a [[semiconductor]]. [[Zone refining]] techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;

Pure germanium suffers from the forming of [[Whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]] by spontaneous [[screw dislocation]]s. If a whisker grows long enough to touch another part of the assembly or a metallic packaging, it can effectively [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt out]] a [[p-n junction]]. This is one of the primary reasons for the failure of old germanium diodes and transistors.

{{main|Isotopes of germanium}}
Germanium occurs in 5 natural [[isotope]]s: {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|70}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|72}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|73}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|74}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|76}}. Of these, {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|76}} is very slightly radioactive, decaying by [[double beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of {{val|1.78|e=21|u=years}}. {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|74}} is the most common isotope, having a [[natural abundance]] of approximately 36%. {{SimpleNuclide2|Germanium|76}} is the least common with a natural abundance of approximately 7%.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Audi|first = G.| title = Nubase2003 Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| issue = 1| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

The ore concentrates are mostly [[sulfide|sulfidic]]; they are converted to the [[oxide]]s by heating under air in a process known as [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]]:

: GeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Some of the germanium is left in the dust produced, while the rest is converted to germanates, which are then leached (together with zinc) from the cinder by sulfuric acid. After neutralization, only the zinc stays in solution while germanium and other metals precipitate. After removing some of the zinc in the precipitate by the [[Waelz process]], the residing Waelz oxide is leached a second time. The [[germanium dioxide|dioxide]] is obtained as precipitate and converted with [[chlorine]] gas or hydrochloric acid to [[germanium tetrachloride]], which has a low boiling point and can be isolated by distillation:&lt;ref name="Naumov" /&gt;

: GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 HCl → GeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
: GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → GeCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Germanium tetrachloride is either hydrolyzed to the oxide (GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or purified by fractional distillation and then hydrolyzed.&lt;ref name="Naumov" /&gt; The highly pure GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is now suitable for the production of germanium glass. It is reduced to the element by reacting it with hydrogen, producing germanium suitable for infrared optics and semiconductor production:

: GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Ge + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The germanium for steel production and other industrial processes is normally reduced using carbon:&lt;ref name="Moska"&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Minerals Engineering|date = 2004|pages = 393–402|doi = 10.1016/j.mineng.2003.11.014|title = Review of germanium processing worldwide|issue = 3|author = Moskalyk, R.

Because germanium is transparent in the infrared wavelengths, it is an important [[infrared]] optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in [[Thermographic camera|thermal imaging cameras]] working in the 8 to 14&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|micron]] range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile [[night vision]], and fire fighting applications.&lt;ref name="Moska" /&gt; It is used in infrared [[spectroscope]]s and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive [[Infrared photography|infrared detectors]].&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; It has a very high [[refractive index]] (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents.

In recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In [[sterling silver]] alloys, for instance, it reduces [[firescale]], increases tarnish resistance, and improves precipitation hardening. A tarnish-proof silver alloy trademarked [[Argentium sterling silver|Argentium]] contains 1.2% germanium.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt;

=== Germanium and health ===

Germanium is not considered essential to the health of plants or animals.&lt;ref name="American Cancer Society" /&gt; Germanium in the environment has little or no health impact.  This is primarily because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and [[carbon]]aceous materials, and the various industrial and electronic applications involve very small quantities that are not likely to be ingested.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; For similar reasons, end-use germanium has little impact on the environment as a biohazard. Some reactive intermediate compounds of germanium are poisonous (see precautions, below).&lt;ref name="Brown Jr"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/germanium/220798.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=US Geological Surveys|accessdate=2008-09-09| title = Commodity Survey:Germanium|first = Robert D.|last = Brown Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germanium supplements, made from both organic and inorganic germanium, have been marketed as an [[alternative medicine]] capable of treating [[leukemia]] and [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt; There is, however, no [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] of benefit; some evidence suggests that such supplements are actively harmful.&lt;ref name="American Cancer Society"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editor=Ades TB |pages=360–363 |chapter=Germanium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some germanium compounds have been administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted in some cases of [[renal]] dysfunction, [[hepatic steatosis]], and peripheral [[neuropathy]] in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than [[endogenous]] levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide ([[propagermanium]]), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baselt, R. |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition=8th|publisher=Biomedical Publications|place=Foster City, CA|date=2008|pages=693–694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] research has concluded that inorganic germanium, when used as a [[nutritional supplement]], "presents potential human [[health hazard]]".&lt;ref name="toxic"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Tao|first = S. H.|author2=Bolger, P. M.|date=June 1997|title = Hazard Assessment of Germanium Supplements|journal = [[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]]|volume = 25|issue = 3|pages = 211–219|doi = 10.1006/rtph.1997.1098|pmid = 9237323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to [[mammal]]s, but have toxic effects against certain [[bacterium|bacteria]].&lt;ref name="nbb"&gt;{{cite book| last = Emsley| first = John| title = Nature's Building Blocks| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 506–510| isbn = 978-0-19-850341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precautions for chemically reactive germanium compounds ==
Some of germanium's artificially-produced compounds are quite reactive and present an immediate hazard to human health on exposure. For example, [[Germanium tetrachloride|germanium chloride]] and [[germane]] (GeH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are a liquid and gas, respectively, that can be very irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.&lt;ref name="Gerber 1997 141–146"&gt;{{cite journal|first = G.

==Future==
As of the year 2000, about 15% of [[United States]] consumption of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused [[dark fiber]], sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Germanium" Mineral Commodity Profile, U.S. Geological Survey, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Institute of Nuclear Materials Management logo.svg|thumb|Institute of Nuclear Materials Management logo]]
The ''' Institute of Nuclear Materials Management''' ('''INMM''') is an international technical and professional organization that works to promote safe handling of [[nuclear material]] and the safe practice of nuclear materials management through publications, as well as organized presentations and meetings.

The INMM's headquarters is located in [[Deerfield, Illinois]] in the United States, but its members are located around world including Europe, Asia, South America and North America.  There are more than 1,100 members and 32 chapters.

Les Shephard, vice president of [[Sandia National Laboratories]]' Energy, Security, and Defense Technology Center, said in February 2009 of the INMM and the American Nuclear Society, 

{{quote|These are the two leading organizations in the world that address the challenges associated with nuclear energy, nonproliferation and nuclear materials management and that contribute significantly to the science and engineering foundation for nuclear energy worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poweronline.com/article.mvc/Sandians-Play-Key-Roles-In-Nuclear-Power-0001|title=Sandians Play Key Roles In Nuclear Power Associations|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Structure ==
INMM is led by an executive committee of nine members, including a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, four members-at-large, and the immediate past president. In addition, INMM has several standing and two technical committees.  Many organizations, such as [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], are Sustaining Members of the INMM.

== Technical divisions ==

In 2010, the INMM Executive Committee approved a restructuring of the Institute. This included changes in the technical divisions. Some were merged and a new division was created. The technical divisions are:

* '''Facility Operations'''
* '''International Safeguards'''
* '''Materials Control and Accountability'''
* '''Nonproliferation and Arms Control'''
* '''Nuclear Security and Physical Protection''' 
* '''Packaging, Transportation and Disposition'''

The division is the focal point for information and activities related to the physical protection of nuclear materials, nuclear facilities, and other high-value assets and facilities.

Until 2010, the INMM had six technical divisions:

* '''International Safeguards''', focusing on the development of effective international nuclear material safeguards, and working to advance safeguard procedures and technology
* '''Materials Control and Accountability''', promoting and communicating the need for development of technology for the control and accountability of nuclear materials
* '''Nonproliferation and Arms Control''', promoting research to further international stability with regard to [[Nuclear proliferation|nonproliferation]] and international [[arms control]]
* '''Packaging and Transportation and Disposition''', promoting technology and research aimed at the packaging and transportation of radioactive materials, including all levels of radioactive waste
* '''Nuclear Security and Physical Protection''', focusing on research to advance technology for the physical protection of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities
* '''Waste Management''', promoting research to help find a solution for the worldwide waste management issues, focusing on each step of waste management including handling, processing, storing, and disposal for all [[radioactive waste]]

== Best practices ==
The INMM develops and promotes global "best practices" for nuclear materials management.  Best practices are based on past events, lessons learned, and ways to effectiveness and efficiency. They are focused on the six technical divisions and should be applicable to all countries with nuclear capabilities, both civilian and military.

In 2008, the INMM joined with [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]], the [[United States Department of Energy]], and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] to establish a new international organization called the [[World Institute for Nuclear Security]] (WINS) aimed at strengthening physical protection and security of the world's nuclear and radioactive materials and facilities. This organization's focus is on collecting information on best management practices from professionals responsible for on-the-ground security and sharing that information with their peer professionals around the world. These security professionals are in the best position to know where the vulnerabilities are, how to improve security, and how to ensure that improvements are implemented quickly and effectively. WINS will place a high priority on protecting sensitive information that may be discussed between members. Initial funding for the WINS included $3 million each from the [[Peter G. Peterson Foundation]] and the U.S. Department of Energy plus $100,000 from [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://secprodonline.com/Articles/2008/09/30/Institute--Nuclear-Materials.aspx Institute To Strengthen Security for Nuclear Materials], ''Security Products'' magazine, September 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapters ==
The INMM has 32 chapters around the world, including six regional chapters in the United States and international chapters in Japan, South Korea, Morocco, Nigeria, Obninsk Regional in Russia, Russian Federation, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Urals, and Vienna.

The INMM also has 16 student chapters that offer opportunities including participation in a mentor program, meetings and workshops, publication subscriptions, and professional networking. Student chapters currently exist at [http://inmmufrj.wixsite.com/studentchapter Federal University of Rio de Janeiro], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], [[Idaho State University]], [[Ibn Tofail University]], [[Jordan University of Science and Technology]],  [[Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]],  [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey]], [[North Carolina State University]] and other Triangle Area universities, [[Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[University of Missouri]], [[University of New Mexico]], [[University of Tennessee]], [[University of Utah]],
[[University of Washington]], and [[Universitas Gadjah Mada]]

== Meetings and workshops ==
INMM holds an annual meeting, an annual Spent Fuel Management Seminar, and a number of other workshops each year. These educational/networking events allow professionals in nuclear materials management to learn new strategies, keep abreast of the science and technology, and to meet with colleagues from around the world. In June 2005, INMM held two workshops in Prague, Czech Republic, sponsored by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI).

==  Publications ==
INMM publishes the ''[http://www.inmm.org/publications/journal.cfm Journal of Nuclear Materials Management]'', a quarterly, [[peer-review]]ed technical [[academic journal|journal]].  In addition, the "[http://www.inmm.org/publications/communicator.cfm Communicator]", online [[newsletter]] is posted three times annually.

American physicist [[William Higginbotham]] served as technical editor of the ''Journal'' from 1974 until his death in 1994.

The '''land and water hemispheres''' of [[Earth]], sometimes capitalised as the '''Land Hemisphere''' and '''Water Hemisphere''', are the [[hemispheres of Earth]] containing the largest possible total areas of [[landform|land]] and [[ocean]], respectively. By definition (assuming that the entire surface can be classed as either "land" or "ocean") the two hemispheres do not overlap.

Determinations of the hemispheres vary slightly. One determination places the centre of the Land Hemisphere at {{Coord|47|13|N|1|32|W|format=dms|type:landmark_region:FR_scale:10000|display=inline}} (in the city of [[Nantes]], [[France]]).&lt;ref name="Boggs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boggs |first=Samuel Whittemore |date=December 1945 |title=This Hemisphere |journal=Journal of Geography |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=345–355 |doi=10.1080/00221344508986498}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center of the water hemisphere is the [[antipodal point]] of the center of the land hemisphere, and is therefore located at {{coord|47|13|S|178|28|E|format=dms|type:landmark_region:FR_scale:10000|display=inline}}, near [[New Zealand]]'s [[Bounty Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Boggs"/&gt;

An alternative assignment determines the centre of the Land Hemisphere to be at {{coord|47.411667|N|2.620833|W|format=dms|type:landmark_region:FR_scale:10000|display=inline}} (in [[île Dumet]] near [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[France]]).&lt;ref name="Berget"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alphonse |last=Berget |title=Répartition géographique des Océans (détermination du pôle continental) |publisher=Annales de l'Institut océanographique |language=French |date=1913 |volume=V |series=10 |url=https://archive.org/stream/annalesdelinstit05instuoft#page/n587/mode/2up/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france-secret.com/dumet_art.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110192441/http://www.france-secret.com/dumet_art.htm |archivedate=10 November 2013 |title=L’ILE DUMET: LE NOMBRIL DU MONDE |work=France Secret |language=French |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution of continents ==

The Land Hemisphere has the substantial majority of the planet's land, including [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], nearly all of [[Asia]] and most of [[South America]]. However, even in the Land Hemisphere, the ocean area still slightly exceeds the land area. The Land hemisphere is almost identical to the hemisphere containing the greatest human population.&lt;ref name="humanhemisphere"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much of Humanity is on Your Side of World?|url=http://brilliantmaps.com/human-hemisphere/|website=Brilliant Maps|accessdate=12 December 2016|date=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Water Hemisphere has only about one-eighth of the [[world]]'s land,&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt; including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]],  [[Hawaii]], the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], and the [[Southern Cone]] of the Americas. [[Antarctica]] is solely within the water hemisphere, though sources differ as to whether it is considered land for the purposes of calculation.

Most of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] are on the water hemisphere. Proportionately, the Water Hemisphere is approximately 89% water, 6% dry land and 5% [[polar ice cap]].&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

The below table follows the assignments of Alphonse Berget of land to the two hemispheres.&lt;ref name="Berget" /&gt;

The '''lattice constant''', or '''lattice parameter''', refers to the physical dimension of [[unit cell]]s in a [[crystal lattice]]. Lattices in three dimensions generally have three lattice constants, referred to as ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. However, in the special case of [[cubic crystal system|cubic crystal structures]], all of the constants are equal and we only refer to ''a''. Similarly, in [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal crystal structures]], the ''a'' and ''b'' constants are equal, and we only refer to the ''a'' and ''c'' constants. A group of lattice constants could be referred to as '''lattice parameters'''. However, the full set of lattice parameters consist of the three lattice constants and the three angles between them.

For example, the lattice constant for [[diamond]] is {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 3.57 [[Ångström|Å]]}} at 300&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]. The structure is equilateral although its actual shape cannot be determined from only the lattice constant. Furthermore, in real applications, typically the average lattice constant is given. Near the crystal's surface, lattice constant is affected by the surface reconstruction that results in a deviation from its mean value. This deviation is especially important in nanocrystals since surface-to-nanocrystal core ratio is large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mudar A. |last=Abdulsattar |title=Ab initio large unit cell calculations of the electronic structure of diamond nanocrystals |journal=Solid State Sci. |volume=13 |page=843 |date=2011 |access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2011.03.009|bibcode=2011SSSci..13..843A }}&lt;/ref&gt; As lattice constants have the dimension of length, their [[SI unit]] is the [[meter]]. Lattice constants are typically on the order of several [[ångström]]s (i.e. tenths of a [[nanometre|nanometer]]). Lattice constants can be determined using techniques such as [[X-ray diffraction]] or with an [[atomic force microscope]]. Lattice constant of a crystal can be used as a natural length standard of nanometer range.&lt;ref name="automatic1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=R.

In [[epitaxy|epitaxial growth]], the lattice constant is a measure of the structural compatibility between different materials.
Lattice constant matching is important for the growth of [[Thin layer chromatography|thin layer]]s of materials on other materials; when the constants differ, strains are introduced into the layer, which prevents [[epitaxy|epitaxial growth]] of thicker layers without defects.

== Volume ==
The volume of the unit cell can be calculated from the lattice constant lengths and angles. If the unit cell sides are represented as vectors, then the volume is the [[dot product]] of one vector with the [[cross product]] of the other two vectors. The volume is represented by the letter ''V''. For the general unit cell
:&lt;math&gt;V = a b c \sqrt{1+2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma - \cos^2\alpha - \cos^2\beta - \cos^2\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;
For monoclinic lattices with {{nowrap|1=''α'' = 90°}}, {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = 90°}}, this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;V = a b c \sin\beta.&lt;/math&gt;
For orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic lattices with {{nowrap|1=''β'' = 90°}} as well, then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dept. of Crystallography &amp; Struc. Biol. CSIC|title=4. Direct and reciprocal lattices|url=http://www.xtal.iqfr.csic.es/Cristalografia/index-en.html|accessdate=9 June 2015|date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = a b c .&lt;/math&gt;

== Lattice matching ==

Matching of lattice structures between two different [[semiconductor material]]s allows a region of [[band gap]] change to be formed in a material without introducing a change in crystal structure. This allows construction of advanced [[light-emitting diode]]s and [[diode laser]]s.

For example, [[gallium arsenide]], [[aluminium gallium arsenide]], and [[aluminium arsenide]] have almost equal lattice constants, making it possible to grow almost arbitrarily thick layers of one on the other one.

== Lattice grading ==
Typically, films of different materials grown on the previous film or substrate are chosen to match the lattice constant of the prior layer to minimize film stress.

An alternative method is to grade the lattice constant from one value to another by a controlled altering of the alloy ratio during film growth. The beginning of the grading layer will have a ratio to match the underlying lattice and the alloy at the end of the layer growth will match the desired final lattice for the following layer to be deposited.

The rate of change in the alloy must be determined by weighing the penalty of layer strain, and hence defect density, against the cost of the time in the epitaxy tool.

For example, [[indium gallium phosphide]] layers with a [[band gap]] above 1.9&amp;nbsp;eV can be grown on [[gallium arsenide]] [[wafer (semiconductor)|wafers]] with index grading.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8297">A total of nine [[nuclear submarine]]s have sunk as a consequence of either accident or extensive damage. The [[United States Navy]] (USN) has lost two boats while five were lost in the [[Soviet Navy]] (one of which sank twice), and two from the [[Russian Navy]]. Only three were lost with all hands: the two from the United States Navy (129 and 99 lives lost) and one from the Russian Navy (118 lives lost), accounting for the three largest losses of life in a submarine. All sank as a result of accident except for {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-27||2}}, which was scuttled in the [[Kara Sea]] when proper decommissioning was considered too expensive. The Soviet submarine {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-129|1960|2}} carried [[Ballistic Missile|nuclear ballistic missiles]] when it was lost with all hands, but as it was a diesel-electric submarine, it is not included in the list.

The two USN submarines belonged to [[COMSUBLANT|Submarine Force Atlantic]], in the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]]. All five of the Soviet/Russian nuclear submarines that remain sunken belonged to the [[Northern Fleet]], while the refloated {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-429||2}} was in the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]].

Of the nine sinkings, two were caused by fires, two by explosions of their weapons systems, two by flooding, one by bad weather, and one by scuttling due to a damaged nuclear reactor. Only {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}}'s reason for sinking is unknown. Eight of the submarines are underwater wrecks in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], five in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and three in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The ninth submarine, ''K-429'', was raised and returned to active duty after both of her sinkings.

*{{USS|Thresher|SSN-593|6}}, the first submarine in [[Thresher/Permit-class submarine|her class]], sank April 10, 1963 during deep-diving trials after flooding, loss of propulsion, and a failed attempt to blow the emergency ballast tanks, causing it to exceed [[crush depth]]. All 129 on board died, including shipyard personnel supporting the deep-diving tests. Location: {{convert|350|km|nmi|lk=out|abbr=on}} east of [[Cape Cod]].
*{{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}}, a {{sclass-|Skipjack|submarine}}, sank May 22, 1968, evidently due to implosion upon reaching [[crush depth]]. The results of the U.S. Navy's various investigations into the loss of ''Scorpion'' are inconclusive. There are various theories about the loss. All 99 men on board died. Location: {{convert|740|km|nmi}} southwest of the [[Azores]].

==Soviet Union==

*{{ship|Soviet submarine|K-27||2}}: The only [[November class submarine#Project 645|Project 645 submarine]] (a variant of the Project 627 {{sclass2-|November|submarine|1}}, with liquid metal cooled reactors), ''K-27'' was decommissioned in 1979. On September 6, 1982, the Soviet Navy scuttled it in shallow water ({{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}}) in the [[Kara Sea]] after sealing the reactor compartment.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;Podvodnye Lodki Rossii (in Russian), Sankt Peterburg, 1996 (Published jointly by Ministry of Defense Central Scientific-Research Institute No. 1 and the Rubin Central Marine Equipment Design Bureau)&lt;/ref&gt; This sinking in shallow water was contrary to the recommendation of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rg.ru/anons/arc_2000/1125/hit.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{ship|Soviet submarine|K-8||2}}: A Project 627 November-class submarine was lost on April 11, 1970 while being towed in rough seas following a fire on board. The submarine's crew was initially evacuated to a surface vessel, but 52 re-boarded the surfaced submarine for a towing operation. All 52 sailors died when the submarine flooded and sank, for total losses of 60 crew when counting the 8 who perished on April 8 in the initial fire.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; Location: [[Bay of Biscay]], {{convert|490|km|nmi}} northwest of Spain in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]].
*{{ship|Soviet submarine|K-219||2}}: A Project 667A [[Yankee-class submarine|Yankee I-class sub]] was damaged by a fire in a missile tube and explosion on October 3, 1986. It then sank suddenly while being towed after all surviving crewmen had transferred off. Six crew members were killed. Location: {{convert|950|km|nmi}} east of [[Bermuda]] in the North Atlantic Ocean.
*[[Soviet submarine K-278 Komsomolets|K-278 ''Komsomolets'']]: The only Mike-class sub built sank due to a raging fire April 7, 1989. All but five crewmen evacuated prior to sinking. A total of 42 crew died, many from smoke inhalation and exposure to the cold waters of the [[Barents Sea]], while 27 crew members survived.
*{{ship|Soviet submarine|K-429||2}}: A Project 670A [[Charlie-class submarine|Charlie I-class sub]] sank twice, once at sea from flooding during a test dive, then two years later, from flooding at her moorings. A total of 16 crew lost their lives in the first incident. Raised after each sinking, K-429 was decommissioned two years after the second incident.

==Russia==
*[[Russian submarine K-141 Kursk|K-141 ''Kursk'']]: The [[Oscar-class submarine|Oscar II-class]] sub sank in the [[Barents Sea]] on August 12, 2000 after an explosion in the torpedo compartment. See [[Kursk submarine disaster]]. All 118 men on board were lost. All except the bow section was salvaged.
*{{ship|Soviet submarine|K-159||2}}: Left to rust for 14 years after being decommissioned, this Soviet-era November-class submarine sank in the Barents Sea on August 28, 2003, when a storm ripped away the pontoons necessary to keep it afloat under tow. Of the ten man salvage crew on board, nine men died in the accident.

'''Nanocellulose''' is a term referring to nano-structured cellulose. This may be either '''cellulose nanocrystal''' (CNC or NCC), '''cellulose nanofibers''' (CNF) also called '''microfibrillated cellulose''' (MFC),  or '''bacterial nanocellulose''', which refers to nano-structured cellulose produced by bacteria.

CNF is a material composed of [[nanotechnology|nanosized]] [[cellulose]] fibrils with a high aspect ratio (length to width ratio). Typical fibril widths are 5–20 [[nanometers]] with a wide range of lengths, typically several [[micrometers]]. It is pseudo-plastic and exhibits [[thixotropy]], the property of certain [[gel]]s or [[fluid]]s that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become less viscous when shaken or agitated. When the shearing forces are removed the gel regains much of its original state. The fibrils are isolated from any cellulose containing source including wood-based fibers ([[Pulp (paper)|pulp fibers]]) through high-pressure, high temperature and high velocity impact [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]], grinding or microfluidization (see manufacture below).

Nanocellulose can also be obtained from native fibers by an acid hydrolysis, giving rise to highly crystalline and rigid nanoparticles which are shorter (100s to 1000 nanometers) than the nanofibrils obtained through homogenization, microfluiodization or grinding routes. The resulting material is known as '''cellulose nanocrystal''' (CNC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Peng BL, Dhar N, Liu HL, Tam KC|year=2011|title=Chemistry and applications of nanocrystalline cellulose and its derivatives: A nanotechnology perspective|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=89|issue=5|pages=1191–1206|url=http://www.arboranano.ca/pdfs/Chemistry%20and%20applications%20of%20nanocrystalline%20cellulose%20and%20its%20derivatives%20A%20nanotechnology%20perspective-2011.pdf|doi=10.1002/cjce.20554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and terminology==
The terminology [[microfibrillated]]/nanocellulose or (MFC) was first used by Turbak, Snyder and Sandberg in the late 1970s at the ITT [[Rayonier]] labs in [[Whippany, New Jersey]], USA to describe a product prepared as a gel type material by passing wood pulp through a Gaulin type milk homogenizer at high temperatures and high pressures followed by ejection impact against a hard surface.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The terminology first appeared publicly in the early 1980s when a number of patents and publications were issued to ITT Rayonier on a new nanocellulose composition of matter.&lt;ref name="Turbak1983"/&gt; In later work Herrick{{who|date=March 2017}} at Rayonier also published work on making a dry powder form of the gel.&lt;ref name="Herrick1983"/&gt; Rayonier has been one of the world's premier producers of purified pulps interested in creating new uses and new markets for pulps and not to compete with new customers. Thus, as the patents issued,&lt;ref name="Turbak, A, F., Snyder, F.W. and Sandberg, K.R."/&gt; Rayonier gave free license to whoever wanted to pursue this new use for cellulose. Rayonier, as a company, never pursued scale-up. Rather, Turbak et al. pursued 1) finding new uses for the MFC/nanocellulose.

==Manufacture==

Nanocellulose, which is also called cellulose nanofibers (CNF), microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) or cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), can be prepared from any cellulose source material, but [[woodpulp]] is normally used.

The nanocellulose fibrils may be isolated from the wood-based fibers using mechanical methods which expose the pulp to high shear forces, ripping the larger wood-fibres apart into nanofibers. For this purpose, high-pressure homogenizers, ultrasonic homogenizers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonic-production-of-nano-structured-cellulose.htm|title=Ultrasonic Production of Nano-Structured Cellulose|publisher=hielscher.com|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} grinders or microfluidizers can be used.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The homogenizers are used to delaminate the cell walls of the fibers and liberate the nanosized fibrils. This process consumes very large amounts of energy and values over 30 MWh/[[tonne]] are not uncommon.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

To address this problem, sometimes enzymatic/mechanical pre-treatments&lt;ref name="Paakko2007"/&gt; and introduction of charged groups for example  through carboxymethylation&lt;ref name="Wagberg2008"/&gt; or [[TEMPO|TEMPO-mediated oxidation]] are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mwp.org/2015-akira-isogai-tsuguyuki-saito-japan-and-yoshiharu-nishiyama-france/|title=Marcus Wallenberg Prize: 2015 – Akira Isogai, Tsuguyuki Saito, Japan, and Yoshiharu Nishiyama, France|publisher=http://mwp.org/|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; these pre-treatments can decrease energy consumption below 1 MWh/tonne.&lt;ref name="Lindstrom2009"/&gt;

Cellulose nanowhiskers are rodlike highly crystalline particles (relative crystallinity index above 75%) with a rectangular cross section. They are formed by the acid hydrolysis of native cellulose fibers commonly using sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. Amorphous sections of native cellulose are hydrolysed and after careful timing, crystalline sections can be retrieved from the acid solution by centrifugation and washing. Their dimensions depend on the native cellulose source material, and hydrolysis time and temperature.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In April 2013 breakthroughs{{clarify|date=March 2017}} in nanocellulose production were announced at an American Chemical Society conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/engineering-algae-to-make-the-wonder-material-nanocellulose-for-biofuels-and-more|title=Engineering Algae to Make the 'Wonder Material' Nanocellulose for Biofuels and More|website=newswise.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology, Mumbai, India, a novel chemo-mechanical process for production of nanocellulose from cotton linters has been developed in the year 2013. To demonstrate this technology to the industrial users, a nanocellulose pilot plant is now operational at this Institute in Mumbai with a capacity of 10 kg per day. This facility was inaugurated in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanocellulose.in|title=Nanocellulose - NaNo Research GROUP @ ICAR-CIRCOT, Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and properties==
[[File:AFM Innventia nanocellulose.JPG|right|thumb|AFM height image of carboxymethylated nanocellulose adsorbed on a silica surface. The scanned surface area is 1 µm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

===Dimensions and crystallinity===
The ultrastructure of nanocellulose derived from various sources has been extensively studied. Techniques such as [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM), [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM), [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM), [[wide angle X-ray scattering]] (WAXS), small incidence angle X-ray diffraction and solid state &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C cross-polarization [[magic angle spinning]] (CP/MAS), [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[spectroscopy]] have been used to characterize typically dried nanocellulose morphology.&lt;ref name="Siro2010"/&gt;

A combination of microscopic techniques with image analysis can provide information on fibril widths, it is more difficult to determine fibril lengths, because of entanglements and difficulties in identifying both ends of individual nanofibrils.&lt;ref name=Chinga-Carrasco2011a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chinga-Carrasco|first=G.|author2=Yu, Y. |author3=Diserud, O. |title=Quantitative Electron Microscopy of Cellulose Nanofibril Structures from Eucalyptus and Pinus radiata Kraft Pulp Fibers|journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis|date=21 July 2011|volume=17|issue=4|pages=563–571|bibcode = 2011MiMic..17..563C |doi = 10.1017/S1431927611000444 |pmid=21740618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chinga-Carrasco2011c&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Chinga-Carrasco G, Miettinen A, Luengo Hendriks CL, Gamstedt EK, Kataja M|title=Structural Characterisation of Kraft Pulp Fibres and Their Nanofibrillated Materials for Biodegradable Composite Applications| year=2011| publisher=InTech| isbn=978-953-307-352-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}  Also, nanocellulose suspensions may not be homogeneous and can consist of various structural components, including cellulose nanofibrils and nanofibril bundles.&lt;ref name=Chinga-Carrasco2011b&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chinga-Carrasco|first=G.|title=Cellulose fibres, nanofibrils and microfibrils: The morphological sequence of MFC components from a plant physiology and fibre technology point of view|journal=Nanoscale Research Letters|date=13 June 2011|volume=6|page=417|bibcode = 2011NRL.....6..417C |doi = 10.1186/1556-276X-6-417|pmid=21711944|pmc=3211513|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of enzymatically pre-treated nanocellulose fibrils in a suspension the size and size-distribution were established using cryo-TEM. The fibrils were found to be rather mono-dispersed mostly with a diameter of ca. 5&amp;nbsp;nm although occasionally thicker fibril bundles were present.&lt;ref name="Paakko2007"/&gt;  By combining ultrasonication with an "oxidation pretreatment", cellulose microfibrils with a lateral dimension  below 1&amp;nbsp;nm has been observed by AFM. The lower end of the thickness dimension is around 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm, which is related to the thickness of a cellulose monolayer sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Qingqing|author2=Scott Renneckar|title=Supramolecular Structure Characterization of Molecularly Thin Cellulose I Nanoparticles|journal=Biomacromolecules|date=6 January 2011| volume=12| issue=3| pages=650–659| doi=10.1021/bm101315y| pmid=21210665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggregate widths can be determined by CP/MAS NMR developed by [[Innventia|Innventia AB]], Sweden, which also has been demonstrated to work for nanocellulose (enzymatic pre-treatment). An average width of 17&amp;nbsp;nm has been measured with the NMR-method, which corresponds well with SEM and TEM. Using TEM, values of 15&amp;nbsp;nm have been reported for nanocellulose from carboxymethylated pulp. However, thinner fibrils can also be detected. Wågberg et al. reported fibril widths of 5–15&amp;nbsp;nm for a nanocellulose with a charge density of about 0.5 meq./g.&lt;ref name="Wagberg2008"/&gt; The group of Isogai reported fibril widths of 3–5&amp;nbsp;nm for TEMPO-oxidized cellulose having a charge density of 1.5 meq./g.&lt;ref name="Fukuzumi2009"/&gt;

Pulp chemistry has a significant influence on nanocellulose microstructure. Carboxymethylation increases the numbers of charged groups on the fibril surfaces, making the fibrils easier to liberate and results in smaller and more uniform fibril widths (5–15&amp;nbsp;nm) compared to enzymatically pre-treated nanocellulose, where the fibril widths were 10–30&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Aulin2009"/&gt; The degree of crystallinity and crystal structure of nanocellulose. Nanocellulose exhibits cellulose crystal I organization and the degree of crystallinity is unchanged by the preparation of the nanocellulose. Typical values for the degree of crystallinity were around 63%.&lt;ref name="Aulin2009"/&gt;

===Viscosity===
The unique [[rheology]] of nanocellulose dispersions was recognized by the early investigators.&lt;ref name="tatsumi2002"/&gt; The high [[viscosity]] at low nanocellulose concentrations makes nanocellulose very interesting as a non-caloric stabilizer and gellant in food applications, the major field explored by the early investigators.

The dynamic [[Rheometry|rheological]] properties were investigated in great detail&lt;ref name="Paakko2007"/&gt; and revealed that the storage and loss modulus were independent of the angular frequency at all nanocellulose concentrations between 0.125% to 5.9%. The storage modulus values are particularly high (104 Pa at 3% concentration)&lt;ref name="Paakko2007"/&gt; compared to results for cellulose nanowhiskers (102 Pa at 3% concentration).&lt;ref name="tatsumi2002"/&gt; There is also a particular strong concentration dependence as the storage modulus increases 5 orders of magnitude if the concentration is increased from 0.125% to 5.9%.

Nanocellulose gels are also highly shear thinning (the viscosity is lost upon introduction of the shear forces). The shear-thinning behaviour is particularly useful in a range of different coating applications.&lt;ref name="Paakko2007"/&gt;

===Mechanical properties===
Crystalline cellulose has interesting mechanical properties for use in material applications. Its tensile strength is about 500MPa{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, similar to that of aluminium.  Its stiffness is about 140–220&amp;nbsp;GPa, comparable with that of [[Kevlar]] and better than that of glass fiber, both of which are used commercially to reinforce plastics. Films made from nanocellulose have high strength (over 200&amp;nbsp;[[MPa]]), high stiffness (around 20&amp;nbsp;[[GPa]])&lt;ref name="Henriksson2008"/&gt; and high strain{{clarify|date=May 2013}} (12%). Its strength/weight ratio is 8 times that of stainless steel.&lt;ref name=ns&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528786.100-why-wood-pulp-is-worlds-new-wonder-material.html |title=Why wood pulp is world's new wonder material – tech – 23 August 2012 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibers made from nanocellulose have high strength (up to 1.57 GPa) and stiffness (up to 86 GPa).&lt;ref name="Mittal2018"/&gt;

===Barrier properties===
In semi-crystalline polymers, the crystalline regions are considered to be gas impermeable. Due to relatively high crystallinity,&lt;ref name="Aulin2009"/&gt; in combination with the ability of the nanofibers to form a dense network held together by strong inter-fibrillar bonds (high cohesive energy density), it has been suggested that nanocellulose might act as a barrier material.&lt;ref name="Fukuzumi2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aulin2010a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Syverud2009"/&gt; Although the number of reported oxygen permeability values are limited, reports attribute high oxygen barrier properties to nanocellulose films. One study reported an oxygen permeability of 0.0006 (cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;µm)/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;day&amp;nbsp;kPa) for a ca. 5&amp;nbsp;µm thin nanocellulose film at 23&amp;nbsp;°C and 0% RH.&lt;ref name="Aulin2010a"/&gt; In a related study, a more than 700-fold decrease in oxygen permeability of a polylactide (PLA) film when a nanocellulose layer was added to the PLA surface was reported.&lt;ref name="Fukuzumi2009"/&gt;

The influence of nanocellulose film density and porosity on film oxygen permeability has recently been explored.&lt;ref name=Chinga-Carrasco2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chinga-Carrasco|first=G.|author2=Syverud K.|title=On the structure and oxygen transmission rate of biodegradable cellulose nanobarriers|journal=Nanoscale Research Letters|date=19 March 2012|volume=7|page=192|bibcode = 2012NRL.....7..192C |doi = 10.1186/1556-276X-7-192|pmid=22429336|pmc=3324384|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors have reported significant porosity in nanocellulose films,&lt;ref name="Henriksson2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henriksson2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Svagan2007"/&gt; which seems to be in contradiction with high oxygen barrier properties, whereas Aulin et al.&lt;ref name="Aulin2010a"/&gt; measured a nanocellulose film density close to density of crystalline cellulose (cellulose Iß crystal structure, 1.63&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Diddens2008"/&gt; indicating a very dense film with a porosity close to zero.

Changing the surface functionality of the cellulose nanoparticle can also affect the permeability of nanocellulose films. Films constituted of negatively charged cellulose nanowhiskers could effectively reduce permeation of negatively charged ions, while leaving neutral ions virtually unaffected. Positively charged ions were found to accumulate in the membrane.&lt;ref name="permselective2009"/&gt;

[[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance]] is one of the methods to study barrier properties of natural, modified or coated nanocellulose. The different antifouling, moisture, solvent, antimicrobial barrier formulation quality can be measured on the nanoscale. The adsorption kinetics as well as the degree of swelling can be measured in real-time and label-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohan|first1=Tamilselvan|last2=Niegelhell|first2=Katrin|last3=Zarth|first3=Cíntia Salomão Pinto|last4=Kargl|first4=Rupert|last5=Köstler|first5=Stefan|last6=Ribitsch|first6=Volker|last7=Heinze|first7=Thomas|last8=Spirk|first8=Stefan|last9=Stana-Kleinschek|first9=Karin|title=Triggering Protein Adsorption on Tailored Cationic Cellulose Surfaces|journal=Biomacromolecules|date=10 November 2014|volume=15|issue=11|pages=3931–3941|doi=10.1021/bm500997s|pmid=25233035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effect of Molecular Architecture of PDMAEMA–POEGMA Random and Block Copolymers on Their Adsorption on Regenerated and Anionic Nanocelluloses and Evidence of Interfacial Water Expulsion |last1 = Vuoriluoto |first1 = Maija | last2 = Orelma | first2=Hannes | last3 = Johansson | first3 = Leena-Sisko | last4 = Zhu | first4 = Baolei | last5 = Poutanen | first5 = Mikko | last6 = Walther | first6 = Andreas | last7 = Laine | first7 = Janne | last8 = Rojas | first8 = Orlando J. | doi=10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b07628 |pmid = 26560798 | journal= The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume= 119|issue=49 |pages= 5275–15286|year = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foams===
Nanocellulose can also be used to make [[aerogels]]/foams, either homogeneously or in composite formulations. Nanocellulose-based foams are being studied for packaging applications in order to replace [[polystyrene]]-based foams. Svagan et al. showed that nanocellulose has the ability to reinforce [[starch]] foams by using a freeze-drying technique.&lt;ref name="Svagan2008"/&gt; The advantage of using nanocellulose instead of [[wood pulp|wood-based pulp fibers]] is that the nanofibrills can reinforce the thin cells in the starch foam. Moreover, it is possible to prepare pure nanocellulose aerogels applying various freeze-drying and super critical {{chem|CO|2}} drying techniques. Aerogels and foams can be used as porous templates.&lt;ref name="Paako2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heath2010"/&gt; Tough ultra-high porosity foams prepared from cellulose I nanofibrill suspensions were studied by Sehaqui et al. a wide range of mechanical properties including compression was obtained by controlling density and nanofibrill interaction in the foams.&lt;ref name="Sehaqui2010"/&gt; Cellulose nanowhiskers could also be made to gel in water under low power sonication giving rise to aerogels with the highest reported surface area (&gt;600m2/g) and lowest shrinkage during drying (6.5%) of cellulose aerogels.&lt;ref name="Heath2010"/&gt; In another study by Aulin et al.,&lt;ref name="Aulin2010b"/&gt; the formation of structured porous aerogels of nanocellulose by freeze-drying was demonstrated. The density and surface texture of the aerogels was tuned by selecting the concentration of the nanocellulose dispersions before freeze-drying. [[Chemical vapour deposition]] of a fluorinated [[silane]] was used to uniformly coat the aerogel to tune their wetting properties towards non-polar liquids/oils. The authors demonstrated that it is possible to switch the wettability behaviour of the cellulose surfaces between super-wetting and super-repellent, using different scales of roughness and porosity created by the freeze-drying technique and change of concentration of the nanocellulose dispersion. Structured porous cellulose foams can however also be obtained by utilizing the freeze-drying technique on cellulose generated by Gluconobacter strains of bacteria, which bio-synthesize open porous networks of cellulose fibers with relatively large amounts of nanofibrills dispersed inside. Olsson et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsson|first1=R. T.|last2=Azizi Samir|first2=M. A.

The magnetic cellulose foam may allow for a number of novel applications of nanocellulose and the first remotely actuated magnetic super sponges absorbing 1&amp;nbsp;gram of water within a 60&amp;nbsp;mg cellulose aerogel foam were reported. Notably, these highly porous foams (&gt;98% air) can be compressed into strong magnetic nanopapers, which may find use as functional membranes in various applications.

===Surface modification===
The surface modification of nanocellulose is currently receiving a large amount of attention.&lt;ref name="Eichhorn review 2010"/&gt; Nanocellulose displays a high concentration of hydroxyl groups at the surface which can be reacted. However, hydrogen bonding strongly affects the reactivity of the surface hydroxyl groups. In addition, impurities at the surface of nanocellulose such as glucosidic and lignin fragments need to be removed before surface modification to obtain acceptable reproducibility between different batches.&lt;ref name="Labet2011"/&gt;

===Safety aspects===
Health, safety and environmental aspects of nanocellulose have been recently evaluated. Processing of nanocellulose does not cause significant exposure to fine particles during friction grinding or spray drying. No evidence of inflammatory effects or cytotoxicity on mouse or human macrophages can be observed after exposure to nanocellulose. The results of toxicity studies suggest that nanocellulose is not cytotoxic and does not cause any effects on inflammatory system in macrophages. In addition, nanocellulose is not acutely toxic to [[Aliivibrio fischeri|Vibrio fischeri]] in environmentally relevant concentrations.&lt;ref name="Vartiainen2011"/&gt;

==Applications==
The properties of nanocellulose (e.g. mechanical properties, film-forming properties, viscosity etc.) makes it an interesting material for many applications and the potential for a multibillion-dollar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/bm3019467 |pmid=23421631 |title=Potential of Nanocrystalline Cellulose–Fibrin Nanocomposites for Artificial Vascular Graft Applications |journal=Biomacromolecules |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=1063–71 |year=2013 |last1=Brown |first1=Elvie E. |last2=Hu |first2=Dehong |last3=Abu Lail |first3=Nehal |last4=Zhang |first4=Xiao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanocellulose can be used to prepare flexible and optically transparent paper. Such paper is an attractive substrate for electronic devices because it is recyclable, compatible with biological objects, and easily degrades when disposed of.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Like resin-free lignocellulose fiberboard which are produced using wet process, high tough cellulose nanofiber board with thickness of 3&amp;nbsp;mm was also introduced by Yousefi et al., 2018.

===Composite===
As described above the properties of the nanocellulose makes an interesting material for reinforcing plastics. Nanocellulose has been reported to improve the mechanical properties of, for example, thermosetting resins, [[starch]]-based matrixes, [[soy protein]], [[rubber latex]], [[Polylactic acid|poly(lactide)]]. The composite applications may be for use as coatings and films, paints, foams, packaging.

===Food===
Nanocellulose can be used as a low calorie replacement for today’s carbohydrate additives used as thickeners, flavour carriers and suspension stabilizers in a wide variety of food products and is useful for producing fillings, crushes, chips, wafers, soups, gravies, puddings etc. The food applications were early recognised as a highly interesting application field for nanocellulose due to the rheological behaviour of the nanocellulose gel.

Applications in this field include: Super water absorbent material (e.g. for incontinence pads material), nanocellulose used together with super absorbent polymers, nanocellulose in tissue, non-woven products or absorbent structures and as antimicrobial films. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Emulsion and dispersion===
Nanocellulose has numerous applications as a food additive, and in the general area of emulsion and dispersion applications in other fields.&lt;ref name=Xhanari2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xhanari|first=K.|author2=Syverud, K. |author3=Stenius, P. |title=Emulsions stabilized by microfibrillated cellulose: the effect of hydrophobization, concentration and o/w ratio|journal=Dispersion Science and Technology|year=2011|volume=32|issue=3|pages=447–452|doi=10.1080/01932691003658942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lif|first=A. |author2=Stenstad, P. |author3=Syverud, K. |author4=Nydén, M. |author5=Holmberg, K.|title=Fischer-Tropsch diesel emulsions stabilised by microfibrillated cellulose|journal=Colloid and Interface Science|volume=352|issue=2|pages=585–592|doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2010.08.052|pmid=20864117 |year=2010 |bibcode=2010JCIS..352..585L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil in water applications were early recognized. Early investigators had explored the area of non-settling suspensions for pumping sand, coal as well as paints and drilling muds.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Oil recovery===
Hydrocarbon fracturing of oil-bearing formations is a potentially interesting and large-scale application. Nanocellulose has been suggested for use in [[Petroleum extraction|oil recovery]] applications as a fracturing fluid. Drilling muds based on nanocellulose have also been suggested.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Medical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical===
The use of nanocellulose in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals was also early recognized. A wide range of high-end applications have been suggested:
* Freeze-dried nanocellulose aerogels used in sanitary napkins, tampons, diapers or as [http://www.pfi.no/New-Biomaterials/Projects/NanoHeal/ wound dressing]
* The use of nanocellulose as a composite coating agent in cosmetics e.g. for hair, eyelashes, eyebrows or nails
* A dry solid nanocellulose composition in the form of tablets for treating intestinal disorders
* Nanocellulose films for screening of biological compounds and nucleic acids encoding a biological compound
* Filter medium partly based on nanocellulose for leukocyte free blood transfusion
* A buccodental formulation, comprising nanocellulose and a polyhydroxylated organic compound
* Powdered nanocellulose has also been suggested as an excipient in pharmaceutical compositions
* Nanocellulose in compositions of a photoreactive noxious substance purging agent
* Elastic cryo-structured gels for potential biomedical and biotechnological application.&lt;ref name=Syverud2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Syverud|first=K.|author2=Kirsebom, H. |author3=Hajizadeh, S. |author4=Chinga-Carrasco, G. |title=Cross-linking cellulose nanofibrils for potential elastic cryo-structured gels|journal=Nanoscale Research Letters|date=12 December 2011|volume=6|page=626|bibcode = 2011NRL.....6..626S |doi = 10.1186/1556-276X-6-626 |pmid=22152032|pmc=3260332|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial production== 
Although wood-driven nanocellulose was first produced in 1983 by Herrick and Turbak, its commercial production postponed till 2010, mainly due to the high production energy consumption and high production cost. Inventia Co. in Sweden was the first nanocellulose company established in 2010. Other first-generation active companies include CelluForce (Canada), Kruger (Canada), Performance BioFilaments (Canada), Nippon (Japan), Nano Novin Polymer Co. (Iran), Maine University (USA), VTT (Finland), Sappi (Netherlands), InoFib (France), and Melodea (Israel).

'''Nisinic acid''' is a very long chain [[polyunsaturated fatty acid|polyunsaturated]] [[omega-3 fatty acid]], similar to [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA).  The lipid name is 24:6 (n-3) and the chemical name is ''all''-''cis''-6,9,12,15,18,21-tetracosahexaenoic acid.  It is not well studied, but [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s even longer than DHA, nisinic acid included, may hold scientific promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter= Nisinic acid, 24: 6n-3, and other methylene-interrupted very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids | date = 2011 | author = Vyssotski, M. | title= Lipids: Categories, Biological Functions and Metabolism, Nutrition and Health | editor = Paige L.

'''Osmium borides''' are compounds of [[osmium]] and [[boron]]. Their most remarkable property is potentially high hardness. It is thought that a combination of high electron density of osmium with the strength of boron-osmium [[covalent bond]]s will make osmium borides [[superhard materials]]. This has not been demonstrated yet. For example, OsB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is hard (hardness comparable to that of [[sapphire]]), but not superhard.&lt;ref name=osb2&gt;{{cite journal|last = Cumberland|first = Robert W.|date = April 27, 2005|title = Osmium Diboride, An Ultra-Incompressible, Hard Material|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume = 127|issue = 20|pages = 7264–5|doi = 10.1021/ja043806y|pmid = 15898746|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Osmium borides are produced in vacuum or inert atmosphere to prevent formation
of [[osmium tetroxide]], which is a hazardous compound. Synthesis occurs at high temperatures (~1000&amp;nbsp;°C) from a mixture of [[magnesium diboride|MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and OsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=osb2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13444">'''Plasma diagnostics''' are a pool of methods, instruments, and experimental techniques used to measure properties of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], such as plasma components' [[density]], distribution function over energy ([[temperature]]), their spatial profiles and dynamics, which enable to derive [[plasma parameters]].

==Invasive probe methods==
===Langmuir probe===
{{main|Langmuir probe}}
Measurements with electric probes, called [[Langmuir probe]]s, are the oldest and most often used procedures for low-temperature plasmas. The method was developed by [[Irving Langmuir]] and his co-workers in the 1920s, and has since been further developed in order to extend its applicability to more general conditions than those presumed by Langmuir. Langmuir probe measurements are based on the estimation of [[current (electricity)|current]] versus [[voltage]] characteristics of a [[electrical network|circuit]] consisting of two metallic electrodes that are both immersed in the plasma under study. Two cases are of interest:
(a) The surface areas of the two electrodes differ by several orders of magnitude. This is known as the ''single-probe'' method.
(b) The surface areas are very small in comparison with the dimensions of the vessel containing the plasma and approximately equal to each other. This is the ''double-probe'' method.

Conventional Langmuir probe theory assumes collisionless movement of charge carriers in the space charge sheath around the probe. Further it is assumed that the sheath boundary is well-defined and that beyond this boundary the plasma is completely undisturbed by the presence of the probe. This means that the [[electric field]] caused by the difference between the potential of the probe and the plasma potential at the place where the probe is located is limited to the volume inside the probe sheath boundary.

The general theoretical description of a Langmuir probe measurement requires the simultaneous solution of the [[Poisson equation]], the collision-free [[Boltzmann equation]] or [[Vlasov equation]], and the [[continuity equation]] with regard to the boundary condition at the probe surface and requiring that, at large distances from the probe, the solution approaches that expected in an undisturbed plasma.

===Plasma ion analyzer===

A plasma ion analyser measures ion energy distributions at selected ion mass, and mass spectra for selected ion energies, for both positive and negative ions.
Plasma neutrals, radicals and fast neutrals are analysed by an integrated electron impact ionizer.
The plasma ion analyser is typically a quadrupole mass spectrometer configured with an ion energy analyser in a differentially pumped high vacuum chamber.
The plasma ion analyser samples plasma ions and neutrals through a pin hole aperture and if properly configured, can provide  a non invasive interface for plasma analysis.

===Ball-pen probe===
{{main|Ball-pen probe}}
A [[ball-pen probe]] is novel technique used to measure directly the [[plasma potential]] in magnetized plasmas. The probe was invented by [[Jiří Adámek]] in the Institute of Plasma Physics AS CR in 2004. The [[ball-pen probe]] balances the electron saturation current to the same magnitude as that of the ion saturation current. In this case, its [[Langmuir probe|floating potential]] becomes identical to the plasma potential. This goal is attained by a ceramic shield, which screens off an adjustable part of the electron current from the probe collector due to the much smaller gyro–radius of the electrons. The [[electron temperature]] is proportional to the difference of ball-pen probe(plasma potential) and Langmuir probe (floating potential) potential. Thus, the electron temperature can be obtained directly with high temporal resolution without additional [[power supply]].

===Self Excited Electron Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (SEERS)===
Nonlinear effects like the [[I-V characteristic]] of the boundary sheath are utilized for Langmuir probe measurements but they are usually neglected for modelling of RF discharges due to their very inconvenient mathematical treatment. The Self Excited Electron Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (SEERS) utilizes exactly these nonlinear effects and known resonance effects in RF discharges. The nonlinear elements, in particular the sheaths, provide harmonics in the discharge current and excite the plasma and the sheath at their series resonance characterized by the so-called geometric resonance frequency.

SEERS provides the spatially and reciprocally averaged electron plasma density and the effective electron collision rate. The electron collision rate reflects stochastic (pressure) heating and ohmic heating of the electrons.

The model for the plasma bulk is based on 2d-fluid model (zero and first order moments of Boltzmann equation) and the full set of the [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwellian]] equations leading to the [[Helmholtz equation]] for the magnetic field. The sheath model is based additionally on the [[Poisson equation]].

===Magnetic (B-dot) probe===
If the magnetic field in the plasma is not stationary, either because the plasma as a whole is transient or because the fields are periodic (radio-frequency heating), the rate of change of the magnetic field with time (&lt;math&gt;\dot B&lt;/math&gt;, read "B-dot") can be measured locally with a loop or coil of wire. Such coils exploit [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], whereby a changing magnetic field induces an electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everson|first=E. T.|last2=Pribyl|first2=P.|last3=Constantin|first3=C. G.|last4=Zylstra|first4=A.|last5=Schaeffer|first5=D.|last6=Kugland|first6=N. L.|last7=Niemann|first7=C.|date=2009|title=Design, construction, and calibration of a three-axis, high-frequency magnetic probe (B-dot probe) as a diagnostic for exploding plasmas|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|language=en|volume=80|issue=11|pages=113505|doi=10.1063/1.3246785|pmid=19947729|issn=0034-6748}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The induced voltage can be measured and recorded with common instruments.
Also, by [[Ampere's law]], the magnetic field is proportional to the currents that produce it, so the measured magnetic field gives information about the currents flowing in the plasma. Both currents and magnetic fields are important in understanding fundamental plasma physics.

===Faraday cup in plasma diagnostics===
{{main|Faraday cup}}
The conventional [[Faraday cup]] is applied for measurements of ion (or electron) flows from plasma boundaries and for [[mass spectrometry]].

==Passive spectroscopy==
Passive [[spectroscopic]] methods simply observe the radiation emitted by the plasma.

===Doppler shift===
If the plasma (or one ionic component of the plasma) is flowing in the direction of the line of sight to the observer, emission lines will be seen at a different frequency due to the [[Doppler effect]].

===Doppler broadening===
The thermal motion of ions will result in a shift of emission lines up or down, depending on whether the ion is moving toward or away from the observer. The magnitude of the shift is proportional to the velocity along the line of sight. The net effect is a characteristic broadening of spectral lines, known as [[Doppler broadening]], from which the ion temperature can be determined.

===Stark effect===
The splitting of some emission lines due to the [[Stark effect]] can be used to determine the local electric field.

===Stark broadening===
Even if the macroscopic electric field is zero, any single ion will experience an electric field due to the neighboring charged particles in the plasma. This results in a [[Stark broadening|broadening]] of some lines that can be used to determine the density of the plasma.

===Spectral line ratios===
{{main|Spectral line ratios}}
The brightness of an [[atomic spectral line]] emitted by atoms and ions in a gas (or plasma) can depend on the gas's temperature and pressure.

Due to the completeness and accuracy of modern [[collisional radiative model]]s the temperature and density of plasmas can be measured by taking ratios of the emission intensities of various atomic spectral lines.

===Zeeman effect===
The presence of a magnetic field splits the atomic energy levels due to the [[Zeeman effect]]. This leads to broadening or splitting of spectral lines. Analyzing these lines can, therefore, yield the magnetic field strength in the plasma.

==Active spectroscopy==
Active spectroscopic methods stimulate the plasma atoms in some way and observe the result (emission of radiation, absorption of the stimulating light or others).

===Absorption spectroscopy===
By shining through the plasma a laser with a wavelength, tuned to a certain transition of one of the species present in the plasma, the absorption profile of that transition could be obtained. This profile provides information not only for the plasma parameters, that could be obtained from the emission profile, but also for the line-integrated number density of the absorbing species.

===Beam emission spectroscopy===
A beam of neutral atoms is fired into a plasma. Some atoms are excited by collisions within the plasma and emit radiation. This can be used to probe density fluctuations in a turbulent plasma.

===Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy===
In very hot plasmas (as in magnetic fusion experiments), light elements are fully ionized and don't emit line radiation. When a beam of neutral atoms is fired into the plasma, electrons from beam atoms are transferred to hot plasma ions, which form hydrogenic ions which promptly emit line radiation. This radiation is analyzed for ion density, temperature, and velocity.

===Laser-induced fluorescence===
If the plasma is not fully ionized but contains ions that fluoresce, [[laser-induced fluorescence]] can provide very detailed information on temperature, density, and flows.

===Motional Stark effect===
If an atom is moving in a magnetic field, the [[Lorentz force]] will act in opposite directions on the nucleus and the electrons, just as an electric field does. In the frame of reference of the atom, there ''is'' an electric field, even if there is none in the laboratory frame. Consequently, certain lines will be split by the [[Stark effect]]. With an appropriate choice of beam species and velocity and of geometry, this effect can be used to determine the magnetic field in the plasma.

===Two-photon laser-induced fluorescence===
The two-photon laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF) is a modification of the laser-induced fluorescence technique. In this approach the upper level is excited by absorbing two photons and registering the resulting emission from the excited state. The advantage of this approach is that the registered light from the fluorescence is with a different wavelength from the exciting laser beam, which leads to improved signal to noise ratio.

==Optical effects from free electrons==
The optical diagnostics above measure line radiation from atoms. Alternatively, the effects of free charges on electromagnetic radiation can be used as a diagnostic.

===Electron cyclotron emission===
In magnetized plasmas, electrons will gyrate around magnetic field lines and emit [[cyclotron radiation]]. The frequency of the emission is given by the [[cyclotron resonance]] condition. In a sufficiently thick and dense plasma, the intensity of the emission will follow [[Planck's law]], and only depend on the electron temperature.

===Thomson scattering===
Scattering of laser light from the electrons in a plasma is known as [[Thomson scattering]]. The electron temperature can be determined very reliably from the [[Doppler broadening]] of the laser line. The electron density can be determined from the intensity of the scattered light, but a careful absolute calibration is required. Although Thomson scattering is dominated by scattering from electrons, since the electrons interact with the ions, in some circumstances information on the ion temperature can also be extracted.

===Interferometry===
If a plasma is placed in one arm of an [[Interferometry|interferometer]], the phase shift will be proportional to the plasma density integrated along the path.

===Faraday rotation===
The [[Faraday effect]] will rotate the plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of a beam passing through a plasma with a magnetic field in the direction of the beam. This effect can be used as a diagnostic of the magnetic field, although the information is mixed with the density profile and is usually an integral value only.

==Neutron diagnostics==
Fusion plasmas produces 2.5 MeV and 14 MeV neutrons. By measuring the neutron flux, plasma properties such as ion temperature and fusion power can be determined.

A '''plasma torch''' (also known as a '''plasma arc''', '''plasma gun''', or '''plasma cutter''', '''plasmatron''') is a device for generating a directed flow of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jeffus | first1 = Larry F. | title = Welding: principles and applications | publisher = Cengage Learning | date = 2002 | pages = 180 | isbn = 978-1-4018-1046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szałatkiewicz | first1 = J. | title = Safety and intelligent control system for plasmatron application | doi = 10.5604/01.3001.0010.2942 | journal = Journal of KONES Powertrain and Transport | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 6 | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = |url= http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/23.1/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.23.No.1.277-281.pdf | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of thermal plasma torches==
[[Plasma (physics)#Thermal vs. non-thermal plasmas|Thermal plasmas]] are generated in plasma torches by [[direct current]] (DC), [[alternating current]] (AC), [[radio-frequency]] (RF) and other discharges. DC torches are the most commonly used and researched, because when compared to AC: “there is less flicker generation and noise, a more stable operation, better control, a minimum of two electrodes, lower electrode consumption, slightly lower refractory [heat] wear and lower power consumption”.&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.04.017 |author=Gomez, E. |author2=Rani, D.A. |author3=Cheeseman, C.R. |author4=Deegan, D. |author5=Wise, M. |author6=Boccaccini, A.R. |date=2009 |title=Thermal plasma technology for the treatment of wastes: A critical review |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=161 |issue=2–3 |pages=614–626 |pmid=18499345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal plasma DC torches, non-transferred arc, based on hot cathode===
[[File:Non-transferred DC plasma torch.png|800px|Cross-sectional representation of a non-transferred DC plasma torch. Showing the pointed cathode and annular anode. The inlets and outlets of the water-cooling system are labelled, note that the arc temperature can be up to 15 000°C. The plasma arc is drawn for illustration purposes only. Not to scale.]]

In a DC torch, the [[Plasma (physics)#Generation of artificial plasma|electric arc]] is formed between the [[electrodes]] (which can be made of copper, [[tungsten]], [[graphite]], [[molybdenum]], silver etc.), and the thermal plasma is formed from the continual input of carrier/working gas, projecting outward as a plasma jet/flame (as can be seen on the right). In DC torches, the carrier gas can be, for example, either oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium, air, or hydrogen;&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; and although termed as such, it does not have to be a gas (thus, better termed a carrier fluid).

For example, a research plasma torch at the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) in Prague, Czech Republic, functions with an [[H2O|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] vortex (as well as a small addition of argon to ignite the arc), and produces a high temperature/velocity plasma flame.&lt;ref name=Hrabovsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hrabovský|first=Milan|author2=Kopecky, V.|author3= Sember, V.|author4=  Kavka, T.|author5=   Chumak, O.|author6=    Konrad, M.|title=Properties of Hybrid Water/Gas DC Arc Plasma Torch|journal=IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science|date=August 2006|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1566–1575|bibcode = 2006ITPS...34.1566H |doi = 10.1109/TPS.2006.878365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, early studies of arc stabilization employed a water-vortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavka|first=T|author2=Chumak, O. |author3=Sember, V. |author4=Hrabovsky, M. |title=Processes in Gerdien arc generated by hybrid gas-water torch|journal=28th ICPIG|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the electrode materials and carrier fluids have to be specifically matched to avoid excessive electrode corrosion or oxidation (and contamination of materials to be treated), while maintaining ample power and function.

Furthermore, the flow-rate of the carrier gas can be raised to promote a larger, more projecting plasma jet, provided that the arc current is sufficiently increased; and vice versa.

The plasma flame of a real plasma torch is a few inches long at most; it is to be distinguished from [[Plasma weapon (fiction)|fictional long-range plasma weapons]].

====Transferred vs. non-transferred====
It is important to note that there are two types of DC torches: non-transferred and transferred. In non-transferred DC torches, the electrodes are inside the body/housing of the torch itself (creating the arc there). Whereas in transferred—one electrode is outside (and is usually the conductive material to be treated), allowing the arc to form outside of the torch over a larger distance.

A benefit of transferred DC torches is that the plasma arc is formed outside the water-cooled body, preventing heat loss—as is the case with non-transferred torches, where their electrical-to-thermal efficiency can be as low as 50%, but the hot water can itself be utilized.&lt;ref name="Hrabovsky" /&gt; Furthermore, transferred DC torches can be used in a twin-torch setup, where one torch is [[Cathodic#Chemistry cathode|cathodic and the other anodic]], which has the earlier benefit of a regular transferred single-torch system, but allows their use with [[Insulator (electricity)|non-conductive]] materials, as there is no need for it to form the other electrode.&lt;ref name="Gomez" /&gt; However, these types of setups are rare as most common non-conductive materials do not require the precise cutting ability of a plasma torch. In addition, the discharge generated by this particular plasma source configuration is characterized by a complex shape and fluid dynamics that  requires a 3D description in order to be predicted, making performance unsteady. The electrodes of non-transferred torches are larger, because they suffer more wear by the plasma arc.

The quality of plasma produced is a function of density (pressure), temperature and torch power (the greater the better). With regards to the efficiency of the torch itself—this can vary among manufacturers and torch technology; though for example, Leal-Quirós reports that for Westinghouse Plasma Corp. torches “a thermal efficiency of 90% is easily possible; the efficiency represents the percentage of arc power that exits the torch and enters the process”.&lt;ref name="Leal-Quiros"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leal-Quirós, Edbertho |date=2004 |title=Plasma Processing of Municipal Solid Waste |journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics |volume=34 |issue=4B |page=1587 |bibcode = 2004BrJPh..34.1587L |doi=10.1590/S0103-97332004000800015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinovel Wind Group Company''' ({{zh|c=华锐风电}}) is a Chinese [[wind turbine]] manufacturer headquartered in [[Beijing]]. It is the largest wind turbine manufacturer in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and by 2011 market share the second largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;BTM Consult&lt;/ref&gt;

The company aims to be the largest turbine maker by 2015 with half of sales for foreign markets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/business/energy-environment/16windside.html?_r=1&amp;ref=china&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donghai Bridge Wind Farm]], the first offshore [[wind farm]] in China, began operation in July 2010 using 34 3 [[Watt|MW]] Sinovel turbines.

In December 2010, the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] ordered a 1.5 MW wind turbine to power a wastewater pumping station in [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority|Charlestown]], [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Controversies==
The firm was accused and found guilty of stealing software from [[American Superconductor|AMSC]] and was embroiled in a lawsuit with that firm.&lt;ref name="lawsuit_amsc"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/amsc-taking-sinovel-infringement-suit-to-china-s-supreme-court.html http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/amsc-taking-sinovel-infringement-suit-to-china-s-supreme-court.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/08/06/19566531-chinese-firm-paid-insider-to-kill-my-company-american-ceo-says&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 2013, the [[United States Department of Justice]] declared Sinovel and three Individuals were charged with theft of trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/June/13-crm-730.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 2018 a U.S. federal jury in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin found Sinovel guilty of stealing trade secrets from AMSC causing the American company to lose over US$800 million.  Prosecutors stated that Sinovel stole [[trade secrets]] and copyrighted information with the intention of building its own versions of AMSC systems and retrofit previously built wind turbines so it could avoid having to pay AMSC for its technology.&lt;ref name="Verdict"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sinovel-wind-gro-usa-court/chinas-sinovel-convicted-in-u-s-of-trade-secret-theft-idUSKBN1FD2XL?il=0 |title=China's Sinovel convicted in U.S. of trade-secret theft |date=24 January 2018| website=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal judge ordered Sinovel to pay $59 Million for the act of stealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-judge-orders-chinese-wind-turbine-maker-to-pay-59-million-for-stealing-trade-secrets/|title=Judge Orders Chinese Wind-Turbine Maker To Pay $59 Million For Stealing Trade Secrets|last=Zarroli|first=Jim|website=www.opb.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a press release by AMSC on 03 July 2018, AMSC has  settled the lawsuit with Sinovel.

'''Sodium lauroamphoacetate''' is [[zwitterionic]] [[surfactant]] of the [[amphoacetate]] class. It is used as a very mild cleaning agent originally used in shampoos and body washes for infants but it now sees broader use in other personal care products.&lt;ref name=farn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farn|first1=Richard J.|title=Chemistry and technology of surfactants|date=2006|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Oxford|isbn=978-14051-2696-0|pages=173-174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Sodium lauroamphoacetate is produced in a 2 step process. Firstly [[lauric acid]] reacts with [[aminoethylethanolamine]] (AEEA); this initially produces the [[amide]] however heating causes this to cyclize to give the [[imidazoline]] group. This reacts with 1 equivalent of [[sodium chloroacetate]] to give the final product. A reaction with 2 equivalents gives the di-acetate, which is also marketed as di-sodium lauroamphoacetate.&lt;ref name=farn /&gt;

==Safety==
Sodium lauroamphoacetate is exceedingly mild,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehling|first1=A.|last2=Kleber|first2=M.|last3=Hensen|first3=H.|title=Comparative studies on the ocular and dermal irritation potential of surfactants|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=May 2007|volume=45|issue=5|pages=747–758|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2006.10.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cases of skin irritation are rare but not unheard of. It has been proposed that these instances are caused not by sodium lauroamphoacetate itself but rather by failures in quality control which result in it being contaminated with AEEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foti|first1=Caterina|last2=Bonamonte|first2=Domenico|last3=Mascolo|first3=Giuseppe|last4=Tiravanti|first4=Giovanni|last5=Rigano|first5=Luigi|last6=Angelini|first6=Gianni|title=Aminoethylethanolamine: a new allergen in cosmetics?|journal=Contact Dermatitis|date=September 2001|volume=45|issue=3|pages=129–133|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.045003129.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''solar charger''' employs [[solar energy]] to supply electricity to devices or charge batteries. They are generally [[wikt:portable|portable]].

Solar chargers can charge [[lead acid battery|lead acid]] or [[Ni-Cd battery]] banks up to 48 V and hundreds of [[ampere-hour]]s (up to 4000 Ah) capacity. Such type of solar charger setups generally use an intelligent [[charge controller]]. A series of [[solar cells]] are installed in a stationary location (ie: rooftops of homes, base-station locations on the ground etc.) and can be connected to a battery bank to store energy for off-peak usage. They can also be used in addition to mains-supply chargers for energy saving during the daytime.

Most portable chargers can obtain energy from the sun only. Some, including the Kinesis K3, and GeNNex Solar Cell 2 can work either way (recharged by the sun or plugged into a wall plug to charge up). Examples of solar chargers in popular use include:
*Small portable models designed to charge a range of different [[mobile phone]]s, cell phones, iPods or other portable audio equipment.
*Fold out models designed to sit on the dashboard of an automobile and plug into the cigar/12v lighter socket to keep the battery topped up while the vehicle is not in use.
*Flashlights/torches, often combined with a secondary means of charging, such as a kinetic (hand crank generator) charging system.
*Public solar chargers permanently installed in public places, such as parks, squares and streets, which anyone can use for free.

==Voltage regulator==
A solar panel can produce a range of charging voltages depending upon [[sunlight]] intensity, so a [[voltage regulator]] must be included in the charging circuit so as to not over-charge ([[overvoltage]]) a device such as a 12 volt car battery.

== Solar chargers on the market ==
Portable solar chargers are used to charge cell phones and other small electronic devices on the go. Chargers on the market today use various types of solar panels, ranging from [[Thin-film photovoltaic cell|thin film]] panels with efficiencies from 7-15% (amorphous silicon around 7%, [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] closer to 15%), to the slightly more efficient [[monocrystalline silicon|monocrystalline]] panels which offer efficiencies up to 18%.

The other type of portable solar chargers are those with wheels which enable them to be transported from one place to another and be used by a lot of people. They are semi-public, considering the fact that are used publicly but not permanently installed. A good example of this kind of portable solar charger is the Strawberry Mini device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cncworld.tv/news/v_show/24318_New_Portable_Solar_Charger.shtml New portable solar charger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123110045/http://www.cncworld.tv/news/v_show/24318_New_Portable_Solar_Charger.shtml |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strawberry Tree in Obrenovac.jpg|thumb|right|Public solar charger for mobile phones, in Obrenovac, Serbia]]

The solar charger industry has been plagued by companies [[Mass production|mass-producing]] low efficiency solar chargers that don't meet the consumer's expectations. This in turn has made it hard for new solar charger companies to gain the trust of consumers. Solar companies are starting to offer high-efficiency solar chargers. When it comes to permanently installed public solar chargers, Strawberry energy Company from Serbia has invented and developed the first public solar charger for mobile devices, [[Strawberry Tree (solar energy device)|Strawberry Tree]]. Due to a built in rechargeable battery which stores energy, it can function without sunshine or at night. Other companies such as Voltaic Systems, Poweradd and others have started to push better products onto the market as well.

Portable solar power is being utilized in developing countries to power lighting as opposed to utilizing [[kerosene lamp]]s which are responsible for respiratory infections, lung and throat cancers, serious eye infections, cataracts as well as low birth weights. Solar power provides an opportunity for rural areas to "leapfrog" traditional grid infrastructure and move directly to distributed energy solutions.

Some solar chargers also have an on-board battery which is charged by the solar panel when not charging anything else. This allows the user to be able to use the solar energy stored in the battery to charge their electronic devices at night or when indoors.

Solar chargers can also be [[wikt:rollable|rollable]] or flexible and are manufactured using [[Thin-film photovoltaic cell|thin film]] PV technology. Rollable solar chargers may include Li-ion batteries.

Currently, foldable solar panels are coming down in price to the point that almost anyone can deploy one while at the beach, biking, hiking, or at any outdoor location and charge their cellphone, tablet, computer etc. As advances in the technology continue to be made, new products will be able to be expand into third world countries faster than ever before. Recently, billionaire Elon Musk unveiled a new battery system that may allow off-grid systems that rely solely on solar power to recharge them to be deployed anywhere on the planet, thus possibly ending the need for strictly grid-based energy systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">The '''split-cycle engine''' is a type of [[internal combustion engine]].

==Design==
In a conventional [[Otto cycle]] engine, each [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] performs four strokes per cycle: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This means that two revolutions of the [[crankshaft]] are required for each power stroke. The split-cycle engine divides these four strokes between two paired cylinders: one for intake and compression, and another for power and exhaust. Compressed air is transferred from the compression cylinder to the power cylinder through a crossover passage. Fuel is then injected and fired to produce the power stroke.

==History==
The Backus Water Motor Company of [[Newark, New Jersey]] was producing an early example of a split cycle engine as far back as 1891. The engine, of "a modified A form, with the crank-shaft at the top", was water-cooled and consisted of one working cylinder and one compressing cylinder of equal size and utilized a [[hot-tube ignitor]] system. It was produced in sizes ranging from 1/2 to {{convert|3|hp}} and the company had plans to offer a scaled-up version capable of {{convert|25|hp}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=from [[American Machinist]] Magazine -- January 15, 1891 |url=http://www.lindsaybks.com/arch/backus/index.html |title=The Backus Gas Engine - Reprint of a January 15, 1891 '&amp;#39;American Machinist'&amp;#39; article |publisher=Lindsaybks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atkinson cycle#Atkinson differential engine|Atkinson differential engine]] was a two piston, single cylinder [[four-stroke engine]] that also used a displacer piston to provide the fuel air mixture for use by the power piston. However, the power piston did the compression.

The [[twingle engine]] (U.S. English) or [[split-single]] engine (British English) is a twin cylinder (or more) [[two-stroke engine]]; more precisely, it has one or more U-tube cylinders that each use a pair of pistons, one in each arm of the U. However, both pistons in each pair are used for power (and the underside of both supplies fuel air mixture, if [[internal combustion engine#Crankcase scavenged|crankcase scavenging]] is used), and they only differ in that one piston works the transfer port to provide the fuel air mixture for use in both cylinders and the other piston works the exhaust port, so that the burnt mixture is exhausted via that cylinder. Unlike the Scuderi both cylinders are connected to the combustion chamber. As neither piston works as a displacer piston at all, this engine has nothing whatsoever to do with the split cycle engine apart from a purely coincidental similarity of the names.

The [[Scuderi engine]] is a design of a split-cycle, [[internal combustion engine]] invented by Carmelo J. Scuderi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/08/01/PM200608015.html "Carmelo Scuderi's legacy just revving up," Public Radio's "Marketplace," August 1, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529111811/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/08/01/PM200608015.html |date=May 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scuderi Group, an engineering and licensing company based in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] and founded by Carmelo Scuderi’s children, said that the prototype was completed and was unveiled to the public on April 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Wrinn, Bill. "Podcast: First Scuderi Engine Prototype Assembled." airhybridblog. 09 Feb 2009. Topaz Partners. 9 Feb 2009 &lt;http://airhybridblog.com/2009/02/09/podcast-first-scuderi-engine-prototype-assembled&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Charles. "Will Split-Cycle Engine Compete With EV Powertrains?" 23 Sep 2011 &lt;http://www.designnews.com/author.asp?section_id=1386&amp;doc_id=233750&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tour Engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tourengine.com/|accessdate=30 October 2017|title=Tour Engine, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an opposed-cylinder split-cycle internal combustion engine that uses a novel Spool Shuttle Crossover Valve (SSCV) to transfer fuel/air charge from the cold to hot cylinder. The first prototype was completed on June, 2008. Tour Engine was funded by grants from the [[Israel]] [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov.il/gxmsmnipublications/rd2012_2013.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2017|title=Research and Development 2012-2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ARPA-E]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=slick-sheet-project/high-efficiency-split-cycle-engine-residential-generators|accessdate=30 October 2017|title=High Efficiency Split-cycle Engine For Residential Generators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical [[Elementary particle|particle]]s '''[[tachyon]]s''' have inspired many occurrences of '''tachyons in fiction'''.  The use of the word in science fiction dates back at least to 1970 when [[James Blish]]'s [[Star Trek]] novel ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'' incorporated tachyons into an ill-fated transporter experiment.
[[Image:Tachyon07a.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tachyon model.]]
[[File:Tachyon06d.gif|thumb|200px|Animation]]
In general, tachyons are a standby mechanism upon which many [[science fiction]] authors rely to establish faster-than-light communication, with or without reference to causality issues. For example, in the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' [[television series]], tachyons are used for real-time communication over long distances.  Another instance is [[Gregory Benford]]'s novel ''[[Timescape]]'', winner of the [[Nebula Award]], which involves the use of tachyons to transmit a message of salvation back in time.  Likewise, [[John Carpenter]]'s horror film ''[[Prince of Darkness (1987 movie)|Prince of Darkness]]'' uses tachyons to explain how future humans send messages backward through time to warn the characters of their impending doom.  By contrast, [[Alan Moore]]'s classic [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Watchmen]]'' features a character who uses "a squall of tachyons" broadcasting from space to muddle the mind of the only person on Earth capable of seeing the future.

The word "tachyon" has become widely recognized to such an extent that it can impart a science-fictional "sound" even if the subject in question has no particular relation to superluminal travel (compare [[positronic brain]]).  Classic [[Anime]] fans may associate tachyons with the energy source for the wave-motion gun and wave-motion engine in ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (''Starblazers'' in the United States).  Further examples include the "Tachion Tanks" of the PC game ''[[Dark Reign: The Future of War|Dark Reign]]'' and the "tachyon beam" of the game ''[[Master of Orion]].''  The space-combat sim ''[[Tachyon: The Fringe]]'' utilizes "tachyon gates" for superluminal travel but gives no exact explanation for the technology, and the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Eve Online]]'' features six types of "Large Tachyon Lasers", technically a contradiction since by definition, [[laser]]s emit light&amp;mdash;[[photon]]s, not any kind of hypothetical tachyon.

==In popular culture==

===Comics===
* The ''[[X-Men]]'' character [[Silver Samurai]] has the power to generate a tachyon field which can cut through everything but [[adamantium]] by channeling his mutant energy into anything, usually his [[katana]].
* In the [[DC Universe]], tachyons are used by both [[Hourman]] II and III.
* In [[Blue Beetle]] issue 7 and 8, tachyon weapons  are used by both [[Stopwatch]] and his assistant [[Short Timer]].
* In the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Watchmen]]'', Dr. Manhattan's ability to see into the future is blocked by tachyons generated by Adrian Veidt.
* In The Adventures of [[Superman]] Annual #3, the Wave-Rider is a character who claims that he was once human, but has been reduced to tachyons, and is thus able to travel backward and forward in time at will.  He follows a timeline to the future in order to determine whether or not Superman poses a threat to mankind.

===Film===
* In ''[[Land of the Lost (film)|Land of the Lost]]'' (2009), [[Will Ferrell]] stars as Dr. Rick Marshall, who invented the "Tachyon Amplifier" that can supposedly boost a strong signal of Tachyon energy into a time warp that will lead to a universal lost and found, a virtual "Land of the Lost".
* In ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' a video signal from the future travels on Tachyon particles to be received as a dream in a church in present-day Los Angeles.
* In ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', [[Reed Richards]] uses a Tachyon pulse generator, with four amplifiers placed in a four-point pattern, to disable the [[Silver Surfer]] and separate him from his board, rendering him powerless.
*In ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015), Tachyons are used to power The Monitor, a device which can see both the past and future. Tachyons also naturally produce temporary images of future events, much like a holographic video.

===Literature===
* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' novels, there is a tachyon net allowing instant communication and particle manipulation through the Universe.
* In [[Evan Currie]]'s ''[[Odyssey One]]'', Captain Weston and his ship, the 'Odyssey' travel the known universe using a 'Transition' drive that uses tachyons to propel the ship and the crew omnidirectionally and instantly through space.
* In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s novel ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', one of the main characters mentions that during a "Jump" through [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], the matter—which includes the ship and everything inside it, including human passengers—are converted into tachyons for the instantaneous mode of interstellar travel in that novel's universe.
* In [[Dan Simmons]]'s ''[[Hyperion Cantos|Hyperion]]'' universe, a faster-than-light communication medium, the "fatline", is used for starships and planets to send high-priority messages to each other without suffering months or years' delay for normal radio transmission. The fatline messages can be intercepted and decoded by fatline receivers, and the message is described in Hyperion as a "burst of decaying tachyons."
* [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s novel ''[[Flashforward (novel)|Flashforward]]'' features the invention of a Tachyon-[[Tardyon]] Collider, allowing experiments which previously required large particle accelerators to be performed in a machine about the size of a microwave. Additionally, a space probe is launched with a tachyon transmitter, allowing it to send information to Earth at [[faster-than-light]] speeds.
* In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Johnny Maxwell]]'' trilogy of children's books, the time-travelling bag-lady is called "Mrs. Tachyon."
* In the ''[[Wild Cards]]'' book series, the character [[Dr. Tachyon]] is so named because of the way in which his [[bioship]] flies faster than light, and because his own alien name is impractically long and difficult to pronounce.
* In [[Gregory Benford]]'s novel ''[[Timescape]]'', scientists at the end of the 20th century are attempting to communicate with the past to avoid a world-threatening event. This is achieved by sending tachyons to introduce [[noise]] into a physics experiment investigating spontaneous resonance and [[indium antimonide]] in the form of [[morse code]] pulses.
* In [[Margaret Peterson Haddix]]'s ''[[The Missing (novel series)]]'' Trilogy, tachyons are depicted as particles that can travel through time. An airplane labeled ''Tachyon Travel'' was used to transport historical children through time.
*In [[Alex Scarrow|Alex Scarrow's]] ''[[TimeRiders|TimeRiders series]]'', they are used to send messages backwards in time.
*In [[Frederik Pohl]]'s novel ''[[The World at the End of Time]]'', tachyons are one of the ways used by the plasma entities that live inside stars to communicate between themselves, the other being [[EPR paradox|Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky pairs of particles]].
*In Nathan Van Coops' ''In Times Like These'' Trilogy, a tachyon pulse transmitter is mentioned to contact other time travelers in other parallel timelines.

===Television===
* In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]], tachyons are among the fictitious or hypothetical particles frequently invoked in [[treknobabble]], often as a ''[[deus ex machina]]'' used to maintain the plot. Tachyons are frequently invoked to explain some aspect of the [[Romulan]] [[cloaking device]]. In the film ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]],'' ships fire "tachyon pulses" at one another, disrupting the targets' "shield harmonics" and thereby allowing [[transporter (Star Trek)|transport]] through the shields. Finally, in the third season ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "Explorers", a tachyon stream was used as an (accidental) means to propel an ancient [[solar sail]]ing ship to warp speed. Tachyons are also often mentioned throughout each series when a plot contains references to [[time travel]] or time manipulation.  In "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]", the final episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' tachyons which were released cause a space-time fissure that threatens to destroy all life on Earth (along with the rest of the galaxy) in the distant past.
* The [[Tom Baker]]-era ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story "[[The Leisure Hive]]" features a race called the Argolins who utilise tachyons for a cloning-like procedure and for "illusions" as such. The Argolin Pangol explains, "Tachyons travel faster than light. A tachyon field can therefore be made to reach point ''B'' – that visidome, say – before its departure from point ''A'', the Generator." [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] says that the [[Time Lord]]s "abandoned tachyonics when we developed warp matrix engineering".
* ''[[Blake's 7]]'' has the Season 3 episode "Orbit", where a scientist and his assistant have created the "Tachyon Funnel" — a powerful weapon that can destroy anything in the universe by harnessing the power of super-dense stellar matter.  Events can be watched in real-time from the Funnel, and the demonstration destroys a star several light-years away.
* In the [[List of Eureka episodes#Season 1 (2006)|series pilot]] of ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', scientist Walter Perkins creates a "tachyon accelerator", activates it, and as a result the laws of physics and the fabric of space-time itself begin to unravel. This is apparently due to a "tachyon collision" created by the machine. The effects are stopped by creating a second collision to counteract the first.
* In the [[NBC]] series ''[[Journeyman (TV series)|Journeyman]]'', tachyons have been mentioned as a theory, possibly explaining the mysterious trips through time experienced by [[Dan Vasser]].
*In the 2009-2010 season series ''[[FlashForward]]'', Lloyd Simcoe's ability to discover the month of a second global blackout depends on his ability to decipher the tachyon constant.
*In the 2006-2007 [[tokusatsu]] series ''[[Kamen Rider Kabuto]]'', Kamen Riders use tachyon powered rider belts known as Zecters to combat the Worms, who have an ability to move faster-than-light. The main protagonist, [[Kamen Rider Kabuto (character)|Souji Tendou]] can use an upgrade called the Hyper Zecter to perform faster than light travel, enabling him to travel back in time.
* In ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', the wave motion engine uses tachyons to enable faster-than-light travel. This technology was given to the humans by Iscander which already had FTL capable engines. The enemy, the Gamilus also had tachyons using engines and so both could fight at the same speed and achieve faster than light travel. The ''Yamato'' also utilizes tachyons in its signature weapon, the wave motion gun.
* In ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', during the episode "[[Hereafter (Justice League episode)|Hereafter]]", [[Vandal Savage]] explains that the disintegrator beam Toyman's machine hit Superman with was actually an energized tachyon stream. This was responsible for sending [[Superman]] thousands of years into the future.
* In ''[[Transformers Animated]]'', the Eiite Guard ship ''[[Steelhaven]]'' has a tachyon transmitter on board. [[Lugnut (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Lugnut]] and [[Blitzwing#Transformers Animated|Blitzwing]] are given orders to steal it, to facilitate a communications device allowing [[Megatron#Transformers Animated 2|Megatron]] to communicate with the [[Decepticons#Transformers Animated|Decepticons]] at the rim of the galaxy.
* In the 2013 series ''[[Max Steel (2013 TV series)|Max Steel]]'', Max McGrath is able to generate Tachyon Unlimited Radiant Bio-Optimized (T.U.R.B.O) Energy from his body, due to an accident that involved his late father. An Alien-friend, Steel is introduced as an Ultra-Link that bonds with him, helping him to regulate his T.U.R.B.O Energy to its full-potential. In episode The Legend of Ja'em Mk'Rah, Max's father, Jim McGrath was revealed to be an alien being from the Planet Tachyon.
* In the episode "[[Synchrony (The X-Files)|Synchrony]]" of the [[FOX]] series ''[[The X-Files]]'', tachyons are suggested to be the particles through which time travel is possible. As explained by a man in the episode who is revealed to have returned from the future to kill the scientists whose work makes time travel possible, the discovery of tachyons inspire scientist Lisa Ianelli to synthesize a chemical compound that acts as a catalyst for triggering a self-sustaining endothermic reaction that reduces the temperature of a body to well-below freezing. The state caused by the reaction enables time travel by countering the negative effects of moving beyond the speed of light.
* In ''[[Babylon 5]]'', humans confirmed the existence of the Tachyon particle in 2091. By the time of the shows setting in 2258 Humans used Tachyon communications for real time faster than light communications over distances of up to 2,000 light years.
* In the 2014 live action series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', the team search for signs of time travel by looking for residual tachyons. In the presence of tachyons, gravity is altered allowing liquids to rise out of their containers. Harrison Wells (aka The Reverse Flash) also implanted one such device into his wheelchair to enhance his speed to defeat Barry Allen yet it was also repurposed to help Firestorm maintain stability. In season 2 a similar device is used by Barry to defeat Zoom after travelling back in time to obtain its schematics from The Reverse Flash.
* Tachyon particles are also mentioned severally in the Disney TV series Best Friends Whenever and appear when time travellers Cyd and Shelby 'jump' backwards or forwards in time.
* In [[Dark Matter (TV series)|Dark Matter]] 2017 the android mentions sending tachyons into a rift as a beacon to locate the rest of the crew.

===Video games===
* In the MMORPG [[Maplestory]], a quest has the player collect tachyons in order to rebuild a barrier between dimensions which Papulatus, a time- and space-distorting monster has destroyed.
* In Paradox Interactive's Stellaris, an empire can research Tachyon Sensors, to increase the survey speed for planets and the fleet's overall sensor range, as well as deadly long-range Tachyon Lance weaponry. 
* In the PC Game [[Tachyon: The Fringe]], humanity has learned to harness the particle to create gates that allow faster-than-light travel within and between solar systems.
* In ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction]]'', the main antagonist is Emperor Percival Tachyon.
* In the PC Pinball [[Pro Pinball: Timeshock!|Timeshock!]], the game's main story focuses on finding pieces of Tachyonium through time.
* In [[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]], certain technological advances allow the construction of a Tachyon Field (perimeter defense) and a Tachyon bolt (weapon).
* A technician's maintenance report offhandedly mentions tachyons as being a part of [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] technology in [[Dead Space 2]].
*In [[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]], cars are equipped with a tachyon repeater as the weapon for vehicle form.
* In [[Master of Orion 2]] the Physics technology tree allow for the uses of tachyon communications, used for communication several parsecs away.
* In [[The Wonderful 101]] the hero's ship, The Virgin Victory, is able to detect encroaching alien enemies with a Tachyon Radar.
* In the RTS [[Zero-K]], the units [http://zero-k.info/mediawiki/index.php?title=Lance Lance] and [http://zero-k.info/mediawiki/index.php?title=Paladin Paladin] have tachyon accelerators which allow them to shoot big lasers.

===Music===
* The experimental hip hop group [[Death Grips]] has a song called Takyon (Death Yon) on their mixtape [[Exmilitary]].
* The Swedish rock band [[Second Sun]] released a song called Tachyonregenerator on a 7" vinyl single of the same name in 2016.
* The British music group Tripswitch named a track Tachyon for the referencing the recorded background dialog from a movie about a space traveler to Earth.

===Other===
* Tachyon is a character in the [[lonelygirl15]] related OpAphid [[alternate reality game]].  She is a [[spy]] working for a secret organisation in opposition to OpAphid's activities.
* In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] [[trading card game]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal]] series, there is a powerful boss monster called "'''No. 107 Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon'''", which stands in opposition (and a kind of superiority) to a rival monster, "'''Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon'''".
* The Tachyon, Tachyon 2 and Tachyon 3 are names of models of balisongs (butterfly knife) produced by [[Microtech Knives]] and originally designed by Mike Turber.

===Manga===

The '''Tallinn Power Plant''' ({{lang-et|Tallinna elektrijaam}}) is a former [[power plant]] located in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. Construction of the power plant was initiated by [[Volta (Estonian company)|Volta company]] and it was decided by the [[Tallinn City Council]] in 1912 after the work of special committee established in 1909.&lt;ref name=epl230304&gt;

'''''Terra Nova''''' is a Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessel ([[FPSO]]) located in the [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]] [[oil and gas field]], approximately {{convert|350|km|mi|sp=us}} east-southeast off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]] in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]. The Terra Nova field is operated by [[Suncor Energy Inc.]], with a 33.9% interest.

The Terra Nova field is south of the successful [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]] field and the more recent [[White Rose (oil field)|White Rose]] field. All three fields are in the [[Jeanne d'Arc Basin]] on the eastern edge of the famous [[Grand Banks]] fishing territory.

''Terra Nova'' lost 165,000 liters of oil into the ocean in 2004 because of two mechanical failures.  In June 2006, production on ''Terra Nova'' was halted as the platform was sent to [[Rotterdam]] for a refit. She returned to the Terra Nova field on 25 September 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11608">'''Thrust-specific fuel consumption''' ('''TSFC''') is the [[fuel efficiency]] of an [[engine]] design with respect to [[thrust]] output. 
TSFC may also be thought of as fuel consumption (grams/second) per unit of thrust (kilonewtons, or kN). It is thus thrust-specific, meaning that the fuel consumption is divided by the thrust.

TSFC or SFC for [[reaction engine|thrust engine]]s (e.g. [[turbojet]]s, [[turbofan]]s, [[ramjet]]s, [[rocket engine]]s, etc.) is the mass of [[fuel]] needed to provide the net thrust for a given period e.g. lb/(h·lbf) (pounds of fuel per hour-pound of thrust) or g/(s·kN) (grams of fuel per second-kilonewton). Mass of fuel is used, rather than volume (gallons or litres) for the fuel measure, since it is independent of temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/Training/Aerodynamics/range_prop.htm Specific Fuel Consumption&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Specific fuel consumption of air-breathing jet engines at their maximum efficiency is more or less proportional to speed. The fuel consumption ''per mile'' or ''per kilometre'' is a more appropriate comparison for aircraft that travel at very different speeds. There also exists [[power specific fuel consumption]], which equals speed times the thrust specific fuel consumption. It can have units of pounds per hour per horsepower.

This figure is inversely proportional to [[specific impulse]].

==Significance of SFC==
SFC is dependent on engine design, but differences in the SFC between different engines using the same underlying technology tend to be quite small. Increasing [[overall pressure ratio]] on jet engines tends to decrease SFC.

In practical applications, other factors are usually highly significant in determining the fuel efficiency of a particular engine design in that particular application. For instance, in aircraft, turbine (jet and turboprop) engines are typically much smaller and lighter than equivalently powerful piston engine designs, both properties reducing the levels of [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on the plane and reducing the amount of power needed to move the aircraft. Therefore, turbines are more efficient for aircraft propulsion than might be indicated by a simplistic look at the table below.

SFC varies with throttle setting,altitude and climate. For jet engines, flight speed also has a significant effect upon SFC; SFC is roughly proportional to air speed (actually exhaust velocity), but speed along the ground is also proportional to air speed. Since work done is force times distance, mechanical power is force times speed. Thus, although the nominal SFC is a useful measure of fuel efficiency, it should be divided by speed to get a way to compare engines that fly at different speeds.

For example, [[Concorde]] cruised at 1354&amp;nbsp;mph, or 7.15 million feet per hour, with its engines giving an SFC of 1.195&amp;nbsp;lb/(lbf·h) (see below); this means the engines transferred 5.98 million [[foot pound]]s per pound of fuel (17.9 MJ/kg), equivalent to an SFC of 0.50&amp;nbsp;lb/(lbf·h) for a subsonic aircraft flying at 570&amp;nbsp;mph, which would be better than even modern engines; the [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma_Olympus_593|Olympus 593]] used in the Concorde was the world's most efficient jet engine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3203_concorde.html Supersonic Dream]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/downloads/turbofan-2012.pdf The turbofan engine]", page 5. ''[[SRM Institute of Science and Technology]], Department of aerospace engineering''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Concorde ultimately has a heavier airframe and, due to being supersonic, is less aerodynamically efficient, i.e., the [[lift to drag ratio]] is far lower. In general, the total fuel burn of a complete aircraft is of far more importance to the customer.

The following table gives the efficiency for several engines when running at 80% throttle, which is approximately what is used in cruising, giving a minimum SFC. The efficiency is the amount of power propelling the plane divided by the rate of energy consumption. Since the power equals thrust times speed, the efficiency is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\eta=V/(SFC\times h)&lt;/math&gt;
where V is speed and h is the energy content per unit mass of fuel (probably the [[lower heating value]] is used here).

A '''water capacitor''' is a device that uses water as its [[dielectric]] insulating medium. 

== Theory of operation ==
A [[capacitor]] is a device in which electrical energy is introduced and can be stored for a later time.  A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by a non-conductive region. The non-conductive region is called the dielectric or electrical insulator. Examples of traditional dielectric media are air, paper, and certain semiconductors.  A capacitor is a self-contained system, is isolated with no net electric charge. The conductors must hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces.&lt;ref name=Schulz&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulz|first=Alexander|title=Capacitors : Theory, Types, And Applications|year=2011|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=Ipswich, MA|type=eBook|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=411418&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water as a dielectric==
Conventional [[capacitor]]s use materials such as glass or ceramic as their insulating medium to store an [[electric charge]]. Water capacitors were created mainly as a novelty item or for laboratory experimentation, and can be made with simple materials.
Water exhibits the quality of being self-healing; if there is an [[electrical breakdown]] through the water, it quickly returns to its original and undamaged state. Other liquid insulators are prone to [[carbonization]] after breakdown, and tend to lose their hold off strength over time.

The drawback to using water is the short length of time it can hold off the voltage, typically in the microsecond to ten microsecond (μs) range. Deionized water is relatively inexpensive and is environmentally safe. These characteristics, along with the high [[dielectric constant]], make water an excellent choice for building large capacitors. If a way can be found to reliably increase the hold off time for a given field strength, then there will be more applications for water capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kristiansen|first1=Magne|title=DSWA-TR-97-30|publisher=Defense Special Weapons Agency|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA335128&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water has been shown not to be a very reliable substance to store electric charge long term, so more reliable materials are used for capacitors in industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egal,Hammer|first=Geoff, Spinner|title=Water and Glass Capacitor|url=http://www.linux-host.org/energy/swater.htm|work=Reseah in Utilization of Free Energy Found in Nature|publisher=Geoff Egal|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However water has the advantage of being self healing after a breakdown, and if the water is steadily circulated through a de-ionizing resin and filters, then the loss resistance and dielectric behavior can be stabilized. Thus, in certain unusual situations, such as the generation of extremely high voltage but very short pulses, a water capacitor may be a practical solution – such as in an experimental Xray pulser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horioka|first1=Kazuhiko|title=Pumping system for Capillary Dscharge Laser|journal=National institute for Fusion Science|date=Mar 2007|url=http://www.nifs.ac.jp/report/nifs-proc72.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
A simple type of water capacitor is created by using water filled glass jars and some form of insulating material to cover the ends of the jar.   Water capacitors are not widely used in the industrial community due to their large physical size for a given capacitance. The conductivity of water can change very quickly and is unpredictable if left open to atmosphere. Many variables such as temperature, [[pH]] levels, and [[salinity]] have been shown to alter conductivity in water.  As a result, there are better alternatives to the water capacitor in the majority of applications.

The pulse withstand voltage of carefully purified water can be very high – over 100kV/cm (comparing to about 100mm for the same voltage in dry air).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.aps.org/prab/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.12.010402|title=Dielectric-breakdown tests of water at 6MV|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Sandia Labs|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A capacitor is designed to store electric energy when disconnected from its charging source.  Compared to more conventional devices, water capacitors are currently not practical devices for industrial applications. Capacitance can be increased by the addition of electrolytes and minerals to the water, but this increases the self leakage, and cannot be done beyond its saturation point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Electric Circuits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-weAQAAIAAJ |last=Dorf |first=Richard C. |last2=Svoboda |first2=James A. |edition=5th |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-471-38689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hazards and benefits==
Modern high voltage capacitors may retain their charge long after power is removed. This charge can cause dangerous, or even potentially fatal, shocks if the stored energy is more than a few [[joule]]s. At much lower levels, stored energy can still cause damage to connected equipment. Water capacitors, being self discharging, (for totally pure water, only thermally ionized, at {{convert|25|C}} the ratio of conductivity to permittivity means that self discharge time is circa 180µs, faster with higher temperatures or dissolved impurities) usually cannot be made store enough  residual electrical energy to cause serious bodily injury.  

Unlike many large industrial high voltage capacitors, water capacitors do not require oil. Oil found in many older designs of capacitors can be toxic to both animals and humans. If a capacitor breaks open and its oil is released, the oil often finds its way into the [[water table]], which can cause health problems over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: Electric Fish|first=Peter|last=Moller|journal=BioScience|volume=41|issue=11|date=December 1991|pages=794–6 [794]|doi=10.2307/1311732|jstor=1311732|publisher=American Institute of Biological Sciences|last2=Kramer|first2=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Capacitors can originally be traced back to a device called a [[Leyden jar]], created by the Dutch physicist [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolund|first=Björn F|last2=Berglund|first2= M|last3=Bernhoff|first3= H.|title=Dielectric study of water/methanol mixtures for use in pulsed-power water capacitors|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=March 2003|volume=93|issue=5|pages=|doi=10.1063/1.1544644}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leyden jar consisted of a glass jar with tin foil layers on the inside and outside of the jar. A rod electrode was directly connected to the inlayer of foil by means of a small chain or wire.  This device stored static electricity created when amber and wool where rubbed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korotkov|first=S|last2=Aristov|first2= Y|last3=Kozlov |first3=A|last4=Korotkov |first4=D|last5=Rol'nik|first5= I|title=A generator of electrical discharges in water.|journal=Instruments &amp; Experimental Techniques|date=March 2011|volume=54|issue=2|pages=190–193.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=60078019&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=4 April 2013|doi=10.1134/s0020441211010246}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulz" /&gt;

Although the design and materials used in capacitors have changed greatly throughout history, the basic fundamentals remain the same. In general, capacitors are very simple electrical devices which can have many uses in today's technologically advanced world.  A modern capacitor usually consists of two conducting plates sandwiched around an insulator. Electrical researcher [[Nicola Tesla]] described capacitors as the "electrical equivalent of dynamite".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
