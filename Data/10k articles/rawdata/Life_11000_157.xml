'''Abu Salama ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Asad al-Makhzumi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو سلمة عبد الله بن عبد الأسد المخزومي}}) was one of the [[sahabah|companions]] of [[Muhammad]].

==Biography==
Abu Salama was one of the early companions of Muhammad. He was born to Barrah Bint Abdul Muttalib and Abdul Asad, thus making him the first cousin of Muhammad; as Barrah was the full sister of Abdullah bin Abdul Mutalib.&lt;ref name="Ibn Hisham, Volume 1"&gt;Ibn Hisham, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to [[Umm Salama]], and they were among [[timing of Sahabah becoming Muslims|the first who converted to Islam]]. They had four children: Salama, Umar, Zaynab and Durra.

Abu Salama was also involved in the migration towards Ethiopia but later came back under the protection of his uncle Abu Talib bin Abdul Mutallib.&lt;ref name="Ibn Hisham, Volume 1"/&gt;

==Military campaigns during Muhammad's epoch ==
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}
Abu Salama died from a wound he sustained during the [[Battle of Uhud]] that reopened after he had led the [[Expedition of Qatan]]. After his death, [[Muhammad]] married his widow.

He also participated in the [[Expedition of Qatan]] in which Muhammad ordered to attack the Banu Asad bin Khuzaymah tribe after receiving intelligence that they were allegedly plotting to attack Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Mubarakpuri, The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet , p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; 3 people were captured by Muslims during the expedition&lt;ref name="Sa'd 1967 150"&gt;{{cite book | last =Sa'd|first= Ibn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vnXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Qaynuqa|title=Kitab al-tabaqat al-kabir | volume =2|year=1967|publisher=Pakistan Historical Society|asin=B0007JAWMK|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf IV''' (before 1205 &amp;ndash; 8 July 1261), was a [[Count of Schauenburg]] (1225–1238) and of [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Holstein]] (1227–1238), of the [[House of Schaumburg]]. Adolf was the eldest son of [[Adolf III of Holstein|Adolf III of Schauenburg and Holstein]] by his second wife, Adelheid of Querfurt.

==Life==
[[Image:Sarkophag Adolf IV von Schauenburg.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Adolf IV in a sarcophagus: an ideal portrait painted about 1450, originally the lower part of a double portrait in the ''Maria-Magdalenen-Kloster'', Kiel. At 2.77 metres long, the figure is greater than life-size]] Adolf IV won several victories against the [[Denmark|Danes]]. In 1225 he won the [[Battle of Mölln]] against [[Albert II, Count of Weimar-Orlamünde]]. On 22 July 1227 with his coalition army Adolf was victorious in the [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)|Battle of Bornhöved]] against King [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] with his Danish army and German allies (the Welfs), and thus regained Holstein. In 1235 he founded [[Kiel]] and in 1238 [[Itzehoe]]. In 1238 he took part in a crusade in [[Livonia]]. 

In fulfilment of an oath taken during the heat of the Battle of Bornhöved, Adolf withdrew in 1238 to a [[Franciscan]] friary and in 1244 was ordained a priest in Rome (his two under-age sons passed into the guardianship of his son-in-law [[Abel of Denmark|Duke Abel of Schleswig]]). Also in 1244 he founded [[Neustadt in Holstein]]. He died in 1261 in the Franciscan friary in Kiel, which he himself had founded, whereupon Holstein was divided between his sons John (of Holstein-Kiel) and Gerhard (of Holstein-Itzehoe).

==Marriage and issue==
He married Heilwig von der Lippe, daughter of Count [[Hermann II, Count of Lippe|Hermann II of Lippe]] and by her had the following children:
* [[Mechtild of Holstein|Mechthild]] (1225–1288): she married firstly in 1237 [[Abel of Denmark]], [[Duke of Schleswig]] and later [[King of Denmark]] (this marriage provided the basis for later claims by the Schauenburgers on the Duchy of Schleswig); and secondly [[Birger Jarl]], Regent of [[Sweden]]
* [[John I, Count of Holstein-Kiel]] (1229–1263)
* [[Gerhard I, Count of Holstein-Itzehoe]] (1232–1290)
* Ludolf, d. in childhood

'''Antipope Callixtus III''' or '''Callistus III''' (died before 19 October 1183&lt;ref&gt;[[Ambrogio Piazzoni]], '''Historia wyboru papieży''', Wyd. M Kraków 2003, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;) was [[Antipope]] from September 1168 to 29 August 1178.

==Biography==
His real name was Giovanni, Abbot of [[Poppi Castle|Struma]]. He was a strong and early supporter of [[Frederick Barbarossa]], and also supported [[Antipope Victor IV (1159–1164)|Antipope Victor IV]], who made him a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]-[[bishop of Albano]].

He was named successor to [[Antipope Paschal III]] by a small number of [[Schism (religion)|schism]]atic cardinals. Callixtus was primarily a bargaining chip of Frederick to pressure [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]], and he had only limited geographical support. He resided in [[Viterbo]].

Frederick, when it became politically expedient, after the [[Battle of Legnano|defeat of Legnano]], switched his backing to Alexander, in the 1177 [[Peace of Venice]], abjuring his position on 29 August 1178. Callixtus, besieged at [[Viterbo]] by [[Christian of Mainz]], eventually accepted the situation, and at [[Tusculum]], made his submission to Pope Alexander (29 August 1178), who received him with kindness. Alexander then appointed him Governor of [[Benevento]], where he died a few years later. Some of his obstinate partisans sought to substitute a new antipope, and chose one Lando Di Sezze, under the name of [[Antipope Innocent III|Innocent III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Third Lateran Council (1179)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; released by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] that deals with the subject of [[near-death experience|near death experiences]].

==Production notes==
''Beyond and Back'' was produced by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]], a [[Utah]]-based [[independent film]] company that specialized in releasing [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] message movies to non-urban audiences. Along with such features as ''[[In Search of Noah's Ark]]'' (1976) and ''[[In Search of Historic Jesus]]'' (1979), the film was one of a series of releases from the company that attempted to present convincing scientific evidence for [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref name="amc"/&gt;

Based in part on a book by evangelist Ralph Wilkerson, the idea for ''Beyond and Back'' was suggested to Sunn Pictures by a freelance writer who submitted a treatment for the film after reading about the film studio in [[Writer's Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Wasser, Cinema Journal, Winter 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The film's screenwriter, Stephen Lord, was a respected television [[screenwriter]], having written scripts for such notable sci-fi/horror programs as ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' and ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]].'' Directing chores went to [[James L. Conway]], who had helmed Sunn's speculative fiction vehicle ''[[The Lincoln Conspiracy (film)|The Lincoln Conspiracy]]'' the previous year.  The movie was filmed by cinematographer Henning Schellerup, a veteran of late '60s and early '70s porn films such as ''Come One, Come All'' (1970) and ''Heterosexualis'' (1973).

Parts of the film were shot in [[Park City, Utah|Park City]], [[Salt Lake City]], and [[Heber City, Utah|Heber]] in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
Since ''Beyond and Back'' never received a traditional wide release, it was able to largely avoid scrutiny from the national media. [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] mostly screened its films in smaller towns and non-urban areas.  It was also popular at drive-in movie theaters.  This approach "avoided the audiences and the critical media in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]]... if the film failed in any single market, negative [[word of mouth]] did not spread to the next locale."&lt;ref&gt;(Wasser, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wasser's assertion has, however, been disputed: "Wow, I saw it when I was 6. Saw it in Brooklyn".&lt;ref&gt;Chris71, http://www.freedocumentary.tv/beyond-and-back/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Born-again Christian background and content==
Filmed entirely on location in Utah, ''Beyond and Back'' was produced by [[Charles E. Sellier Jr.]] At the time of the film's release, Sellier noted that he: {{quote|"Believe(s) God wants me to do the films I do, otherwise He wouldn't have made me a success."&lt;ref&gt;''[[TV Guide]]'', January 28, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Critical and box office reception==
''[[The New York Times]]''' film critic [[Janet Maslin]] criticized the film for its inability to answer the many questions it raised, adding: {{quote|"Do you know real malarkey when you hear it? What would you consider a fair price for the Brooklyn Bridge?".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980CE7DE1530E632A2575BC1A9649C946990D6CF&lt;/ref&gt;}} In his January 1979 ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review, [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one star, noting that it: {{quote|"Gives turkeys a bad name.

Produced very inexpensively, the film was a major commercial success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15244">'''Breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers''' is the practice of breastfeeding of HIV-infected mothers and include those who may want to or are currently breastfeeding . HIV can be transmitted to the infant through breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdna-song-HIV.htm|title=Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)|last=Health|first=Australian Government Department of|website=www.health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of transmission varies and depends on the viral load in the mother's milk. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|vauthors=Moland, K, Blystad A|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|veditors=Hahn R, Inhorn M|page=449|chapter=Counting on Mother's Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A infant can be infected with HIV throughout the duration of the pregnancy or during childbirth (intrapartum).&lt;ref name="White, E. 1999 12"&gt;{{cite book | author = White, E. | year = 1999 | title = Breastfeeding and HIV/AIDS: The Research, the Politics, the Women's Perspectives | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fetal and neonatal secrets|last=Polin|first=Richard|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2014|isbn=978-0-323-09139-8|location=Philadelphia|pages=|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Breastfeeding with HIV guidelines established by the [[WHO]] suggest that HIV-infected mothers (particularly those in resource-poor countries) practice exclusive breastfeeding only, rather than mixed breastfeeding practices that involve other dietary supplements or fluids.&lt;ref name = "Moland_2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moland K, De Paoli M, Sellen D, Van Esterik P, Leshbari S, Blystad A | year = 2010 | title = Breastfeeding and HIV: Experiences from a Decade of Prevention of Postnatal HIV Transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa | journal = International Breastfeeding Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | page = 4 | doi = 10.1186/1746-4358-5-10| pmid = 20977709 | pmc = 2987846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have revealed the high benefit of exclusive breastfeeding to both mother and child, documenting that exclusive breastfeeding for a period of 6 months significantly reduces transmission, provides the infant with a greater chance of survival in the first year of life, and helps the mother to recover from the negative health effects of birth much more quickly.&lt;ref name="pmid19806071"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stein Z, Kuhn L | title = Breast feeding: A time to craft new policies | journal = J Public Health Policy | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–10 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19806071 | pmc = 2813715 | doi = 10.1057/jphp.2009.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these positive indicators, other studies have determined that bottle-fed babies of HIV-infected mothers approximately has a 19 percent chance of becoming infected, in comparison to breastfed babies who had an approximate 49 percent chance of infection.&lt;ref name="White, E. 1999 12" /&gt; Such a variance in findings makes it difficult to institute a proper set of guidelines for HIV-infected women in third-world or developing countries, where alternative forms of feeding are not always acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe (AFASS).&lt;ref name="Moland_2010" /&gt; Thus after much research, the benefits and/or consequences of breastfeeding with HIV are still currently under debate.

== PMTCT policy challenges ==
The practice of breastfeeding for HIV positive mothers is a highly contested and controversial global public health concern. Programs for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and other international guidelines offer preventative interventions to address mother to child transmission(MTCT) of HIV in Third World countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 468 | chapter = Counting on Mother's Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|veditors=Hahn R, Inhorn M }}&lt;/ref&gt; PMTCT programs provide HIV-positive women with recommendations and services including [[antiretroviral therapy]] (ART), modifications in infant feeding practices (i.e., exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive replacement feeding), and counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 450 | chapter = Counting on Mother's Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|veditors=Hahn R, Inhorn M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programs have been implemented across different regions, their success in resource-constrained settings is still widely debated upon.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baek C, Rutenberg N | title = Implementing programs for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in resource-constrained settings: Horizons studies, 1999-2007 | journal = Public Health Rep | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–304 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20297758 | pmc = 2821859 | doi = 10.1177/003335491012500220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the majority of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole had an estimate of 430,000 HIV infections among children under the age of 15.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010" /&gt; HIV-positive women's lack of participation and adherence to PMTCT services and infant feeding guidelines has made the success of these policies difficult, despite the knowledge and technology that has been dedicated to them.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010" /&gt; Many women fear knowing their HIV status.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010" /&gt; Generally speaking, HIV-positive mothers lack support, especially from males, thus resulting in their stigmatization and exclusion by members of the community.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010" /&gt; It is because of this that most women end up losing contact with development programs, which end soon after the mother delivers.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010" /&gt; The discontinuation of these programs makes a knowledge and understanding of different feeding options difficult for these mothers, because these programs are not there to present them with the necessary information.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010" /&gt;

== Cross-cultural experiences ==

Access to available resources for the prevention of MTCT of HIV varies across different cultural regions. “MTCT of HIV has been virtually eliminated in well-resourced settings such as the United States and Europe”.&lt;ref name="Baek_Rutenberg_2010"/&gt; Available medical and therapeutic resources in developed countries can include drugs for HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy and labour, cesarean delivery to reduce the infant's exposure to infection; and modifications in infant feeding practices.&lt;ref name="Bulhões_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulhões AC, Goldani HA, Oliveira FS, Matte US, Mazzuca RB, Silveira TR | title = Correlation between lactose absorption and the C/T-13910 and G/A-22018 mutations of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LCT) gene in adult-type hypolactasia | journal = Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 1441–6 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17934640 | doi = 10.1590/S0100-879X2007001100004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In third world settings, medical resources and technology can be very hard to find and can serve as a financial burden to HIV-positive mothers. HIV-infected mothers refer to counselors for expert knowledge and recommendations on infant feeding and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hollen C | title = HIV-Positive Women's Responses to Global Policy in Infant Feeding in Canada | journal = Medical Anthropology Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | page = 503 | doi=10.1111/j.1548-1387.2011.01182.x| year = 2011 | url = https://surface.syr.edu/ant/1 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment amenities in resource-constrained settings are also available to HIV-positive mothers in the form of antiretroviral therapy (ART) which is one resource that has contributed to the elimination of MTCT of HIV in first world countries.&lt;ref name="Bulhões_2007" /&gt; In order to have access to resources, HIV-positive mothers must be able maintain follow up appointments regularly, however, this is problematic in resource-limited settings due to weak infrastructure in health care systems in countries such as India, Tanzania and Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Bulhões_2007" /&gt; This can also serve as a dilemma for HIV-positive mothers because although limited resources are available to them, financial constraint can prevent women from accessing available treatments. This can influence HIV-positive mother's decision to rely solely on breastfeeding as a primary feeding option due to financial instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Krocker L, Beckwith A | year = 2011 | title = Safe Infant Feeding in Lesotho in the Eras of HIV/AIDS | journal = Annals of Anthropological Practice | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | page = 59 | doi=10.1111/j.2153-9588.2011.01066.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropological research demonstrates that in contexts where breastfeeding is essential to infant survival, such as in resource poor settings, PMTCT infant feeding guidelines challenge notions of motherhood and women's decision making power over infant care, and colour HIV positive mothers' infant feeding experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blystad A, Moland K | year = 2011 | title = Technologies of Hope? Motherhood, HIV and Infant Feeding in Eastern Africa | journal = Anthropology &amp; Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | doi=10.1080/13648470902940655 | pmid = 27276404 | pages=105–118| hdl = 11250/2481714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Africa, infant mortality is high and breastfeeding is vital for infant survival.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | chapter = Counting on Mother's Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|veditors=Hahn R, Inhorn M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, motherhood is defined as the responsibility for ensuring the child's proper growth and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Breastfeeding is also seen as a cultural practice that helps create a social bond between mother and child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Esterik P| year = 2002 | title = Contemporary Trends in Infant Feeding Research | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 31 | page = INSERT | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085428}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a disjuncture between PMTCT policy's infant feeding guideline and what is considered to be good mothering behaviour.&lt;ref name = "Moland_2010"/&gt; The PMTCT policy promotes replacement feeding because it is believed to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV. However, adhering to such guidelines are difficult for mothers in resource-limited settings who believe that not breastfeeding one's child would be harmful to their health and survival, as well as threaten the “development of close bodily and emotional bonds between mother and child”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 471 | chapter = Counting on Mother's Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|veditors=Hahn R, Inhorn M }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, not breastfeeding, for HIV-positive women, is perceived as failing to be a good mother.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Thus, PMTCT programs impact HIV-positive women's agency and decision-making in infant care, as well as challenge their cultural conceptions of good motherhood.

== World Health Organization guideline ==

In an effort to further refine the [[United Nations]] guideline for optimal infant feeding options for [[HIV]]-infected mothers, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) held a three-day convention in Geneva in 2006 to review new evidence that had been established since they last established a guideline in 2000. Participants included UN agencies, representative from nongovernmental organizations, researchers, infant feeding experts, and WHO headquarters departments. The convention concluded with the following recommendations: If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable and safe, HIV-infected mothers are recommended to use replacement feeding. Otherwise, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended. At six months, if replacement feeding is still not available, HIV-infected mothers are encouraged to slowly introduce food while continuing breastfeeding. Those with HIV-infected infants are recommended to continue breastfeeding even after 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=WHO |title=HIV and infant feeding: new evidence and programmatic experience: report of a technical consultation held on behalf of the Inter-agency Task Team (IATT) on prevention of HIV infections in pregnant women, mothers and their infants. Geneva, Switzerland, 25–27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calpurnia Pisonis.jpg|thumb|200px|Calpurnia from the 16th-century ''[[Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]'']]
'''Calpurnia''' was the third and last wife of [[Julius Caesar]].  Born in 75 BC, she was the daughter of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Roman consul|consul]] in 58 BC, and sister of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul 15 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso (Pontifex)]], consul in 15 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Caesar's Gallic War, Book 1,
Julius Caesar, Hinds &amp; Noble, 1898, pg. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and Caesar's demise==
Calpurnia married Caesar in late 59 BC. Contemporary sources describe her as a humble, often shy woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Cicero: The Secrets of his Correspondence'', Volume 1, Jerome Carcopino translator, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1951, pg. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; No children resulted from their union. Caesar's daughter, [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]], was likely older than her stepmother, and had married [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] around the same time. Following Caesar's assassination in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Calpurnia delivered all Caesar's personal papers, including his will and notes, and his most precious possessions to the consul [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]], one of Caesar's most trusted allies. She never remarried.

According to a tradition reported in some ancient sources,&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Caesaris'', chapters 19&amp;ndash;24, recounts Caesar's assassination; extracts are quoted in {{cite web| url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/caesar2.htm| title= The Assassination of Julius Caesar, 44 BC | work=EyeWitness to History | accessdate=9 November 2005 }}. For an assessment of Nicolaus and his sources see Sihler, E.G. ''Annals of Caesar: A Critical Biography with a Survey of the Sources'' (New York : G. E. Stechert, 1911), pp. 293&amp;ndash;4&lt;/ref&gt; Calpurnia had a premonition about her husband's murder and endeavoured in vain to warn him. Unaware that [[praetor]] [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] was one of the conspirators against her husband, she  asked him to send word to the [[Roman senate|Senate]] that Caesar was ill and unable to attend.  However, Caesar rejected this plan, and Brutus escorted him into the hands of his enemies.

==Calpurnia in literature and popular culture==
[[File:Greer Garson in Julius Caesar trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Greer Garson as Calpurnia.]]
*In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', Calpurnia has a dream that a statue of Caesar was flowing with blood as many Romans wash their hands in the blood. She also sees in her dream that Julius Caesar would die in her arms.
*Calpurnia was portrayed by [[Gertrude Michael]] in ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934), [[Greer Garson]] in the [[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|1953 adaptation]] of Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', [[Gwen Watford]] in ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963), [[Joan Sims]] in ''[[Carry On Cleo]]'' (1964), [[Jill Bennett (British actress)|Jill Bennett]] in the [[Julius Caesar (1970 film)|1970 adaptation]] of ''Julius Caesar'' and [[Valeria Golino]] in the 2002 miniseries ''[[Julius Caesar (miniseries)|Julius Caesar]]''.
*Calpurnia was shown solving a murder in ''Mist of Prophecies'' (2002)  - part of the ''[[Roma Sub Rosa]]'' series by [[Steven Saylor]].  She gets Gordianus the Finder to look into a threat to her husband in a later book in this series, ''The Triumph of Caesar'' (2008). She is portrayed as a woman of formidable intelligence and efficiency, utterly devoted to her husband's interests, but with an incongruous fascination with trying to foretell the future.
*[[Calpurnia (Rome character)|Calpurnia]] was portrayed by [[Haydn Gwynne]] in [[HBO]]'s series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.  She is depicted as proud and traditional, and having had a vision of Caesar's death.
*Shakespeare's Calpurnia was portrayed by [[Sylvia Lennick]] in [[Wayne and Shuster]]'s comedy sketch "Julius Caesar - Rinse the Blood Off My Toga", parodied as a hysterical [[Italian-American]] housewife, repeatedly wailing "I&amp;nbsp;told him, Julie! Don't go!" in a [[Bronx]] accent.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/sylvia-lennick-wayne-shuster-sidekick-dies-at-93/article1246977/ "Sylvia Lennick, Wayne &amp; Shuster sidekick, dies at 93"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', August 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles River Laboratories, Inc.''', is an American [[corporation]] specializing in a variety of pre-clinical and clinical [[laboratory]] services for the [[pharmaceutical]], [[medical device]] and [[biotechnology]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Carl Roland. ''Business Policy: Text and Cases''. R.D. Irwin, 1982, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; It also supplies assorted biomedical products and [[research and development]] [[outsourcing]] services for use in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. According to its website, its customers include every major pharmaceutical and biotechnology company in the world, major academic institutions and government research centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criver.com/fr-FR/AboutUs/CRGlance/Pages/home.aspx "Charles River At A Glance"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122090254/http://www.criver.com/fr-FR/AboutUs/CRGlance/Pages/home.aspx |date=January 22, 2010 }}, Charles River Laboratories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Charles River was founded in 1947, by a young veterinarian who purchased thousands of rat cages from a Virginia farm and set up a one-man laboratory in Boston, overlooking the Charles River. In an effort to fulfill the regional need for laboratory animal models, he bred, fed and cared for the animals and personally delivered them to local researchers. 
In the last six decades, this one-man laboratory has evolved into a worldwide network. 
The organisation is constantly expanding their portfolio, and organisational growth has become a continuous strategic effort in anticipating tomorrow’s drug development needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.criver.com/about-us/who-we-are&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman and chief executive officer is [[James C. Foster]].

==Mergers==
In October 2003, Charles River Laboratories merged with Inveresk, a [[UK]]-owned research company. The company was known then as Charles River Laboratories. Inveresk specialised in clinical research and pre-clinical testing, and their main facilities are in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. In late 2009, Charles River sold its Clinical Services Division in Edinburgh to [[Quotient Bioresearch]].

In 2010 Charles River Laboratories attempted to acquire [[WuXi PharmaTech]], a China-based contract research organization, but the offer was withdrawn when the deal faced opposition from several large Charles River investors, including [[Relational Investors]], [[JANA Partners]] and [[Neuberger Berman]].

Proxy advisory firm [[RiskMetrics]] had also recommended that Charles River's shareholders vote against the proposed deal.

In July 2015 the company announced it would acquire [[Celsis International]] for $212 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/charles-river-buys-celsis-for-212m/81251486/|title=Charles River Buys Celsis for $212M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 the company announced it was set to acquire [[WIL Research Laboratories|WIL Research]] for approximately $585 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/charles-river-labs-to-acquire-wil-research-for-585m/81252192/|title=Charles River Labs to Acquire WIL Research for $585M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June the company announced it would acquire Blue Stream Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-river-laboratories-acquires-blue-203000110.html|title=Charles River Laboratories Acquires [[Blue Stream Laboratories|access-date=2016-06-28}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 the business announced it would acquire [[Brains On-Line]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bioanalysis-zone.com/2017/08/16/brains-line-acquired-charles-river-laboratories_charles-river-labs/&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the company announced it would acquire [[KWS BioTest]] for up to £18 million ($24.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/charles-river-labs-acquires-kws-biotest/81255364&lt;/ref&gt; In February of the same year Charles River announced it would acquire [[MPI Research]] for $800 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/charles-river-to-acquire-mpi-research-for-800m-posts-10-2017-revenue-growth&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rights issues==
The company has been the target of [[animal rights]] activists in the UK and US. It owned [[Shamrock Farm]] in England's West Sussex which closed in 2000 following a 15-month campaign by animal rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnett|first1=Anthony|last2=Ridley|first2=Yvonne|title=Monkey farm 'death trail' exposed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/09/yvonneridley.theobserver|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest site monkey farm to close.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Protest+site+monkey+farm+to+close.-a060767439|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=Coventry Evening Telegraph|date=11 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2007, two monkeys at the company’s Sparks, Nevada, facility had their fingers amputated after they were caught in the wiring of their cages while being moved, and a third monkey suffered a cut to its tail.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghastly Slaughter of Research Monkeys Prompts Calls for Oversight|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/03/17/ghastly-slaughter-research-monkeys/|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 32 cynomolgus [[primates]], also known as [[crab-eating macaque]]s, died of overheating at the company's Sparks, Nevada, laboratory after a climate system failure. [[PETA]] filed a complaint with the [[USDA]] over the incident. The  following year, a monkey died at the same facility after being left in their cage as it was going through a hot cage washer. Charles River was fined $14,500 for the two incidents. The company subsequently closed their Sparks facility.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sonner|first1=Scott|title=Animal deaths spark call for fining of Nevada, other testing labs|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-and-west/animal-deaths-spark-call-fining-nevada-other-testing-labs|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PETA]] owns $2,000 worth of shares in the company, enough to introduce formal resolutions regarding animal care during the company’s annual shareholder meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Warren|title=PETA takes on Merck, Pfizer animal testing policies|url=http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2012/12/peta_takes_on_merck_pfizer_ani.html|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=NJ.com|publisher=NJN Publishing|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christoph von Graffenried, 1st Baron of Bernberg''', also known as '''Christoph de Graffenried''', (15 November 1661 – 1743) was a British [[Peerage of Great Britain|peer]] from [[Switzerland]] who founded [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]], [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]], in 1710. Today, he is best known for his memoir, ''Relation of My American Project'' ([[Circa|c.]] 1716), which recounts his life as the Baron of Bernburg and  Landgrave of Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Colonial Records of North Carolina |url=https://archive.org/details/colonialrecordso01nort_0 |pages=985–986 |date=n.d. |lccn=01006807 |oclc=2864657 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Worb Schloss Tele.jpg|thumb|right|[[Worb Castle]], Von Graffenried's ancestral home and place of birth]]
Von Graffenried was born on 15 November 1661 to Anton von Graffenried, Lord of [[Worb]], and his first wife, Catherine, at [[Worb Castle]] in [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graffenried |first=Thomas P. de |date=1925 |title=History of the de Graffenried Family from 1191 A.D. to 1925 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofdegraff00graf |chapter=Chapter IX: Baron Christopher de Graffenried (The Landgrave) |location=Binghamton and New York |publisher=Vail-Ballou Press |pages=58–73 |lccn=26008083 |oclc=660863 |ol=OL24992234M |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landgrave of Carolina (1709-1743)==
Von Graffenried met Luis Michel, who claimed to know the location of [[silver ore]] in [[Virginia]] and owned land in the [[New World]]. He told von Graffenried what glorious places Carolina and Virginia were, and he advised him to move to Carolina. With the idea of paying off his debts and making money on the cheap land of Carolina, he left his debts to his father and secretly departed for [[London]] to make arrangements to move to the New World. When in London, he met with explorer [[John Lawson (explorer)|John Lawson]], who was publishing a book entitled ''A Voyage to Carolina''. Lawson was the Surveyor General of Carolina. Lawson promised to show von Graffenried and his settlers a perfect place to establish a community. In 1709, von Graffenried next met with the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, who granted to him ten thousand acres (40&amp;nbsp;km²) on the [[Neuse River|Neuse]] and [[Cape Fear River]]s. They also gave him the title Baron of Bernberg,{{cn|date=November 2018}} after the colony he was supposed to found.

Von Graffenried recruited a group of [[German Palatines|German refugees]] from the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatine]] region, which had been ravaged by French warfare and an extremely harsh winter, and [[Canton of Bern|Bernese]] immigrants. &lt;!--how many of each?--&gt;After severe hardships in their own countries, they were willing to try starting over in Carolina. He sailed with the colonists to Carolina in 1710. On the sea, the settlers were attacked by French [[privateers]] who stripped them of everything they brought. (On a similar voyage of nearly 3000 German Palatines from London to New York, nearly one-third died during and shortly after the trip; shipboard illnesses killed many already weakened by the harsh conditions of that winter.)

[[Image:Lawson-torture.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's depiction of the torture of Christoph von Graffenried and John Lawson by [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora Indians]] in 1711]]
Once in the New World, the settlers sold everything that remained, except the clothes on their backs. John Lawson took them to a site at the junction of the [[Trent River (North Carolina)|Trent]] and Neuse Rivers, which they named New Bern. The first season, the settler's crops did not do well. Von Graffenried returned to [[Europe]] to get supplies and additional settlers. He returned to the colony unscathed. In addition to a lack of food and supplies, there was great tension between the settlers and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora Indians]] of the [[Neuse River]] region. They were separated by language and culture, especially related to their differing concepts of land and property rights. The Tuscarora were an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, distantly related to the [[Five Tribes]] of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] based in central and western New York. The settlers had unwittingly planned their new settlement on the site of an old Tuscarora village. In 1711, von Graffenried and the settlers evicted a group of Tuscarora from nearby lands without payment, and von Graffenried assumed the title "Landgrave of Carolina." Retaliatory raids by the Tuscarora, under a leader named Hancock, led to deaths and damage to the settlement.

During the summer of 1711, von Graffenried, along with John Lawson, took a trip up the [[Neuse River]]. Von Graffenried wanted to crossbreed European grapes with wild, native grapes and start a vineyard. The Tuscarora took captive von Graffenried, John Lawson, and an enslaved African whom they had entrusted with their baggage. While in captivity, John Lawson and von Graffenried were given three separate trials, each in a different Tuscaroran village. One found the men not guilty; the other two pronounced them guilty of crimes against the Tuscarora.  The Tuscarora decided to kill them but,  after extended discussion over several weeks, the elders decided von Graffenried would be released. He wore such fine clothes they mistook him for the [[Robert Gibbes|Governor of Carolina]]. They thought if they let the "governor" go, the colony would let the incident pass. They informed him they were planning an attack on all the settlements in northern Carolina (when this took place, it was known as the [[Tuscarora War]]). The next day, the natives killed Lawson after ritual torture. Von Graffenried was released on condition that no new European settlements should be made without the sanction of the native chiefs. When he finally reached New Bern, he found it abandoned and in flames.

==Journey to the Shenandoah Valley==
In 1712 von Graffenried contracted French-Canadian guide and surveyor [[Martin Chartier]] to take him to [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Maryland)|Sugarloaf Mountain]]&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; and then to the [[Shenandoah Valley]], where they visited [[Massanutten Mountain]], the supposed site of [[silver ore]] which the baron hoped to mine, however they found no evidence of any ore.&lt;ref&gt;''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography,'' The Virginia Historical Society, Vol. XXX, December, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Worb, Graffenried-Scheibe 1730.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|Memorial window in Worb Church]]
Having lost his fortune, von Graffenried returned penniless in 1714 to Worb, Switzerland. He sold his part in Carolina to Thomas Pollock for 800 pounds. Von Graffenried soon wrote a book entitled ''Relation of My American Project''. In it, he included several documents, among them a letter written to the governor of Carolina and a layout of the settlement of [[New Bern]].

{{quote|In 1731, after the death of a brother, the Oberherr von Worb, [Christoph's father] Anton secured and sold to Christoph the management of the estate which went with the office, reserving for himself the revenues of the office. The management of the estate was not very lucrative, but the father thought he had made a rather generous expiation for his previous treatment. Next, when Anton became Mayor of Murton he wanted a representative in Iverton; and although Christoph did not relish the place, still to please his wife he ran for it and was elected. In 1730 at Anton's death the estate of Worb came to Christoph without encumbrance, and he held it till 1740, when he retired in favor of his sons. Three years later he died and was buried in the choir of the Church at Worb, ending a life the last years of which, while uneventful, were not unpleasant.|width=85%}}

==Personal life==
On 25 April 1684 von Graffenried married Regina Tscharner (1665–1731). Tscharner also came from an accomplished and respected family, her father, Beat Ludwig, having been a member of the Assembly and her grandfather, Samuel, having been the Governor and Mayor of [[Chillon]]. The von Graffenrieds had four sons and seven daughters. In 1702, von Graffenried acquired the office of Governor of [[Yverdon-les-Bains|Yverdon]].

He left SFI in the late 1990s, and abandoned his work on artificial life, publishing no research since that time.

Langton is the first-born son of [[Jane Langton]], author of books including the ''Homer Kelly Mysteries''. He has two adult sons: Gabe and Colin.

==Artificial life==

Langton made numerous contributions to the field of artificial life, both in terms of simulation and computational models of given problems and to philosophical issues. He early identified the problems of information, computation and reproduction as intrinsically connected with complexity and its basic laws. Inspired by ideas coming from physics, particularly phase transitions, he developed several key concepts and quantitative measures for [[cellular automata]] and suggested that critical points separating order from disorder could play a very important role in shaping complex systems, particularly in biology. These ideas were also explored simultaneously, albeit with different approximations, by [[James P. Crutchfield]] and [[Per Bak]] among others.

While a graduate student at the [[University of Michigan]], Langton created the [[Langton's ant|Langton ant]] and [[Langton's loops|Langton loop]], both simple artificial life simulations, in addition to his Lambda parameter, a dimensionless measure of complexity and computation potential in [[cellular automata]], given by a chosen state divided by all the possible states. For a 2-state, 1-r neighborhood, 1D cellular automata the value is close to 0.5. For a 2-state, [[Moore neighborhood]], 2D cellular automata, like [[Conways Life|Conway's Life]], the value is 0.273.

===General===
The ''Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention'' states, "For several methodological reasons&amp;nbsp;– nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others&amp;nbsp;– it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S.

Gay men were close to two times (1.7) more likely to require medical attention and 16 times more likely to suffer injury as compared to individuals who did not identify as gay men.&lt;ref&gt; "Who is Doing What to Whom? Determining the Core Aggressor in Relationships Where Domestic Violence Exists." National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. https://www.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/who_is_doing_what_to_whom.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of the literature found that rates of domestic violence among same-sex couples are similar to or greater than opposite-sexed couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stiles-Shields |first1=C |last2=Carroll |first2=RA |title=Same-Sex Domestic Violence: Prevalence, Unique Aspects, and Clinical Implications. |journal=Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy |date=2015 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=636-48 |doi=10.1080/0092623X.2014.958792 |pmid=25189218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a 2010 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) study, reporting on domestic violence in the U.S., 26% of gay men said that they experienced [[physical violence]], [[stalking]], or [[rape]] by their partners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Walters, Mikel L., Jieru Chen, and Matthew J. Breiding. "The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 findings on victimization by sexual orientation." Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 648, no. 73 (2013): 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 29% of heterosexual men reported similar violence in the same study.

The CDC also stated that 40% of lesbian women reported physical violence by their partners, and 44% reported experiencing physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. In contrast, 35% of heterosexual women reported physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners in the same study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender female couples, researchers found that internalized homophobia and discrimination were correlated with IPV.&lt;ref&gt;[[cite url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research done on psychological aggression of lesbian relationships, researchers found that internalized homophobia and social constraints in talking with friends about sexual identity issues showed correlation with IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0361684313517866 | volume=38 | title=Sexual Minority Stressors and Psychological Aggression in Lesbian Women’s Intimate Relationships | year=2014 | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | pages=535–550 | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Robin J. | last2 = Milletich | first2 = Robert J. | last3 = Derlega | first3 = Valerian J. | last4 = Padilla | first4 = Miguel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender male couples, SES, attachment orientation, HIV status, and public outness, and internalized homophobia showed relationship with intimate partner violence in gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1891/0886-6708.23.3.344 | volume=23 | title=Correlates of Partner Abuse in Male Same-Sex Relationships | year=2008 | journal=Violence and Victims | pages=344–360 | last1 = Bartholomew | first1 = Kim | last2 = Regan | first2 = Katherine V. | last3 = Oram | first3 = Doug | last4 = White | first4 = Monica A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study conducted on the predictors of IPA of gay men found a correlation between public outness, alcohol consumption, and internalized homophobia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10896-014-9620-7 | volume=29 | title=Predictors of Women’s Same-Sex Partner Violence Perpetration | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Family Violence | pages=653–664 | last1 = Milletich | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Gumienny | first2 = Leslie A. | last3 = Kelley | first3 = Michelle L. | last4 = D'Lima | first4 = Gabrielle M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bisexual===
Although [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, they are often victims of domestic violence. The CDC reported that 61% of bisexual women said they experienced physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For men in the same study, 37% reported having experienced similar violence.

For both men and women, the percentage of bisexual people who have experienced domestic violence is higher than either gay men or lesbians. The high rate of domestic violence faced by bisexual people may be in part because of the [[Biphobia|specific challenges bisexual people face]] in receiving help, as bisexuality is often misunderstood, even by those who administer domestic violence help professionally.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Transgender===
[[Transgender]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, but they experience high rates of domestic violence. Comparatively, little research has been conducted on domestic violence towards transgender individuals, especially within the context of romantic relationships. In a 2009 United States study, 56% to 66% of transgender individuals reported experiencing violence within their homes, though not necessarily by a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stotzer | first1 = Rebecca L | year = 2009 | title = Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 170–179 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences and factors ==

=== Legal issues ===
Members of same-sex relationships who face domestic violence often have issues accessing legal recourse, as domestic violence laws are often drafted in such a way as to only include different sex partnerships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some are worried about being involved in the legal system because they are afraid they will be mistreated or dismissed due to their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Although often the abuser can still be arrested or tried for [[assault]] or similar crimes, not classifying the crime as domestic may change how it is dealt with in the court system and change how the victim is treated. Also, studies have shown that law enforcement officers do not treat domestic violence in same-sex relationships as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Victims of domestic violence in same sex relationships do have legal rights afforded to them in some U.S. states, whether or not they are married to their partner, although the requirements and protections vary by state.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Some of these rights include having a [[Injunction|civil protection order]] or [[restraining order]] placed on the abuser to keep them from stalking or harassing the victim.

Some cities and states in the U.S. are working to improve the legal situation for LGBT victims of domestic violence, through policy change and police training.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] the city has created an LGBT unit of their police department to combat [[Violence against LGBT people|homophobic violence]] and to deal with [[Transphobia|violence against transgender people]] by professionals who are also members of the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/page/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-liaison-unit-lgbtlu|title=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Liaison Unit (LGBTLU) {{!}} mpdc|website=mpdc.dc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/496404041/for-d-c-s-lgbt-community-a-police-liaison-who-can-relate|title=For D.C.'s LGBT Community, A Police Liaison Who Can Relate|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===
[[File:Minnesota AIDS Project - HIV Stigma Stops Here - Twin Cities Pride Parade (9180874836).jpg|thumb|People carry a banner promoting the end of HIV stigma at a [[Pride parade|Pride Parade]]]]

[[HIV/AIDS]] may create additional problems for those in violent relationships, financially, emotionally, and health wise, whether it is the perpetrator or the victim who is living with HIV or AIDS.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncavp.org/issues/DomesticViolence.aspx|title=NCAVP :: Issues :: Domestic Violence|website=www.ncavp.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specifically affects those in same-sex relationships because [[men who have sex with men]], no matter how they identity, are significantly more likely to have HIV or AIDS than others.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations/men-sex-men|title=Men who have sex with men, HIV and AIDS {{!}} AVERT|website=www.avert.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those living with HIV are often financially dependent on their partners, making it more difficult to leave abusive relationships.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS the abuser may take control of their finances in order to have even more control over their life.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This issue is compounded by the fact that those living with HIV or AIDS may often become too sick to work and support themselves, and that even when they are able to work they often face [[discrimination]] in the workplace or in the hiring process, even though this is technically illegal under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/hiv-aids-and-employment-discrimination|title=HIV &amp; AIDS and Employment Discrimination {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abusers may use emotional tactics to exert control over their partners, whether it is them or the victim who has HIV or AIDS.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Some abusive partners may threaten to reveal their partner's positive [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV status]] to others as a form of control, as there is a [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS]] that could affect a victim's life.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; If it is the abuser who has HIV or AIDS, the victim may fear that leaving someone who is sick makes them seem shallow, uncaring, or discriminatory, or the abuser may insinuate that if their partner leaves the relationship the abuser will become sicker as a result.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Oppositionally, if it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS, the abuser may imply that the victim will be unable to find another partner due to their positive HIV status or that they will die alone.The abuser may also claim that it is the victim's fault that the abuser has HIV or AIDS, essentially [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally blackmailing]] them to stay in the relationship.

There are many health related ways that HIV or AIDS can affect domestic violence in same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Some perpetrators of domestic violence purposefully try to transmit [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]] to their partner or to transmit their partner's STD to themselves, as a tactic to control their partner. Additionally, many people in same-sex relationships who experienced domestic violence experienced violence specifically because they had asked their partners to use [[condom]]s or other [[prophylactics]], which are known to limit the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In conjunction with this, abusers may tamper with their partner's [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] medications that prevent the spread of HIV, or may use the social [[Slut-shaming|stigma surrounding the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis]] to convince their partner not to use it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calabrese|first=Sarah K.|last2=Underhill|first2=Kristen|date=2016-10-26|title=How Stigma Surrounding the Use of HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis Undermines Prevention and Pleasure: A Call to Destigmatize "Truvada Whores"|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=105|issue=10|pages=1960–1964|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302816|issn=0090-0036|pmc=4566537|pmid=26270298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Tim|title=Mediated Intimacies: Raw Sex, Truvada, &amp; the Biopolitics of Chemoprophylaxis|url=https://www.academia.edu/19691468/Mediated_Intimacies_Raw_Sex_Truvada_and_the_Biopolitics_of_Chemoprophylaxis|journal=Sexualities|publication-date=February 2015|volume=18|pages=224–246|doi=10.1177/1363460715569137|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuser may also tamper with their partner's or their own [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV medication]], or keep their partner from receiving health care in other ways.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Furthermore, those with HIV or AIDS may be more affected by physical violence than those who are healthy, as their [[immune system]]s are weak and physical injuries will be harder to recover from. Those living with HIV or AIDS may also be more affected by [[emotional trauma]] for the same reason.

=== Homophobia ===
Homophobia plays a role in causing domestic violence in same-sex relationships as well as being a systemic issue as to why victims of same-sex domestic violence lack access to resources.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One way this occurs is through the fear of being "[[Outing|outed]]," as abusers may use this fear of being outed to control their partners or an abuser may use the fact that they are not out to limit their partner's exposure to other LGBT people who would recognize that their relationship is unhealthy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/domestic_violence1/publications/ABA_LGBT-rights_Final.authcheckdam.pdf|title=What Rights Do I Have As An LGBT Victim of Domestic Violence?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.americanbar.org|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Another way homophobia plays a role in domestic violence is that people in same-sex relationships may feel that they have a duty to represent the LGBT community in a positive manner, and that if their relationship is abusive it is proof that homosexuality is inherently wrong, immoral, or otherwise flawed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Further, the abuser may frame the abuse as justified because of the victim's [[Sexual orientation]], or imply that no one will help the victim because of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/lgbt-abuse/|title=The National Domestic Violence Hotline {{!}}   LGBTQ Abuse|website=www.thehotline.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a systematic level, many resources offered to victims of domestic violence are not offered to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. This refusal to help victims of same-sex domestic violence victims occurs both by private domestic violence help centers and by law enforcement, who may not treat same-sex domestic violence as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gendered expectations ===
Historically, domestic violence was viewed by many [[Feminism|feminists]] as "a manifestation of patriarchal power."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This definition saw domestic violence as a phenomenon acted out by men onto women, therefore leaving out [[Domestic violence against men|male victims of domestic violence]] and victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. Some abusers even capitalize on the idea that domestic violence cannot occur in same-sex relationships to convince their partner that the abuse is normal or non-abusive.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

One idea that persists and is harmful to lesbians, is that sexual assault is less serious or aggressive when perpetrated by women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, being sexually assaulted can be traumatic to victims regardless of the gender of the perpetrator. Similarly, women stalking other women or men seem as less threatening than the same actions being perpetrated by men, so lesbian victims of stalking may be ignored by law enforcement and other individuals.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Part of this problem that specifically impacts lesbians is that lesbians are assumed to have perfect relationships specifically because there is no man involved in the situation. This idea of a "lesbian utopia" makes it more difficult for lesbians to report domestic violence, because often people don't believe it can be true.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Gay men may feel that being battered is a threat to their [[masculinity]], and thus are hesitant to report domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some abusers may frame the abuse as simply an "expression of masculinity," which normalizes the physical violence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Data collection issues ===
There are several problems with data collection about domestic violence in same-sex relationships, including lack of reporting, biased sampling, and lack of interest in studying same-sex domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, if samples are taken at a center that caters to LGBT individuals, the results may be unregularly high, as those who use these services may also be those in need of help, or unregularly low, as abusers often limit their partner's exposure to others, especially those who may recognize their relationship as abusive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

[[File:Edwin Lankester.jpg|thumb|Edwin Lankester]]
'''Edwin Lankester''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Royal Microscopical Society|FRMS]], [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] (23 April 1814 – 30 October 1874) was an English surgeon and naturalist who made a major contribution to the control of [[cholera]] in London: he was the first public analyst in England.

== Life ==
Edwin Lankester was born in 1814 in Melton, near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in Suffolk, to 'poor but clever parents' according to his son [[E. Ray Lankester]] (Lester 1995). His father was a builder.

Edwin married [[Phebe Lankester|Phebe Pope]] in 1845, daughter of a former mill-owner. She was 19 at the time of marriage, became a botanist and microscopist, published books for children and wrote natural history articles. They had a total of eleven children of whom eight survived – four boys and four girls. [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] became a close friend of the family, and visited often. [[John Stevens Henslow]], Darwin's tutor, was also a family friend. A born teacher, he introduced Edwin's son Ray to the delights of fossil collecting. Through his association with East Suffolk and his friendship with Henslow, Lankester became an early and active Honorary Member of the [[Ipswich Museum]], of which his son Ray Lankester was afterwards President (1901–1929).&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Plunkett, 'Ipswich Museum Moralities in the 1840s and 1850s', in C. Harper-Bill et al. (eds), ''East Anglia's History: Essays in Honour of Norman Scarfe'' (Boydell press with Centre of East Anglian Studies, Woodbridge 2002), 309–331.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. B. Ford]], the ecological geneticist, said of Edwin: 
"Lankester was a close personal friend of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s and was so deeply impressed by him that he was determined that one of his sons should become a great biologist, He named all three of his sons suitably: Forbes, [[Ray Lankester|Ray]] and Owen!" (p.&amp;nbsp;338 in Mayr and Provine). 
But, alas for this excellent story, Edwin had another son, his second, whom he named Rushton. Rushton emigrated to [[Java]], married, and raised a family, the only one of Edwin's offspring to do so. The lack of productivity in this otherwise capable family was distinctly unusual at that time.

==Career==
Apprenticed at first to a Mr. Ginney, a surgeon of Woodbridge, in 1832 he became Assistant to Thomas Spurgin of [[Saffron Walden]]. Spurgin raised £300 to enable Edwin to study medicine and science from 1834–7 at the new [[University College London]]. He attended lectures by [[John Lindley]] (botany) and [[Robert Edmund Grant]] (zoology) – to whose post Edwin's eldest son [[E. Ray Lankester]] succeeded in 1875. Grant had been one of Darwin's tutors at Edinburgh. Edwin's friends at UCL included [[William Jenner, 1st Baronet|William Jenner]] and [[William Benjamin Carpenter]].

Edwin could not afford a complete degree course, so qualified as [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] and Licentiate of the [[Society of Apothecaries]]. In 1837 he moved to [[Doncaster]] to become resident medical attendant and science tutor to the Woods family of Campsall Hall, recommended by Lindley. The Woods family were "indifferent to religion and fervent Owenites" as he mentioned in a letter home. [[Robert Owen]] actually visited Campsall Hall, and Lankester described the event in his diary.

In 1839 Lankester left the Woods and travelled to [[Heidelberg]] to take his M.D., which he got in six months. Back in London, he befriended [[Edward Forbes]] and [[Arthur Henfrey (botanist)|Arthur Henfrey]], the botanist. He practised medicine and wrote articles on botany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPublicationSearch.do?id=19454-2&amp;back_page=%2Fipni%2FeditAdvPublicationSearch.do%3Ffind_title%3Dpenny%26find_abbreviation%3D%26output_format%3Dnormal |title=The International Plant Names Index |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; medicine and surgery for the [[Penny Cyclopaedia]]. He contributed to the Biographical Dictionary, and wrote for other journals. As time went by, he became ever more fully absorbed in natural history.

In 1841 his study of sulphur bacteria (then the 'glairine of sulphurous waters') was noteworthy, as was his microscopic examination of [[drinking water]]. His book the ''Aquavivarium'' (1856) had a great vogue. He co-founded the important ''[[Journal of Cell Science|Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science]]'' (QJMS) in 1853, and co-edited it with [[George Busk]], and later with his son Ray. ''Half-hours with the microscope'' (1857) was a best-seller, reprinted until 1918.

Edwin Lankester was President of the [[British Association]] for 25 years, and the founder of the Biological Section of the BA. He was present at the infamous Wilberforce-Huxley encounter in 1860. He was the first Secretary of the [[Ray Society]], with his wife as Assistant Secretary. In 1845 he was President of the [[Royal Microscopical Society]], and that same year he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. Twenty years later he became the first President of the [[Quekett Microscopical Club]].

In addition, Lankester also served as coroner for Central Middlesex, succeeding the first medically qualified coroner to take up the position, Dr [[Thomas Wakley]], in 1862. Dr. Lankester, like his predecessor, contributed greatly to our knowledge on the social problem of [[infanticide]] in nineteenth century Britain by producing a series of 'statistically detailed Annual Reports' on the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Lionel 1986, Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cholera ==
The cause of London's [[cholera]] outbreaks had been identified by [[John Sutherland (physician)|John Sutherland]] (1808–1891) and Dr [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] (1813–1858; author of the famous map of [[Broad Street pump|water pumps]] near [[Broad Street (ward)|Broad Street]]) the matter was not decided until Lankester established a committee to look into the latest outbreak. The Committee's report (1854) had sections written by Snow and the Reverend [[Henry Whitehead (clergyman)|Henry Whitehead]], a local [[curate]]. They reached the conclusion that the outbreak was attributable to the use of impure water from the well in Broad Street.

In 1866, twelve years after the event, Dr. Lankester wrote "''The Board of Guardians met to consult what ought to be done. Of that meeting, the late Dr. Snow demanded an audience. He was admitted and gave it as his opinion that the pump in Broad Street, and that pump alone, was the cause of all the pestilence. He was not believed: not a member of his own profession, not an individual in the parish believed that Snow was right. But the pump was closed nevertheless and the plague was stayed.''"&lt;ref name="ph.ucla.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/removal.html|title=John Snow and the removal of the Broad Street pump handle|last=Frerichs|first=Ralph R.|date=|website=www.ph.ucla.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-05|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lankester later became the first [[Medical Officer of Health]] for the [[St. James's district]], the area where the outbreak occurred. It still took years before the public authorities acted to ensure the purity of water supply; Snow had been dead for over 30 years when the Chief Medical Office of Health at last acknowledged that his work on the transmission of cholera was one of the most significant medical discoveries of the 19th century.

Lankester's interest in this (beyond simple humanity) came through his microscopical examination of water, which is even today one of the standard tests of drinking water quality.

The '''European Neural Network Society''' ('''ENNS''') is an association of scientists, engineers, students, and others seeking to learn about and advance understanding of [[neural network|artificial neural networks]]. Specific areas of interest in this scientific field include modelling of [[behavior]]al and [[brain]] processes, development of neural [[algorithm]]s and applying neural [[computer modeling|modelling]] concepts to problems relevant in many different domains. [[Erkki Oja]] and [[John G. Taylor]] are past ENNS presidents and honorary executive board members. {{as of|2018}} its president is [[Věra Kůrková]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://e-nns.org/current-enns-executive-committee/|title=Current ENNS Executive Committee|publisher=European Neural Network Society|accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year since 1991 ENNS organizes the [[International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks]] (ICANN). The history and the links to past conferences are available at the ENNS web site. This is one of the oldest and best established conferences on the subject, with proceedings published in Springer [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]], see index in DBLP bibliography database.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/icann/&lt;/ref&gt;

As a non-profit organization ENNS promotes scientific activities at European and at the national levels in cooperation with national organizations that focus on neural networks. Every year many stipends to attend ICANN conference are given. ENNS also sponsors other students and have given awards and prizes at co-sponsored events (schools, workshops, conferences and competitions).

The '''[[European Union]]''' (EU) has been called an [[Potential superpowers|emerging superpower]] by scholars and academics like T. R. Reid,&lt;ref&gt;Reid, T. R. (2004) The United States of Europe 305p, ''Penguin Books'' {{ISBN|1-59420-033-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Reding]],&lt;ref name="A.

Others have challenged their views.

==Overview==
Mark Leonard cites several factors: the EU's large population, large economy (the EU has the largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP), low inflation rates, the unpopularity and perceived failure of US foreign policy in recent{{when|date=August 2018}} years. He compares this with the high quality of life (especially when measured in terms such as hours worked per week, health care, social services) of certain EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/in-the-press/europe-new-superpower |title=Europe: the new superpower |publisher=CER |date=February 18, 2005|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McCormick (political scientist)|John McCormick]] believes that the EU has already achieved superpower status, based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence. He argues that the nature of power has changed since the [[Cold War]]-driven definition of superpower was developed, and that military power is no longer essential to great power; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction, and contrasts the threatening [[hard power]] of the United States with the opportunities offered by the soft power wielded by the European Union.&lt;ref name="The European Superpower"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCormick|first=John|title=The European Superpower|isbn=978-1-4039-9846-0|date=November 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parag Khanna]] believes that "Europe is overtaking its rivals to become the world's most successful empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paragkhanna.com/?p=54 |title=The Empire Strikes Back |last=Khanna|first=Parag|publisher=ParagKhanna.com|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parag Khanna |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/02/eu.politics |title=US scholar Parag Khanna on the rise of the new Rome - Europe &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khanna writes that [[South America]], [[East Asia]], and other regions prefer to emulate the "[[European Dream]]" rather than the [[American Dream|American variant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paragkhanna.com/the-empire-strikes-back/|publisher=Parag Khanna|last=Khanna|first=Parag|accessdate=August 2, 2014|title=The Empire Strikes Back}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could possibly be seen in the [[African Union]] and [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]]. Notably, the EU as a whole has some of the world's largest and most influential languages being official within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302063751/http://www.nocturne.ca/nn-worldlanguages.htm|url=http://www.nocturne.ca/nn-worldlanguages.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2010|title=Languages of the world|work=Nocturne |accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Reding also takes the [[Future enlargement of the European Union|future EU enlargement]] into account. An eventual future accession of the rest of [[Europe]], the whole of [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]], would not only boost the [[economy of the EU]], but it would also increase the EU's population to about 800 million, which he considers almost equal to that of [[India]] or [[China]]. The EU is qualitatively different from India and China since it is enormously more prosperous and technologically advanced.&lt;ref name="A. R." /&gt; Turkish PM [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] said in 2005: "In 10 or 15 years, the EU will be a place where civilizations meet. It will be a superpower with the inclusion of Turkey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/11977/-eu-will-be-super-power-with-turkey-.html |publisher=''Turkish Weekly''|title=’EU will be Super Power with Turkey’|date=June 4, 2005|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert J. Guttman wrote in 2001 that the very definition of the term superpower has changed and in the 21st century, it does not only refer to states with military power, but also to groups such as the European Union, with strong market economics, young, highly educated workers savvy in high technology, and a global vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbi7eVIcyD4C&amp;dq=Europe+emerging+superpower&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QxLIyJCn7Q&amp;sig=MVdQdAbG6-3ee0A5-UjCEbNNpEE&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=wBgUSuf7CJmv-AbooqioDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PPP1,M1 |title=Europe in the New Century: Visions of an Emerging Superpower |publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friis Arne Petersen]], the Danish ambassador to the US, has expressed similar views. He conceded that the EU is a "special kind of superpower," one that has yet to establish a unified military force that exerts itself even close to the same level as many of its individual members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalatlanta.com/article/16908/danish-envoy-economic-strength-makes-eu-a-rising-superpower/ |title=Danish Envoy: Economic Strength Makes EU a 'Rising Superpower |work=Globalatlanta|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is argued by commentators that full political integration is not required for the European Union to wield international influence: that its apparent weaknesses constitute its real strengths (as of its low profile diplomacy and the emphasis on the rule of law)&lt;ref name="The European Superpower"/&gt; and that the EU represents a new and potentially more successful type of international actor than traditional ones;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyde-Price|first=Adrian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326212441/http://www.arena.uio.no/cidel/WorkshopOsloSecurity/Hyde-Price.pdf|archivedate=March 26, 2009|date=October 23, 2004|url=http://www.arena.uio.no/cidel/WorkshopOsloSecurity/Hyde-Price.pdf|title=The EU, Power and Coercion: From 'Civilian' to 'Civilising' Power|publisher=ARENA Centre for European Studies|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is uncertain if the effectiveness of such an influence would be equal to that of a more politically integrated union of states such as the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17726 |title=Europe vs. America by Tony Judt &amp;#124; The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Buzan notes that the EU's potential superpower status depends on its "stateness". It is unclear though how much state-like quality is needed for the EU to be described as a superpower. Buzan states that the EU is unlikely to remain a potential superpower for a long time because although it has material wealth, its "political weakness and its erratic and difficult course of internal political development, particularly as regards a common foreign and defence policy" constrains it from being a superpower.&lt;ref name="The United States and the Great Powers"&gt;{{cite book | last =Buzan | first =Barry | coauthors = | title=The United States and the Great Powers | publisher=Polity Press | year=2004 | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom | page =70 | isbn =0-7456-3375-7 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Stubb]], the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]], has said that he thinks the EU is both a superpower and not a superpower. While the EU is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest [[political union]], [[single market]] and aid donor in the world, it is not a superpower in the defense or foreign policy spheres. Like Barry Buzan, Alexander Stubb thinks that the most major factor constraining the EU's rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system, other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide, and continued preference for the sovereign nation-state among some [[Europe]]ans. To counterbalance these, he urged the EU leaders to approve and ratify the [[Lisbon Treaty]] (which they did in 2009), create an EU foreign ministry ([[EEAS]], established in 2010), develop a [[Military of the European Union|common EU defense]], hold one collective seat at the [[UN Security Council]] and [[G8]], and address what he described as the "sour mood" toward the EU prevalent in some European countries today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/0717carnegie-stubb.pdf |publisher=Carnegie Endowment|title=Will the EU Ever Become a Superpower? |format=PDF |date=July 17, 2008 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrary views==
{{worldwide|date=November 2018}}
Some do not believe that the EU will achieve superpower status. "The EU is not and never will be a superpower" according to the former UK [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] [[David Miliband]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gees.org/documentos/Documen-02639.pdf |title=(FCO) Europe 2030: Model power not Superpower - Bruges Speech by the Rt Hon David Miliband MP Foreign Secretary |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726024647/http://www.gees.org/documentos/Documen-02639.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EU parliamentarian Ilka Schroeder argues that conflicts such as the Israeli–Palestinian dispute see close EU involvement largely to compensate for European inability to project military power internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stahl|first=Julie|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/1238927/ |title=Europe Wants to Rival US as Military Superpower, Says EU Parliamentarian|publisher=Crosswalk.com |date=January 2, 2004|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'''s [[Robert Lane Greene]] notes that the lack of a strong European military only exacerbates the lack of unified EU foreign policy and discounts any EU arguments towards superpower status, noting especially that the EU's creation of a global response force rivaling the superpower's (United States of America) is "unthinkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/173-sovereign/30500.html |title=EU Constitution: A 'Superpower Europe' It Won't Be |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2003-07-18 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The biggest barrier to European superpowerdom is that European elites refuse to bring their postmodern fantasies about the illegitimacy of military 'hard power' into line with the way the rest of the world interprets reality" according to Soren Kern of Strategic Studies Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Communities-and-Partners/Partner-Network/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=51949 |title=So Europe wants to be a superpower |work=isn.ethz.ch |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's [[Michael Howard]] has warned against the "worry" that many Europeans are pushing for greater EU integration to counterbalance the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4020973.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Howard warning on EU 'superpower' | date=November 17, 2004| accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Europe's total reliance on soft (non-military) power is in part because of its lack of a "shared identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/pdin_monitor_article/the_european_union_a_quiet_superpower_or_a_relic_of_the_past |title=The European Union, a "Quiet Superpower" or a Relic of the Past &amp;#124; USC Center on Public Diplomacy |publisher=Uscpublicdiplomacy.org |date=March 25, 2007|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While to some the European Union should be a "model power" unafraid of using military force and backing free trade, its military shortcomings argue against superpower status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7097162.stm |title=Miliband EU speech in full |publisher=BBC News |date=November 15, 2007|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Osborne]], the British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the time, has also pointed to what he saw as an economic crisis of the European Union. In 2014, Osborne said: "The biggest economic risk facing Europe doesn't come from those who want reform and re-negotiation. It comes from a failure to reform and renegotiate. It is the status quo which condemns the people of Europe to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing decline." Osborne also said that the EU is facing growing competition with global economic powers like China, India and the US, and the European Union should "reform or decline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10572725/George-Osborne-lectures-the-EU-on-reform.html |title=George Osborne lectures the EU on reform |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= January 14, 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2014 |location=London |first=James |last=Kirkup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/EU-falling-behind-India-China-British-finance-minister/articleshow/28839348.cms |title=EU falling behind India, China: British finance minister |publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|date=January 15, 2014 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Osborn |first=Andrew |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-britain-eu-osborne-idUSBREA0F05020140116 |title=Reform or lose us as member, Britain's finance minister tells EU |publisher=Reuters |date= January 16, 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing of the death of Osores and the temporary appointment of Álava, the [[Viceroy of Peru]], [[Diego Fernández de Córdoba, Marquis of Guadalcázar]] decided to replace him with his nephew [[Luis Fernández de Córdoba y Arce]], hoping that he would have occasion to display his military skills in the [[War of Arauco]]. Córdoba replaced Álava in May 1625.

'''Frederick''' '''Charles''' "'''Freddy'''" '''Krueger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|uː|ɡ|ər}}) is a character from the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]]. He first appeared in [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984) as a burnt [[serial killer]] who uses a gloved hand with razors to kill his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well. In the dream world, he is a powerful force and almost completely invulnerable. However, whenever Freddy is pulled into the real world, he has normal human vulnerabilities.

Krueger was created by [[Wes Craven]] and had been consistently portrayed by [[Robert Englund]] since his first appearance. In the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|2010 franchise reboot]], he was portrayed by [[Jackie Earle Haley]]. In 2011, Freddy appeared as a playable character in the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/freddy-krueger-joins-mortal-kombat/1100-6324731/|title=Freddy Krueger joins Mortal Kombat|last=|first=|date=|website=GameSpot|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the series, Freddy has battled numerous survivors including [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wes Craven: The Art of Horror|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=McFarland|year=2004|isbn=0786419237|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (comics)|''Nightmares on Elm Street'' comics]], a popular alias is used, known as The Springwood Slasher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/a-nightmare-on-elm-street/250046/nightmare-on-elm-street-comics-a-nightmarish-history-lesson|title=Nightmare on Elm Street Comics: A Nightmarish History Lesson|last=Jasper|first=Gavin|date=October 31, 2015|website=Den of Geek!|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freddy is a ''tantabus'' ([[latin]]: nightmare) [[demon]] who attacks his victims from within their dreams. He is commonly identified by his burned, disfigured face, red-and-green striped sweater, brown [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]], and [[trademark look|trademark]] metal-clawed brown leather glove only on his right hand. This glove was the product of Krueger's own imagination, the blades having been welded by himself. Robert Englund has said many times that he feels the character represents neglect, particularly that suffered by children. The character also more broadly represents subconscious fears.

[[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]] rated Freddy the 14th greatest villain,&lt;ref&gt;''Wizard'' #177&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom|British]] television channel [[Sky2]] listed him 8th,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatthehellis.com/Freddy_Krueger |title=What the hell is/Freddy Krueger |publisher=Whatthehellis.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Film Institute]] ranked him 40th on its "[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains]]" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/afi100heroesvilla.html |title=100 Greatest Heroes and Villains - AFI |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Freddy won an award for Best Villain (formerly Most Vile Villain) at the [[Scream Awards]].

==Appearances==

===Film===
Freddy is introduced in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' as a child killer who is eventually captured, but is let off due to a [[technicality]] (the search warrant wasn't signed in the right place). He is hunted down by a mob of angry parents and cornered in a boiler room where he used to take his victims. The mob douses the building with gasoline and sets it on fire, burning Krueger alive. While his body dies, his spirit lives on in the dreams of a group of teenagers living in his old neighborhood, whom he preys on by entering their dreams and killing them. He is apparently destroyed at the end of the film by protagonist [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]], but the last scene reveals that he has survived. He goes on to antagonize the teenage protagonists of the next five films in the series.

In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', more of Freddy's backstory is revealed by the mysterious nun who repeatedly appears to Dr. Gordon. Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, was a nurse at the asylum featured in the film. At the time she worked there, a largely abandoned, run-down wing of the asylum was used to lock up entire hordes of the most insane criminals all at once. When Amanda was young, she was accidentally locked into the room with the criminals over a holiday weekend. They managed to keep her hidden for days, raping her repeatedly. When she was finally discovered, she was barely alive and was pregnant with the future Freddy Krueger. Later, in ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'', reveals that Krueger has a daughter, Katherine, who seeks to end her father's horrific legacy once and for all.

After a hiatus after the release of ''The Final Nightmare'', Krueger was brought back in ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]'' by [[Wes Craven]], who had not worked on the film series since the third film, ''Dream Warriors''. Robert Englund, who portrayed Krueger throughout the film series and its television spin-off, also took the role as a fictional version of himself in ''New Nightmare''; it is implied that Englund was stalked by his character, who is an ancient demonic entity that took on the form of Wes Craven's creation, and has come to life from the film franchise's fictitious world. Englund describes to his former co-star and friend [[Heather Langenkamp]] that this embodiment of Freddy is being darker and more evil than he portrayed in their films; he struggles to keep his sanity intact from Krueger's torments, and goes into hiding with his family. Krueger sees Langenkanp as his primary foe as the result of her character Nancy Thompson who was the first to defeat him, and his attempts to crossover to reality causes a series of earthquakes throughout [[Los Angeles County]]. After Langenkamp succeeds in defeating the entity and apparently destroys him, however it is referred by Krueger's creator that it is imprisoned to the fictitious world over again.

In 2003, Freddy battled fellow horror icon [[Jason Voorhees]] from [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|the ''Friday the 13th'' film series]] in the theatrical release ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', a film which officially resurrected both characters from their respective deaths and subsequently sent them to Hell. The ending of the film is left ambiguous as to whether or not Freddy is actually dead; despite being decapitated, as a head he looks back and winks at the viewers. A sequel featuring [[Ash Williams]] from ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|The Evil Dead]]'' franchise was planned, but never materialized onscreen. It was later turned into Dynamite Entertainment's comic book series ''[[Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash]]''.

In the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|2010 remake of the original film]], it is suggested that Freddy is a [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] who had sexually abused the teenage protagonists of the film when they were young children. When their parents found out, they trapped him in a building and set it on fire, killing him. As a spirit, he took his revenge on the teenagers by haunting their dreams for alerting their parents.

===Television===
Robert Englund continued his role as Krueger on October 9, 1988, in the television anthology series, ''[[Freddy's Nightmares]]''. The show was hosted by Freddy, who did not take direct part in most of the episodes, but he did show up occasionally to influence the plot of particular episodes. Further, a consistent theme in each episode was characters having disturbing dreams. The series ran for two seasons, [[List of Freddy's Nightmares episodes|44 episodes]], ending March 10, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvaddicts.tv/movie/drama/Freddys_Nightmares.html|title=Freddy's Nightmares DVD|publisher=TV Addicts|accessdate=2008-02-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020043453/http://www.tvaddicts.tv/movie/drama/Freddys_Nightmares.html  |archivedate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the episodes did not feature Freddy taking a major role in the plot, the pilot episode, "No More, Mr. Nice Guy", depicts the events of his trial, and his subsequent death at the hands of the parents of Elm Street after his [[acquittal]]. In "No More, Mr. Nice Guy", though Freddy's case seems open and shut, a mistrial is declared based on the arresting officer, Lt. Tim Blocker, not reading Krueger his [[Miranda rights]], which is different from the original ''Nightmare'' that stated he was released because someone forgot to sign a search warrant in the right place. The episode also reveals that Krueger used an [[ice cream van]] to lure children close enough so that he could kidnap and kill them. After the town's parents burn Freddy to death he returns to haunt Blocker in his dreams. Freddy gets his revenge when Blocker is put to sleep at the dentist's office, and Freddy shows up and kills him.&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/freddy-pilot/|title="No More Mr. Nice Guy" summary|publisher=I-Mockery.com|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode "Sister's Keeper" was a "sequel" to this episode, even though it was the seventh episode of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/freddys-nightmares/show/1394/episode.html|title=''Freddy's Nightmares'' episode guide|publisher=[[TV.com]]|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode follows Krueger as he terrorizes the Blocker twins, the identical twin daughters of Lt. Tim Blocker, and frames one sister for the other's murder.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; Season two's "It's My Party And You'll Die If I Want You To" featured Freddy attacking a high school [[prom]] date who stood him up twenty years earlier. He got his revenge with his desire being fulfilled in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=It's My Party and You'll Die if I Want You To|series=[[Freddy's Nightmares]]|airdate=1989-12-23|season=2|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character returned to television in an episode of ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' titled "Mister Knifey-Hands" with Englund reprising his role in a cameo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/23/goldbergs-freddy-krueger-robert-englund/|title=Robert Englund to revive Freddy Krueger on 'The Goldbergs'|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Freddy's first video game appearance was in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]'s 1989 game ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (video game)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicgames.about.com/od/consoleandhandheldgames/fr/A-Nightmare-On-Elm-Street-Freddys-Nes-Nightmare.htm |title=A Nightmare on Elm Street for the Nintendo Entertainment System - Freddy's NES Nightmare |publisher=Classicgames.about.com |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was published by [[LJN Toys]] and developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]].

A second game for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[DOS]]-based computers was also released in 1989 released by Monarch Software and developed by [[Westwood Associates]].

Freddy Krueger appeared as a downloadable playable character for [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' (2011)]], with Robert Englund reprising his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/noobde/status/854782385195450369 |title=Ed Boon on Twitter |publisher=Twitter |date=2017-04-19 |accessdate=2017-05-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510005254/https://mobile.twitter.com/noobde/status/854782385195450369 |archivedate=2017-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/robert-englund-too-old-for-freddy-krueger/ |title=ROBERT ENGLUND SAYS HE’S TOO OLD TO PLAY FREDDY KRUEGER AGAIN |publisher=ScreenCrush |date=2017-10-23 |accessdate=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has become the second non-''Mortal Kombat'' character to appear in the game with the other being [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] from the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series (who was an exclusive character for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] versions, while Freddy was available across all versions of the game). &lt;!-- The following is per the in-game biography. --&gt;The game depicts Krueger as a malevolent spirit inhibating the Dream Realm who attacks [[Shao Kahn]] for "stealing" the souls of his potential victims. During the fight, he is pulled into the game's fictional depiction of the real world. The injured Krueger arms himself with two razor claws to continue to battle Kahn. Upon defeating him, Krueger is sent back to the Dream Realm by [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 and updates|Nightwolf]], where he continues to haunt the dreams of his human prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaSBkBDcepM |title=Mortal Kombat: Freddy Krueger DLC Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[PlayStation.Blog]], ''Mortal Kombat'' co-creator [[Ed Boon]] cited the character's violent nature and iconic status as reasoning for the inclusion in the game, "Over the years, we’ve certainly had a number of conversations about guest characters. At one point, we had a conversation about having a group — imagine Freddy, [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]], [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], [[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]''. We never got a grip on how we would do it, whether they’d be DLC characters or what. We also wanted to introduce a character who was unexpected. This DLC thing opens the doors to realizing these ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/07/22/ed-boon-talks-freddy-krueger-in-mortal-kombat-secret-origins-of-dlc-characters/ |title= Krueger in Mortal Kombat, Secret Origins of DLC Characters |publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krueger went on to become playable in the mobile edition of the game's sequel, ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'', alongside Jason from ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/203016/grab-clawed-gloves-freddy-krueger-joins-mortal-kombat-x/ |title= Grab Your Clawed Gloves!

In October 2017, Krueger was released as a downloadable playable character in the seventh chapter of the [[Asymmetric video game|asymmetric]] [[survival horror]] game ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'', alongside [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Quentin Smith|Quentin Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadbydaylight.com/chapter7/|title=Chapter 7 - A Nightmare on Elm Street|accessdate=2017-10-26|publisher=Dead by Daylight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the chapter are set immediately following [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)#Plot|Nancy Holbrook's&lt;!-- NOT Nancy Thompson --&gt; escape]] from Krueger, after which he targets Quentin Smith as revenge for aiding her. Invading Smith's dreams, he forces him to go to the Badham Preschool, where the two are unwittingly taken to the universe of ''Dead by Daylight'' by an unseen force.&lt;ref name="DBDManual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadbydaylight.com/manual/killers/#freddy|title=Dead by Daylight: Manual|publisher=Dead by Daylight|accessdate=2017-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928103108/http://www.deadbydaylight.com/manual/killers/#freddy|archivedate=2017-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Six Flags Fright Fest ===
At [[Six Flags St Louis]]' Fright Fest event (then known as Fright Nights), Krueger was the main character for the event's first year in 1988. He reappeared in his own haunted house, Freddy's Nightmare: The Haunted House on Elm Street, for the following two years.

===Halloween Horror Nights===
Freddy Krueger appeared alongside Jason Voorhees and Leatherface as minor icons during [[Halloween Horror Nights]] 17 and [[Freddy vs. Jason|again with Jason]] during Halloween Horror Nights 25 at [[Universal Orlando Resort]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]. In 2016, Freddy Krueger returned to Halloween Horror Nights, along with Jason, in [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Hollywood]].

==Characterization==
Wes Craven said his inspiration for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Rockoff|first = Adam|title = Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978 to 1986|publisher = McFarland &amp; Company|date = April 2002|isbn = 0-7864-1227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a [[child molestation|child molester]], which Craven said was the "worst thing" he could think of. The decision was made to instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of [[Day care sex abuse hysteria|highly publicized child molestation cases]] in [[California]] around the time ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' went into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Robb|first = Brian|title = Screams and Nightmares: The Films of Wes Craven|publisher = Overlook TP|date = 2000-10-31|isbn = 1-58567-090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured [[homeless]] man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s [[pop music|pop]] song "[[Dream Weaver (song)|Dream Weaver]]" by [[Gary Wright]]. In an interview, he said, "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone."&lt;ref&gt;Wes Craven. ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' DVD audio commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freddy's back story is revealed gradually throughout the series. In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', the protagonists learn that Freddy's mother, [[Amanda Krueger]], was a nun who worked in Westin Hills mental hospital caring for the inmates. Freddy was conceived when she was accidentally locked inside over the Christmas holiday and [[gang-rape]]d by a group of the inmates, thus making him "the bastard son of 100 maniacs". ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' depicts Freddy's traumatic childhood; he displayed sociopathic behavior at a young age and was often teased by classmates. He was adopted as a child by an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholic]] named Mr. Underwood, who teaches him how to [[zoosadism|torture animals]] and [[self-harm|inflict pain on himself]]. Freddy eventually murders him, with no apparent consequences, and becomes a serial killer.

In ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]'', Freddy is characterized as a symbol of something powerful and ancient, and is given more stature and muscles.&lt;ref&gt;''New Nightmare'' commentary with [[Wes Craven]]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the six movies before it, ''New Nightmare'' shows Freddy as closer to what Wes Craven originally intended, toning down his comedic side while strengthening the more menacing aspects of his character.

Throughout the series, Freddy's potential victims often experience dreams of young children, [[skipping rope|jumping rope]] and chanting a rhyme to the tune of "[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]" with the lyrics changed to "One, Two, Freddy's coming for you", often as an omen to Freddy's presence or a precursor to his attacks.

In the 2010 remake of ''[[A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare On Elm Street]]'', [[Jackie Earle Haley]] portrayed Freddy Krueger. In the film, Krueger is depicted as a [[child abuse]]r who worked as a gardener at a local preschool. Unlike in the original version of events, where he was a known child-killer who evaded conviction on a technicality, in this version of events there was actually ambiguity about Kruger's guilt or innocence apart from the testimony of his victims, until the now-grown survivors find the room where Krueger molested them while searching for evidence.

===Appearance===
[[File:KruegerSweatshirt.jpg|thumb|upright|Freddy Krueger sweatshirt from ''The Dream Master'', fourth film in the series]]
Freddy Krueger's physical appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor changes were made in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his [[#clawed glove|bladed glove]], loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn [[work boots]], in keeping with his blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a [[waiter]] or wearing a [[Superman]] inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a [[video game]] sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant [[snake]]-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|hookah smoking caterpillar]] (Freddy vs. Jason).

In ''New Nightmare'', Freddy's appearance is updated considerably, giving him a green fedora that matched his sweater stripes, skin-tight [[leather]] pants, knee-high black boots, a [[turtleneck]] version of his [[trademark look|trademark]] sweater, a black [[trench coat]], and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer burns on his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, this Freddy's injuries are more like those of an actual burn victim. For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the burns on his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed facial tissue on the left cheek, more reminiscent of actual [[third degree burns]] than in the original series.

===Bladed Glove===
[[File:FreddyKruegerClaw.jpg|thumb|upright|Freddy Krueger "Dream Master" claw used in the 4th installment of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'']]
[[Wes Craven]] stated that part of the inspiration for Freddy's infamous bladed glove was from his [[cat]], as he watched it claw the side of his couch one night.&lt;ref name=Claw&gt;[http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewstheglove.html Nightmare Companion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131222736/http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewstheglove.html |date=2009-01-31 }} Freddy's claw&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview he said, "Part of it was an objective goal to make the character memorable, since it seems that every character that has been successful has had some kind of unique weapon, whether it be a [[Leatherface|chain saw]] or a [[Jason Voorhees|machete]], etc. I was also looking for a primal fear which is embedded in the subconscious of people of all cultures. One of those is the fear of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a [[saber-toothed tiger]] reaching with its tremendous hooks. I transposed this into a human hand. The original script had the blades being fishing knives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewswes.html Nightmare on Elm Street companion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006054224/http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/nightmareinterviewswes.html |date=2009-10-06 }} Wes Craven interview&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jim Doyle, the creator of Freddy's claw, asked [[Wes Craven|Craven]] what he wanted, Craven responded, "It's kind of like really long fingernails, I want the glove to look like something that someone could make who has the skills of a boilermaker."&lt;ref name="Claw"/&gt; Doyle explained, "Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking steak knife, we thought that this looked really cool, we thought it would look even cooler if we turned it over and used it upside down. We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because we were actually using the knife upside down." Later Doyle had three duplicates of the glove made, two of which were used as stunt gloves in long shots.&lt;ref name=Claw/&gt;

For ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'', Lou Carlucci, the effects coordinator, remodeled Freddy's glove for a more "organic look". He says, "I did the original glove on the first ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street|Nightmare]]'' and we deliberately made that rough and primitive looking, like something that would be constructed in somebody's home workshop. Since this is supposed to be a new look for Freddy, Craven and everybody involved decided that the glove should be different. This hand has more muscle and bone texture to it, the blades are shinier and in one case, are retractable. Everything about this glove has a much cleaner look to it, it's more a natural part of his hand than a glove." The new glove has five claws.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|2010 remake]], the glove is redesigned as a metal [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] with four finger bars, but it is patterned after its original design.

Freddy's glove appeared in the 1987 horror-comedy ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' above the door on the inside of a toolshed. This was [[Sam Raimi]]'s response to Wes Craven showing footage of ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', which in turn was a response to Sam Raimi putting a poster of Craven's 1977 film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' in ''[[The Evil Dead]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The glove also appears in the 1998 horror-comedy ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' in an evidence locker room that also contains the remains of the film's villain [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]], the [[chainsaw]] of [[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', and the masks of [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] from ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' and [[Jason Voorhees]] from ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]''.

At the end of the film ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]'', the mask of the title character, [[Jason Voorhees]], played by [[Kane Hodder]], is dragged under the earth by Freddy's gloved hand, thus setting up ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]''. Freddy's gloved hand, in the ending, was played by Hodder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horrorconventions.co.uk/kane-hodder/|title=Kane Hodder|publisher=HorrorConventions.co.uk|accessdate=2016-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508163040/http://horrorconventions.co.uk/kane-hodder/|archive-date=2016-05-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular cloning]] and [[biology]], a '''knock-in''' (or '''gene knock-in''') refers to a [[genetic engineering]] method that involves the one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information in a genetic locus or the insertion of sequence information not found within the locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Greg|title=A Primer Of Genome Science 3rd ed.|year=2009|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-87893-236-8|pages=301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this is done in mice since the technology for this process is more refined and there is a high degree of shared sequence complexity between mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome|journal = Nature|date = 2002-12-05|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 12466850|pages = 520–562|volume = 420|issue = 6915|doi = 10.1038/nature01262|last = Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium|first2 = Robert H.|last2 = Waterston|first3 = Kerstin|last3 = Lindblad-Toh|first4 = Ewan|last4 = Birney|first5 = Jane|last5 = Rogers|first6 = Josep F.|last6 = Abril|first7 = Pankaj|last7 = Agarwal|first8 = Richa|last8 = Agarwala|first9 = Rachel|last9 = Ainscough}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between knock-in technology and traditional [[transgenic]] techniques is that a knock-in involves a gene inserted into a specific locus, and is thus a "targeted" insertion.

A common use of knock-in technology is for the creation of disease models. It is a technique by which scientific investigators may study the function of the regulatory machinery (e.g. [[promoter (biology)|promoters]]) that governs the expression of the natural gene being replaced. This is accomplished by observing the new phenotype of the organism in question. The [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|BACs]] and [[Yeast artificial chromosome|YACs]] are used in this case so that large fragments can be transferred.

== Technique ==
Gene knock-in originated as a slight modification of the original knockout technique developed by Martin Evans, Oliver Smithies, and Mario Capecchi. Traditionally, knock-in techniques have relied on homologous recombination to drive targeted gene replacement, although other methods using a transposon-mediated system to insert the target gene have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westphal|first=C. H.|last2=Leder|first2=P.|date=1997-07-01|title=Transposon-generated 'knock-out' and 'knock-in' gene-targeting constructs for use in mice|journal=Current Biology|volume=7|issue=7|pages=530–533|issn=0960-9822|pmid=9210379|doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(06)00224-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''loxP'' flanking sites that become excised upon expression of Cre recombinase with gene vectors is an example of this. Embryonic stem cells with the modification of interest are then implanted into a viable blastocyst, which will grow into a mature chimeric mouse with some cells having the original blastocyst cell genetic information and other cells having the modifications introduced to the embryonic stem cells. Subsequent offspring of the chimeric mouse will then have the gene knock-in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gene knock-in has allowed, for the first time, hypothesis-driven studies on gene modifications and resultant phenotypes. Mutations in the human p53 gene, for example, can be induced by exposure to benzo(a)pyrene and the mutated copy of the p53 gene can be inserted into mouse genomes. Lung tumors observed in the knock-in mice offer support for the hypothesis of BaP’s carcinogenicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhipei|last2=Muehlbauer|first2=Karl-Rudolf|last3=Schmeiser|first3=Heinz H.|last4=Hergenhahn|first4=Manfred|last5=Belharazem|first5=Djeda|last6=Hollstein|first6=Monica C.|date=2005-04-01|title=p53 mutations in benzo(a)pyrene-exposed human p53 knock-in murine fibroblasts correlate with p53 mutations in human lung tumors|journal=Cancer Research|volume=65|issue=7|pages=2583–2587|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3675|issn=0008-5472|pmid=15805253}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent developments in knock-in technique have allowed for pigs to have a gene for green fluorescent protein inserted with a [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] system, which allows for much more accurate and successful gene insertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruan|first=Jinxue|last2=Li|first2=Hegang|last3=Xu|first3=Kui|last4=Wu|first4=Tianwen|last5=Wei|first5=Jingliang|last6=Zhou|first6=Rong|last7=Liu|first7=Zhiguo|last8=Mu|first8=Yulian|last9=Yang|first9=Shulin|date=2015-09-18|title=Highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgene knockin at the H11 locus in pigs|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14253|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=5|pages=14253|doi=10.1038/srep14253|pmc=4585612|pmid=26381350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knock-in also allows for biallelic modifications to some genes to be generated and the phenotype in mice observed in a single generation, an unprecedented timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yanliang|last2=Li|first2=Junhong|last3=Xiang|first3=Jinzhu|last4=Wen|first4=Bingqiang|last5=Mu|first5=Haiyuan|last6=Zhang|first6=Wei|last7=Han|first7=Jianyong|date=2015-12-10|title=Highly efficient generation of biallelic reporter gene knock-in mice via CRISPR-mediated genome editing of ESCs|journal=Protein &amp; Cell|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=152–156|doi=10.1007/s13238-015-0228-3|issn=1674-800X|pmc=4742388|pmid=26661644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus gene knockout ==

Knock-in technology is different from [[Gene knockout|knockout]] technology in that knockout technology aims to either delete part of the DNA sequence or insert irrelevant DNA sequence information to disrupt the expression of a specific genetic locus. Gene knock-in technology, on the other hand, alters the genetic locus of interest via a one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information or by the addition of sequence information that is not found on said genetic locus. A gene knock-in therefore can be seen as a gain of function mutation and a gene knockout a loss of function mutation, but a gene knock-in may also involve the substitution of a functional gene locus for a mutant phenotype that results in some loss of function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Construction of Transgenic and Gene Knockout/Knockin Mouse Models of Human Disease|journal = Transgenic Research|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 0962-8819|pmc = 3516403|pmid = 21800101|pages = 327–349|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s11248-011-9537-3|first = Alfred|last = Doyle|first2 = Michael P.|last2 = McGarry|first3 = Nancy A.|last3 = Lee|first4 = James J.|last4 = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential applications ==

Because of the success of gene knock-in methods thus far, many clinical applications can be envisioned. Knock-in of sections of the human [[immunoglobulin gene]] into mice has already been shown to allow them to produce humanized antibodies that are therapeutically useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ig knock-in mice producing anti-carbohydrate antibodies: breakthrough of B cells producing low affinity anti-self antibodies|journal = Journal of Immunology|date = 2008-03-15|issn = 0022-1767|pmid = 18322191|pages = 3839–3848|volume = 180|issue = 6|first = Lorenzo|last = Benatuil|first2 = Joel|last2 = Kaye|first3 = Nathalie|last3 = Cretin|first4 = Jonathan G.|last4 = Godwin|first5 = Annaiah|last5 = Cariappa|first6 = Shiv|last6 = Pillai|first7 = John|last7 = Iacomini|doi=10.4049/jimmunol.180.6.3839}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be possible to modify [[stem cell]]s in humans to restore targeted gene function in certain tissues, for example possibly correcting the mutant gamma-chain gene of the [[IL-2 receptor]] in hematopoietic stem cells to restore lymphocyte development in people with X-linked [[severe combined immunodeficiency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Knock out, knock in, knock down--genetically manipulated mice and the Nobel Prize|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|date = 2007-12-13|issn = 1533-4406|pmid = 18077807|pages = 2426–2429|volume = 357|issue = 24|doi = 10.1056/NEJMp0707712|first = John P.|last = Manis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

While gene knock-in technology has proven to be a powerful technique for the generation of models of human disease and insight into proteins ''in vivo'', numerous limitations still exist. Many of these are shared with the limitations of knockout technology. First, combinations of knock-in genes lead to growing complexity in the interactions that inserted genes and their products have with other sections of the genome and can therefore lead to more side effects and difficult-to-explain [[phenotype]]s. Also, only a few loci, such as the ROSA26 locus have been characterized well enough where they can be used for conditional gene knock-ins, making combinations of [[reporter gene|reporter]] and transgenes in the same locus problematic. The biggest disadvantage of using gene knock-in for human disease model generation is that mouse physiology is not identical to that of humans and human [[ortholog]]s of proteins expressed in mice will often not wholly reflect the role of a gene in human pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transgenic mouse technology in skin biology: generation of knockin mice|journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|date = 2014-12-01|issn = 1523-1747|pmid = 25381772|pages = 1–3|volume = 134|issue = 12|doi = 10.1038/jid.2014.434|first = Frederik|last = Tellkamp|first2 = Farida|last2 = Benhadou|first3 = Jeroen|last3 = Bremer|first4 = Maria|last4 = Gnarra|first5 = Jana|last5 = Knüver|first6 = Sandra|last6 = Schaffenrath|first7 = Susanne|last7 = Vorhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in mice produced with the [[ΔF508]] fibrosis mutation in the [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR gene]], which accounts for more than 70% of the mutations in this gene for the human population and leads to cystic fibrosis. While ΔF508 CF mice do exhibit the processing defects characteristic of the human mutation, they do not display the pulmonary pathophysiological changes seen in humans and carry virtually no lung phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pathophysiology of Gene-Targeted Mouse Models for Cystic Fibrosis|url = http://physrev.physiology.org/content/79/1/S193|journal = Physiological Reviews|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 0031-9333|pmid = 9922382|pages = S193–S214|volume = 79|issue = 1|language = en|first = Barbara R.|last = Grubb|first2 = Richard C.|last2 = Boucher|doi = 10.1152/physrev.1999.79.1.S193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such problems could be ameliorated by the use of a variety of animal models, and pig models (pig lungs share many biochemical and physiological similarities with human lungs) have been generated in an attempt to better explain the activity of the ΔF508 mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of CFTR-null and CFTR-DeltaF508 heterozygous pigs by adeno-associated virus-mediated gene targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer|journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date = 2008-04-01|issn = 0021-9738|pmc = 2265103|pmid = 18324337|pages = 1571–1577|volume = 118|issue = 4|doi = 10.1172/JCI34773|first = Christopher S.|last = Rogers|first2 = Yanhong|last2 = Hao|first3 = Tatiana|last3 = Rokhlina|first4 = Melissa|last4 = Samuel|first5 = David A.|last5 = Stoltz|first6 = Yuhong|last6 = Li|first7 = Elena|last7 = Petroff|first8 = Daniel W.|last8 = Vermeer|first9 = Amanda C.|last9 = Kabel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glypheoidea''' (containing the '''glypheoid''' lobsters), is a group of [[lobster]]-like [[Decapoda|decapod]] [[crustacean]]s which forms an important part of fossil faunas, such as the [[Solnhofen limestone]]. These fossils included taxa such as ''Glyphea'' (from which the group takes its name), and ''Mecochirus'', mostly with elongated (often semichelate) [[cheliped]]s. This group of decapods is a good example of a [[living fossil]], or a [[lazarus taxon]], since until their discovery in the 1970s, the group was considered to have become [[extinct]] in the [[Eocene]]. The [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] Glypheoidea comprises five families. The two extant species, ''[[Neoglyphea inopinata]]'' and ''Laurentaeglyphea neocaledonica'', are both in the Glypheidae.

==Prehistoric abundance==
The first animals attributable to the Glypheoidea appeared in the [[Permian|Permo]]-[[Triassic]]. They were abundant in the [[Jurassic]], but declined from the [[Cretaceous]] to the [[Eocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jacques Forest]] |year=2006 |title=Les glyphéides actuels et leur relation avec les formes fossiles (Decapoda, Reptantia) |language=French |trans-title=The Recent glypheids and their relationship with their fossil relatives (Decapoda, Reptantia) |journal=[[Crustaceana]] |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=769–793 |doi=10.1163/156854006778008212 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/15941/15941.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Jacques Forest]] |year=2006 |title=The Recent glypheids and their relationship with their fossil relatives (Decapoda, Reptantia) |journal=[[Crustaceana]] |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=795–820 |doi=10.1163/156854006778008221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extant taxa==
The Glypheoidea was originally considered to be a purely fossil group. That opinion had to be altered when a single male specimen was discovered in the collections of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1975. It had been caught off the [[Philippines]] in 1908 and preserved, without its full significance being realised. Over sixty years later, the specimen was rediscovered, and described by two French scientists as a new genus and species, ''[[Neoglyphea inopinata]]'' in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Forest |author2=M. de Saint Laurent |year=1975 |title=Présence dans la faune actuelle d'un représentant du groupe mésozoïque des Glyphéides: ''Neoglyphea inopinata'' gen. nov., sp. nov. (Crustacea Decapoda Glypheidae) |journal=[[Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série D]] |volume=281 |pages=155–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "unexpected new  ''Glyphea''". More individuals were caught on subsequent expeditions in 1976, 1980 and 1985, allowing for a complete description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.

'''Hammerhead''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and a member of [[organized crime]] who exists in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]].

He is closely associated with the "Hammerhead Family", a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime family. Hammerhead distinguishes himself from other villains in that he dresses up and acts somewhat like a gangster from the 1920s. Due to an injury he suffered, much of his skull was replaced with an unbendable steel alloy by [[Jonas Harrow]], giving his head a flattened shape.

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=October 2018}}
Hammerhead made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #113, and was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 63|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Gerry Conway made his first major contribution to the Spider-Man saga...a new mobster was on the rise in New York's underworld - Hammerhead.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway recalled that Hammerhead "was most directly influenced by the [[Frederick Foswell|Big Man]] and the Crime-Master, who were among the first villains in ''Amazing Spider-Man''. One of the more interesting things [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]], [[Jack Kirby]], and, of course, [[Steve Ditko]] did was combining the two different kinds of milieus: superhero and ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', with the unusual criminal characters who had some kind of physical deformity. ... Plus, Hammerhead - I liked [the] name, and John Romita came up with an interesting look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 7|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Hammerhead's family immigrated from the Soviet Union to Italy when he was a child. He got help from a man named The General. His father ran a garage in Toirrano, where he insisted the young man speak only in Russian, beating him severely with a mallet when he would not. Though not much is known about his life before he became an evil criminal and supervillain, he is known to have a sister.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

All the while, Hammerhead dreamed of becoming a gangster. He is eventually recruited into one of the "families" of the criminal organization known as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] when a member oversees Hammerhead murdering a childhood bully and his girlfriend in a theater showing ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Originally a small-time hitman, Hammerhead quickly rises through the ranks of the Maggia, while hiding the fact that he is actually Russian so he can be "made". In his final test, Hammerhead is brought to his father's garage (with the Maggia apparently unaware of their relationship), where he proceeds to kill his father, while telling him in Russian that he does not truly hate him, and that he made him (Hammerhead) this way.&lt;ref name="Extra #1"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man EXTRA!'' #1 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

One day, Hammerhead was found beaten, disfigured, and delirious with pain in an alley in New York City's [[Bowery]] by [[Jonas Harrow]], a surgeon who had lost his medical license due to his illegal experiments. Seeing the opportunity both to save this man's life and to redeem his reputation, Harrow operated on the gunman for three days, replacing much of his shattered skull with a strong steel alloy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 18 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the surgery, the unconscious thug fixated on the only memory he retained: an image of a poster for a movie called "The [[Al Capone]] Mob", which was hanging in the alley where he lay beaten and bloodied before Harrow found him. When he recovered, the memory of the poster and its images of 1930s-era gangsters prompted Hammerhead to start a gang of his own in the style of Capone and other mobsters of the 1920s. He even dressed as if he were living in that decade. Later on,{{issue|date=December 2015}} Hammerhead's entire skull was replaced with or reinforced with some type of nearly unbreakable metal (possibly [[vibranium]] or secondary [[adamantium]]).{{issue|date=December 2017}}

A gang war broke out between Hammerhead's mob and [[Doctor Octopus]]'s criminal organization. Hammerhead was forced to flee the country due to [[Spider-Man]]'s interference.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #113-115&lt;/ref&gt; He later had a rematch with Doctor Octopus next to an atomic breeder reactor on a remote Canadian island which caused a chain reaction, blasting Hammerhead "out of phase" with this dimension.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, he appeared as an immaterial ghost-like being to haunt Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus then unwittingly restored Hammerhead to his material form. Hammerhead kidnapped Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]], who was then rescued by Spider-Man as Doctor Octopus caused Hammerhead's helicopter to plummet into the Hudson River.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerhead then proposed that all Maggia "families" unite under his leadership. Wearing a strength-enhancing exoskeleton, he battled the [[Human Torch]] who then fused the exoskeleton's power pack.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #233&lt;/ref&gt; Hammerhead was nearly assassinated by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s Arranger during a gang war. Hammerhead was forced out of a major role in New York City organized crime by the Kingpin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #284-288&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerhead then allied himself with the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in the latter's bid to become the new crime lord of New York City. The two served as partners in a splinter group of the Maggia.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #51&lt;/ref&gt; Hammerhead hired [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] as a bodyguard and hitman.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #157&lt;/ref&gt; He hired the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] to kill [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]], who posed a threat to Tombstone; the assassination attempt failed.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #161&lt;/ref&gt; Hammerhead was kidnapped and beaten by Tombstone, who had gained superhuman powers and resented Hammerhead for not sending him to kill Joe Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' #68&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerhead later attended a Las Vegas crime conference to divide the resources left by the Kingpin's downfall at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #307-309; ''Nomad'' #4-6; ''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' #46-48&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he participates in a multi-sided gang-war focused on the Kingpin's attempt to re-take New York City for his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Made Men'' #1 (August 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerhead is a major player in underworld activities in the Marvel Universe and is highly sought after for elimination by the [[Punisher]]. He is currently one of several gang warlords struggling to control the criminal underworld in the major cities of the Eastern United States. During one of the first meetings of such warlords, Hammerhead was almost killed by the Strucker twins [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]]. This meeting was being manipulated by [[Baron Von Strucker]], the head of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. When [[Don Fortunato]] made a bid for control of the New York underworld, Hammerhead opposed him and was almost killed as a result. When every other crime lord surrendered to Fortunato and his HYDRA allies, Hammerhead went rogue, launching a raid on Fortunato's home and successfully fighting off a HYDRA attack on his own headquarters. He did have assistance from Spider-Man and [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]], however. For a time, the hero known as [[S.H.O.C.]] also assists Hammerhead. Later he was hired by [[Norman Osborn]] to be a part of the [[Sinister Twelve]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

During the events of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Hammerhead used the vacuum left by the incarceration of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to gain a greater foothold in the ranks of organized crime, attempting to organize an army of costumed villains (consisting of the [[Ani-Men]] V, [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] I, Aura, [[Bloodshed (comics)|Bloodshed]], [[Clown (comics)|Clown]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]] III, [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Great Gambonnos]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II, [[Man Mountain Marko]], [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], [[Mindblast]], [[Gregory Herd|Override]], [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], [[Slyde]], [[Trapster]], and [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will O' The Wisp]]) to enforce his new criminal empire. When Slyde balked at the idea, Hammerhead had [[Underworld (comics)|Underworld]] kill him to serve as a warning to anyone who did not join up with him. The Kingpin manipulated various hero factions, most notably [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Iron Man]] into breaking up Hammerhead's first convening of his army. During the conflict, Hammerhead was shot numerous times by Underworld, who was revealed to be working for Kingpin. Underworld later confronted Hammerhead while he lay in prison. Underworld then shot Hammerhead at point-blank range with adamantium bullets.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1 (February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bullets, while not penetrating his skull, did cause severe trauma to his brain, resulting him in needing surgery, but the hospital he was brought to was unable to treat him. In mid-surgery however, men working for [[Mister Negative]] came in, killed the hospital staff, and took Hammerhead away. Mister Negative then has his surgeon Doctor Tramma revive Hammerhead and offers to transplant his brain into a new robotic adamantium skeleton, which Hammerhead agrees to.&lt;ref name="Extra #1"/&gt;

The operation is a complete success, and Hammerhead is restored to full mobility without any ill effects. He swears loyalty to Mister Negative in exchange for his restored life, and proceeds to shape a gang of lowlife thugs into an effective army for his benefactor. He then proceeds to battle Spider-Man, besting him with no effort for the first time in years. Later, he has a rematch with Spider-Man, with Spider-Man dislocating Hammerhead's hip bone.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #575&lt;/ref&gt;

Mister Negative sends Hammerhead to help Spider-Man (who Mister Negative corrupted) take down the Hood, who launches an attack on Negative's headquarters. He blackmails H.A.M.M.E.R. director [[Norman Osborn]] into forcing the Hood to pull out of Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: Mister Negative'' #2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammerhead later begins to doubt his loyalty to Mister Negative when Silvermane appears to return.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Unknown to Hammerhead, it is actually an android controlled by [[Mysterio]] to plant seeds of rebellion. Nevertheless, he flees a shootout with the Maggia when the Silvermane robot calls him a traitor. It is shown that Mister Negative had a computer chip put in Hammerhead's head to deliver an electroshock when necessary, which he promptly uses to punish him and remind him who is in charge.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Hammerhead and Mister Negative are among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team, promising them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside his nephew and minions, Hammerhead formed an alliance with [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] where he sided with her gang.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Hammerhead has no superhuman abilities, yet his skull is now surgically reinforced with vibranium (or secondary adamantium), making his head flat on top; with this, he can charge and break through objects such as brick walls without causing any pain or damage to himself. This metal can absorb physical impacts that would otherwise fracture human bone. Hammerhead is in peak physical condition comparable to that of an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athlete. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant whose most dangerous tactic is charging head first like a bull toward an opponent. Hammerhead once utilized a strength-enhancing exoskeleton designed by the [[Tinkerer]].

After an assassin's adamantium bullet penetrated a part of his head not protected by his adamantium skull, Hammerhead is surgically rebuilt by [[Mister Negative]]. Breakout surgeries replace the upper half of his skeleton with an adamantium endo-skeleton (the skeleton is shown to have a network of hydraulic servomechanisms). The upper portion of his body is now superhumanly strong as a result of the additional hidden cybernetic musculature, making him able to effortlessly beat a superpowered foe such as Spider-Man. Mister Negative does not use on Hammerhead the same [[Lord Dark Wind]] bonding process, used on the similarly empowered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] for coating their bones in adamantium: instead he replaces Hammerhead's bones with replicas fashioned in the invulnerable metal. It is still unknown how his artificial skeleton can carry on biological functions.

The intervention of Mr. Negative also radically changed Hammerhead's personality. Hammerhead now recalls his life as Russian immigrant prior to the accident in which he adopted the 1920s gangster persona. Consequently, Hammerhead no longer speaks like a 1920s movie gangster, but instead behaves as a typical modern Russian mobster and hitman, as this was apparently his original personality prior to his head injury.

Hammerhead is highly skilled in the organization, concealment, and management of criminal enterprises. He is an effective hitman, a skilled marksman (his preferred weapon was the [[Thompson submachine gun]]), and an excellent street fighter. In his original incarnation, Hammerhead was able to hold his own against Spider-Man despite being an ordinary human by using his superhumanly durable skull as a blunt instrument. After his recent augmentation, he is now capable of grappling with and physically overpowering Spider-Man to the extent that he could eventually crush his foe.

* Hammerhead appeared in the 1980s ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[William Boyett]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Hammerhead was said to maintain crime in the mid-west. In the episode "Wrath of the Sub-Mariner", he alongside Silvermane (and his henchman Man Mountain Marko) and Caesar Cicero meet with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] when his scientist Dr. Everett has created a dissolving fluid. He is webbed up by [[Spider-Man]].
* Hammerhead appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Nicky Blair (actor)|Nicky Blair]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In this version, his head is laced with [[adamantium]]. He first appeared in the "Insidious Six" two-parter as one of [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]]'s loyal henchmen and amongst the other crime lords against the Kingpin. He was hired by Silvermane that since the Kingpin failed to kill Spider-Man, he was supposed to have the Kingpin killed. But the Kingpin used the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]], the team that failed to kill Spider-Man but managed to successfully kidnap Silvermane, however, Silvermane escaped thanks to Spider-Man. Later, Silvermane hired Hammerhead again to steal the Tablet of Time so Silvermane can get his own restored youth, as the Tablet of Time's ability was to restore youth into elderly people like Silvermane. But when Hammerhead failed due to the arrival of Spider-Man, Silvermane was enraged by Hammerhead's failure and fired him, telling him that someone new and better will be hired on his place. As a result, Hammerhead started working for the Kingpin. After [[Alistair Smythe]] (Kingpin's right-hand man) stole the Tablet of Time from Dr. Curt Connors and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] (Silvermane's new hired man) had kidnapped Connors, Hammerhead figured out Tombstone had also kidnapped [[Vanessa Fisk]] even though the Kingpin didn't know about it until Silvermane sent a note, telling about the hostage. So Hammerhead kidnapped [[Alisha Silver (comics)|Alisha Silver]] (Silvermane's daughter) before the Kingpin knew about Vanessa's kidnapping, and the Kingpin was pleased about Hammerhead's work. When Silvermane then figured out Hammerhead's betrayal and kidnapped Alisha, Silvermane and the Kingpin organized a meeting that Alistair's robot and Spider-Man had intervened. Hammerhead tried to re-kidnap Alicia but the helicopter he was kidnapping Alisha in was out of control and landed on a roof. Spider-Man then arrived and defeated Hammerhead, but Alicia then used a stun-blaster on Spider-Man, knocking out and kidnapping Spider-Man. Alistair then used his own robot again to steal the Tablet of Time from Silvermane (as Tombstone had stolen the Tablet of Time and kidnapped Dr. Conners and his wife) but when the robot was defeated, the Kingpin sent Hammerhead to retrieve the Tablet of Time. While Spider-Man was dealing with the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], Silvermane, Tombstone and Alicia, Hammerhead slipped by and stole the Tablet of Time with the good guys thinking it was destroyed in the explosion of Silvermane's building, as Alicia wanted this process to come because Alisha blamed everyone against her about her father becoming a baby (as Silvermane actually overused the Tablet of Time) and tried to kill them by blowing the building up with them inside, though all of them escaped. After Vanessa left him because of his life of crime, the Kingpin thanked Hammerhead for successfully taking the Tablet of Time but told him to get rid of it, as it has led to the destruction of his relationship with his wife. Hammerhead did do as what the Kingpin told him to - by selling it to [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes]] for the villain to put his own plans into action by the two-part second-season finale.
* Hammerhead appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This incarnation is much less belligerent and more cool-headed and intelligent than he was portrayed in the original animated series. He also uses [[brass knuckles]] as weapons unlike other interpretations of the character, but retains his usual strength. His hair also is presented as being parted and joining at his forehead, as opposed to the other versions of the character, and lacks a vest under his jacket. An enforcer of the Big Man of Crime, he acts on his boss's behalf call out various forces to take out Spider-Man; first the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], then giving [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] some equipment, and finally contacting [[Norman Osborn]] to make supervillains to distract Spider-Man from the Big Man's operations. He bails Flint Marko and Alex O'Hirn out of jail only to subject the two to [[Oscorp]]'s illegal experiments that turn the criminals into the supervillains [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. Hammerhead later speaks with Osborn about the Green Goblin's interference. Hammerhead ends up kidnapped by the Goblin but is rescued by Spider-Man and the Big Man. He's later seen helping the [[Sinister Six]] and the Enforcers break out of jail and employing Sandman to steal a large oil tanker for profit. Prior to being the Big Man's henchman, Hammerhead once worked for Silvermane, and was in a romantic relationship with his ex-boss's daughter [[Silver Sable]]. He represents the Big Man in a bid organized by Oscorp to sell a chip that could produce Rhino soldiers. When Silver Sable shows to the meeting, he resents Silver Sable and tries to outbid Silver Sable only to be beaten by [[Roderick Kingsley]]. Hammerhead goes after Kingsley and Sable. But when Spider-Man and Rhino interfere, he reluctantly teams up with his ex-lover to fight Spider-Man and Rhino. He escapes police custody. Hammerhead becomes angered when the Big Man contacts the Enforcers directly and without his help. The Big Man stating being fed up with all of Hammerhead's various failures, from supervillains' creations, to the Sandman oil tanker fiasco, and the Rhino chip failure. When Hammerhead contacts Osborn in creating yet another supervillain, Osborn gives him advice that inspires him to betray the Big Man, starting by sabotaging the Enforcers' escape from the police. Hammerhead later secretly calls a Valentine's Day meeting between the Big Man, [[Doctor Octopus]] and Silvermane. There, he betrays everyone all by attacking Silver Sable and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and framing this on his boss, causing the crime lords to fight against one other. He is fired after the Big Man gets arrested. It is later revealed that Hamerhead's actions were encouraged and manipulated by the Goblin using Hammerhead to take down the Big Man.
* A [[Marvel Noir]] version of Hammerhead appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six]]'', voiced by [[Jon Polito]] in one of his final works before the actor's passing.&lt;ref name="Return to the Spider-Verse Pt. 3"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Return to the Spider-Verse Pt. 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=18|airdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is a gang rival of [[Hulk (comics)|Joe Fixit]]. He was behind a building fire that Fixit tried to hold up while the people inside were being evacuated at the cost of [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s life which [[Spider-Man Noir]] blames Fixit for. In the episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" [Pt. 3], Spider-Man and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Kid Arachnid]] arrive in the Noir universe, finding Hammerhead's war with Fixit as Spider-Man Noir prevents any interference. When Martin Li gets hold of Hammerhead's [[Siege Perilous]] fragment, [[Mister Negative]] transmutates Hammerhead into stone and takes over his gang. After Mister Negative's defeat, Hammerhead and everyone else that were petrified were restored to normal.
* Hammerhead appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sandman|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=6|airdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is shown to have hired Flint Marko and [[Blizzard (comics)#Randy Macklin|Randy Macklin]] as minions. In the episode "Sandman", a flashback had Hammerhead burying Flint Marko under a combination of toxic waste and sand for failing him for the last time. As a result of unknowingly mutating Flint Marko, he also mutated his daughter [[List of Marvel Comics characters: A#Keemia Alvarado|Keemia]] who was caught in the accident upon stumbling upon the scene of the accident. After figuring out how to stabilize Keemia, Hammerhead and his gang took Keemia in. When Spider-Man and Sandman arrived at Hammerhead's mansion, they are attacked by a bitter Keemia and Hammerhead's minions where Spider-Man webbed up Hammerhead and his minions. After Keemia and Sandman disappeared into the night, Hammerhead and his minions were arrested by the police. In the episode "Spider-Man on Ice", Hammerhead became displeased with Randy Macklin's status when Macklin shows up and freezes Hammerhead and his henchmen for not taking his Blizzard status seriously. As Randy Macklin goes on an icy rampage, Spider-Man has Harry Osborn alert the police to use every silver in Hammerhead's hideout to defrost Hammerhead and his henchmen. In the episode "How I Thwipped My Summer Vacation," Hammerhead has a son named Tully (voiced by [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]) who has his birthday party that involved Hammerhead's men kidnapping singer Ross Caliban. While Spider-Man defeated Hammerhead and this thugs, Tully went on the attack until Ross convinced Tully to take a selfie with him in exchange for ending his attack on Spider-Man.

He worked as a circus freak as the "Human Bulldozer", before being recruited by [[Norman Osborn]] and taking the new name "Hammerhead", despite his 6th grade education. He is sent to New Jersey to retrieve one of the fragments of the Tablet of Order and Chaos. However, he misuses the fragment to become more powerful and plans to ovethrow Osborn and take over New York's criminal underworld. His regular Thompson 70 machine guns are replaced with a gatling gun and a missile launcher, which are fused to his arms when he uses the power of the fragment. [[Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man]] manages to defeat him and claim the fragment. During the credits, he is shown in prison attempting to emulate his fragment granted powers by tying the twin Tommy guns he wields to his hands with bandages.

After [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] steals his data drives, Hammerhead calls up his goons stating that the drives have trackers and instructs them to find and kill Black Cat. They rigger her penthouse to explode and, despite Spider-Man attempting to save her, she seemingly dies, as Hammerhead watches the explosion from a safe distance before leaving. Hammerhead returns as the main antagonist of the second part of the DLC, "Turf Wars", where he and his gang have stolen numerous [[Silver Sable|Sable]] International weapons and tech to use in a deadly war against the NYPD. Despite Spider-Man's help, Hammerhead manages to escape and kill numerous police officers, which quickly angers captain [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Yuri Watanabe]]. Spider-Man begins to investigate to learn more of Hammerhead's whereabouts and soon finds out he plans to kidnap the Dons of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. Spider-Man tries to stop him, but his goons used the Sable tech to build several drills which they use to kidnap the Dons and later for several assaults against the NYPD as well. Despite Yuri's warnings not to stay in her way, Spider-Man continues the investigation, while also destroying several of Hammerhead's "businesses" and weapon storage. Spider-Man eventually learns of his main event at the Hudson Yards construction site, where Hammerhead plans to kill the Dons of the Maggia Live on television to regain respect and fear. Spider-Man stops him and then confronts Hammerhead, who is wearing a battle armor made of Sable tech called Project Olympus. Spider-Man is able to defeat him, but Yuri then shows up and immobilizes Spider-Man, before vengefully shooting Hammerhead in the head for all the deaths he caused. However, as he is being taken away in an ambulance, one of his men disguised as a police officer manages to knock out the other female police officer and resurrects him with a taser, before driving away with him.

===Theater===
* Hammerhead can be seen in ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. He is seen alongside [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] when Spider-Man foils their bank robbery.

The '''hoatzin''' (''Opisthocomus hoazin''), also known as the '''reptile bird''', '''skunk bird''', '''stinkbird''', or '''[[Canje River|Canje]] pheasant''', is a species of tropical [[bird]] found in swamps, [[riparian]] forests, and [[mangrove]]s of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] and the [[Orinoco Basin|Orinoco basins]] in [[South America]]. It is notable for having chicks that have claws on two of their wing [[digit (anatomy)|digits]].

It is the only member of the [[genus]] '''''Opisthocomus''''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: "wearing long hair behind", referring to its large [[Crest (feathers)|crest]]),&lt;ref name = "HBW"/&gt; which in turn is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] genus in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Opisthocomidae'''. The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] position of this family has been greatly debated, and is still far from clear.

==Description==
[[File:Hoatzin in Peru.jpg|thumb|left|At Lake Sandoval, Peru]] 
The hoatzin is [[pheasant]]-sized, with a total length of {{Convert|65|cm|0}}, and a long neck and small head. It has an unfeathered blue face with [[Maroon (color)|maroon]] eyes, and its head is topped by a spiky, rufous crest. The long, sooty-brown tail is broadly tipped [[Buff (colour)|buff]]. The upperparts are dark, sooty-brown-edged buff on the [[wing covert]]s, and streaked buff on the mantle and nape. The under parts are buff, while the crissum (the undertail [[Covert feather|coverts]] surrounding the [[cloaca]]), [[Flight feather|primaries]], underwing coverts and flanks are rich rufous-[[Chestnut (colour)|chestnut]], but this is mainly visible when it opens its wings. 
The hoatzin is an [[herbivore]], eating leaves and fruit, and has an unusual digestive system with an enlarged [[crop (anatomy)#Birds|crop]] used for fermentation of vegetable matter, in a manner broadly analogous to the digestive system of mammalian [[ruminants]]. The alternative name of "stinkbird" is derived from the bird's foul odour, which is caused by the fermentation of food in its digestive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = DK Eyewitness Books: The Amazon | first = Tom | last = Jackson | year = 2015| publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York, NY, US | page = 21 | isbn = 978-1-4654-3566-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hOjtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a noisy species, with a variety of hoarse [[bird vocalization|calls]], including groans, croaks, hisses and grunts.&lt;ref name = "HBW"&gt;{{cite book | first = B. T. | last = Thomas | editor-last = Josep | editor-first = del Hoyo | editor2-last = Andrew | editor2-first = Jordi | editor3-last = Sargatal | editor3-first = Christie | contribution = Family Opisthocomidae (Hoatzins) | title = [[Handbook of the Birds of the World]].

==Taxonomy, systematics and evolution==
[[File:Hoatzins in Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|In Brazil]] 
The hoatzin was originally described by German zoologist [[Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller|Statius Müller]] in 1776. There has been much debate about the hoatzin's relationships with other birds. Because of its distinctness it has been given its own [[Family (biology)|family]], the Opisthocomidae, and its own [[suborder]], the Opisthocomi. At various times, it has been allied with such [[taxa]] as the [[tinamou]]s, the [[Galliformes]] (gamebirds), the [[rail (bird)|rail]]s, the [[bustard]]s, [[seriema]]s, [[sandgrouse]], [[dove]]s, [[turaco]]s and other [[Cuculiformes]], and [[mousebird]]s.&lt;ref name = "HBW"/&gt; A [[whole genome sequencing]] study published in 2012 places the hoatzin as the sister [[taxon]] of a [[clade]] composed of [[Gruiformes]] (cranes) and [[Charadriiformes]] (plovers).&lt;ref name=Jarvis2014&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jarvis | first1 = E.D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Whole-genome analyses resolve early branches in the tree of life of modern birds | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1320.abstrac÷ | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6215| pages = 1320–1331 | doi=10.1126/science.1253451 | pmid=25504713 | pmc=4405904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, genetic research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prum|first1=Richard O.|last2=Berv|first2=Jacob S.|last3=Dornburg|first3=Alex|last4=Field|first4=Daniel J.|last5=Townsend|first5=Jeffrey P.|last6=Lemmon|first6=Emily Moriarty|last7=Lemmon|first7=Alan R.|title=A comprehensive phylogeny of birds (Aves) using targeted next-generation DNA sequencing|journal=Nature|date=7 October 2015|doi=10.1038/nature15697|volume=526|pages=569–573|pmid=26444237}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that the hoatzin is the last surviving member of a bird line that branched off in its own direction 64 million years ago, shortly after the extinction event that killed the non-avian dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/new-study-rearranges-family-tree-of-birds/ New study rearranges family tree of birds]&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the debate===
{{Confusing|date=January 2014}}
Historical placement as gamebirds is based mainly on [[phenetic]] considerations of external [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], which are considered unreliable and generally dismissed today; the gamebirds together with the [[waterfowl]] are classified as [[Galloanserae]] whereas the hoatzin are not. However, cuckoos have [[Dactyly|zygodactyl]] feet (two toes forward, two backward) and turacos are semi-zygodactylous, whereas the hoatzin has the more typical anisodactyl foot with three toes forward, one backwards. The evolution of avian dactyly, on the other hand, is not entirely resolved to satisfaction.

[[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy|Sibley and Ahlquist]] in 1990 considered it likely to be a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[cuckoo]] based on [[DNA-DNA hybridization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sibley|first= Charles G. |last2= Monroe|first2= Burt L. Jr. |year=1990|title=Distribution and taxonomy of the birds of the world: A Study in Molecular Evolution|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn= 0-300-04969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avise ''et al.'' in 1994 found [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] sequence data to agree with Sibley and Ahlquist's previous treatment. Subsequently, Hughes and Baker in 1999 proclaimed to have "resolved" the relationships of the hoatzin to be with turacos, based on their own analysis of 6 sets of mtDNA and one of [[nDNA]] sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avise|first= John C.|last2= Nelson|first2= William S. |authorlink3=Charles Sibley|last3=Sibley|first3= Charles G.|year=1994|title= Why one kilobase sequences from mitochondrial DNA fail to solve the hoatzin phylogenetic enigma|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|pmid=8075835|volume=3|issue=2|pages= 175–184|doi=10.1006/mpev.1994.1019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first= Janice M. |last2= Baker|first2=Allan J. |year=1999|title=Phylogenetic relationships of the enigmatic hoatzin (''Opisthocomus hoazin'') resolved using mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=16|issue=9|pages=1300–1307|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/9/1300.full.pdf+html |format=PDF|pmid=10486983|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hoatzins.jpg|thumb|left|Group of five in Peru]] 
However, using [[mitochondrial]] and nuclear DNA sequences of increased length, Sorenson ''et al.'' in 2003 noted that all three previous DNA studies were apparently flawed due to errors in methodology, small [[sample size]], and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] errors; their study strongly suggested ''against'' a close relationship between the hoatzin and cuckoos or turacos. It was not possible, though, to reliably determine the hoatzin's closest living relatives. Even though it tended to group with doves, this was not at all well-supported, with little more than 10% [[likelihood]] at best that such an arrangement was accurate according to Sorenson ''et al.''s analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sorenson|first=Michael D.|author2=Oneal, Elen |author3=García-Moreno, Jaime |author4= Mindell, David P.  |year=2003|title=More taxa, more characters: the Hoatzin problem is still unresolved|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|pmid=12777516|volume=20|issue=9|pages=1484–1499|doi=10.1093/molbev/msg157|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/9/1484.pdf |format=PDF}} [http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/20/9/1484/DC1 Supplementary Material]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fain and Houde in 2004 proposed a [[dichotomy]] in the [[Neoaves]] ([[neognath]]s excluding fowl) based on β-[[fibrinogen]] [[intron]] 7 (FGB-int7) sequences. In their suggested phylogeny, the hoatzin was a basal member of the [[Metaves]], a proposed clade that would include many other historically problematic bird families, such as [[flamingo]]s, [[grebe]]s, [[tropicbird]]s, sandgrouse and [[mesite]]s. While the doves did also group with the "Metaves", no close relationship between these and the hoatzin within Metaves was recovered.&lt;ref name="Parallel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fain|first=Matthew G. |last2=Houde|first2=Peter |year=2004|title= Parallel radiations in the primary clades of birds|journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]|volume=58|issue=11|pages=2558–2573|doi=10.1554/04-235|url=http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/~houde/Parallel_radiations.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=15612298 |accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other major neoavian lineage, [[Coronaves]], largely agreed in its internal [[phylogeny]] with what is currently emerging as consensus,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. that there is a major clade of "[[near passerine]]s" and that the [[Charadriiformes]] are quite distinct.&lt;/ref&gt; the interrelationships of the "Metaves" were not resolvable. Nor do supposed metavian groupings like flamingos and [[nightjar]]s or tropicbirds and [[hummingbird]]s seem to have a factual basis rather than being artifactually grouped based on molecular [[homoplasies]] or lack of informative characters within the group, as Fain and Houde originally suggested; Metaves instead may be a "wastebasket taxon".

It seems probable that the taxa included in the Metaves by Fain and Houde contain some good [[clade]]s, such as [[Caprimulgiformes]], the [[Mirandornithes]], or the [[Apodiformes]]. Considering that some "odd [[Gruiformes]]" which might be each other's closest living relatives make up most of the remaining Metaves, the doves, the hoatzin, and sandgrouse would remain as "Metaves ''incerta sedis''" (Metaves with uncertain placement). This would seem to suggest that the hoatzin is at least more closely related to doves than to many of the other purported 'coronavian' families that previously have been suggested.  Subsequent multigene studies of Ericson et al. 2006 and of Hackett et al. 2008 corroborated the Metaves clades, dependent on the inclusion of one and two genes respectively, but the latter did not recover the hoatzin with Metaves.

More recently, Houde embarked on sequencing the entire genome of the hoatzin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/~houde/hoatzin.htm | title = The Hoatzin Genome Project | accessdate = 16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, it was reported that more than 1.4 billion base pairs of hoatzin DNA had been sequenced, roughly equal to its entire haploid genome, but that only about 2.4% of its genome had yet been assembled. Completion of this project would be welcomed for more reasons than resolution of hoatzin relationships.  Out of the diverse Class Aves, the genomes of no more than 4 species of birds including of the waterfowl/fowl and songbirds had been sequenced. Moreover, much might be learned by coordinating these efforts with that of the metagenomic analysis of the hoatzin foregut ruminant bacterial microflora.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jgi.doe.gov/why-sequence-hoatzin-crop-microbiome/ "Why Sequence Hoatzin crop microbiome" US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute web page] Retrieved 2017-Nov-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil record===

With respect to other material evidence, an undisputed [[fossil]] record of a close hoatzin relative is specimen [[UCMP]] 42823, a single [[cranium]] backside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first= Alden H. |year=1953|title= A fossil Hoatzin from the Miocene of Colombia|journal=[[Auk (journal)|Auk]]|volume=70|issue=4|pages=484–495|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v070n04/p0484-p0489.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.2307/4081360}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is of [[Miocene]] origin&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Originally believed to be of Late Miocene age – some 10–5 million years old –, the bone was found in association with fossils of the monkey ''[[Cebupitheca|Cebupitheca sarmientoi]]'' that today, usually is considered of Early or Middle Miocene, possibly 18 but at least some 12 million years of age.&lt;/ref&gt; and was recovered in the upper [[Magdalena River Valley]], [[Colombia]] in the well known fauna of [[La Venta (Colombia)|La Venta]].&lt;ref name="HBW"/&gt; This has been placed into a distinct, less derived genus, ''[[Hoazinoides]]'', but clearly would be placed into the same family as the extant species. It markedly differs insofar as that the cranium of the living hoatzin is characteristic, being much domed, rounded, and shortened, and that these autapomorphies were less pronounced in the Miocene bird. Miller discussed these findings in the light of the supposed affiliation of the hoatzins and the Galliformes, which was the favored hypothesis at that time, but had been controversial almost since its inception. He cautioned, however, "that ''Hoazinoides'' by no means establishes a phyletic junction point with other galliforms." for obvious reasons, as we know today. Anything other than the primary findings of Miller are not to be expected in any case, as by the time of ''Hoazinoides'', essentially all modern bird families are either known or believed to have been present and distinct. Going further back in time, the Late [[Eocene]] or Early [[Oligocene]] (some 34 million years ago) ''[[Filholornis]]'' from [[France]] has also been considered "proof" of a link between the hoatzin and the gamebirds.&lt;ref name = "HBW"/&gt; The fragmentary fossil ''[[Onychopteryx]]'' from the [[Eocene]] of [[Argentina]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the quite complete but no less enigmatic Early-Middle Eocene ([[Ypresian]]-[[Lutetian]], some 48 million years ago) ''[[Foro (bird)|Foro panarium]]'' are sometimes used{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to argue for a hoatzin-cuculiform (including turacos) link. But as demonstrated above, this must be considered highly speculative, if not as badly off the mark as the relationship with [[Cracidae]] discussed by Miller.

The earliest record of the order Opisthocomiformes is ''[[Protoazin|Protoazin parisiensis]]'', from the latest [[Eocene]] (approximately 34 mya) of [[Romainville]], [[France]]. The holotype and only known specimen is [[Naturhistorisches Museum Basel|NMB]] PG.70, consisting of partial [[coracoid]], partial [[scapula]], and partial [[wiktionary:pedal|pedal]] [[phalanx]]. According to the phylogenetic analysis performed by the authors, ''[[Namibiavis]]'', although later, is more basal than ''Protoazin''. Opisthocomiforms seem to have been much more widespread in the past, with the present South American distribution being only a relic. By the Early to Middle Miocene, they were probably extinct in Europe already, as formations dated to this time and representing fluvial or lacustrine palaeoenvironments, in which the hoatzin thrives today, have yielded dozens of bird specimens, but no opisthocomiform. A possible explanation to account for the extinction of ''Protoazin'' between the Late Eocene and the Early Miocene in Europe, and of ''Namibiavis'' after the Middle Miocene of Sub-Saharan Africa is the arrival of arboreal [[carnivora]]ns, predation by which could have had a devastating effect on the local opisthocomiforms, if they were as poor flyers and had similarly vulnerable nesting strategies as today's hoatzins. [[Felidae|Felids]] and [[Viverridae|viverrids]] first arrived in Europe from Asia after the [[Turgai Sea]] closed, marking the [[Grande Coupure|boundary]] between the Eocene and the [[Oligocene]]. None of these predators, and for the matter, no [[placental]] predator at all was present in South America before the [[Great American Interchange]] 3 mya, which could explain the survival of the hoatzin there.&lt;ref name=Protoazins&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014 |title=Earliest and first Northern Hemispheric hoatzin fossils substantiate Old World origin of a "Neotropic endemic" |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=101 |pages= 143–8|doi=10.1007/s00114-014-1144-8|author=Gerald Mayr|author2=Vanesa L. De Pietri |pmid=24441712}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the earliest fossil record of an opisthocomiform, ''Protoazin'' was also the earliest find of one (1912), but it was forgotten for more than a century, being described only in 2014.

''[[Hoazinavis]]'' is an extinct genus of early opisthocomiform from Late Oligocene and Early Miocene (about 24–22 mya) deposits of Brazil. It was collected in 2008 from the Tremembé Formation of São Paulo, Brazil. It was first named by [[Gerald Mayr]], Herculano Alvarenga and Cécile Mourer-Chauviré in 2011 and the type species is ''[[Hoazinavis lacustris]]''.&lt;ref name=Mayr2011&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gerald |last=Mayr|first2=Herculano | last2 = Alvarenga |first3= Cécile |last3=Mourer-Chauviré |year=2011 |title=Out of Africa: Fossils shed light on the origin of the hoatzin, an iconic Neotropic bird |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=98 |issue=11 |pages=961–966 |doi=10.1007/s00114-011-0849-1 |pmid=21964974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Namibiavis]]'' is another extinct genus of early opisthocomoform from early Middle Miocene (approximately 16 mya) deposits of Namibia. It was collected from Arrisdrift, southern Namibia. It was first named by Cécile Mourer-Chauviré in 2003 and the type species is ''[[Namibiavis senutae]]''.&lt;ref name=Mayr2011/&gt;

==Behaviour==

===Feeding===
The hoatzin eats the [[leaves]] and to a lesser degree [[fruit]]s and [[flower]]s of the plants that grow in the marshy and riverine habitats where it lives. It clambers around clumsily among the branches, and being quite tame (though they become stressed by frequent visits), often allows close approach and is reluctant to flush. The hoatzin uses a leathery bump on the bottom of its crop to help balance itself on the branches. Once it was thought that the species could eat the leaves of only  [[Araceae|arums]] and [[Avicennia|mangroves]], but the species is now known to consume the leaves of more than fifty species. One study undertaken in [[Venezuela]] found that the hoatzins diet was 82% leaves, 10% flowers, and 8% fruit.&lt;ref name = "HBW"/&gt; Any feeding of insects or other animal matter is purely accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.245.4923.1236|last=Grajal|first=A.|first2=S. D.|last2= Strahl|first3=R. |last3=Parra|first4=M.

[[File:Rurrenabaque Bolivia - The Amazon.jpg|thumb|left|In flight, Bolivia]] 

One of this species' many peculiarities is that it has a digestive system unique amongst birds. Hoatzins use bacterial [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] in the front part of the gut to break down the vegetable material they consume, much as [[cattle]] and other [[ruminant]]s do. Unlike ruminants, however, which possess the [[rumen]] (a specialized stomach for bacterial fermentation), the hoatzin has an unusually large [[crop (anatomy)|crop]], folded in two chambers, and a large, multi-chambered lower esophagus. Its stomach chamber and gizzard are much smaller than in other birds. The [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] of the hoatzin is so large as to displace the flight muscles and keel of the sternum, much to the detriment of their flight capacity. Because of aromatic compounds in the leaves they consume and the bacterial fermentation,&lt;ref name="Wright2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wright|first1=A.-D. G.|last2= Northwood|first2=K.

===Breeding===

Hoatzins are seasonal breeders, breeding during the [[Wet season|rainy season]], the exact timing of which varies across its range.&lt;ref name ="HBW"/&gt; Hoatzins are gregarious and nest in small [[bird colony|colonies]], laying two or three [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s in a stick nest in a tree hanging over water in seasonally flooded forests. The chicks, which are fed on regurgitated fermented food, have another odd feature; they have two claws on each wing.  Immediately on hatching, they can use these claws, and their oversized feet, to scramble around the tree branches without falling into the water. When predators such as the [[great black hawk]] attack a hoatzin nesting colony, the adults fly noisily about, trying to divert the predator's attention, while the chicks move away from the nest and hide among the thickets.  If discovered, however, they drop into the water and swim under the surface to escape, then later use their clawed wings to climb back to the safety of the nest. This has inevitably led to comparisons to the fossil bird ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', but the characteristic is rather an [[autapomorph]]y, possibly caused by an [[atavism]] toward the [[dinosaur]]ian finger claws, whose [[developmental genetics]] ("blueprint") presumably is still in the avian [[genome]]. Since ''Archaeopteryx'' had three functional claws on each wing, some earlier systematists speculated that the hoatzin was descended from it, because nestling hoatzins have two functional claws on each wing. Modern researchers believe that the young hoatzin's claws are of more recent origin, however, and may be a secondary adaptation from its frequent need to leave the nest and climb about in dense vines and trees well before it can fly.&lt;ref name = "HBW" /&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
Though conspicuous—even attractive—at close range due to its bizarre shape, striking colors, unwariness, and poor flight, it is not considered [[endangered species|endangered]]. In fact, its survival seems to be more assured than that of many other [[endemic (biology)|endemic]]s of its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hoatzin Opisthocomus hoazin|publisher=BirdLife International|url= http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1319|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, indigenous peoples sometimes collect the eggs for food, and the adults are occasionally hunted, but in general this is rare, as it is reputed to have a bad taste.&lt;ref name = "HBW"/&gt; While its preferred habitats, mangrove and riverine forest, are disappearing quickly in some regions, it is less threatened than the [[Amazon rainforest]], which is a primary target for [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation]]. The hoatzin therefore remains fairly common in a large part of its range. The hoatzin is the national bird of [[Guyana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyana.org/Handbook/symbols.html|title=Guyana National Symbols|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''virus''' is a biological agent that [[reproduction|reproduces]] inside the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of living [[Host (biology)|hosts]]. When infected by a virus, a host cell is forced to produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus at an extraordinary rate. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cell.  But unlike [[prion|still simpler infectious agents]], viruses contain [[Introduction to genetics|genes]], which gives them the ability to mutate and evolve.  Over 5,000 species of viruses have been discovered.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-3645-6"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leppard, Keith |author2=Nigel Dimmock |author3=Easton, Andrew |title=Introduction to Modern Virology |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited |year=2007 |page=4 |isbn=978-1-4051-3645-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of viruses are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria.  A virus consists of two or three parts: [[gene]]s, made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry genetic information; a [[protein]] coat that protects the genes; and in some viruses, an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of fat that surrounds the protein coat and is used, in combination with specific receptors, to enter a new host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple [[tobacco mosaic virus|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] to more [[bacteriophage|complex]] structures. Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 [[nanometre]]s; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to {{convert|1|cm}}.

Viruses spread in many ways. Just as many viruses are very specific as to which host species or tissue they attack, each [[species]] of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other [[organism]]s, known as ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s''. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as [[influenza]] are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as [[norovirus]] are transmitted by the [[fecal–oral route|faecal–oral route]], which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. [[Rotavirus]] is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, [[HIV]], is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the [[Dengue virus]], are spread by blood-sucking insects.

Viral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and even plants.  However, they are usually eliminated by the [[immune system]], conferring lifetime [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the host for that virus. [[Antibiotic]]s have no effect on viruses, but [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed to treat life-threatening infections. [[Vaccine]]s that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some viral infections.

{{Main|History of virology}}
[[File:HIV-budding-Color cropped.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron micrograph]] of HIV-1 viruses, coloured green, budding from a [[lymphocyte]]]]

In 1884 the French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented a filter, known today as the [[Chamberland filter]] or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1890s the Russian [[biologist]] [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] used this filter to study what became known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.

At the same time several other scientists proved that, although these agents (later called ''viruses'') were different from bacteria, they could still cause disease, and they were about one hundredth the size of bacteria. In 1899 the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] observed that the agent multiplied only in dividing cells. Having failed to demonstrate its particulate nature, he called it a "''[[contagium vivum fluidum]]''", a "soluble living germ".&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the English [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]] discovered viruses that infect bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 827&lt;/ref&gt; and the French-Canadian microbiologist [[Félix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on [[agar]], would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria. Counting these dead areas allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'herelle | first1 = F | title = On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli: brief note by Mr. F.

With the invention of the [[electron microscope]] in 1931 by the German engineers [[Ernst Ruska]] and [[Max Knoll]] came the first images of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;From ''Nobel Lectures, Physics 1981–1990'', (1993) Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Gösta Ekspång, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 American [[biochemist]] and [[virologist]] [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]] examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it to be mostly made from protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanley | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Loring | first2 = H.S. | year = 1936 | title = The isolation of crystalline tobacco mosaic virus protein from diseased tomato plants | url = | journal = Science | volume = 83 | issue = 2143| page = 85 | pmid = 17756690 | doi = 10.1126/science.83.2143.85 |bibcode = 1936Sci....83...85S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.89.2311.345 | last1 = Stanley | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Lauffer | first2 = M.A. | year = 1939 | title = Disintegration of tobacco mosaic virus in urea solutions | url = | journal = Science | volume = 89 | issue = 2311| pages = 345–347 | pmid = 17788438 |bibcode = 1939Sci....89..345S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A problem for early scientists was that they did not know how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American [[pathologist]] [[Ernest William Goodpasture]] and [[Alice Miles Woodruff]] grew [[influenza]] and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs.&lt;ref name="pmid17810781"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodpasture EW, Woodruff AM, Buddingh GJ | title = The Cultivation Of Vaccine and other Viruses In The Chorioallantoic Membrane of Chick Embryos | journal = Science | volume = 74 | issue = 1919 | pages = 371–2 | date = October 1931 | pmid = 17810781 | doi = 10.1126/science.74.1919.371 | bibcode = 1931Sci....74..371G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when [[John Franklin Enders]], [[Thomas Huckle Weller]] and [[Frederick Chapman Robbins]] grew [[polio virus]] in cultures of living animal cells.&lt;ref name="pmid15470207"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosen FS | title = Isolation of poliovirus--John Enders and the Nobel Prize | journal = N.

==Origins==
{{Further|Virus#Origins}}
Viruses co-exist with life wherever it occurs. They have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses remains unclear because they do not form fossils, so [[Molecular biology|molecular techniques]] have been the most useful means of hypothesising how they arose. However, these techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA but most of the viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Shors. p. 16
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="pmid15476878"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Nickle DC, Shriner D, Jensen MA, Learn GH, Mittler JE, Mullins JI | title = Molecular clock-like evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 | journal = Virology | volume = 329 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–8 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15476878 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main theories speculate on the origins of viruses:&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp.11–21&lt;/ref&gt;

; Regressive theory : Viruses may have once been small cells that [[parasitism|parasitised]] larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria [[rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|chlamydia]] are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend credence to this theory, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

; Cellular origin theory : Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from [[plasmid]]s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

; Coevolution theory : Viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and DNA at the same time as cells first appeared on earth and would have depended on cellular life for many millions of years.&lt;ref name =Wessner&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wessner D. R. | year = 2010 | title = The Origins of Viruses | url = | journal = Nature Education | volume = 3 | issue = 9| page = 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are problems with all of these hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis does not explain the structures of virus particles. The coevolution, or virus-first hypothesis, contravenes the definition of viruses, in that they are dependent on host cells.&lt;ref name =Wessner/&gt; But viruses are recognised as ancient and to have origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the  [[Three-domain system|three domains]].&lt;ref name="Mahy Gen 28"/&gt; This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Mahy Gen 28"&gt;{{vcite book |author=Mahy WJ &amp; Van Regenmortel MHV (eds) |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |pages=28 |isbn=0-12-375146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Basic Scheme of Virus en.svg|thumb|250px|A simplified diagram of the structure of a virus]]

A virus particle, also known as a [[virion]], consists of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a [[capsid]].&lt;ref name="Topley-and-Wilson33-55"&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 33–55&lt;/ref&gt; The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be [[truncated icosahedron|icosahedral]] (20-sided), [[helix|helical]] or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the [[nucleocapsid]], which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of [[lipid]] (fat) called an [[viral envelope|envelope]].

===Size===
Viruses are among the smallest infectious agents, and most of them can only be seen by [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]]. Most viruses cannot be seen by light microscopy (in other words, they are [[Optical microscope#Limitations|sub-microscopic]]); their sizes range from 20 to 300&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]]. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one cm.&lt;ref name="Topley-and-Wilson33-55"/&gt; By contrast [[bacteria]]l sizes are typically around 1 micrometre (1000&amp;nbsp;nm) in diameter, and the [[Cell biology|cells]] of higher organisms a few tens of micrometres. Some viruses such as  [[megavirus]]es and [[pandoravirus]]es are relatively large. At around 1 [[micrometre|micrometer]], these viruses, which infect [[amoeba]]e, were discovered in 2003 and 2013. They are around a thousand times larger than [[influenza virus]]es and the discovery of these "giant" viruses astonished scientists.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/science/changing-view-on-viruses-not-so-small-after-all.html | title=Changing View on Viruses: Not So Small After All | work=New York Times | date=18 July 2013 | accessdate=20 December 2014 | author=Zimmer, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genes===
{{details|Introduction to genetics}}

Genes are made from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but [[RNA virus|many viruses]] have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Viruses reproduce rapidly because they have only a few genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | last1 = International Human | first1 = Genome Sequencing Consortium | year = 2004 | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011| pages = 931–945 | pmid = 15496913 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..931H }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and [[rotavirus]] has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

All cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are [[enzyme]]s called [[DNA polymerase]] and [[RNA polymerase]] which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 129–131&lt;/ref&gt; However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and this is one of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 652&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called [[reassortment]].&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 654&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein synthesis===
[[File:Cell with Virus.png|thumb|275px|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[cytoskeleton]] (8) smooth ER (9) [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s within [[centrosome]] (14) [[virus]] particle shown to approximate scale]]

Proteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. [[Protein biosynthesis|Protein synthesis]] consists of two major steps: [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]].

Transcription is the process where information in DNA, called the [[genetic code]], is used to produce RNA copies called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to [[ribosome]]s where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's [[amino acid]] structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.

Some nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson pp. 75–82&lt;/ref&gt; In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called [[retrovirus]]es behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 698&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life-cycle==
{{main|Viral life cycle|Viral entry}}

[[File:HepC replication.png|thumb|Life-cycle of a typical virus (left to right); following infection of a cell by a single virus, hundreds of offspring are released.]]

When a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 6–13&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Attachment''' is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human [[T cell]]s, because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can only react with [[CD4]] and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.
*'''Penetration''' follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by [[endocytosis]] or by fusion with the cell.
*'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.
*'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.
*'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.
*'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called [[lysis]]. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called [[viral shedding#Via budding|budding]].

==Effects on the host cell==
The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive.&lt;ref&gt;Collier pp. 115–146&lt;/ref&gt; These are called ''cytopathic effects''.&lt;ref&gt;Collier p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and [[apoptosis]] (cell "suicide").&lt;ref name="pmid10547702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roulston A, Marcellus RC, Branton PE | title = Viruses and apoptosis | journal = Annu. Rev. Microbiol. | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 577–628 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10547702 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activity due to proteins produced by the virus, not all of which are components of the virus particle.&lt;ref name="pmid18637511"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alwine JC | title = Modulation of host cell stress responses by human cytomegalovirus | journal = Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. | volume = 325 | issue = | pages = 263–79 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18637511 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-77349-8_15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell. Cells in which the virus is [[virus latency|latent]] and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally.&lt;ref name="pmid18164651"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sinclair J | title = Human cytomegalovirus: Latency and reactivation in the myeloid lineage | journal = J. Clin. Virol. | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–5 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18164651 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcv.2007.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This is often the case with [[herpes simplex|herpes viruses]].&lt;ref name="pmid6326635"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan MC, Jordan GW, Stevens JG, Miller G | title = Latent herpesviruses of humans | journal = Ann. Intern. Med. | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 866–80 | date = June 1984 | pmid = 6326635 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-100-6-866 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12076064"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sissons JG, Bain M, Wills MR | title = Latency and reactivation of human cytomegalovirus | journal = J.

Some viruses, such as [[Epstein-Barr virus]], often cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy;&lt;ref name="pmid18035323"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barozzi P, Potenza L, Riva G, Vallerini D, Quadrelli C, Bosco R, Forghieri F, Torelli G, Luppi M | title = B cells and herpesviruses: a model of lymphoproliferation | journal = Autoimmun Rev | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 132–6 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18035323 | doi = 10.1016/j.autrev.2007.02.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some other viruses, such as [[papillomavirus]], are an established cause of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid19020360"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Subramanya D, Grivas PD | title = HPV and cervical cancer: updates on an established relationship | journal = Postgrad Med | volume = 120 | issue = 4 | pages = 7–13 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19020360 | doi = 10.3810/pgm.2008.11.1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a cell's DNA is damaged by a virus, and if the cell cannot [[DNA repair|repair]] itself, this often triggers apoptosis. One of the results of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; [[HIV]], for example, does this.&lt;ref name="pmid10547702"/&gt;

==Viruses and diseases==
{{for|more examples of diseases caused by viruses|List of infectious diseases}}

[[File:Norwalk.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Norovirus]]. Ten Norovirus particles; this RNA virus causes winter vomiting disease. It is often in the news as a cause of gastro-enteritis on cruise ships and in hospitals.]]

Common human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], [[influenza|the flu]], [[chickenpox]] and [[cold sores]]. Serious diseases such as [[Ebola]] and [[AIDS]] are also caused by viruses. Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be "benign". The more harmful viruses are described as [[virulence|virulent]].
Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect.
Some viruses can cause lifelong or [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 4643&lt;/ref&gt; This is common in [[hepatitis B virus]] and [[hepatitis C virus]] infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. They serve as important reservoirs of the virus. If there is a high proportion of carriers in a given population, a disease is said to be [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Topley and Wilson p. 766&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by [[organism]]s; such organisms are called [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s. Some viruses that infect animals, including humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as [[norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal [[fomites|objects]] and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated [[hypodermic needle]]s. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diseases of plants===
{{Main|Plant pathology}}

[[File:Pepper mild mottle virus.png|thumb|125px|[[Capsicum|Pepper]]s infected by mild mottle virus]]

There are many types of [[plant virus]], but often they only cause a loss of [[crop yield|yield]], and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by [[organism]]s ([[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s). These are normally insects, but some [[fungi]], [[Nematode|nematode worms]] and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 822&lt;/ref&gt; Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 802–803&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteriophages===
{{main|Bacteriophage}}

[[File:PhageExterior.svg|thumb|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]

Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and [[archaea]]. The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages that belong to 11 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fauquet, CM |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=82 |isbn=978-0-12-375146-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are important in [[marine ecology]]: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 803&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host resistance===

====Innate immunity of animals====
{{Main|Innate immunity}}

Animals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This [[innate]] immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a "memory" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called [[interferon]] is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called [[RNA interference]]. Some blood cells [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and destroy other virus infected cells.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adaptive immunity of animals====
{{main|Immune response}}

[[File:Rotavirus with antibody.jpg|thumb|Two rotavirus particles: the one on the right is coated with antibodies which stop its attaching to cells and infecting them]]

Specific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called [[lymphocyte]]s play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a "memory" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called [[antibody|antibodies]]. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection; however, after the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, often giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus.&lt;ref&gt;Shors pp.225–233&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant resistance====
Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called [[Gene-for-gene relationship#Classes of resistance gene|resistance (R) genes]]. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.97.26.14789 | last1 = Dinesh-Kumar | first1 = S.P. | last2 = Tham | first2 = Hong | last3 = -1#Wai- | first3 = Baker | year = 2000 | title = Structure—function analysis of the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 97 | issue = 26| pages = 14789–94 | pmid = 11121079 | pmc = 18997 |bibcode = 2000PNAS...9714789D }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 812&lt;/ref&gt; When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants which destroy viruses, such as [[salicylic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[Reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1239 | last1 = Soosaar | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Burch-Smith | first2 = T.M. | last3 = Dinesh-Kumar | first3 = S.P. | year = 2005 | title = Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 789–98 | pmid = 16132037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resistance to bacteriophages====
The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called [[restriction endonucleases]], cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.

====Vaccines====
{{Details|Vaccination}}

[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|The structure of DNA showing the position of the nucleosides and the phosphorus atoms that form the "backbone" of the molecule]]

Vaccination is a way of preventing diseases caused by viruses. Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease.

====Antiviral drugs====
{{main|Antiviral drug}}

Since the mid 1980s, the development of [[antiviral drug]]s has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS [[pandemic]]. Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogue]]s, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 514−515&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of nucleoside analogues are [[aciclovir]] for [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus]] infections and [[lamivudine]] for HIV and [[hepatitis B virus]] infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 514&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guanosine-acyclovir-comparison.png|thumb|upright|The structure of the DNA base [[guanosine]] and the antiviral drug [[aciclovir]]]]

Other antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called [[protease inhibitors]], which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.&lt;ref name="Shors p. 463"&gt;Shors p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug [[ribavirin]] combined with interferon.&lt;ref name="pmid17927615"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witthöft T, Möller B, Wiedmann KH, Mauss S, Link R, Lohmeyer J, Lafrenz M, Gelbmann CM, Hüppe D, Niederau C, Alshuth U|display-authors = 6 | title = Safety, tolerability and efficacy of peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C in clinical practice: The German Open Safety Trial | journal = J. Viral Hepat. | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 788–96 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17927615 | pmc = 2156112 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2893.2007.00871.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatments for chronic [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using [[lamivudine]] and other anti-viral drugs have been developed.&lt;ref name="pmid21654909"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul N, Han SH | title = Combination Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis B: Current Indications | journal = Curr Hepat Rep | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 98–105 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21654909 | pmc = 3085106 | doi = 10.1007/s11901-011-0095-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.

HIV infections are usually treated with a combination of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Shors p. 463"/&gt; The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.

==Role in ecology==
Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Senkevich TG, Dolja VV | title = The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells | journal = Biol. Direct | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 29 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16984643 | pmc = 1594570 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—there are about one million of them in a teaspoon of seawater&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and this is the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.&lt;ref&gt;Shors p. 25−26&lt;/ref&gt;

Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea. It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are mainly responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful [[algal bloom]]s,&lt;ref name="pmid16163346"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suttle CA | title = Viruses in the sea | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7057 | pages = 356–61 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16163346 | doi = 10.1038/nature04160 |bibcode = 2005Natur.437..356S }}&lt;/ref&gt; which often kill other marine life.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hab/redtide/|title=Harmful Algal Blooms: Red Tide: Home &amp;#124; CDC HSB|publisher=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=23 August 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms.&lt;ref name="pmid17853907"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suttle CA | title = Marine viruses--major players in the global ecosystem | journal = Nat. Rev. Microbiol. | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 801–12 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17853907 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1750 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their effects are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 [[gigatonne]]s of carbon per year.&lt;ref name="pmid17853907"/&gt;

Marine mammals are also susceptible to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals  were killed in Europe by [[phocine distemper virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Hall | first1= A | last2= Jepson | first2= P | last3= Goodman | first3= S | last4= Harkonen | first4= T | title= Phocine distemper virus in the North and European Seas&amp;nbsp;– Data and models, nature and nurture | journal= Biological Conservation | volume= 131 | issue= 2 | pages= 221–229 | year= 2006 |doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2006.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations.&lt;ref name="pmid17853907"/&gt;

{{nihongo |'''Ishinosuke Uwano'''|上野 石之助|Uwano Ishinosuke|extra= October 1922 }} is a former soldier in the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] and a [[prisoner of war]] in the Soviet labour camps, who came to media prominence in April 2006 after it was found that he had been living voluntarily in [[Ukraine]] for six decades after the end of [[World War II]]. He had been recorded as dead in official Japanese databases.

==Background==
Uwano was stationed in the Japanese half of [[Sakhalin Island]] at the end of the war, and had been in contact with his family as late as 1958. He subsequently married a Ukrainian woman and settled in [[Kiev]], where he had three children. However, his lack of contact with his family led to the declaration that he was [[Declared death in absentia|legally dead]] in 2000; as a result, when he returned to Japan to visit family in 2006, he had to enter his homeland on a [[Ukrainian passport]].

==Disappearance==
The last time that Uwano's family saw him was in [[Sakhalin]] in 1958. After that, they lost all contact with him. He reappeared in [[Ukraine]] in 2006.

He was best known for performing theme songs for several installments of the ''[[Digimon]]'' anime television series, including his recording debut in 1999 with his first and most famous single, "[[Butter-Fly]]", the theme song of the [[anime]] ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''. He was signed with the [[Lantis (company)|Lantis]] recording label.

== Life and career ==
Wada was born in [[Fukuchiyama, Kyoto|Fukuchiyama]], [[Kyoto prefecture|Kyoto]], Japan. In 2003, Wada released his first original album, ''[[All of My Mind]]'', which included many of his previous works. He also collaborated in Michihiko Ōta's self-cover album ''Mirai e no Message: Ōta Michihiko Self-Cover'', featuring in two tracks – a cover version of "Hontō no Tsuyosa" (本当の強さ) ([[Ken Ichijouji|Ken]] &amp; [[Wormmon]]'s Theme) and in "3 Primary Colors" (the ''[[Digimon Tamers|Tamers]]'' theme), along with AiM.  Later, he released an album called ''The Best Selection: Welcome Back!''. It contains several of his earlier works as well as two new songs, titled "Pierce" and "Kimi no Keshiki."  On August 1, 2008, he debuted a mini-album titled ''Ever'', which contained five brand new songs. An album titled ''Kazakami no Oka Kara'' (風上の丘から), was sold at his live concerts in Japan throughout the end of 2009 in commemoration of his 10th anniversary in music, and it was released worldwide on January 11, 2010.

Wada had contributed songs to six of the seven ''[[Digimon]]'' [[anime]] series (with one of his songs reused for [[Digimon Xros Wars: Time Traveling Hunter Boys|the seventh]], to which he contributed no new songs), including opening themes for the first five of them. He also performed two songs used as ending themes for ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'', "Innocent: Mujaki na Mama de" (イノセント～無邪気なままで～) and "an Endless Tale" (with [[Ai Maeda (voice actress)|AiM]]). He starred in various other songs for the series, such as "Bokura no Digital World" (the "memorial" theme for the [[Digimon Adventure 02|Adventure]] series), "Yūki o Uketsugu Kodomo-tachi e" and also several Christmas songs. He also performed a song for ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''.

=== International appearances ===
In July 2007, Wada made his first show in [[Brazil]], doing a solo presentation and singing along other invited Japanese singers on the "[[Anime Friends]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diariodonordeste.globo.com/materia.asp?codigo=814692|title=Agitos da J-music|date=July 16, 2010|publisher=[[Rede Globo]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened one year after [[Ayumi Miyazaki]] visited Brazil in another convention "ExpoAnime Brasil". He also visited the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in Brazil on October 14, 2007, during the Anima Weekend event. On December 15–16, 2007, he made a live presentation in the "Anime Festival XL" event in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]. In August 2008, he released a mini-album named ''ever'', which contains five original songs, with four of them composed and written by himself. In December 2008 he was performing in the "Animeku 08", in February the "AniCon", and in July the "Anime Friends" (both in 2010) Events from "Yamato", in Brazil and [[Argentina]]. On June 5–6, 2010, he did 2 concerts in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]] in the Santa Lucia Arena at the "Dengeki Live", a [[J-pop]] event and anime convention. In response to his metastasized cancer in 2011, he cancelled two appearances planned for Chile and [[Peru]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

=== Death ===
On October 4, 2011, Wada announced via his blog that he was putting his career on hold in order to deal with a sudden metastasized [[cancer]] which had previously seen treatment in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digimon Singer Kouji Wada Puts Career on Hold Due to Cancer|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-10-04/digimon-singer-kouji-wada-puts-career-on-hold-due-to-cancer|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2016, Wada died suddenly from complications related to [[nasopharynx cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digimon Theme Song Singer Kouji Wada Passes Away - News - Anime News Network|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-08/digimon-theme-song-singer-kouji-wada-passes-away/.100820|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last single, "Seven〜tri. Version〜", was released only five days prior to his death.

====Tribute====
A CD tribute for Kōji Wada was released in Japan on July 31, 2016 under the name of "Digimon Song Best of Koji Wada." The CD includes a total of eleven tracks by the late singer. Additionally, the cover features Angemon, Wada's favourite character from the "Digimon" franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digimon-adventure.net/fes/goods.html#cdinfo01|title=DIGIMON ADVENTURE FES. 2016 会場限定CD「DIGIMON SONG BEST OF KOJI WADA」|publisher=Digimon Adventure Net|language=Japanese|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another compilation, "Koji Wada Digimon Memorial Best", was released on January 25, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2016-12-27/digimon-releases-memorial-compilation-album-for-singer-kouji-wada/.110366|title= Digimon Releases Memorial Compilation Album for Singer Kouji Wada|publisher=Anime News Network|date=December 27, 2016|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory]] - released December 14 2017 in Japan and January 19 2018 worldwide - the new Digimon Hudiemon was made as a tribute to Wada, with it being a butterfly Digimon and its attack Infinity Dream referencing the song Butterfly. Hudie (Chinese for butterfly) is also the name of the hacker group featured in the game, which is also a tribute to Wada.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pintaram.com/u/zubamon/1671346839720797135_2217822651&lt;/ref&gt;

An adult female between the age of twenty-five and thirty-five years old was discovered wrapped in plastic and concealed in a [[Footlocker (luggage)|footlocker]] on  October 31, 1969 in St. Petersburg, Florida. The murder weapon, a tie, was visible around her neck. Examination also concluded she had suffered blunt force trauma to the head. The murder had taken place within seventy-two hours of her discovery. She was five feet nine inches tall, weighing 130 pounds, she was the mother of at least one child, and the dental care she received in her life was relatively low, despite the fact that her wisdom teeth had been removed.&lt;ref name="Case File 661UFFL"&gt;{{cite web| title=Case File 661UFFL|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/661uffl.html| publisher=The Doe Network| accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her face has been reconstructed twice, including by the University of South Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1019|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/1019|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 29, 2014|date=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of a young woman was found in the summer of 1971 underneath a bridge. She had been killed by [[strangulation]]. Analysis of the remains traced her place of residence to a village in [[Greece]]. She had given birth to at least two children between the ages of 17 and 24 years. Evidence of various dental work and a unique ankle surgery were present on the body, which may indicate she was from a well-off background. Reconstructions were created between 1971 and 2012.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thevillagesdailysun.com/articles/2006/10/08/news/news02.txt |title=Little Miss Panasoffkee |first=Dan |last=Sullivan |newspaper=The Village's Daily Sun |accessdate=October 7, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |title=LITTLE MISS "P" |url=http://unsolved.com/ajaxfiles/mur_little_miss_p.htm |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121123101/http://unsolved.com/ajaxfiles/mur_little_miss_p.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of a male aged eleven to fourteen was found floating in a pond on May 7, 1972 in Daytona, Volusia County, Florida. He had been stabbed to death three to four days before and was already decomposed when he was found, preventing the assessment of his eye color. The victim was white at a height of five feet two inches tall and weighed around 110 to 120 pounds. He had dark wavy hair and had no evidence of dental work, but his teeth were in very good condition. On his right leg, a [[benign tumor]] was found and the bones of his feet had fused together. Both of these traits were caused by different conditions but would not likely have symptoms. The victim also may have shaved his pubis, if he was at a reproductive stage in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 2128UMFL|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/2128umfl.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=March 11, 2015|date=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wore a denim jacket, a red and white striped shirt, gray pants, brown socks and one black shoe with a silver buckle. The latter articles of clothing were presumed to be dress clothes. The boy had a wallet with visible paint drops in his back pants pocket, although it is unknown if it assisted with finding clues about the victim's identity. The body was exhumed in 2013 to collect DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2014|title=John Doe 1972|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1224409/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of an unidentified white female was found on August 21, 1973. She was likely between the ages of 13 and 18 but may have been as old as 21. It was believed that she may have been a victim of Joseph Spaziano.

She was found within a wooded area beneath the body of Laura Harbers, whose murder Spaziano was later charged with. A witness claimed to have met a teenage girl in Daytona Beach, Florida, who was riding on a motorcycle with Spaziano. The girl asked the witness to watch over her purse until she returned. When the girl did not return, the witness looked through the purse but could only recall to authorities that the girl may have been from [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Five days later, Spaziano returned and took the purse from the witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 67UFFL|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/67uffl.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A young woman's remains were found in Daytona Beach, Volusia County, Florida on November 5, 1980. She was murdered several weeks before and had most likely died due to stab wounds that occurred in her upper torso. The victim was a prostitute, according to convicted murderer Gerald Eugene Stano, who stated he choked the victim, instead of stabbing her, and had met her a few years before she was found dead. She was likely Hispanic, although she could have been White/Black biracial as well.&lt;ref name=doev&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 382UFFL|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/382uffl.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=January 5, 2015|date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was estimated to be between fifteen and twenty five years old, to have been subjected to labor that involved using her arms, had been between five feet seven to five feet eleven inches tall and weighed between 115 and 135 pounds.&lt;ref name=ncmecv&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1980|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184261|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=January 5, 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her height and weight ranges were difficult to estimate, as her skeleton was partial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 724|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/724|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=January 5, 2015|date=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had fillings that contained a metal that had been outdated at the time.

A female of African ancestry aged sixteen to twenty-six was discovered within a day of her death on February 3, 1981 in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The female had been beaten to death, as numerous injuries were noted on her body and was then left in a Japanese Garden. She was clothed, wearing a "white/beige shirt," blue jeans and white undergarments, the bottoms with the words "Rest Area Visitors Welcome." The young woman had a gap between her two front incisors and she had bleached her black hair blonde in some places. She was estimated to be five feet and two inches tall and to have weighed 90 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 790UFFL|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/790uffl.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 7963|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/7963|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=July 4, 2015|date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A white woman's body was found floating in a canal in Moore Haven, Glades County, Florida, on March 9, 1981, approximately one day after she was killed by a blow to the side of her head. Although she had died recently, her body was already decomposing and was unrecognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 7915|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/7915|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=November 29, 2014|date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim may have been seen earlier at two local restaurants before her death. She was between twenty-five and forty-five years old, wearing a pink shirt, a white bra, jeans, blue knee-high socks and brown ankle-high boots. The letter N was tattoed amateurishly on the top of her right thumb, which may have represented her or a loved one's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glades Florida Jane Doe March 1981|url=http://canyouidentifyme.org/GladesFloridaJaneDoeMarch1981|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman had painted her toenails with a copper-colored polish but not on her fingernails. This is possibly due to her being a nail-biter, as her nails were chewed short. She had hazel eyes with auburn hair and she was between five feet four to five feet six inches tall as a weight of approximately 125 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 509UFFL|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/509uffl.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 1984, the skeleton of a male aged seventeen to twenty-eight was found in South Bay, Palm Beach County, Florida. It is believed that he had died within a year of his body being found. The victim was approximately five feet nine inches to six feet tall with a weight at around 110 to 130 pounds. He was found clothed; he wore blue underwear underneath a pair of white swim trunks and white socks with a blue stripe. Analysis of his bones indicated he had broken some ribs weeks before his murder and he had also suffered trauma to his right hand that failed to heal properly, which may have distorted the way his thumb looked. The young man had fillings in his teeth and had one of his back teeth extracted a year or more before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2015|title=John Doe 1984|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184443/1/screen|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death was ruled as homicide, as he had been struck with a blunt object in the back of his head.

On April 18, 1984, a seventeen to twenty-year-old female was found in the woods in Altoona, Lake County, Florida, several weeks after she died. Her remains were severely decomposed and had mostly been skeletonized. She was approximately 5.0' to 5.1' tall and weighed between 90 and 110 pounds. The victim had straight light brown to auburn hair and is believed to be white. She wore a black shirt reading "here comes trouble," a whitish shirt with the words "have you kissed your child tonight?", jeans, tan shoes with blue trim, tan underwear and a gold necklace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 126UFFL|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/126uffl.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She may have fractured two of her ribs during her life, which may assist in identifying her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 6037|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/6037|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 16, 2014|date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that her left ear was pierced but she wore no earring when found.

A black male, clothed only in shorts, was unearthed from a shallow grave on April 6, 1998 in Plant City, Hillsborough County, Florida. The victim had been shot with a shotgun and was then wrapped in a carpet after his murder earlier in the 1990s.

[[File:Escultura clara.jpg|thumb|200px|Man sculpting himself by Uruguayan artist Yandí Luzardo, inspired in the objective of Logosophy: conscious evolution of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://logosofia.edu.uy/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=53 The picture and its explanation are at the bottom right corner of the page.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Logosophy''' is an ethical-philosophical [[doctrine]] developed by the Argentine humanist and thinker [[Carlos Bernardo González Pecotche]], which offers teachings of conceptual order and practices that lead oneself to self-cognition and self-improvement through a process of conscious [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="dic1"&gt;"Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa". Brazil: Departamento de Imprensa Nacional, 1966, Volume 3 (J-P).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dic2"&gt;"Dicionário Contemporâneo da Língua Portuguesa". Brazil: Editora Delta S.A., 2nd Brazilian Edition, Volumes III and IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logosophy argues that the [[thought]]s can be autonomous and independent of one's individual will, and that they are born and fulfill their function under the influence of the moral or psychic states of their owner or someone else. Its purpose is to free the mental faculties of suggestive influences, allowing the human being to think freely and understand the true objectives of life.&lt;ref name="dic2"/&gt;

Logosophy presents itself as a new and conclusive science, which reveals a [[scientific method|method]] and a set of disciplines of its own, with the purpose of leading man to the knowledge of his own self, of the [[Universe]], and its eternal laws. It also presents itself as a new way of feeling and conceiving life, since it presents a new conception of humanity, human psychic and mental organization, and the human life in its broadest possibilities and proportions.&lt;ref name="lcm1"&gt;González Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. “Logosophy, Science and Method”. Brazil: Editora Logosófica, 1980, Lesion I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name is the combination of the Greek word "logos" and "[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]", which the author has adopted as meaning Creative Word or Manifestation of the Supreme Knowledge, and Original Science or Wisdom, respectively, to denote "a new line of cognitions, a doctrine, a method and a technique which are eminently its own".&lt;ref name="lcm1"/&gt;

Logosophy was created in 1930, with the creation of the first Logosophical Foundation in the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], Argentina.&lt;ref name="site"&gt;[http://www.logosophy.info/ Logosophy – International Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The author==
[[Carlos Bernardo González Pecotche]], also known as '''Raumsol''', was born on August 11, 1901 in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. He was a son of Jorge N. González and Maria Pecotche de González. He married Paulina Eugenia Puntel on October 8, 1924 and had a son, Carlos Federico González Puntel, born on July 10, 1925. He died in Buenos Aires on April 4, 1963.

==The method==
The logosophical method, as its author claims, is unique in its essence and has the quality of adapting itself to each and every mind, giving it the share of knowledge that it is capable of absorbing.&lt;ref name="lcm4"&gt;González Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. “Logosophy, Science and Method”. Brazil: Editora Logosófica, 1980, Lesion VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination of the aptitudes and the conditions of assimilation are factors to which the method gives special consideration.  Its main artery, which makes the teaching live and breathe in the soul of the student, is the one which requires him, as the main function of the cognition which it bestows, to become intimately familiarized with the teaching to the point of identifying himself with it by associating it to his life.&lt;ref name="lcm4"/&gt;

The logosophical method intends to guide the human being to a more thorough knowledge of his mind considered in the entirety of its complex operation. Logosophy invites man to carry out a complete study of his own psychology – his character, his tendencies, his thoughts, his qualities, his deficiencies, and whatever relates directly or indirectly to the movements of his mental faculties and contemplates his spiritual state.&lt;ref name="lcm4"/&gt;

==Objectives==
The main objectives of the logosophical cognitions are:&lt;ref name="cil1"&gt;González Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. “Initiation Course Into Logosophy”. Brazil: Editora Logosófica, 1981, Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Man’s conscious [[evolution]]''', achieved through the organization of his mental, sensitive and instinctive systems.
*'''The [[knowledge]] of one’s self''', which implies full mastery of the elements which constitute the secret of each individual’s existence.
*'''The integration of one’s spirit''', so that the individual may put to use the values that are his own, for they have their origin in his self inheritance.
*'''The knowledge of the universal laws''', which is indispensable for the human being to adjust his life to their wise principles.
*'''The knowledge of the mental, transcendent or metaphysical world''', where all the ideas and thoughts that fecund human life originate.
*'''The creation of a new life and a better destiny''', by surpassing to a maximum one’s ordinary prerogatives.
*'''The development and mastery of the functions of [[study skills|studying]], [[learning]], [[teaching]], [[thinking]] and accomplishing''', all of which are transubstantiated through the Logosophical method into individual [[aptitude]]s of an invaluable significance for the future of the education of [[human|mankind]].

==Logosophy and Philosophy==
According to González Pecotche, the logosophical knowledge does not have common points of reference with any of the usually studied branches of knowledge, be it Science, Philosophy, [[Psychology]], etc.&lt;ref name="cil2"&gt;González Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. “Initiation Course Into Logosophy”. Brazil: Editora Logosófica, 1981, Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the relationship between Logosophy and Philosophy, González Pecotche stated:

“In this regard, Logosophy includes two powerful forces which, when they unite and bond, lead man to accomplish the two aims of this existence: to evolve toward perfection and to constitute himself as a real contributor to humanity.  One of these factors is the cognition that it offers to the human mind; the other is the affection that teaches how to fulfill human hearts.
The common science lacks this affection, this force; it is cold and rigid, and sometimes speculative and intemperate, as in the case of philosophy; conversely, Logosophy is conciliatory. Herein lies the great difference and which also explains why it is capable of realizing great accomplishments in the human soul and which seem inconceivable to those who remain extraneous to such possibilities.”&lt;ref name="icl"&gt;González Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. “An Introduction to Logosophical Cognition”. Brazil: Editora Logosófica, 1998, Page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logosophy as Humanism==
Amongst the multiple views that González Pecotche provides of Logosophy, he also mentions that it is a new kind of Humanism. However he differentiates his original contributions from the works of other Humanists:

“Differing therefore from the generalized concept of humanism, our humanism starts from one's own sensitive and thinking being who seeks to accomplish within himself the evolutionary process that all humanity must follow. One's accomplishment in this respect will inevitably constitute later a true example of what each participant within the great human family can achieve.”&lt;ref name="mvc"&gt;González Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. “The Mechanism of Conscious Life”. Brazil: Editora Logosófica, 1986, Chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lottie Pickford''' (born '''Charlotte Smith''', June 9, 1893 – December 9, 1936) was a Canadian-born [[silent film]] actress and [[socialite]]. She was the younger sister of fellow actress [[Mary Pickford]] and elder sister of actor [[Jack Pickford]].

One of her best known roles was in ''[[The Diamond from the Sky]]'' directed by [[William Desmond Taylor]] in 1915. Pickford's career is often overshadowed by that of her siblings and though she was a notable figure in the 1920s, her films and role in the Pickford acting family are now largely forgotten.

==Early years==
She was born to John Charles Smith and [[Charlotte Hennessy]].  Pickford was named for her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the middle child, born a year and two months after her sister [[Mary Pickford|Gladys Smith]] and three years before her brother [[Jack Pickford|John Charles Smith, called Jack]].  She quickly became her father's favorite, much to her sister's annoyance.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 14"&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After mistakenly believing she was a boy when first born, her father lovingly gave her the boyish nickname, 'Chuckie'.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 14"/&gt;

Pickford's father left the family while she was young, and her sister Gladys took on responsibilities. Lottie and Jack became extremely close, banding together against Gladys, whom they saw as strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lottie idolized her brother Jack, and they remained close throughout their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 42"&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her tense relationship with her sister, Lottie was protective of her, and once jumped on [[D.W. Griffith]] to defend her sister during a heated argument with the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In need of extra income, the family began to act. On January 8, 1900, Gladys and Lottie appeared in ''The Silver King''.  Lottie was either offered a lesser sum than her sister or was part of a packaged deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family eventually moved to [[New York City]] where they all acted in various productions, sometimes together, sometimes not.  At one point Lottie and Gladys had to travel on their own for one production.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 42"/&gt;

Of the family, Gladys was the breakout star. Her family members were usually attached to her as a contractual stipulation.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she started in films, Gladys took the name [[Mary Pickford]]. Lottie and Jack also took on the surname Pickford in their acting careers. Mary was influential in getting her siblings on the payroll after she started acting in films.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
In 1907, Mary adopted the stage name 'Mary Pickford'.  The rest of the family adopted the Pickford name by the time they began appearing in films.  Mary signed with [[D.W. Griffith]]'s [[Biograph Company]] in 1909 and also secured work for her siblings.

Between 1909 and 1910, Mary made eighty shorts, Jack made twenty-eight, and Lottie made twenty-five.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 89"&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three Pickfords, Lottie's talents were considered the weakest.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Actress [[Linda Arvidson]] said Mary had claimed her sister was not pretty enough for films, and had done her best to keep her away from Biograph.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 89"/&gt;  When the Biograph Company departed for [[California]], Lottie Pickford and her mother were left behind. She would eventually join her sister in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Away from her elder sister, Pickford's first starring role came in 1914 in ''The House of Bondage''.  It was a [[vice]] film, with Pickford playing a [[prostitute]], in stark contrast to her sister's image as "America's Sweetheart".  The film did not receive good reviews, being considered too crude.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 171"&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, Pickford appeared in ''[[Fanchon the Cricket|Fanchon, the Cricket]]'', opposite both her siblings. It is the only film in which all three Pickford siblings appear. It was thought [[Lost film|lost]] until rediscovered in the 20th century at the British Film Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/lostfilmsarticle.html|title=The Lost Film Files|last=Cade|first=Mary Ann|publisher=silentsaregolden.com|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickford starred in ''[[The Diamond from the Sky]]'' [[Serial film|serial]] (1915) although, to her humiliation, she was only given the role after Mary turned it down. A ''[[Photoplay]]'' article from around the time of the release declared her "Pickford The Second!" and compared her to her sister, albeit as a worthy sequel.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 171"/&gt;  The serial was jeopardized when she became pregnant.  This incident put her on the unofficial Hollywood [[blacklist]] for a short time.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 172"&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickford performed in only five roles between 1915 and 1918, when she took a break from acting.

After divorcing her first husband, Pickford next starred in 1921's ''They Shall Pay'' which co-starred [[Allan Forrest]], her future husband.  Pickford again took several years' time off from acting before returning in a minor role in the 1924 film ''[[Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (film)|Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final role was opposite her brother-in-law [[Douglas Fairbanks Sr.]] in ''[[Don Q Son of Zorro]]'' in 1925.  During her career, Pickford starred in eight features, while her brother starred in over forty features.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 305"&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pickford was a socialite and partying was her first love. She and her brother Jack both struggled with alcoholism. Her parties were legendary and lasted until morning with plentiful drugs and alcohol and nudity. Pickford's maid recalled that when they heard Mary's car pulling in, Pickford and her friends would "Jump into their knickers!"&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 172"/&gt;
Despite her reputation as a party girl, Pickford was considered to be down to earth, friendly, sweet, and unpretentious.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 222"&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
[[File:Fairbanks &amp; Pickford 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Douglas Fairbanks|Fairbanks]], Mary Pickford Rupp (daughter of Lottie Pickford) and [[Mary Pickford]]. December 1921 [[Photoplay]], Page 80.]]
On an unknown date in 1915, before the release of ''The Diamond from the Sky'', Pickford quietly married New York broker Alfred Rupp.  The couple had a daughter in 1915, Mary Pickford Rupp (1915-1984), who would be later renamed Gwynne Rupp.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 172"/&gt;  The couple separated in 1919 and divorced the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; For unknown reasons, Pickford allowed her mother Charlotte to legally adopt her daughter, who was renamed Gwynne in 1920.  Pickford did not comment to the press on the matter, other than to say she would never marry again.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, Eileen page 222"/&gt;  Gwynne lived with her grandmother until Charlotte, Sr.'s death in 1928. At that time, Gwynne's aunt Mary Pickford took custody of her.  This arrangement lasted until Gwynne married radio announcer Hugh "Bud" Ernst in June 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R40vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6tsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4420,3531022&amp;dq=gwynne+pickford+ernst&amp;hl=en|title=Niece of Mary Pickford Weds Radio Announcer|date=June 1, 1939|work=Ottawa Citizen|page=23|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lottie Pickford did marry again, to actor [[Allan Forrest]] in January 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lottie Pickford To Wed For Second Time Tonight|date=January 7, 1922|work=The Baltimore Sun|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained a divorce from Forrest in Paris in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WqQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=65kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5420,2878170&amp;dq=lottie+pickford+allan+forrest&amp;hl=en|title=Lottie Pickford Divorced|date=February 16, 1928|work=Reading Eagle|page=4|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On July 22, 1929, she married Russel O.

They remained married until her early death in 1936.&lt;ref name="evening"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8Q1QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lFUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2797,2890149&amp;dq=lottie+pickford+john+lock&amp;hl=en|title=Lottie Pickford Dies After Lengthy Illness|date=December 10, 1936|work=The Evening Independent|page=1|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On December 6, 1936, Pickford suffered a [[heart attack]] at the age of 43. She was said to have been in failing health for three years, related to alcohol abuse. She died at her home in [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name="evening" /&gt; Her funeral was held on December 13 at Wee Kirk o' the Heather Church in [[Glendale, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ASSOCIATES AT RITES FOR LOTTIE PICKFORD; More Than 150 Friends Gather at Wee Kirk o' the Heather for Funeral in Hollywood|date=December 13, 1936|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in the Pickford family plot in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Whitfield|1997|pp=305–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malnutrition in children''' is common globally and may result in both short and long term irreversible negative health outcomes. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that [[malnutrition]] accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide,&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; about 1&amp;nbsp;million children.&lt;ref name="ENJM013113" /&gt; Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35% of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Prüss-Üstün, A., Bos, R., Gore, F., Bartram, J. (2008). [http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/saferwater/en/ Safer water, better health – Costs, benefits and sustainability of interventions to protect and promote health]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

The main causes are unsafe water, inadequate [[sanitation]] or insufficient hygiene, factors related to society and poverty, diseases, maternal factors, gender issues and – overall – poverty.

Malnutrition in this article specifically refers to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or [[micronutrients]].&lt;ref name=Young2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=E.M.|title=Food and development|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=9781135999414|pages=36–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XhwKwNzJVjQC&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones2011&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of International Health|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449667719|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt7TqZPZSlIC&amp;pg=PA194}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It could also refer to a condition where too much food is consumed such that the diet causes health problems).&lt;ref name=FFL2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Facts for life|date=2010|publisher=United Nations Children's Fund|location=New York|isbn=978-92-806-4466-1|pages=61 and 75|edition=4th|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Facts_for_Life_EN_010810.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Measuring for malnutrition in Madhya Pradesh (8816985582).jpg|thumb|A child’s upper arm is measured to detect malnutrition in the village of Baggad, in Madhya Pradesh’s Dhar district (India)]]

=== Measures ===
There are three commonly used measures for detecting [[malnutrition]] in children:
* [[stunted growth|stunting]] (extremely low height for age),
* underweight (extremely low weight for age), and
* wasting (extremely low weight for height).&lt;ref name="Wagstaff 1999" /&gt;
These measures of malnutrition are interrelated, but studies for the World Bank found that only 9 percent of children exhibit stunting, underweight, and wasting.&lt;ref name="Wagstaff 1999"&gt;{{cite web|title=Socioeconomic Inequalities in Child Malnutrition in the Developing World |ssrn=632505|work=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 2434 |author1=Adam Wagstaff|author2=Naoke Watanabe|date=November 1999 |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with severe acute malnutrition are very thin, but they often also have swollen hands and feet, making the internal problems more evident to health workers.&lt;ref name="Facts for Life"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts for Life|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Facts_for_Life_EN_010810.pdf|publisher=UNICEF |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with severe malnutrition are very susceptible to infection.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt;

=== Effects later in life ===
Undernutrition in children causes direct structural damage to the brain and impairs infant motor development and exploratory behavior.&lt;ref name="Victora 2008" /&gt; Children who are undernourished before age two and gain weight quickly later in childhood and in adolescence are at high risk of chronic diseases related to nutrition.&lt;ref name="Victora 2008" /&gt;

Studies have found a strong association between undernutrition and child mortality.&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008" /&gt; Once malnutrition is treated, adequate growth is an indication of health and recovery.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Even after recovering from severe malnutrition, children often remain [[stunted growth|stunted]] for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt;

Even mild degrees of malnutrition double the risk of mortality for respiratory and diarrheal disease mortality and malaria.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; This risk is greatly increased in more severe cases of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt;

Undernourished girls tend to grow into short adults and are more likely to have small children.&lt;ref name="Victora 2008" /&gt;

Prenatal malnutrition and early life growth patterns can alter metabolism and physiological patterns and have lifelong effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="Victora 2008" /&gt; Children who are undernourished are more likely to be short in adulthood, have lower educational achievement and economic status, and give birth to smaller infants.&lt;ref name="Victora 2008" /&gt; Children often face malnutrition during the age of rapid development, which can have long-lasting impacts on health.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Inadequate food intake, infections, psychosocial deprivation, the environment (lack of sanitation and hygiene), [[social inequality]] and perhaps genetics contribute to childhood malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt;{{page?|date=June 2018}}

===Inadequate food intake===
[[File:Kwashiorkor 6180.jpg|thumb|A child suffering from Kwashiorkor caused by inadequate dietary protein intake, show signs of thinning hair or “Flag Sign”, edema, inadequate growth, and weight loss.]]
Inadequate food intake such as a lack of proteins can lead to [[Kwashiorkor]], [[Marasmus]] and other forms of [[Protein–energy malnutrition]].

=== Sanitation ===
[[File:Children and open sewer in Kibera.jpg|thumb|Poor sanitary conditions in environment that can contribute to malnutrition and disease in children (Kibera, Kenya)]]
The [[World Health Organization]] estimated in 2008 that globally, half of all cases of undernutrition in children under five were caused by unsafe water, inadequate [[sanitation]] or insufficient hygiene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This link is often due to repeated diarrhoea and [[helminthiasis|intestinal worm infections]] as a result of inadequate sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=World Bank|first1=|title=Environmental health and child survival epidemiology, economics, experiences.|date=2008|publisher=Environment Department of the World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8213-7237-1|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6534}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the relative contribution of diarrhea to undernutrition and in turn stunting remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ngure|first1=Francis M.|last2=Reid|first2=Brianna M.|last3=Humphrey|first3=Jean H.|last4=Mbuya|first4=Mduduzi N.|last5=Pelto|first5=Gretel|last6=Stoltzfus|first6=Rebecca J.|title=Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), environmental enteropathy, nutrition, and early child development: making the links|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=January 2014|volume=1308|issue=1|pages=118–128|doi=10.1111/nyas.12330|pmid=24571214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social inequality ===
In almost all countries, the poorest quintile of children has the highest rate of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Wagstaff 1999" /&gt; However, inequalities in malnutrition between children of poor and rich families vary from country to country, with studies finding large gaps in Peru and very small gaps in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Wagstaff 1999" /&gt; In 2000, rates of child malnutrition were much higher in low income countries (36 percent) compared to middle income countries (12 percent) and the United States (1 percent).&lt;ref name="Wagstaff 1999" /&gt;

Studies in Bangladesh in 2009 found that the mother’s literacy, low household income, higher number of siblings, less access to mass media, less supplementation of diets, unhygienic water and [[sanitation]] are associated with chronic and severe malnutrition in children.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore medical journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with chronic diseases like HIV have a higher risk of malnutrition, since their bodies cannot absorb nutrients as well.&lt;ref name="Facts for Life" /&gt;  Diseases such as measles are a major cause of malnutrition in children; thus immunizations present a way to relieve the burden.&lt;ref name="Facts for Life" /&gt;

=== Maternal factors ===
The nutrition of children 5 years and younger depends strongly on the nutrition level of their mothers during pregnancy and [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name="Challenge 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Challenge of Hunger and Malnutrition |url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Files/Filer/CC08/Papers/0%20Challenge%20Papers/CP_HungerandMalnutritionCC08vol2.pdf |work=Copenhagen Consensus Challenge Paper |author1=Sue Horton|author2=Harold Alderman, Juan A.

This affects the children’s ability to achieve their full potential.

=== Gender ===
A study in Bangladesh in 2008 reported that rates of malnutrition were higher in female children than male children.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt; Other studies show that, at the national level, differences between undernutrition prevalence rates between young boys and girls are generally small.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G.

==Diagnosis==
Measurements of a child’s growth provide the key information for the presence of malnutrition, but weight and height measurements alone can lead to failure to recognize kwashiorkor and an underestimation of the severity of malnutrition in children.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=[edited by] Christopher Duggan, John B. Watkins, W. Allan |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention==
Measures have been taken to reduce child malnutrition. Studies for the World Bank found that, from 1970 to 2000, the number of malnourished children decreased by 20 percent in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="Wagstaff 1999" /&gt; Iodine supplement trials in pregnant women have been shown to reduce offspring deaths during infancy and early childhood by 29 percent.&lt;ref name="Facts for Life" /&gt; However, universal salt iodization has largely replaced this intervention.&lt;ref name="Facts for Life" /&gt;

The Progresa program in Mexico combined [[conditional cash transfer]]s with nutritional education and micronutrient-fortified food supplements; this resulted in a 10 percent reduction the prevalence of stunting in children 12–36 months old.&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008" /&gt; Milk fortified with zinc and iron reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 18 percent in a study in India.
In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to combat malnutrition in the North, However, a research has shown that ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans contains the components of the Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) and this has been used massively to reduce malnutrition in the north.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breastfeeding ===

{{Main|Breastfeeding}}

Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and dehydration caused by diarrhea, but mothers are sometimes wrongly advised to not breastfeed their children.&lt;ref name="Facts for Life" /&gt;  Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce mortality in infants and young children.&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008" /&gt; Since only 38 percent of children worldwide under 6 months are exclusively breastfed, education programs could have large impacts on children malnutrition rates.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNICEF|title=Introduction to Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/ |publisher=UNICEF |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, breastfeeding cannot fully prevent PEM if not enough nutrients are consumed.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide,&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; about 1&amp;nbsp;million children.&lt;ref name="ENJM013113" /&gt; Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35% of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

According to a 2008 review an estimated 178&amp;nbsp;million children under age 5 are [[stunted growth|stunted]], most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008" /&gt; A 2008 review of malnutrition found that about 55&amp;nbsp;million children are wasted, including 19&amp;nbsp;million who have severe wasting or severe acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z.

As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the ''indirect'' disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the ''direct'' effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2410">'''Manius Acilius Aviola''' was a [[Roman senate|senator]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. He was ''[[Roman consul|consul ordinarius]]'' in AD 54 with [[Marcus Asinius Marcellus]] as his colleague. Aviola is also recorded as being governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in 65/66.&lt;ref name=CIL&gt;{{CIL|6|1331}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brian Jones, Aviola was also ''[[curator aquarum]]'' (or "superintendent of the aqueducts") from 74 to 97.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Jones, ''The Emperor Domitian'' (London: Routlege, 1993), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He is known almost solely from surviving inscriptions.

Aviola has been identified as the son of [[Gaius Calpurnius Aviola]], suffect consul of AD 24.&lt;ref name=CIL/&gt; Assuming that he became consul ''anno suo'', he would have been born around AD 22, making this relationship more likely. He is known to have lived into [[Domitian|Domitian's]] reign, and that he married Aedia Servilia, the daughter of [[Servilius Nonianus|Marcus Servilius Nonianus]] (consul AD 35).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gallivan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435641 "Who Was Acilius?"], ''[[Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte]]'', 27 (1978), p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; Older authorities, such as [[Edmund Groag]], have identified Aviola with the Avilius mentioned by [[Juvenal]],&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'', iv.94-96&lt;/ref&gt; but Gallivan has argued that Aviola is a different person.&lt;ref&gt;Gallivan, "Who was Acilius?", p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it is not known if Aviola had any children, there is a [[Manius Acilius Aviola (consul 82)|Manius Acilius Aviola]], suffect consul in 82, who is sometimes identified as his son, and [[Manius Acilius Aviola (consul 122)|Manius Acilius Aviola]], ordinary consul in 122, who is sometimes identified as his grandson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8458">'''Nonresistance''' (or '''non-resistance''') is "the practice or principle of not resisting authority, even when it is unjustly exercised".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary, online edition, accessed 8 April 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; At its core is discouragement of, even opposition to, physical resistance to an enemy. It is considered as a form of principled [[nonviolence]] or [[pacifism]] which rejects all physical violence, whether exercised on individual, group, state or international levels. Practitioners of nonresistance may refuse to retaliate against an opponent or offer any form of [[self-defense]]. Nonresistance is often associated with particular religious groups.

Sometimes non-resistance has been seen as compatible with, even part of, movements advocating [[social change]]. An often-cited example is the movement led by [[Mohandas Gandhi]] in the struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian Independence]]. While it is true that in particular instances (e.g. when threatened with arrest) practitioners in such movements might follow the line of non-resistance, such movements are more accurately described as cases of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]].

==History==

Perhaps the oldest recorded statement of nonresistance philosophy is that of [[Socrates]] around 399 BC.  An influential [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] philosopher, Socrates was [[Trial of Socrates|sentenced to death]] by the [[Athenian democracy]] for teaching his students to question authority and think for themselves.  Socrates [[Crito|accepted his fate]] on reasons of morality and justice, rather than accept help from his supporters to flee [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and escape execution.

The term nonresistance was later used to refer to the [[Established Church]] during the religious troubles in [[England]] following the [[English Civil War]] and [[Act of Settlement 1701|Protestant Succession]]. In the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist churches]], the term is defined in contrast with [[pacifism]]. Advocates of non-resistance view pacifism as a more liberal theology since it advocates only physical nonviolence and allows its followers to actively oppose an enemy. In the 20th century, there have been differences of opinion between and within [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] churches, as they disagreed on the ethics of nonresistance and pacifism.

[[Leo Tolstoy]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Leo. The Kingdom of God is within you. 1893. [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_You/Chapter_I], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adin Ballou]]&lt;ref&gt;Ballou, Adin. Christian Non-Resistance in all its important bearings, illustrated and defended (1846). Providence; Blackstones Ed., 2003, 190 pp. [https://archive.org/details/ChristianNon-resistance]; Ballou, Adin. Christian non-resistance in extreme cases. 1860. [http://www.adinballou.org/extreme.shtml]; Ballou, Adin. Non-Resistance in relation to human governments. [https://archive.org/details/Non-resistanceInRelationToHumanGovernments], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] were notable advocates of nonresistance.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, there were variations between them. Gandhi's ''[[Satyagraha]]'' movement was based on a belief in resistance that was active but at the same time nonviolent, and he did not believe in using non-resistance (or even nonviolent resistance) in circumstances where a failure to oppose an adversary effectively amounted to cowardice. 'I do believe,' he wrote, 'that where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence.'"&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section “Between Cowardice and Violence,” of the book The Mind of Mohandas Gandhi, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian theology==
[[Christian]] nonresistance is based on a reading of the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which [[Jesus]] says:

{{quote|You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, [[Turning the other cheek|turn to him the other also]]. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.|[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:38-42, NIV}}

Members of the [[Anabaptist]] ([[Mennonite]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterite]] and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]/[[German Baptist]]) denominations and other [[peace church]]es like the [[Quaker]]s have interpreted this passage to mean that people should do nothing to physically resist an enemy. According to this belief, only [[God]] has the right to execute punishments. Nonresistant Christians note that [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] love of Jesus resulted in his submission to [[crucifixion]] rather than vengeance. A main application of this theology for Anabaptist groups is to teach [[conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] of military [[conscription]] to their youth.

To illustrate how nonresistance works in practice, [[Alexandre Christoyannopoulos]] offers the following [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] response to [[terrorism]]:

{{Quote|The path shown by Jesus is a difficult one that can only be trod by true martyrs. A "[[martyr]]," etymologically, is he who makes himself a witness to his faith. And it is the ultimate testimony to one’s faith to be ready to put it to practice even when one’s very life is threatened. But the life to be sacrificed, it should be noted, is not the enemy’s life, but the martyr’s own life — killing others is not a testimony of love, but of anger, fear, or hatred. For Tolstoy, therefore, a true martyr to Jesus’ message would neither punish nor resist (or at least not use violence to resist), but would strive to act from love, however hard, whatever the likelihood of being crucified. He would patiently learn to forgive and turn the other cheek, even at the risk of death. Such would be the only way to eventually win the hearts and minds of the other camp and open up the possibilities for reconciliation in the "[[War on Terror|war on terror]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/6673/1/Christo%203.pdf |title=Turning the Other Cheek to Terrorism: Reflections on the Contemporary Significance of Leo Tolstoy's Exegesis of the Sermon on the Mount |pages=41–42 |date= April 2008 |publisher=Loughborough University Institutional Repository }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Author James R. Graham wrote, "The Christian is not a pacifist, he is a non-participationist."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, James R., Strangers and Pilgrims, The Church Press, Glendale, California n.d., p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]], nonresistant practices of [[Old Order Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]] include rejection of the following civil practices: sue at law, lobby the government, hold government office, use the force of the law to maintain their "rights".

'''Simon O'Neill''' ('''Number Four'''), is a [[fictional character]], a [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylon]] from the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series. He first appears in [[The Farm (Battlestar Galactica)|The Farm]] (August 2005), an episode written by [[Carla Robinson]] and directed by Rod Hardy. Like the [[John Cavil|Cavils]] and [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Threes]], and in contrast to [[Leoben Conoy|Leobens]], [[Aaron Doral|Dorals]], [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Sixes]], and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Eights]], Simons appear to be relatively uncommon and never appear in large groups. He has a more prominent role in the movie ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]''.

== Versions ==
=== Caprica ===
A Number Four first appears posing as a human [[physician]] treating  [[Kara Thrace|Kara Thrace (Starbuck)]] for [[ballistic trauma]] in what was supposedly a [[hospital]] on [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]]. In reality, he was also performing invasive medical tests on her [[reproductive organ]]s. After Starbuck begins to suspect the doctor's true nature, she kills him, and escapes from the facility. Her fears are confirmed when a second copy of the model greets her on her way. This copy is then gunned down by resistance fighters who rescue her.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the episode ''[[The Farm (Battlestar Galactica)|The Farm]]''&lt;/ref&gt; At least one other copy is seen on Cylon-occupied Caprica.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the episode ''[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is later revealed that a Number Four was the Caprica Buccaneers' team doctor and worked against the resistance by contaminating radiation meds and giving too much morpha. This copy was eliminated after [[Samuel Anders]] saw the Four copy who cornered Starbuck outside the Cylon facility&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the movie ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Fleet ===
Another Four - also named Simon - was a medic in the Colonial Fleet on Gemenon and later lived on the ship ''Cybele'' in ''Galactica'''s refugee fleet with his human wife Giana O'Neill and stepdaughter Jemmy. This Simon was reluctant to act against humanity because he loved his wife and stepdaughter. A [[Number One (Battlestar Galactica)|Brother Cavil]] attempted to pressure him into blowing up the ''Cybele''. Simon airlocks himself instead. Giana learned the truth about her husband after Starbuck returned to the fleet. Although she was distraught, she reasoned he must have killed himself rather than follow the Cylon plan and thus was heroic in a way.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the movie ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Six, he killed himself out of resurrection range (the reason for being out of range at the time is unknown) and is thus truly dead.

=== New Caprica ===
A Four is present in [[Gaius Baltar|President Gaius Baltar]]'s office during the Battle of [[New Caprica]].&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the episode ''[[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)|Exodus, Part 2]]''&lt;/ref&gt; One Four, assigned as part of one [[Cylon Basestar (re-imagining)|Basestar]]'s command crew that witnesses a sister Basestar's plight, determines a decision to rescue the infected Basestar cannot be reached scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the episode ''[[Torn (Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]&lt;/ref&gt; A Simon captured from that same infected Basestar near the ''Lion's Head Nebula'' is interrogated on Galactica. He reveals information about the ship and the Cylons' motives for abandoning it, in exchange for a cure promised by the humans. However, there is no cure, only a treatment. It was thought this Four was killed when [[Karl Agathon]] [[sabotage]]s the environmental control system, killing the [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylon]] [[wikt:prisoner|prisoners]] to stop them from being used as biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the episode ''[[A Measure of Salvation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number Four's role ===
Simon returns when a [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]] model talks to Baltar in [[The Passage (Battlestar Galactica)|The Passage]], after consulting with Simon about the Cylons' next move towards [[Earth]].

Number Fours are nearly always featured as a Doctor or Medic, and has a fascination with the possibility of Humanoid Cylons being able to reproduce. He also speaks calmly and clearly, and seems to use [[logic]] to solve his problems and make decisions. When Galactica attacks the Colony in the final episode, a Four shows no concern, believing the odds are in the Cylons' favor and there is no need to worry.

[[Ellen Tigh]] makes the veiled comment Number Four would want to study [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Caprica Six]] and [[Saul Tigh]]'s baby if given the opportunity. Caprica Six takes this to be a threat against her baby. Ellen's veiled threat is proven to be valid, as this Four does get the chance to operate on Hera when she is later kidnapped by Boomer. This Four is killed by Boomer herself who snaps his neck in order to return Hera to her parents during the attack on the Colony.

Several Number Fours are among the boarding party led by John Cavil that storms Galactica during the assault on The Colony. At least one is killed by the CIC crew. After a tenuous truce is declared, one Four oversees the transfer of resurrection data from the Final Five to the Colony Hybrids, but the truce is broken when Galen Tyrol murders Tory Foster. The Four in the CIC is shot dead by Starbuck in the ensuing fight. The remaining Fours aboard the Colony all perish when it falls into the naked singularity it was orbiting and is obliterated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22704">'''Ovarian follicle activation''' can be defined as [[primordial follicles]] in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the [[oocyte]] is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during [[ovulation]]. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called [[folliculogenesis]].

Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal [[granulosa cell]]s, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective [[zona pellucida]] layer, and growth of the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braw-Tal|first=Ruth|title=The initiation of follicle growth: the oocyte or the somatic cells?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00699-2|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=187|issue=1-2|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.

== Activation of Primordial Follicle Development ==
Primordial follicles are activated to grow into [[antral follicle]]s. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the [[theca cells]], is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: [[Neurotrophin|Neurotropin]], [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), [[Neurotrophin-4|neurotrophin 4]] (NT4), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-B), [[Growth differentiation factor-9|growth differentiation factor 9]] (GDF9) and [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic protein]] 15 (BMP15).

=== GDF9 ===
Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth.  GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Yeong|date=March 2012|title=Control of ovarian primordial follicle activation|journal=Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–14|doi=10.5653/cerm.2012.39.1.10|issn=2233-8233|pmc=3341446|pmid=22563545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TGF-β ===
As discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/insights-from-animal-reproduction/the-primordial-to-primary-follicle-transition-a-reliable-marker-of-ovarian-function|title=The Primordial to Primary Follicle Transition — A Reliable Marker of Ovarian Function|last=Duda|first=Malgorzata|last2=Grzesiak|first2=Malgorzata|last3=Knet-Seweryn|first3=Malgorzata|last4=Tabarowski|first4=Zbigniew|date=2016|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/62138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Forkhead box L2|Foxl2]] ===
Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sohlh1 ===
Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation==
===[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]===
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor gene]] whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Aaron J. W.|last2=Kawamura|first2=Kazuhiro|last3=Cheng|first3=Yuan|last4=Fauser|first4=Bart C. J. M.|date=February 2015|title=Intraovarian control of early folliculogenesis|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1210/er.2015.36.issue-1.edboard|issn=1945-7189|pmc=4309737|pmid=25202833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===[[FOXO3|Foxo3]]===
When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelosi|first=Emanuele|last2=Omari|first2=Shakib|last3=Michel|first3=Marc|last4=Ding|first4=Jun|last5=Amano|first5=Tomokazu|last6=Forabosco|first6=Antonino|last7=Schlessinger|first7=David|last8=Ottolenghi|first8=Chris|date=2013-05-14|title=Constitutively active Foxo3 in oocytes preserves ovarian reserve in mice|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|pages=ncomms2861|doi=10.1038/ncomms2861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation.  The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xinbo|last2=Tang|first2=Naimei|last3=Hadden|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Rishi|first4=Arun K.|date=November 2011|title=Akt, FoxO and regulation of apoptosis|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1813|issue=11|pages=1978–1986|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3002|pmid=21440011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSC and mTOR===
Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of [[mTORC1]] activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Liu|first3=Kui|date=February 2010|title=Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial follicles|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=21|issue=2|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.001|issn=1879-3061|pmid=19913438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Flohr|first2=Gilian|last3=Gorre|first3=Nagaraju|last4=Shen|first4=Yan|last5=Yang|first5=Hairu|last6=Lundin|first6=Eva|last7=Lan|first7=Zijian|last8=Gambello|first8=Michael J.|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=December 2009|title=Disruption of Tsc2 in oocytes leads to overactivation of the entire pool of primordial follicles|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=12|pages=765–770|doi=10.1093/molehr/gap092|issn=1460-2407|pmid=19843635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMH===
AMH ([[Anti-Müllerian hormone|Anti-mullerian Hormone]]) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsun-Ming|last2=Klausen|first2=Christian|last3=Leung|first3=Peter C. K.|date=August 2013|title=Antimüllerian hormone inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone-induced adenylyl cyclase activation, aromatase expression, and estradiol production in human granulosa-lutein cells|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=2|pages=585–592.e1|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.04.019|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23663993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27===
P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=M. B.|date=September 2000|title=P27 in cell cycle control and cancer|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=19–27|doi=10.3109/10428190009053535|issn=1042-8194|pmid=10975380}}&lt;/ref&gt; by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Medical Consequences ==

=== Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) ===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], before the age of 40.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Chevy|last2=Cree|first2=Lynsey|last3=Shelling|first3=Andrew N|date=2015-09-23|title=The genetics of premature ovarian failure: current perspectives|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=7|pages=799–810|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S64024|issn=1179-1411|pmc=4590549|pmid=26445561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated [[atresia]] of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persani|first=Luca|last2=Rossetti|first2=Raffaella|last3=Cacciatore|first3=Chiara|date=November 2010|title=Genes involved in human premature ovarian failure|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=45|issue=5|pages=257–279|doi=10.1677/JME-10-0070|issn=1479-6813|pmid=20668067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.

[[FOXL2]] - FOXL2 [[knockout mouse]] models showed failure of [[granulosa cell]] differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=S. E.|last2=Chand|first2=A. L.|last3=Winship|first3=I. M.|last4=Gersak|first4=K.|last5=Aittomäki|first5=K.|last6=Shelling|first6=A. N.|date=August 2002|title=Identification of novel mutations in FOXL2 associated with premature ovarian failure|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=8|issue=8|pages=729–733|issn=1360-9947|pmid=12149404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

BMP15 and [[Growth differentiation factor-9|GDF9]] - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laissue|first=Paul|last2=Christin-Maitre|first2=Sophie|last3=Touraine|first3=Philippe|last4=Kuttenn|first4=Frederique|last5=Ritvos|first5=Olli|last6=Aittomaki|first6=Kristiina|last7=Bourcigaux|first7=Nathalie|last8=Jacquesson|first8=Laetitia|last9=Bouchard|first9=Philippe|date=May 2006|title=Mutations and sequence variants in GDF9 and BMP15 in patients with premature ovarian failure|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=154|issue=5|pages=739–744|doi=10.1530/eje.1.02135|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16645022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF [[antral follicle]]s leads to defective antral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Méduri|first=G.|last2=Massin|first2=N.|last3=Guibourdenche|first3=J.|last4=Bachelot|first4=A.|last5=Fiori|first5=O.|last6=Kuttenn|first6=F.|last7=Misrahi|first7=M.|last8=Touraine|first8=P.|date=January 2007|title=Serum anti-Müllerian hormone expression in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England)|volume=22|issue=1|pages=117–123|doi=10.1093/humrep/del346|issn=0268-1161|pmid=16954410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[mTORC1]] and [[PI3K]] - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Shen|first3=Yan|last4=Gorre|first4=Nagaraju|last5=Hämäläinen|first5=Tuula|last6=Cooney|first6=Austin J.|last7=Huhtaniemi|first7=Ilpo|last8=Lan|first8=Zi-Jian|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=2010-02-01|title=Tsc/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes governs the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–410|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp483|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2798719|pmid=19843540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSC - In the oocytes of [[TSC2|Tsc2]] knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"/&gt;

=== [[Chemotherapy]] and Ovarian Follicle Activation ===

As well as having many genetic causes, [[premature ovarian failure]] has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalich-Philosoph|first=Lital|last2=Roness|first2=Hadassa|last3=Carmely|first3=Alon|last4=Fishel-Bartal|first4=Michal|last5=Ligumsky|first5=Hagai|last6=Paglin|first6=Shoshana|last7=Wolf|first7=Ido|last8=Kanety|first8=Hannah|last9=Sredni|first9=Benjamin|date=2013-05-15|title=Cyclophosphamide triggers follicle activation and "burnout"; AS101 prevents follicle loss and preserves fertility|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=5|issue=185|pages=185ra62|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005402|issn=1946-6242|pmid=23677591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]], and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as [[alkylating agents]], seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:
# By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity
# By indirect damage to the [[stromal cell]]s which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle.
Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.

===[[Oocyte cryopreservation]]===

Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnez|first=Jacques|last2=Dolmans|first2=Marie-Madeleine|last3=Pellicer|first3=Antonio|last4=Diaz-Garcia|first4=Cesar|last5=Sanchez Serrano|first5=Maria|last6=Schmidt|first6=Kristen Tryde|last7=Ernst|first7=Erik|last8=Luyckx|first8=Valérie|last9=Andersen|first9=Claus Yding|date=May 2013|title=Restoration of ovarian activity and pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue: a review of 60 cases of reimplantation|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=6|pages=1503–1513|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23635349}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of [[cryopreservation]], each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.

=== Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation ===

Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in [[oestrogen]], a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">'''Phason''' is a [[quasiparticle]] existing in [[quasicrystal]]s due to their specific, quasiperiodic lattice structure. Similar to [[phonon]], phason is associated with atomic motion. However, whereas phonons are related to ''translation'' of atoms, phasons are associated with atomic ''rearrangements''. As a result of these rearrangements, waves, describing the position of atoms in crystal, change phase, thus the term "phason". 

The hydrodynamic theory of the quasicrystals predicts that the conventional (phonon) strain relaxes rapidly. On the contrary, relaxation of the phason strain is diffusive and is much slower.&lt;ref&gt;"Hydrodynamics of icosahedral quasicrystals" [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v32/p7444 Phys. Rev. B 32, 7444&amp;ndash;7452 (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, metastable quasicrystals grown by rapid quenching from the melt exhibit built-in phason strain&lt;ref&gt;"Icosahedral clusters, icosaheral order and stability of quasicrystals—a view of metallurgy" [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/013008 Sci.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">'''Planar chirality''' is the special case of [[Chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] for two [[dimension]]s.

Most fundamentally, planar [[Chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] is a [[Mathematics|mathematical]] term, finding use in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and related physical sciences, for example, in [[astronomy]], [[optics]] and [[metamaterials]]. Recent occurrences in latter two fields are dominated by [[microwave]] applications and micro- and [[nanostructure]]d planar interfaces for visible and [[infrared]] [[light]].

Planar chirality is also exhibited by molecules like (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]], some di- or poly-substituted [[metallocene]]s, and certain monosubstituted [[paracyclophane]]s. Nature rarely provides planar chiral molecules, [[cavicularin]] being an exception.

=== Assigning the configuration of planar chiral molecules ===
To assign the configuration of a planar chiral molecule, begin by selecting the pilot atom, which is the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|highest priority]] of the atoms that is not in the plane, but are directly attached to an atom in the plane. Next, assign the priority of three adjacent in-plane atoms, starting with the atom attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and preferentially assigning in order of highest priority if there is a choice. When viewed from the side of the pilot atom, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R, otherwise it is assigned as S.&lt;ref&gt;Kalsi, P.S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLWpHCMP63YC "Stereochemistry Conformation and Mechanism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In optics and metamaterials ==
The study of planar chiral [[metamaterial]]s has revealed that planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly polarized wave incident on their front and back.
The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect is referred to as circular conversion dichroism.
Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Planetary habitability''' is the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and maintain environments hospitable to [[life]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20150407"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dyches |first1=Preston |last2=Chou |first2=Felcia |title=The Solar System and Beyond is Awash in Water |url=http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/the-solar-system-and-beyond-is-awash-in-water/ |date=7 April 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=8 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may be [[abiogenesis|generated directly]] on a planet or satellite endogenously or be transferred to it from another body, a hypothetical process known as [[panspermia]].&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'&gt;{{citation |last=NASA |title=NASA Astrobiology Strategy |url=https://nai.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2016/04/NASA_Astrobiology_Strategy_2015_FINAL_041216.pdf |date=October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environments do not need to contain life to be considered habitable nor are accepted [[habitable zone]]s the only areas in which life might arise.&lt;ref name="Seager 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exoplanet Habitability |journal=Science |year=2013 |last=Seager |first=Sara |volume=340 |issue=577 |pages=577–581 |doi=10.1126/science.1232226 |pmid=23641111 |bibcode=2013Sci...340..577S }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the existence of [[extraterrestrial life|life beyond Earth]] is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an [[extrapolation]] of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the [[Sun]] and [[Solar System]] which appear favorable to life's flourishing. Of particular interest are those factors that have sustained complex, [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisms on Earth and not just simpler, [[microorganism|unicellular]] creatures. Research and theory in this regard is a component of a number of natural sciences, such as [[astronomy]], [[planetary science]] and the emerging discipline of [[astrobiology]].

An absolute requirement for life is an [[energy]] source, and the notion of planetary habitability implies that many other [[geophysics|geophysical]], [[geochemistry|geochemical]], and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] criteria must be met before an astronomical body can support life. In its astrobiology roadmap, [[NASA]] has defined the principal habitability criteria as "extended regions of liquid water,&lt;ref name="NASA-20150407"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dyches |first1=Preston |last2=Chou |first2=Felcia |title=The Solar System and Beyond is Awash in Water |url=http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/the-solar-system-and-beyond-is-awash-in-water/ |date=7 April 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=8 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conditions favorable for the assembly of complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]], and energy sources to sustain [[metabolism]]".&lt;ref name=NASA1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g1.html |title=Goal 1: Understand the nature and distribution of habitable environments in the Universe |publisher=[[NASA]] |work=Astrobiology: Roadmap |accessdate=11 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117011137/http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g1.html |archivedate=17 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, researchers reported that [[Ocean planet|water worlds]] could support life.&lt;ref name="EA-2018901"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Water worlds could support life, study says - Analysis by UChicago, Penn State scientists challenges idea that life requires 'Earth clone' |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-08/uoc-wwc083018.php |date=1 September 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert]] |accessdate=1 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APJ-20180831"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kite |first1=Edwin S. |last2=Ford |first2=Eric B. |title=Habitability of Exoplanet Waterworlds |date=31 August 2018 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=864 |pages=75 |doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aad6e0 |arxiv=1801.00748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitability indicators and [[biosignature]]s must be interpreted within a planetary and environmental context.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt; In determining the habitability potential of a body, studies focus on its bulk composition, [[orbit]]al properties, [[atmosphere]], and potential chemical interactions. Stellar characteristics of importance include [[Solar mass|mass]] and [[luminosity]], stable [[stellar variation|variability]], and high [[metallicity]]. Rocky, wet [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial]]-type planets and moons with the potential for [[Biochemistry|Earth-like chemistry]] are a primary focus of astrobiological research, although more speculative habitability theories occasionally examine [[alternative biochemistry|alternative biochemistries]] and other types of astronomical bodies.

The idea that planets beyond Earth might host life is an ancient one, though historically it was framed by [[philosophy]] as much as [[physical science]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This article is an analysis of planetary habitability from the perspective of contemporary physical science. A historical viewpoint on the possibility of habitable planets can be found at [[Extraterrestrial life#Beliefs|Beliefs in extraterrestrial life]] and [[Cosmic pluralism]]. For a discussion of the probability of alien life see the [[Drake equation]] and [[Fermi paradox]]. Habitable planets are also a staple of fiction; see [[Planets in science fiction]].&lt;/ref&gt; The late 20th century saw two breakthroughs in the field. The observation and [[robotic spacecraft]] [[space exploration|exploration]] of other planets and moons within the Solar System has provided critical information on defining habitability criteria and allowed for substantial geophysical comparisons between the Earth and other bodies. The discovery of [[extrasolar planet]]s, beginning in the early 1990s&lt;ref&gt;

These findings confirm that the Sun is not unique among [[star]]s in hosting planets and expands the habitability research horizon beyond the Solar System.

Under the auspices of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]]'s [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|Project Phoenix]], scientists [[Margaret Turnbull]] and [[Jill Tarter]] developed the "[[HabCat]]" (or Catalogue of Habitable Stellar Systems) in 2002. The catalogue was formed by winnowing the nearly 120,000 stars of the larger [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] into a core group of 17,000 "HabStars", and the selection criteria that were used provide a good starting point for understanding which astrophysical factors are necessary to habitable planets.&lt;ref name="ajs.145"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turnbull |first=Margaret C. |first2=Jill C. |last2=Tarter |title=Target selection for SETI: A catalog of nearby habitable stellar systems |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=145 |issue=1 |pages=181–198 |date=March 2003 |url=http://skye.as.arizona.edu/~turnbull/HabCat.pdf |format=PDF |arxiv=astro-ph/0210675 |bibcode=2003ApJS..145..181T |doi=10.1086/345779 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222123523/http://skye.as.arizona.edu/~turnbull/HabCat.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2006 }} Habitability criteria defined—the foundational source for this article.&lt;/ref&gt; According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may be more favorable to the formation and development of habitable planets than smaller galaxies, like the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref name="SP-20150821"&gt;{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Giant Galaxies May Be Better Cradles for Habitable Planets |url=http://www.space.com/30335-giant-galaxies-habitable-planets.html |date=21 August 2015 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=24 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the question of what makes a planet habitable is much more complex than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface: various [[Geophysics|geophysical]] and [[Geodynamics|geodynamical]] aspects, the radiation, and the host star's [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] environment can influence the evolution of planets and life, if it originated.&lt;ref name="Review 2009"/&gt; Liquid water is a necessary but not sufficient condition for life as we know it, as habitability is a function of a multitude of environmental parameters&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015' /&gt;

=== Spectral class ===
The [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] of a star indicates its [[photosphere|photospheric temperature]], which (for [[main sequence|main-sequence stars]]) correlates to overall mass. The appropriate spectral range for "HabStars" is considered to be "late F" or "G", to "mid-K". This corresponds to temperatures of a little more than 7,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] down to a little less than 4,000&amp;nbsp;K (6,700&amp;nbsp;°C to 3,700&amp;nbsp;°C); the Sun, a G2 star at 5,777&amp;nbsp;K, is well within these bounds. This spectral range probably accounts for between 5% and 10% of stars in the local [[Milky Way galaxy]]. "Middle-class" stars of this sort have a number of characteristics considered important to planetary habitability:
* They live at least a few billion years, allowing life a chance to evolve. More [[luminosity|luminous]] main-sequence stars of the "O", "B", and "A" classes usually live less than a billion years and in exceptional cases less than 10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-builders.org/lessons/less/les1/StarTables.html |title=Star tables |publisher=[[California State University]], Los Angeles |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614211818/http://www.world-builders.org/lessons/less/les1/StarTables.html |archivedate=14 June 2008 |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Life appears to [[timeline of evolution|have emerged]] on Earth approximately 500 million years after the planet's formation. "A" class stars (which shine for between 600 million and 1.2 billion years) and a small fraction of "B" class stars (which shine 10+ million to 600 million) fall within this window. At least theoretically life could emerge in such systems but it would almost certainly not reach a sophisticated level given these time-frames and the fact that increases in luminosity would occur quite rapidly. Life around "O" class stars is exceptionally unlikely, as they shine for less than ten million years.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They emit enough high-frequency [[ultraviolet radiation]] to trigger important atmospheric dynamics such as [[ozone]] formation, but not so much that [[ionisation]] destroys incipient life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasting |first=James F. |authorlink=James Kasting |last2=Whittet |first2=DC |last3=Sheldon |first3=WR |date=August 1997 |title=Ultraviolet radiation from F and K stars and implications for planetary habitability |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=413–420 |bibcode=1997OLEB...27..413K |doi=10.1023/A:1006596806012 |pmid=11536831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* They emit sufficient radiation at wavelengths conducive to photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Light Absorption for Photosynthesis|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/ligabs.html|website=phy-astr.gus.edu|publisher=Georgia State University|accessdate=2018-05-01|format=Graphic with references|quote=It is evident from these absorption and output plots that only the red and blue ends of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum are used by plants in photosynthesis. The reflection and transmission of the middle of the spectrum gives the leaves their green visual color.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liquid water may exist on the surface of planets orbiting them at a distance that does not induce [[tidal locking]].

Whether fainter late K and M class [[red dwarf]] stars are also suitable hosts for habitable planets is perhaps the most important open question in the entire field of planetary habitability given their prevalence ([[habitability of red dwarf systems]]). [[Gliese 581 c]], a "[[super-Earth]]", has been found orbiting in the "[[habitable zone]]" (HZ) of a [[red dwarf]] and may possess liquid water. However it is also possible that a greenhouse effect may render it too hot to support life, while its neighbor, [[Gliese 581 d]], may be a more likely candidate for habitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Gliese 581: one planet might indeed be habitable |publisher=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |date=13 December 2007 |url=http://www.aanda.org/content/view/275/42/lang,en/ |accessdate=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the discovery was announced of another planet, [[Gliese 581 g]], in an orbit between these two planets.

=== A stable habitable zone ===
{{main|Habitable zone}}

The habitable zone (HZ) is a [[Spherical shell|shell]]-shaped region of space surrounding a star in which a planet could maintain liquid water on its surface.&lt;ref name="Review 2009"/&gt;  The concept was first proposed by astrophysicist [[Su-Shu Huang]] in 1959, based on climatic constraints imposed by the host star.&lt;ref name="Review 2009"/&gt;  After an energy source, liquid water is considered the most important ingredient for life, considering how integral it is to all life systems on Earth. This may reflect the known dependence of life on water;&lt;!--http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2171&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0--&gt; however, if life is discovered in the absence of water, the definition of an HZ may have to be greatly expanded. &lt;!-- What follows is not a reference but an editorial comment. &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;That [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and to a lesser extent [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (respectively 3.5 and 8 [[astronomical unit]]s outside the Sun's putative habitable zone) are considered prime candidates underscores the problematic nature of the HZ criterion. In secondary and tertiary descriptions{{clarify|date=June 2013}} of habitability it is often stated that habitable planets ''must'' be within the HZ—this remains to be proven.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

The inner edge of the HZ is the distance where [[runaway greenhouse effect]] vaporize the whole water reservoir and, as a second effect, induce the photodissociation of water vapor and the loss of hydrogen to space. The outer edge of the HZ is the distance from the star where a maximum greenhouse effect fails to keep the surface of the planet above the freezing point, and by {{chem|CO|2}} condensation.&lt;ref name="Review 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seager 2013"/&gt;

A "stable" HZ implies two factors. First, the range of an HZ should not vary greatly over time. All stars increase in luminosity as they age, and a given HZ thus migrates outwards, but if this happens too quickly (for example, with a super-massive star) planets may only have a brief window inside the HZ and a correspondingly smaller chance of developing life. Calculating an HZ range and its long-term movement is never straightforward, as negative [[Feedback|feedback loops]] such as the [[CNO cycle]] will tend to offset the increases in luminosity. Assumptions made about atmospheric conditions and geology thus have as great an impact on a putative HZ range as does stellar evolution: the proposed parameters of the Sun's HZ, for example, have fluctuated greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kasting |first=James F. |authorlink=James Kasting |last2=Whitmore |first2=Daniel P. |last3=Reynolds |first3=Ray T. |date=1993 |title=Habitable Zones Around Main Sequence Stars |journal=Icarus |format=PDF |issue=1 |pages=108–128 |url=http://www.geosc.psu.edu/~kasting/PersonalPage/Pdf/Icarus_93.pdf |doi=10.1006/icar.1993.1010 |volume=101 |bibcode=1993Icar..101..108K |pmid=11536936 |accessdate=6 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318115319/http://www.geosc.psu.edu/~kasting/PersonalPage/Pdf/Icarus_93.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, no large-mass body such as a [[gas giant]] should be present in or relatively close to the HZ, thus disrupting the formation of Earth-size bodies. The matter in the asteroid belt, for example, appears to have been unable to accrete into a planet due to orbital resonances with Jupiter; if the giant had appeared in the region that is now between the orbits of [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], Earth would almost certainly not have developed in its present form. However a gas giant inside the HZ might have [[habitable moon]]s under the right conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Darren M. |last2=Kasting |first2=James F. |last3=Wade |first3=Richard A. |date=January 1997 |title=Habitable moons around extrasolar giant planets |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/385234a0 |issue=6613 |pages=234–236 |volume=385 |pmid=9000072 |bibcode=1996DPS....28.1221W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Solar System, the inner planets are [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], and the outer ones are [[gas giant]]s, but discoveries of [[extrasolar planet]]s suggest that this arrangement may not be at all common: numerous Jupiter-sized bodies have been found in close orbit about their primary, disrupting potential HZs. However, present data for extrasolar planets is likely to be skewed towards that type (large planets in close orbits) because they are far easier to identify; thus it remains to be seen which type of planetary system is the norm, or indeed if there is one.

=== Low stellar variation ===
{{main|Variable star}}

Changes in [[luminosity]] are common to all stars, but the severity of such fluctuations covers a broad range. Most stars are relatively stable, but a significant minority of variable stars often undergo sudden and intense increases in luminosity and consequently in the amount of energy radiated toward bodies in orbit. These stars are considered poor candidates for hosting life-bearing planets, as their unpredictability and energy output changes would negatively impact [[organism]]s: living things adapted to a specific temperature range could not survive too great a temperature variation. Further, upswings in luminosity are generally accompanied by massive doses of [[gamma ray]] and [[X-ray]] radiation which might prove lethal. [[Celestial body atmosphere|Atmospheres]] do mitigate such effects, but their atmosphere might not be retained by planets orbiting variables, because the high-frequency energy buffeting these planets would continually strip them of their protective covering.

The Sun, in this respect as in many others, is relatively benign: the variation between its maximum and minimum energy output is roughly 0.1% over its 11-year [[solar cycle]]. There is strong (though not undisputed) [[solar variation|evidence]] that even minor changes in the Sun's luminosity have had significant effects on the Earth's climate well within the historical era: the [[Little Ice Age]] of the mid-second millennium, for instance, may have been caused by a relatively long-term decline in the Sun's luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/1998Q4/211/project2/group4.htm |title=The Little Ice Age |work=Department of Atmospheric Science |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a star does not have to be a true variable for differences in luminosity to affect habitability. Of known [[solar analog]]s, one that closely resembles the Sun is considered to be [[18 Scorpii]]; unfortunately for the prospects of life existing in its proximity, the only significant difference between the two bodies is the amplitude of the solar cycle, which appears to be much greater for 18 Scorpii&lt;!--What's the best estimate for how much?--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solstation.com/stars2/18sco.htm |title=18 Scorpii |work=www.solstation.com |publisher=Sol Company |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High metallicity ===
{{see also|Metallicity}}

While the bulk of material in any star is [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], there is a significant variation in the amount of heavier elements ([[metal-rich|metals]]). A high proportion of metals in a star correlates to the amount of heavy material initially available in the [[protoplanetary disk]]. A smaller amount of metal makes the formation of planets much less likely, under the [[solar nebula]] theory of [[planetary system]] formation. Any planets that did form around a metal-poor star would probably be low in mass, and thus unfavorable for life. [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] studies of systems where [[exoplanet]]s have been found to date confirm the relationship between high metal content and planet formation: "Stars with planets, or at least with planets similar to the ones we are finding today, are clearly more metal rich than stars without planetary companions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Santos |first=Nuno C. |last2=Israelian |first2=Garik |last3=Mayor |first3=Michael |date=2003 |title=Confirming the Metal-Rich Nature of Stars with Giant Planets |work=Proceedings of 12th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems, and The Sun |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] |url=http://origins.colorado.edu/cs12/proceedings/oral/tuesday/santosxx.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship between high metallicity and planet formation also means that habitable systems are more likely to be found around stars of younger generations, since stars that formed early in the [[universe]]'s history have low metal content.

Habitability indicators and [[biosignature]]s must be interpreted within a planetary and environmental context.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt; Whether a planet will emerge as habitable depends on the sequence of events that led to its formation, which could include the production of organic molecules in [[molecular cloud]]s and [[protoplanetary disk]]s, delivery of materials during and after planetary [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], and the orbital location in the planetary system.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt;  The chief assumption about habitable planets is that they are [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial]]. Such planets, roughly within one [[order of magnitude]] of Earth mass, are primarily composed of [[silicate]] rocks, and have not accreted the gaseous outer layers of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] found on [[gas giants]]. The possibility that life could evolve in the cloud tops of giant planets has not been decisively ruled out,{{refn |group="lower-alpha" |In ''[[Evolving the Alien]]'', [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] evaluate plausible scenarios in which life might form in the cloud-tops of Jovian planets.

In analyzing which environments are likely to support life, a distinction is usually made between simple, unicellular organisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] and complex metazoans (animals). Unicellularity necessarily precedes multicellularity in any hypothetical tree of life, and where single-celled organisms do emerge there is no assurance that greater complexity will then develop.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;There is an emerging consensus that single-celled micro-organisms may in fact be common in the universe, especially since Earth's [[extremophile]]s flourish in environments that were once considered hostile to life. The potential occurrence of complex multi-celled life remains much more controversial. In their work ''[[Rare Earth hypothesis|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'', [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Donald E. Brownlee|Donald Brownlee]] argue that microbial life is probably widespread while complex life is very rare and perhaps even unique to Earth. Current knowledge of Earth's history partly buttresses this theory: multi-celled organisms are believed to have emerged at the time of the [[Cambrian explosion]] close to 600 million years ago, but more than 3 billion years after life first appeared. That Earth life remained unicellular for so long underscores that the decisive step toward complex organisms need not necessarily occur.&lt;/ref&gt; The planetary characteristics listed below are considered crucial for life generally, but in every case multicellular organisms are more picky than unicellular life.

=== Mass ===
[[File:Mars sunset PIA00920.jpg|thumb|[[Mars]], with its [[Rarefaction|rarefied]] atmosphere, is colder than the Earth would be if it were at a similar distance from the Sun.]]
Low-mass planets are poor candidates for life for two reasons. First, their lesser [[gravity]] makes [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] retention difficult. Constituent [[molecule]]s are more likely to reach [[escape velocity]] and be lost to space when buffeted by [[solar wind]] or stirred by collision. Planets without a thick atmosphere lack the matter necessary for primal [[biochemistry]], have little insulation and poor [[heat transfer]] across their surfaces (for example, [[Mars]], with its thin atmosphere, is colder than the Earth would be if it were at a similar distance from the Sun), and provide less protection against [[meteoroid]]s and high-frequency [[radiation]]. Further, where an atmosphere is less dense than 0.006 Earth atmospheres, water cannot exist in liquid form as the required [[atmospheric pressure]], 4.56 [[Torr|mm Hg]] (608 Pa) (0.18 [[inch of mercury|inch Hg]]), does not occur.&lt;!--http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Mars/water.html--&gt; The temperature range at which water is liquid is smaller at low pressures generally.

Secondly, smaller planets have smaller [[diameter]]s and thus higher surface-to-volume ratios than their larger cousins. Such bodies tend to lose the energy left over from their formation quickly and end up [[geology|geologically]] dead, lacking the [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[plate tectonics|tectonic activity]] which supply the surface with life-sustaining material and the atmosphere with temperature moderators like [[carbon dioxide]]. Plate tectonics appear particularly crucial, at least on Earth: not only does the process recycle important chemicals and minerals, it also fosters [[bio-diversity]] through continent creation and increased environmental complexity and helps create the convective cells necessary to generate [[Earth's magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ward|Ward]], pp. 191–220&lt;/ref&gt;

"Low mass" is partly a relative label: the Earth is low mass when compared to the Solar System's [[gas giant]]s, but it is the largest, by diameter and mass, and the densest of all terrestrial bodies.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;There is a "mass-gap" in the Solar System between Earth and the two smallest gas giants, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], which are 13 and 17 Earth masses. This is probably just chance, as there is no geophysical barrier to the formation of intermediate bodies (see for instance [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] and [[Super-Earth]]) and we should expect to find planets throughout the galaxy between two and twelve Earth masses. If the star system is otherwise favorable, such planets would be good candidates for life as they would be large enough to remain internally dynamic and to retain an atmosphere for billions of years but not so large as to accrete a gaseous shell which limits the possibility of life formation.&lt;/ref&gt; It is large enough to retain an atmosphere through gravity alone and large enough that its molten core remains a heat engine, driving the diverse geology of the surface (the decay of [[radioactive]] elements within a planet's core is the other significant component of planetary heating). Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csmres.jmu.edu/geollab/Fichter/PlateTect/heathistory.html |title=The Heat History of the Earth |work=Geolab |publisher=[[James Madison University]] |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it would be fair to infer that the lower mass limit for habitability lies somewhere between that of Mars and that of Earth or Venus: 0.3 Earth masses has been offered as a rough dividing line for habitable planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raymond |first=Sean N. |last2=Quinn |first2=Thomas |last3=Lunine |first3=Jonathan I. |date=January 2007 |title=High-resolution simulations of the final assembly of Earth-like planets 2: water delivery and planetary habitability |journal=Astrobiology |arxiv=astro-ph/0510285 |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.06-0126 |volume=7 |pages=66–84 |pmid=17407404 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7...66R |issue=1 |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/895337 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2008 study by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics suggests that the dividing line may be higher. Earth may in fact lie on the lower boundary of habitability: if it were any smaller, plate tectonics would be impossible. Venus, which has 85% of Earth's mass, shows no signs of tectonic activity. Conversely, "[[super-Earth]]s", terrestrial planets with higher masses than Earth, would have higher levels of plate tectonics and thus be firmly placed in the habitable range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Earth: A Borderline Planet for Life? |work=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |date=2008 |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/2008/pr200802.html |accessdate=4 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptional circumstances do offer exceptional cases: [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] (which is smaller than any of the terrestrial planets) is volcanically dynamic because of the gravitational stresses induced by its orbit, and its neighbor [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] may have a liquid ocean or icy slush underneath a frozen shell also due to power generated from orbiting a gas giant.

[[Saturn]]'s [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], meanwhile, has an outside chance of harbouring life, as it has retained a thick atmosphere and has liquid methane seas on its surface. Organic-chemical reactions that only require minimum energy are possible in these seas, but whether any living system can be based on such minimal reactions is unclear, and would seem unlikely. These satellites are exceptions, but they prove that mass, as a criterion for habitability, cannot necessarily be considered definitive at this stage of our understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15863549 |title=Most liveable alien worlds ranked|accessdate=2017-08-16 |date=November 23, 2011 |publisher=BBC Science &amp; Environment|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A larger planet is likely to have a more massive atmosphere. A combination of higher escape velocity to retain lighter atoms, and extensive outgassing from enhanced plate tectonics may greatly increase the atmospheric pressure and temperature at the surface compared to Earth. The enhanced greenhouse effect of such a heavy atmosphere would tend to suggest that the habitable zone should be further out from the central star for such massive planets.

Finally, a larger planet is likely to have a large iron core. This allows for a [[magnetic field]] to [[magnetosphere|protect]] the planet from [[stellar wind]] and [[cosmic radiation]], which otherwise would tend to strip away planetary atmosphere and to bombard living things with ionized particles. Mass is not the only criterion for producing a magnetic field—as the planet must also rotate fast enough to produce a [[dynamo]] effect within its core&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/magearth.html |title=Magnetic Field of the Earth |last=Nave |first=C. R. |work=[[HyperPhysics]] |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—but it is a significant component of the process.

=== Orbit and rotation ===
As with other criteria, stability is the critical consideration in evaluating the effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. [[Orbital eccentricity]] is the difference between a planet's farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet's surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the [[freezing point]] and [[boiling point]] of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth's oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, it is difficult to imagine life as we know it having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the temperature sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ward|Ward]], pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth's orbit is almost wholly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.

Habitability is also influenced by the architecture of the planetary system around a star. The evolution and stability of these systems are determined by gravitational dynamics, which drive the orbital evolution of terrestrial planets.  Data collected on the orbital eccentricities of extrasolar planets has surprised most researchers: 90% have an orbital eccentricity greater than that found within the Solar System, and the average is fully 0.25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1611 |title=Elusive Earths |last=Bortman |first=Henry |date=22 June 2005 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the vast majority of planets have highly eccentric orbits and of these, even if their average distance from their star is deemed to be within the HZ, they nonetheless would be spending only a small portion of their time within the zone.

A planet's movement around its [[rotation|rotational axis]] must also meet certain criteria if life is to have the opportunity to evolve. A first assumption is that the planet should have moderate [[season]]s. If there is little or no [[axial tilt]] (or obliquity) relative to the perpendicular of the [[ecliptic]], seasons will not occur and a main stimulant to biospheric dynamism will disappear. The planet would also be colder than it would be with a significant tilt: when the greatest intensity of radiation is always within a few degrees of the equator, warm weather cannot move poleward and a planet's climate becomes dominated by colder polar weather systems.

If a planet is radically tilted,  seasons will be extreme and make it more difficult for a [[biosphere]] to achieve [[homeostasis]]. The axial tilt of the Earth is higher now (in the [[Quaternary]]) than it has been in the past, coinciding with reduced polar [[glacier|ice]], warmer temperatures and ''less'' seasonal variation.  Scientists do not know whether this trend will continue indefinitely with further increases in axial tilt (see [[Snowball Earth]]).

The exact effects of these changes can only be computer modelled at present, and studies have shown that even extreme tilts of up to 85 degrees do not absolutely preclude life "provided it does not occupy continental surfaces plagued seasonally by the highest temperature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Planetary Tilt Not A Spoiler For Habitation |publisher=[[Penn State University]] |date =25 August 2003 |url =http://www.psu.edu/ur/2003/planetarytilt.html |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the mean axial tilt, but also its variation over time must be considered. The Earth's tilt varies between 21.5 and 24.5 degrees over 41,000 years. A more drastic variation, or a much shorter periodicity, would induce climatic effects such as variations in seasonal severity.

Other orbital considerations include:
* The planet should rotate relatively quickly so that the day-night cycle is not overlong. If a day takes years, the temperature differential between the day and night side will be pronounced, and problems similar to those noted with extreme orbital eccentricity will come to the fore.
* The planet also should rotate quickly enough so that a magnetic dynamo may be started in its iron core to produce a magnetic field.
* Change in the direction of the axis rotation ([[precession]]) should not be pronounced. In itself, precession need not affect habitability as it changes the direction of the tilt, not its degree. However, precession tends to accentuate variations caused by other orbital deviations; see [[Milankovitch cycles]]. Precession on Earth occurs over a 26,000-year cycle.

The Earth's [[Moon]] appears to play a [[Earth#Moon|crucial role]] in moderating the Earth's climate by stabilising the axial tilt. It has been suggested that a chaotic tilt may be a "deal-breaker" in terms of habitability—i.e. a satellite the size of the Moon is not only helpful but required to produce stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasker |first=J. |last2=Joutel |first2=F. |last3=Robutel |first3=P. |date=July 1993 |title=Stabilization of the earth's obliquity by the moon |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=361 |issue=6413 |pages=615–617 |bibcode=1993Natur.361..615L |doi=10.1038/361615a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This position remains controversial.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;According to prevailing theory, the formation of the Moon commenced when a Mars-sized body struck the Earth in a glancing collision late in its formation, and the ejected material coalesced and fell into orbit (see [[giant impact hypothesis]]). In ''Rare Earth'' Ward and Brownlee emphasize that such impacts ought to be rare, reducing the probability of other Earth-Moon type systems and hence the probability of other habitable planets. Other moon formation processes are possible, however, and the proposition that a planet may be habitable in the absence of a moon has not been disproven.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the Earth, the sole Moon is sufficiently massive and orbits so as to significantly contribute to [[ocean tides]], which in turn aids the dynamic churning of Earth's large liquid water oceans. These lunar forces not only help ensure that the oceans do not stagnate, but also play a critical role in Earth's dynamic climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorminey|first1=Bruce|title=Without the Moon, Would There Be Life on Earth?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/moon-life-tides/|website=scientificamerican.com|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=2018-05-01|date=2009-04-29|quote="Europa must have big tides, so it's my favorite for microbial life," says Max Bernstein, an astrochemist and program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

=== Geochemistry ===
{{Main|Geochemistry}}
It is generally assumed that any extraterrestrial life that might exist will be based on the same fundamental [[biochemistry]] as found on Earth, as the four elements most vital for life, [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are also the most common chemically reactive elements in the universe. Indeed, simple biogenic compounds, such as very simple [[amino acid]]s such as [[glycine]], have been found in [[meteorite]]s and in the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organic Molecule, Amino Acid-Like, Found In Constellation Sagittarius |publisher=ScienceDaily |date=2008 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080326161658.htm |accessdate=20 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These four elements together comprise over 96% of Earth's collective [[biomass]]. Carbon has an unparalleled ability to bond with itself and to form a massive array of intricate and varied structures, making it an ideal material for the complex mechanisms that form living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Hydrogen and oxygen, in the form of water, compose the solvent in which biological processes take place and in which the first reactions occurred that led to [[Abiogenesis|life's emergence]]. The energy released in the formation of powerful [[covalent bond]]s between carbon and oxygen, available by oxidizing organic compounds, is the fuel of all complex life-forms. These four elements together make up [[amino acids]], which in turn are the building blocks of [[protein]]s, the substance of living tissue. In addition, neither [[sulfur]], required for the building of proteins, nor [[phosphorus]], needed for the formation of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and the adenosine phosphates essential to [[metabolism]], is rare.

Relative abundance in space does not always mirror differentiated abundance within planets; of the four life elements, for instance, only [[oxygen]] is present in any abundance in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/elbio.html |title=Elements, biological abundance |last=Darling |first=David |authorlink=David Darling (astronomer) |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be partly explained by the fact that many of these elements, such as [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]], along with their simplest and most common compounds, such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and water, are gaseous at warm temperatures. In the hot region close to the Sun, these volatile compounds could not have played a significant role in the planets' geological formation. Instead, they were trapped as gases underneath the newly formed crusts, which were largely made of rocky, involatile compounds such as [[silica]] (a compound of [[silicon]] and oxygen, accounting for oxygen's relative abundance). [[Outgassing]] of volatile compounds through the first volcanoes would have contributed to the formation of the planets' [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]]. The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] showed that, with the application of energy, simple inorganic compounds exposed to a primordial atmosphere can react to synthesize [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/internet/l3.html |title=How did chemistry and oceans produce this? |work=The Electronic Universe Project |publisher=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, [[Volcanism|volcanic]] outgassing could not have accounted for the amount of water in Earth's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/internet/l2.html |title=How did the Earth Get to Look Like This? |work=The Electronic Universe Project |publisher=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of the water —and arguably carbon— necessary for life must have come from the outer Solar System, away from the Sun's heat, where it could remain solid. [[Comet]]s impacting with the Earth in the Solar System's early years would have deposited vast amounts of water, along with the other volatile compounds life requires onto the early Earth, providing a kick-start to the [[origin of life]].

Thus, while there is reason to suspect that the four "life elements" ought to be readily available elsewhere, a habitable system probably also requires a supply of long-term orbiting bodies to seed inner planets. Without comets there is a possibility that life as we know it would not exist on Earth.

=== Microenvironments and extremophiles ===
[[File:Atacama.png|thumb|The [[Atacama Desert]] in [[South America]] provides an analog to [[Mars]] and an ideal environment to study the boundary between sterility and habitability.]]
One important qualification to habitability criteria is that only a tiny portion of a planet is required to support life. Astrobiologists often concern themselves with "micro-environments", noting that "we lack a fundamental understanding of how evolutionary forces, such as [[genetic mutation|mutation]], [[natural selection|selection]], and [[genetic drift]], operate in micro-organisms that act on and respond to changing micro-environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g5.html |title=Understand the evolutionary mechanisms and environmental limits of life |work=Astrobiology: Roadmap |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=September 2003 |accessdate=6 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126083203/http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/roadmap/g5.html |archivedate=26 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extremophile]]s are Earth organisms that live in niche environments under severe conditions generally considered [[wikt:inimical#Adjective|inimical]] to life. Usually (although not always) unicellular, extremophiles include acutely [[Alkaliphile|alkaliphilic]] and [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophilic]] organisms and others that can survive water temperatures above 100&amp;nbsp;°C in [[hydrothermal vents]].

The discovery of life in extreme conditions has complicated definitions of habitability, but also generated much excitement amongst researchers in greatly broadening the known range of conditions under which life can persist. For example, a planet that might otherwise be unable to support an atmosphere given the solar conditions in its vicinity, might be able to do so within a deep shadowed rift or volcanic cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Hart |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astrobio_caves_030617-1.html |title=Cave Dwellers: ET Might Lurk in Dark Places |publisher=[[Space.com]] |date=17 June 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030620142504/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astrobio_caves_030617-1.html |archivedate=20 June 2003 |accessdate=6 August 2007 &lt;!-- alternate copy: http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/cave_slime.html --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, craterous terrain might offer a refuge for primitive life. The [[Lawn Hill crater]] has been studied as an astrobiological analog, with researchers suggesting rapid sediment infill created a protected microenvironment for microbial organisms; similar conditions may have occurred over the geological history of [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindsay |first=J |last2=Brasier |first2=M |title=Impact Craters as biospheric microenvironments, Lawn Hill Structure, Northern Australia |journal=Astrobiology |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=2006 |pages=348–363 |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.6.348 |pmid=16689651 |bibcode=2006AsBio...6..348L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth environments that ''cannot'' support life are still instructive to astrobiologists in defining the limits of what organisms can endure. The heart of the [[Atacama desert]], generally considered the driest place on Earth, appears unable to support life, and it has been subject to study by NASA and [[European Space Agency|ESA]] for that reason: it provides a Mars analog and the moisture gradients along its edges are ideal for studying the boundary between sterility and habitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher |last=McKay |date=June 2002 |url=http://quest.nasa.gov/challenges/marsanalog/egypt/AtacamaAdAstra.pdf |title=Too Dry for Life: The Atacama Desert and Mars |publisher=[[NASA]] |work=Ames Research Center |format=PDF |accessdate=26 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826151945/http://quest.nasa.gov/challenges/marsanalog/egypt/AtacamaAdAstra.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atacama was the subject of study in 2003 that partly replicated experiments from the [[Viking (spacecraft)|Viking]] landings on Mars in the 1970s; no [[DNA]] could be recovered from two soil samples, and incubation experiments were also negative for [[biosignature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mars-Like Soils in the Atacama Desert, Chile, and the Dry Limit of Microbial Life |journal=Science |date=7 November 2003 |first=Rafael |last=Navarro-González |first2=Christopher P. |last2=McKay |volume=302 |issue=5647 |pages=1018–1021 |doi=10.1126/science.1089143 |jstor=3835659 |pmid=14605363 |bibcode=2003Sci...302.1018N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological factors===

The two current ecological approaches for predicting the potential habitability use 19 or 20 environmental factors, with emphasis on water availability, temperature, presence of nutrients, an energy source, and protection from solar ultraviolet and [[Cosmic ray|galactic cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name='D.C.Golden'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuerger|first1=Andrew C.|last2=Golden|first2=D.C.|last3=Ming|first3=Doug W.|title=Biotoxicity of Mars soils: 1.

== Alternative star systems ==
In determining the feasibility of extraterrestrial life, astronomers had long focused their attention on stars like the Sun. However, since planetary systems that resemble the Solar System are proving to be rare, they have begun to explore the possibility that life might form in systems very unlike our own.

=== Binary systems ===
{{Main|Habitability of binary star systems}}
Typical estimates often suggest that 50% or more of all stellar systems are [[binary star|binary systems]]. This may be partly sample bias, as massive and bright stars tend to be in binaries and these are most easily observed and catalogued; a more precise analysis has suggested that the more common fainter stars are usually singular, and that up to two thirds of all stellar systems are therefore solitary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Most Milky Way Stars Are Single |publisher=[[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] |date=30 January 2006 |url =http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/press/2006/pr200611.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813062958/http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/press/2006/pr200611.html |archivedate=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=5 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The separation between stars in a binary may range from less than one [[astronomical unit]] (AU, the average Earth–Sun distance) to several hundred. In latter instances, the gravitational effects will be negligible on a planet orbiting an otherwise suitable star and habitability potential will not be disrupted unless the orbit is highly eccentric (see [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]], for example). However, where the separation is significantly less, a stable orbit may be impossible. If a planet's distance to its primary exceeds about one fifth of the closest approach of the other star, orbital stability is not guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |work=www.solstation.com |publisher=Sol Company |accessdate=5 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628175616/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether planets might form in binaries at all had long been unclear, given that gravitational forces might interfere with planet formation. Theoretical work by [[Alan Boss]] at the [[Carnegie Institution]] has shown that gas giants can form around stars in binary systems much as they do around solitary stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Planetary Systems can from around Binary Stars |publisher=[[Carnegie Institution]] |url=http://carnegieinstitution.org/news_releases/news_0601_10.html |author=Boss, Alan |date=January 2006 |accessdate=5 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515225714/http://carnegieinstitution.org/news_releases/news_0601_10.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of [[Alpha Centauri]], the nearest star system to the Sun, suggested that binaries need not be discounted in the search for habitable planets. Centauri A and B have an 11&amp;nbsp;AU distance at closest approach (23&amp;nbsp;AU mean), and both should have stable habitable zones. A study of long-term orbital stability for simulated planets within the system shows that planets within approximately three&amp;nbsp;AU of either star may remain rather stable (i.e. the [[semi-major axis]] deviating by less than 5% during 32&amp;nbsp;000 binary periods). The HZ for Centauri A is conservatively estimated at 1.2 to 1.3&amp;nbsp;AU and [[Centauri B]] at 0.73 to 0.74—well within the stable region in both cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiegert |first=Paul A. |last2=Holman |first2=Matt J. |date=April 1997 |title=The stability of planets in the Alpha Centauri system |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=1445–1450 |bibcode=1997AJ....113.1445W |doi=10.1086/118360 |arxiv=astro-ph/9609106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red dwarf systems ===
{{main|Habitability of red dwarf systems}}
[[File:BrownDwarfs Comparison 01.png|300px|thumb|Relative star sizes and [[photosphere|photospheric temperatures]]. Any planet around a red dwarf such as the one shown here ([[Gliese 229A]]) would have to huddle close to achieve Earth-like temperatures, probably inducing tidal locking. See [[Aurelia and Blue Moon|Aurelia]]. Credit: MPIA/V. Joergens.]]

Determining the habitability of [[red dwarf]] stars could help determine how common life in the universe might be, as red dwarfs make up between 70 and 90% of all the stars in the galaxy.

==== Size ====
Astronomers for many years ruled out red dwarfs as potential abodes for life. Their small size (from 0.08 to 0.45 solar masses) means that their [[nuclear reaction]]s proceed exceptionally slowly, and they emit very little light (from 3% of that produced by the Sun to as little as 0.01%). Any planet in orbit around a red dwarf would have to huddle very close to its parent star to attain Earth-like surface temperatures; from 0.3 AU (just inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) for a star like [[Lacaille 8760]], to as little as 0.032 AU for a star like [[Proxima Centauri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Habitable zones of stars |url=http://exobio.ucsd.edu/Space_Sciences/zones.htm |work=NASA Specialized Center of Research and Training in Exobiology |publisher=[[University of Southern California]], San Diego |deadurl=yes |archivedate=21 November 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001121121500/http://exobio.ucsd.edu/Space_Sciences/zones.htm |accessdate=11 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (such a world would have a year lasting just 6.3 days). At those distances, the star's gravity would cause tidal locking. One side of the planet would eternally face the star, while the other would always face away from it. The only ways in which potential life could avoid either an inferno or a deep freeze would be if the planet had an atmosphere thick enough to transfer the star's heat from the day side to the night side, or if there was a gas giant in the habitable zone, with a [[habitable moon]], which would be locked to the planet instead of the star, allowing a more even distribution of radiation over the planet. It was long assumed that such a thick atmosphere would prevent sunlight from reaching the surface in the first place, preventing [[photosynthesis]].

[[File:Gliese 667 Cc sunset.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An artist's impression of [[GJ 667 Cc]], a potentially habitable planet orbiting a red dwarf constituent in a [[star system|trinary star system]].]]This pessimism has been tempered by research. Studies by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi of [[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Center]] in California have shown that a planet's atmosphere (assuming it included greenhouse gases [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]) need only be 100 [[millibars|mbs]], or 10% of [[Earth's atmosphere]], for the star's heat to be effectively carried to the night side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=M.

Martin Heath of [[Greenwich Community College]], has shown that seawater, too, could be effectively circulated without freezing solid if the ocean basins were deep enough to allow free flow beneath the night side's ice cap. Further research—including a consideration of the amount of photosynthetically active radiation—suggested that tidally locked planets in red dwarf systems might at least be habitable for higher plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heath |first=Martin J. |last2=Doyle |first2=Laurance R. |last3=Joshi |first3=Manoj M. |author4=Haberle, Robert M. |date=1999 |title=Habitability of Planets Around Red Dwarf Stars |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=405–424 |format=PDF |url=http://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/education/spring02/scalo/heath.pdf |doi=10.1023/A:1006596718708 |pmid=10472629 |accessdate=11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other factors limiting habitability ====
Size is not the only factor in making red dwarfs potentially unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never see the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. [[Photosynthesis]] as we understand it would be complicated by the fact that a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the [[infrared]], and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on [[chemosynthesis]] rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.

Red dwarfs are far more variable and violent than their more stable, larger cousins. Often they are covered in [[starspot]]s that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% for months at a time, while at other times they emit gigantic flares that can double their brightness in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ken |last=Croswell |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16922754.200-red-willing-and-able.html |title=Red, willing and able |date=27 January 2001 |type=[http://www.kencroswell.com/reddwarflife.html Full reprint] |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=5 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such variation would be very damaging for life, as it would not only destroy any complex organic molecules that could possibly form biological precursors, but also because it would blow off sizeable portions of the planet's atmosphere.

For a planet around a red dwarf star to support life, it would require a rapidly rotating magnetic field to protect it from the flares. A tidally locked planet rotates only very slowly, and so cannot produce a geodynamo at its core. The violent flaring period of a red dwarf's life cycle is estimated to only last roughly the first 1.2 billion years of its existence. If a planet forms far away from a red dwarf so as to avoid tidal locking, and then migrates into the star's habitable zone after this turbulent initial period, it is possible that life may have a chance to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AstronomyCast episode 40: American Astronomical Society Meeting, May 2007 |work=Universe Today |last1=Cain |first1=Fraser |last2=Gay |first2=Pamela |authorlink2=Pamela L.

It was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. Yet, in 1998, astronomers observed an intense [[stellar flare]], surprisingly showing that Barnard's Star is, despite its age, a [[flare star]].&lt;ref name=Flare&gt;{{cite web

==== Longevity and ubiquity ====
There is, however, one major advantage that red dwarfs have over other stars as abodes for life: they live a long time.

Red dwarfs, by contrast, could live for trillions of years because their nuclear reactions are far slower than those of larger stars, meaning that life would have longer to evolve and survive.

While the odds of finding a planet in the habitable zone around any specific red dwarf are slim, the total amount of habitable zone around all red dwarfs combined is equal to the total amount around Sun-like stars given their ubiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1694 |title=M Dwarfs: The Search for Life is On, Interview with Todd Henry |date=29 August 2005 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=5 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this total amount of habitable zone will last longer, because red dwarf stars live for hundreds of billions of years or even longer on the main sequence.&lt;ref name="Red Dwarfs Universe Today"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cain |first=Fraser |title=Red Dwarf Stars |url=http://www.universetoday.com/24670/red-dwarf-stars/ |publisher=Universe Today |date=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Massive stars ===
Recent research suggests that very large stars, greater than ~100 solar masses, could have planetary systems consisting of hundreds of Mercury-sized planets within the habitable zone. Such systems could also contain [[brown dwarfs]] and low-mass stars (~0.1–0.3 solar masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The outcome of the protoplanetary disk of very massive stars, January 2011 |journal=New Astronomy |last=Kashi |first=Amit |last2=Soker |first2=Noam |doi=10.1016/j.newast.2010.06.003 |bibcode=2011NewA...16...27K |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=27–32 |arxiv=1002.4693 |citeseerx=10.1.1.770.1250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the very short lifespans of stars of more than a few solar masses would scarcely allow time for a planet to cool, let alone the time needed for a stable biosphere to develop. Massive stars are thus eliminated as possible abodes for life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stellar mass#Age]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a massive-star system could be a progenitor of life in another way – the [[supernova]] explosion of the massive star in the central part of the system. This supernova will disperse heavier elements throughout its vicinity, created during the phase when the massive star has moved off of the main sequence, and the systems of the potential low-mass stars (which are still on the main sequence) within the former massive-star system may be enriched with the relatively large supply of the heavy elements so close to a supernova explosion. However, this states nothing about what types of planets would form as a result of the supernova material, or what their habitability potential would be.

'''Class II''' habitats include bodies which initially enjoy Earth-like conditions, but do not keep their ability to sustain liquid water on their surface due to stellar or geophysical conditions. Mars, and possibly Venus are examples of this class where complex life forms may not develop.

'''Class III''' habitats are planetary bodies where liquid water oceans exist below the surface, where they can interact directly with a silicate-rich [[Planetary core|core]]. 
:Such a situation can be expected on water-rich planets located too far from their star to allow surface liquid water, but on which subsurface water is in liquid form because of the [[geothermal heat]]. Two examples of such an environment are [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]. In such worlds, not only is light not available as an energy source, but the organic material brought by meteorites (thought to have been necessary to start life in some scenarios) may not easily reach the liquid water. If a planet can only harbor life below its surface, the [[biosphere]] would not likely modify the whole planetary environment in an observable way, thus, detecting its presence on an exoplanet would be extremely difficult.

'''Class IV''' habitats have liquid water layers between two ice layers, or liquids above ice. 
:If the water layer is thick enough, water at its base will be in solid phase (ice polymorphs) because of the high pressure. [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] are likely examples of this class. Their oceans are thought to be enclosed between thick ice layers. In such conditions, the emergence of even simple life forms may be very difficult because the necessary ingredients for life will likely be completely diluted.

== The galactic neighborhood ==
Along with the characteristics of planets and their star systems, the wider galactic environment may also impact habitability. Scientists considered the possibility that particular areas of galaxies ([[Habitable zone#Galactic habitable zone|galactic habitable zones]]) are better suited to life than others; the Solar System in which we live, in the [[Orion Spur]], on the Milky Way galaxy's edge is considered to be in a life-favorable spot:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leslie |last=Mullen |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=139 |title=Galactic Habitable Zones |date=18 May 2001 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=5 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is not in a [[globular cluster]] where immense star densities are inimical to life, given excessive radiation and gravitational disturbance. Globular clusters are also primarily composed of older, probably metal-poor, stars. Furthermore, in globular clusters, the great ages of the stars would mean a large amount of [[stellar evolution]] by the host or other nearby stars, which due to their proximity may cause extreme harm to life on any planets, provided that they can form.
* It is not near an active [[gamma ray]] source.
* It is not near the galactic center where once again star densities increase the likelihood of ionizing radiation (e.g., from [[magnetar]]s and [[supernovae]]). A [[supermassive black hole]] is also believed to lie at the middle of the galaxy which might prove a danger to any nearby bodies.
* The circular orbit of the Sun around the galactic center keeps it out of the way of the galaxy's spiral arms where intense radiation and gravitation may again lead to disruption.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ward|Ward]], pp. 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, relative isolation is ultimately what a life-bearing system needs. If the Sun were crowded amongst other systems, the chance of being fatally close to dangerous radiation sources would increase significantly. Further, close neighbors might disrupt the stability of various orbiting bodies such as [[Oort cloud]] and [[Kuiper belt]] objects, which can bring catastrophe if knocked into the inner Solar System.

While stellar crowding proves disadvantageous to habitability, so too does extreme isolation. A star as metal-rich as the Sun would probably not have formed in the very outermost regions of the Milky Way given a decline in the relative abundance of metals and a general lack of star formation. Thus, a "suburban" location, such as the Solar System enjoys, is preferable to a Galaxy's center or farthest reaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dorminey |first=Bruce |date=July 2005 |title=Dark Threat |journal=[[Astronomy Magazine|Astronomy]] |pages=40–45 |bibcode=2005Ast....33g..40D |volume=33|issue=7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other considerations ==

=== Alternative biochemistries ===
{{main|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
While most investigations of extraterrestrial life start with the assumption that advanced life-forms must have similar requirements for life as on Earth, the hypothesis of [[hypothetical types of biochemistry|other types of biochemistry]] suggests the possibility of lifeforms evolving around a different metabolic mechanism. In ''[[Evolving the Alien]]'', [[biologist]] [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] argue [[astrobiology]], based on the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], is restrictive and unimaginative. They suggest that [[Earth analog|Earth-like planets]] may be very rare, but non-carbon-based complex life could possibly emerge in other environments. The most frequently mentioned alternative to carbon is [[silicon-based life]], while [[Ammonia-based life#Ammonia|ammonia]] and [[hydrocarbons]] are sometimes suggested as [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry#Non-water solvents|alternative solvents]] to water. The astrobiologist [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] and other scientists have proposed a Planet Habitability Index whose criteria include "potential for holding a liquid solvent" that is not necessarily restricted to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Which alien worlds are most livable?| work=NBC News| date=2011-11-22| author=Alan Boyle |accessdate=2015-03-20|url= http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/11/22/8956644-which-alien-worlds-are-most-livable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

More speculative ideas have focused on bodies altogether different from Earth-like planets. Astronomer [[Frank Drake]], a well-known proponent of the search for [[extraterrestrial life]], imagined life on a [[neutron star]]: submicroscopic "nuclear molecules" combining to form creatures with a life cycle millions of times quicker than Earth life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drake |first=Frank |title=Life on a Neutron Star |journal=Astronomy |volume=1 |issue=5 |page=5 |date=1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called "imaginative and tongue-in-cheek", the idea gave rise to science fiction depictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/N/neutronstarlife.html |title=Neutron star, life on |last=Darling |first=David |authorlink=David Darling (astronomer) |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight |accessdate=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Sagan]], another optimist with regards to extraterrestrial life, considered the possibility of organisms that are always airborne within the high atmosphere of Jupiter in a 1976 paper.&lt;ref name="Sagan, C. 1976"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1976ApJS...32..737S |doi=10.1086/190414 |title=Particles, environments, and possible ecologies in the Jovian atmosphere |date=1976 |last1=Sagan |first1=C. |last2=Salpeter |first2=E.

==="Good Jupiters"===
"Good Jupiters" are gas giants, like the Solar System's [[Jupiter]], that orbit their stars in circular orbits far enough away from the habitable zone not to disturb it but close enough to "protect" terrestrial planets in closer orbit in two critical ways. First, they help to stabilize the orbits, and thereby the climates of the inner planets. Second, they keep the inner stellar system relatively free of comets and asteroids that could cause devastating impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Henry |last=Bortman |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1222 |title=Coming Soon: "Good" Jupiters |date=29 September 2004 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=5 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter orbits the Sun at about five times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This is the rough distance we should expect to find good Jupiters elsewhere. Jupiter's "caretaker" role was dramatically illustrated in 1994 when [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] impacted the giant.

However, the evidence is not quite so clear. Research has shown that Jupiter's role in determining the rate at which objects hit Earth is significantly more complicated than once thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horner |first=Jonathan |last2=Jones |first2=Barrie |title=Jupiter – Friend or Foe?

The role of Jupiter in the early history of the Solar System is somewhat better established, and the source of significantly less debate. Early in the Solar System's history, Jupiter is accepted as having played an important role in the hydration of our planet: it increased the eccentricity of [[asteroid belt]] orbits and enabled many to cross Earth's orbit and supply the planet with important volatiles such as water and carbon dioxide. Before Earth reached half its present mass, icy bodies from the Jupiter–Saturn region and small bodies from the primordial asteroid belt supplied water to the Earth due to the gravitational scattering of Jupiter and, to a lesser extent, [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lunine |first=Jonathan I. |date=30 January 2001 |title=The occurrence of Jovian planets and the habitability of planetary systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=809–814 |doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.809 |pmid=11158551 |pmc=14664 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98..809L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the gas giants are now helpful protectors, they were once suppliers of critical habitability material.

In contrast, Jupiter-sized bodies that orbit too close to the habitable zone but not in it (as in [[47 Ursae Majoris]]), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like [[16 Cygni|16 Cygni B]]) make it very difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a [[#A stable habitable zone|stable habitable zone]] above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a strongly inclined orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Porter |first1=Simon B. |last2=Grundy |first2=William M. |title=Post-capture Evolution of Potentially Habitable Exomoons |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=736 |issue=1 |page=L14 |date=July 2011 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/736/1/L14 |bibcode=2011ApJ...736L..14P |arxiv=1106.2800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life's impact on habitability ===
A supplement to the factors that support life's emergence is the notion that life itself, once formed, becomes a habitability factor in its own right. An important Earth example was the production of molecular oxygen gas ({{chem|O|2}}) by ancient [[cyanobacteria]], and eventually photosynthesizing plants, leading to a radical change in the composition of Earth's atmosphere. This environmental change is called the [[Great Oxygenation Event]]. This oxygen proved fundamental to the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] of later animal species. The [[Gaia hypothesis]], a  scientific model of the geo-biosphere pioneered by [[James Lovelock]] in 1975, argues that life as a whole fosters and maintains suitable conditions for itself by helping to create a planetary environment suitable for its continuity. Similarly, [[David Grinspoon]] has suggested a "living worlds hypothesis" in which our understanding of what constitutes habitability cannot be separated from life already extant on a planet. Planets that are geologically and meteorologically alive are much more likely to be biologically alive as well and "a planet and its life will co-evolve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1720 |title=The Living Worlds Hypothesis |date=22 September 2005 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=6 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the basis of [[Earth system science]].

Some Christians believe that certain New Testament figures are reincarnations of Old Testament figures. For example, [[John the Baptist]] is believed by some to be a reincarnation of the prophet [[Elijah]].&lt;ref name="cinemaseekers1"/&gt;

Other Christians believe the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus was fulfilled by reincarnation. [[Sun Myung Moon]], the founder of the [[Unification Church]], considered himself to be the fulfillment of Jesus' return.

===Catholicism===

The Catholic Church does not believe in reincarnation, which it regards as being incompatible with [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm#1013 |title=CCC - PART 1 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ARTICLE 11 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the leaders of certain [[sects]] in the church have taught that they are reincarnations of Mary - for example, Marie-Paule Giguère of the [[Community of the Lady of All Nations|Army of Mary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cccb.ca/site/Files/armyofmary.html |title=Army of Mary Doctrinal Note |publisher=Cccb.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Feliksa Kozłowska|Maria Franciszka]] of the former [[Mariavite Church|Mariavites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius X |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_05041906_tribus-circiter_en.html |title=Pius X, Tribus Circiter (05/04/1906) |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1904-09-04 |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in 1842, and was consequently 66 years of age. The deceased's first business training was in the office of the chief engineer of the old Devon and Cornwall Railway Co. In 1864 he was appointed manager of the Bristol and South Wales Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, Cardiff.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician who served as MP for the [[Swansea (UK Parliament constituency)|Swansea Town]] constituency from 1892 to 1895. He was regarded as being on the radical wing of the party and was popular with working-class electors. Defeated by Sir John Llewelyn in 1895 he was rejected as a candidate for the constituency in 1900 due to his opposition to the South African War.

==Early life==
Burnie was born in 1842 at [[Dawlish]] in South Devon where his father, John Dickson Burnie, was a builder and contractor. The family came originally from Dumfriesshire.&lt;ref name="Camb 1-7-92 Swansea"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Political Campaign in Swansea|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3339575/ART53|accessdate=23 May 2014|newspaper=Cambrian|date=1 July 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, Burnie worked in the railway trade and came to Swansea in 1870 when Shacklefgord, Ford &amp; Co., the works at Cheltenham, where he was general manager, were re-located.&lt;ref name="Camb 1-7-92 Swansea" /&gt; He became general manager of the firm in 1876.

==Public Life==
Burnie was elected to the Sweansea Town Council in 1877 and became active in the municipal life of the town, serving as Mayor and Chairman of the Harbour Trust. In 1889, however, the year Swansea became a County Borough, he chose to stand down.&lt;ref name="Camb 25-10-89 Burnie"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Robert D. Burnie and his Constituents. A Farewell Meeting|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3338385/ART17|accessdate=25 May 2014|newspaper=Cambrian|date=25 October 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
By the 1890s, Burnie was building a political reputation beyond his adopted town. In 1890 he was nominated to be Liberal candidate for the vacancy in [[East Carmarthenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Carmarthenshire]] following the death of [[David Pugh (British politician)|David Pugh]] but he withdrew before the selection conference.&lt;ref name="CJ 18-7-90 East Carms"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Vacancy for East Carmarthenshire.|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3761458/3761464/54|accessdate=8 December 2016|newspaper=Carmarthen Journal|date=18 July 1890|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became treasurer of the Welsh Farmer's Defence Fund, which was formed in light of tithe agitation, and in early 1892 he made a tour through the counties of South Wales where protests had taken place.&lt;ref name="Camb 1-7-92 Swansea" /&gt; He came close to winning the Liberal nomination at Chelsea and also at Mid Glamorgan where he was narrowly defeated in 1890 by [[Samuel Thomas Evans]] largely. it was stated, due to Evans being a Welsh-speaking Welshman.&lt;ref name="Camb 1-7-92 Swansea" /&gt;

===Member of Parliament for Swansea===
The death of the siting member of Swansea Town, [[Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn]], shortly before the 1892 General Election led to Burnie being selected as candidate.&lt;ref name="Camb 1-7-92 Swansea" /&gt;

Burnie launched his campaign at a public meeting at the Albert Hall, Swansea, where Sir Hussey Vivian presided and endorsed Burnie's campaign in a speech resonating with references to his own father's time as MP for Swansea. Vivian's intervention may have been calculated to counter the impact of the Conservatives' decision to adopt Sir John Llewelyn, a very popular figure locally and nephew of the late member, Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn.&lt;ref name="Camb 1-7-92 Lib meeting"&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Enthusiastic Liberal Demonstration at the Albert Hall|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3339575/ART54|accessdate=24 May 2014|newspaper=Cambrian|date=1 July 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been defeated in 1895, Burnie was again adopted as candidate in 1900. However, he withdrew over his opposition to the South African War.&lt;ref name="SWDN 3-7-00"&gt;{{cite news|title=Representation of Swansea Town.

'''Shri Ram Chandra Mission''' (also named '''SRCM''' or "'''Sahaj Marg'''") is a [[non-profit organization]] and a spiritual movement. It was registered in 1945 in India by Shri Ram Chandraji of Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.  It has its current world headquarters at [[Manapakkam]], [[Chennai]], Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SRCM World Headquarters |url=http://www.sahajmarg.org/smww/headquarters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and practice==
The stated purpose of the Shri Ram Chandra Mission is to "awaken the divine consciousness and provide support on the path of human evolution". According to the movement, the form of [[Raja Yoga]] practiced, starts at step number 7 of Patanjali's Raja Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Role of the Abhyasi in Sahaj Marg. |url=https://www.sahajmarg.org/publications/research-articles/role-of-the-abhyasi-in-sahaj-marg |publisher=Shri Ram Chandra Mission |accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on simple and natural means suited to current living conditions and does not involve mechanical methods involving austerity and penance. It is universal, easily practicable and one can quickly get to find oneself from the inside out.&lt;ref name="Golden"&gt;{{cite book |title=Golden Jubilee |publisher=SRCM |isbn=2-906219-17-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sahaj Marg system uses the cleansing of the past impressions (also called [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|samskaras]]), [[meditation]] on the heart and the support of a living spiritual master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A flexible mind |url=http://www.ayl.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/articles/AYL_issue_7_FLEXIBLE_MIND.pdf |first=Elizabet |last=Denley |journal=Australian Yoga Life |volume=7 |format=pfd |accessdate=4 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806221329/http://www.ayl.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/articles/AYL_issue_7_FLEXIBLE_MIND.pdf |archivedate=6 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the spiritual teacher is said to be essential as he is well aware of all issues and all matters of [[spirituality]] and has walked the path of realization or enlightenment of the soul, being a Master of the path. He knows what to do for the traveler.&lt;ref name="Golden"/&gt; He is regarded by the practitioners as a living example, a teacher by his writings and by his words, deeds and being. "It is God who is the true [[Guru]] and Master and from God alone we receive the light", wrote Shri Ram Chandraji in his book ''Reality at Dawn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sahaj Marg, le Septième Darshana, La Réalité à l'Aube |publisher=Infolio |isbn=978-2-88474-603-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SRCM offers its services of [[Sahaj Marg]] system of meditation to all seekers without any bias of religion, nationality, color, race, gender, caste or class. There are no fees charged by SRCM at any stage of spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/Proving-science-behind-spirituality/article14029690.ece | title=Proving science behind spirituality | date=31 January 2016 | first=A.D. | last=Rangarajan | newspaper=The Hindu | accessdate=21 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The current president of Shri Ram Chandra Mission and spiritual Master of the Sahaj Marg system is Shri [[Kamlesh Patel]] (b. 1956). This includes SRCM USA, which was registered in California in 1997 (SRCM California-1997) and SRCM India, which was registered in Lucknow, India in the year 1945 (SRCM-Shahjahanpur-1945). SRCM was named after the Adi Guru Shri Ram Chandraji of Fatehgarh (aka ‘Lalaji’) and was founded by his successor Shri Ram Chandra of Shahjahanpur, affectionately known as Babuji (1899 - 1983). He was succeeded as president and spiritual Master of SRCM by Shri [[Parthasarathi Rajagopalachari]], affectionately known as Chariji (1927 - 2014). Following the death  of Chariji on 20 December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=21st December 2014 |url=https://www.thehindu.com/obituary/21st-december-2014/article6716140.ece |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shri [[Kamlesh Patel]] has become the third president of SRCM and the fourth spiritual Master of the Sahaj Marg system.

Babuji was taught by Shri Ram Chandra of Fatehgarh (aka ‘Lalaji’), the Adi Guru of the Sahaj Marg system. Although Babuji met Lalaji merely a few times physically, Babuji eventually became his spiritual successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Les nouvelles voies spirituelles: enquête sur la religiosité parallèle en Suisse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmn2yDLUYuMC&amp;pg=PA213 |first=Jean-François |last=Mayer |authorlink=Jean-François Mayer |page=213 |language=French |place=Lausanne |publisher=L'Âge d'Homme |year=1993 |isbn=2-8251-0412-4 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lalalji rediscovered the ancient yogic method of spiritual training based on yogic transmission of divine energy called Pranahuti.

The Shri Ram Chandra Mission is now present in over 120 countries on all continents. Books published by SRCM have been translated to over twenty languages and read widely across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sahaj Marg system of meditation |url=http://sundaytimes.lk/080803/Plus/sundaytimesplus_11.html |journal=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=3 August 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiritual Hierarchy Publication Trust (SHPT) was registered on 8 April 2009, with its headquarters at Kolkata, India. The SHPT undertakes all publication activities under license from the Shri Ram Chandra Mission (SRCM) and the Sahaj Marg Spirituality Foundation(SMSF).&lt;ref name="SHPT"&gt;[https://www.shpt.in/?route=information/information&amp;information_id=4/ Spiritual Hierarchy Publication Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Shri Ram Chandra Mission, registered in India in the year 1945 and having its world headquarters in Chennai, India, is an [[NGO]] recognized by the [[United Nations Department of Public Information]] (UNDPI) as a "non-profit organization" in Denmark, the United States and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Department of Public Information – Non-governmental organizations |url=http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;profileCode=610124 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SRCM in collaboration with the [[United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan]] hosts the 'All India Essay Writing Event', an annual essay writing event for school and college students across India, where prizes are awarded for national and state level winners. In 2014, a total of 1,85,751 students from 11,857 schools and colleges across the India took part in this annual contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/srikakulam-youth-shines-in-essay-contest/article6822459.ece | title= Srikakulam youth shines in essay contest | date=26 January 2015 | newspaper=The Hindu | accessdate=9 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2017, the event was hosted with participants writing essays in English, Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.

Shri Ram Chandra Mission, Kanha Shantivanam, was awarded the `Haritha Mitra' (Green Friend) Award by the Telangana government in 2016, in recognition of exemplary contribution to the greening movement undertaken by the Government of Telangana by Deputy Chief Minister Mahmood Ali of [[Telangana State]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/award-for-green-commitment/article19506739.ece Award for green commitment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, [[Ram Nath Kovind]], the [[President of India]], [[E.S.L. Narasimhan]], [[Governor of Andhra Pradesh|Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana]] visited SRCM's Kanha Shantivanam Ashram and planted 100,000th tree with [[Kamlesh Patel]] under the Green Kanha initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kovind visits ashram near Hyderabad, plants sapling|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/kovind-visits-ashram-near-hyderabad-plants-sapling-117122500591_1.html|agency=IANS|publisher=[[Business Standard]]|date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Telangana: Green drive –18 crore more saplings planted than before|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/pets-and-environment/261217/telangana-green-drive-18-crore-more-saplings-planted-than-before.html|publisher=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Observing International Day of Peace|url=https://telanganatoday.com/observing-international-day-of-peace|publisher=[[Telangana Today]]|date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SRCM's Kanha Shantivanam, a sprawling 700-acre ashram, when completed in a year's time will house a world-class archive, cultural center, a library and a museum all dedicated to narrating the history and current relevance of Yoga. The meditation hall will be able to house close to 50,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/over-300-trees-uprooted-for-road-widening-get-new-lease-of-life-in-kanha-shantivanam/articleshow/60717887.cms Kanha Shantivanam's Green Initaitive]&lt;/ref&gt;
Kanha Shantivanam is also an ex-situ conservation centre, where rare and threatened plant species are being collected from across India. More than 300 mature trees earmarked for felling because of different road works have been transplanted in Kanha Shantivanam. Another 100 coconut trees marked for felling in Tamil Nadu have also been transplanted there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Hyderabad-Tab/2017-12-27/Prez-plants-saplings-at-Ashram/348201 Rare and threatened plant species are being collected at Kanha Shantivanam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seychelles frogs''' ('''Sooglossidae''') are a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[frogs]] found on the [[Seychelles|Seychelles Islands]] and [[India]]. Until recently, this family was believed to include the genera ''[[Nesomantis]]'' and ''[[Sooglossus]]'', but following a major revision of amphibians in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/5781/1/B297.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the genus ''Nesomantis'' was named a junior synonym of ''Sooglossus''; conversely, the recently discovered [[purple frog]], which was initially assigned to a distinct [[monotypic]] family ('''Nasikabatrachidae'''), is now included in the Sooglossidae.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Darrel R. 2006. Amphibian Species of the World: an online reference. Version 4.0 (17 August 2006). Electronic Database accessible at [http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/index.php]. American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the species are relatively small terrestrial frogs, about {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, hiding under fallen leaves or in rock crevices. They are unusual for the [[neobatrachia]]ls, in that they undertake inguinal amplexus, a primitive version of [[amplexus]]. Except for ''[[Purple frog|N. sahyadrensis]]'', they lay their eggs on moist ground, rather than in water. Several species lack [[tadpole]]s, with the eggs hatching directly into froglets.&lt;ref name=EoR&gt;{{cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G. |editor2=Zweifel, R.G.|author= Zweifel, Richard G.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 104–105|isbn= 0-12-178560-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tadpoles of'' [[Seychelles frog|S. sechellensis]]'' are carried, abnormally, on the backs of the female frogs until [[metamorphosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Animals:Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no fossil record for the family. Ancestors diverged when the Seychelles Islands split from India about 100 million years ago.

==Taxonomy==
The family was first described in 1931 by [[Gladwyn Kingsley Noble]] (1894–1940).

**''[[Sechellophryne gardineri]]'' (Gardiner's Seychelles frog)

==Plot==
One afternoon in [[San Francisco]], Adaline Bowman purchases fake IDs at an apartment before returning home to feed her dog. She then goes to work and opens a box of film reels, which highlight historical events and times. A voiceover ties together the film reels explaining the story of Adaline's life so far. She was born on New Years Day 1908, then later married and gave birth to a daughter, only to become a widow after her husband died in a tragic accident. Years later, in 1937, Adaline crashed her car when she swerved into a ravine during a snowstorm and died in the freezing lake nearby, but a lightning strike suddenly revived her. From that moment on, Adaline has stayed physically 29 years old.

One night, two suspicious FBI agents attempt to force her onto an airplane for study, but she escapes captivity and realizes that she will have to spend the rest of her life on the run. Ever since, she has changed her identification and address according to the era, while her daughter Flemming ages normally, to the point where she appears older than Adaline.

On [[New Year's Eve]] in the present year, she attends a party where she meets Ellis Jones, introducing herself as her current alias, Jennifer. He asks to see her again but she refuses, knowing she can never fall in love because she can never have a normal future with someone. The next day at work, Ellis arrives and again asks Adaline to go on a date with him. Finally she accepts.

In a flashback, Adaline is shown pulling up in a cab to a park where a man is waiting, holding an engagement ring. Scared, she asks the cab driver to keep going. Back in the present day, Adaline's dog falls ill and she begins to ignore Ellis' calls. He shows up at her apartment but she pushes him away, only to have a change of heart while looking through some old photographs and realizing she doesn't want to live the same year a hundred times without having a natural life.

They later resolve their argument and Ellis asks Adaline to attend the party at his parents' house celebrating his parents' fortieth anniversary, and she says yes. Upon their arrival, Ellis introduces her to his father, William, who recognizes her instantly and calls her Adaline. She appears to recognize him, too, but lies, telling him that Adaline was her mother, who has since died. A flashback shows how they met and came to be in love, soon revealing that he was the man with the engagement ring she stood up that afternoon. One night, Ellis tells Adaline he is falling in love with her and she is unsure of how to react.

The following day, Adaline talks with William outside and he notices a scar on her left hand, and becomes shaken. Another flashback reveals that Adaline cut her hand while they were hiking decades ago and he had stitched it up himself. He realizes that she is truly Adaline and confronts her. She becomes upset, claiming she used to be "normal" and doesn't know what changed her. He begs her not to run, for Ellis' sake, but she says she doesn't know how to stay. She flees and returns to the house, writing a note to Ellis while he showers, then she packs her things and leaves. Moments later, Ellis finds the letter and confronts his father, who refuses to explain.

While driving home, Adaline thinks of all the times she has run and suddenly has a change of heart about the way she lives her life. She stops and calls her daughter to tell her she is going to stop running. As she turns the car around, a tow truck plows into her in a hit-and-run accident, leaving her to die. Freezing and helpless, Adaline dies again. An ambulance arrives and she is revived by the electricity of the defibrillator. Later in the hospital, she wakes up to Ellis, and the two profess their love for one another. Adaline then tells him of her 107 years of life.

One year later, Ellis and Adaline are going to a New Year's Eve party. As she is leaving, she notices something strange in the hallway mirror: her first grey hair, proving she has begun to age naturally again. When Ellis asks if she is okay, she responds: "Yes... Perfect."

They created a custom "Fashion Journey Through the Decades" initiative, through which a fashion influencer from [[YouTube]] or [[Maker Studios]] created a unique look inspired by the film. Video ads were also released on [[Instagram]] and tutorials on [[Pinterest]]. Advance screenings for fashion and lifestyle influencers took place in partnership with [[Gilt City]].

===Critical response===
''The Age of Adaline'' has received mixed reviews from critics, although the performances of Blake Lively and Harrison Ford received very positive reviews and were cited as some of their best work in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/22/age-of-adaline-review-blake-lively-harrison-ford|title= The Age of Adaline review|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=May 9, 2015|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 56%, based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's consensus reads "''The Age of Adaline'' ruminates on mortality less compellingly than similarly themed films, but is set apart by memorable performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_age_of_adaline/|title=The Age of Adaline (2015)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-age-of-adaline|title=The Age of Adaline|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive|CBS Interactive Inc.]]|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave ''The Age of Adaline'' an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/age-of-adaline-overhauls-furious-7-at-friday-box-office/|title=‘Age of Adaline’ Overhauls ‘Furious 7’ at Friday Box Office|work=[[TheWrap]]|accessdate=April 26, 2015|author=Cunningham, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matt Zoller Seitz]] of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave the film three out of four stars, expressing surprise at the film's increase in quality midway through: "I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay." He also gave high praise to Harrison Ford's dramatic performance, writing that "Ford's voice—always deep, lowered an octave by age and one more by William's longing—is even more powerful [than the devastating look on his face]. This is Ford's best performance since ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', maybe since ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seitz|first1=Matt Zoller Seitz|authorlink1=Matt Zoller Seitz|title=The Age of Adaline Movie Review (2015)|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-age-of-adaline-2015|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=23 December 2017|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Falling''''' is a 2014 British mystery [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Carol Morley]]. It stars [[Maisie Williams]] and [[Florence Pugh]] as best friends at an all-girls school. The film also stars [[Greta Scacchi]], [[Monica Dolan]], [[Maxine Peake]], and [[Mathew Baynton]]. Production began in October 2013. The film premiered at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] on 11 October 2014 and was released theatrically on 24 April 2015 in the UK. ''The Falling'' earned £468,762 on a £750,000 budget.

== Plot ==
In 1969, Lydia and Abbie are best friends at an English girls school. Lydia, the neglected daughter of an [[agoraphobic]] mother, becomes fixated on Abbie, who has begun to explore her sexuality. After having sex with Lydia's brother Kenneth in an attempt to abort her pregnancy by another boy, Abbie begins to suffer from [[Mass psychogenic illness|fainting spells]]. She suffers an episode after a stint in detention with Lydia and dies in the process. Following Abbie's burial, Lydia begins suffering as well from fainting spells, and it soon becomes an epidemic, with numerous girls and a young teacher in the school spontaneously passing out for no more than a few seconds. Lydia becomes convinced that the administration must take action, much to the chagrin of the school principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfilms/articles/the_falling_begins_shoot |title=Independent Announces Start of Shoot for Carol Morley's Film ''The Falling'' |work=[[BBC Films]] |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an assembly becomes disrupted by a mass fainting episode, the school is temporarily shut down and all affected students are hospitalized and psychoanalysed. When no cause for the spells is discovered, the school is reopened and Lydia is expelled. That same night, the virginal Lydia has sex with Kenneth, with whom she has developed an incestuous relationship after Abbie's death. However their mother Eileen catches them and, armed with a pair of scissors, angrily forces Kenneth out of the house before launching into an argument with her daughter, in which she brands Lydia dangerous and that she ought to be locked up. Eileen also reveals that Lydia and Kenneth are only half-siblings; Lydia being the product of a rape. 

Upon learning this, Lydia runs out of the house and Eileen follows her outside, despite having never ventured outside in over 16 years. Searching for Lydia, Eileen is overcome with flashbacks of her own sexual assault, and eventually locates Lydia; who has climbed to the top of a tree in a breakdown over Abbie's death. Eileen pleads with Lydia to come down, but she laughs, challenging her mother's lack of maternal affection, before losing her footing and leaping from the tree into a lake. 

Distraught, Eileen ventures into the water and cradles Lydia's seemingly drowned body, realizing that her emotional frigidity had done more harm to her daughter than she knew. Lydia regains consciousness, and the film ends with the two women in a crying embrace.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Umbilical cord prolapse''' is when, during [[Childbirth|labor]], the [[umbilical cord]] comes out of the [[uterus]] with or before the presenting part of the [[baby]].&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt; The concern with cord prolapse is that pressure on the cord from the baby will compromising [[blood]] flow to the baby.&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The greatest risk factor is having had more than two previous children with the current baby in an abnormally positioned within the uterus.&lt;ref name=Say2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayed Ahmed |first1=WA |last2=Hamdy |first2=MA |title=Optimal management of umbilical cord prolapse. |journal=International Journal of Women's Health |date=2018 |volume=10 |pages=459–465 |doi=10.2147/IJWH.S130879 |pmid=30174462|pmc=6109652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other risks include a [[Premature birth|premature]] or small baby, [[twin pregnancy]], and [[too much amniotic fluid]].&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Say2018/&gt; Whether [[amniotomy|medical rupture of the amniotic sac]] is a risk is controversial.&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Say2018/&gt; The diagnosis should be suspected if there is a sudden decrease in the babies heart rate during labor.&lt;ref name=Hol2013/&gt; Seeing or feeling the cord confirms the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Hol2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Management focuses on quick delivery, usually by [[cesarean section]].&lt;ref name=Hol2013/&gt; Filling the bladder or pushing up the baby by hand is recommended until this can take place.&lt;ref name=Hol2013/&gt; The [[knee-chest position]], or if this is not possible [[Trendelenburg position]] may be used.&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt; With appropriate management, the majority of cases have good outcomes.&lt;ref name=Hol2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Umbilical cord prolapse occurs in about 1 in 500 pregnancies.&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lore |first1=Marybeth |title=Umbilical Cord Prolapse and Other Cord Emergencies |journal=The Global Library of Women's Medicine |date=March 2017 |doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of death of the baby is about 10%.&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt; Much of this risk is due to [[congenital anomalies]] or [[premature birth|prematurity]], however.&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt; It is considered an emergency.&lt;ref name=Hol2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holbrook |first1=BD |last2=Phelan |first2=ST |title=Umbilical cord prolapse. |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America |date=March 2013 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2012.11.002 |pmid=23466132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The first sign of umbilical cord prolapse is usually a sudden [[bradycardia|decrease in fetal heart rate]] that is severe and does not immediately resolve. On a fetal heart tracing, this would usually look like moderate to severe [[cardiotocography#deceleration|variable decelerations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tejani|first1=NA|last2=Mann|first2=LI|last3=Sanghavi|first3=M|last4=Bhakthavathsalan|first4=A|last5=Weiss|first5=RR|title=The association of umbilical cord complications and variable decelerations with acid-base findings.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=February 1977|volume=49|issue=2|pages=159–62|pmid=13333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the cord can be seen or felt on vaginal examination, particularly with overt cord prolapse.

==Risk factors==
Risk factors that are associated with umbilical cord prolapse tend to make it difficult for the fetus from appropriately engaging and filling the maternal pelvis or are related to abnormalities of the umbilical cord. The two major categories of risk factors are spontaneous and [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]], or those that result from medical intervention.
* '''spontaneous factors''':
** fetal malpresentation:&lt;ref name="kahana"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahana|first1=B|last2=Sheiner|first2=E|last3=Levy|first3=A|last4=Lazer|first4=S|last5=Mazor|first5=M|title=Umbilical cord prolapse and perinatal outcomes.|journal=International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics|date=February 2004|volume=84|issue=2|pages=127–32|pmid=14871514|doi=10.1016/s0020-7292(03)00333-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; abnormal fetal lie tends to result in space below the fetus in the maternal pelvis, which can then be occupied by the cord.
** [[polyhydramnios]], or an abnormally high amount of amniotic fluid&lt;ref name="kahana" /&gt;
** [[premature birth|prematurity]]: likely related to increased chance of malpresentation and relative polyhydramnios.&lt;ref name="kahana" /&gt;
** [[low birth weight]]:&lt;ref name="critchlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Critchlow|first1=CW|last2=Leet|first2=TL|last3=Benedetti|first3=TJ|last4=Daling|first4=JR|title=Risk factors and infant outcomes associated with umbilical cord prolapse: a population-based case-control study among births in Washington State.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=February 1994|volume=170|issue=2|pages=613–8|pmid=8116723|doi=10.1016/s0002-9378(94)70238-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually described as &lt;2500 g at birth, though some studies will use &lt;1500g. Cause is likely similar to those for prematurity.
** [[multiple gestation]], or being pregnant with more than one fetus at a given time:&lt;ref name="critchlow" /&gt; more likely to occur in the fetus that is not born first.
** spontaneous [[rupture of membranes]]:&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=DJ|last2=MacKenzie|first2=IZ|title=The mortality and morbidity associated with umbilical cord prolapse.|journal=British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|date=October 1995|volume=102|issue=10|pages=826–30|pmid=7547741|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1995.tb10850.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; about half of prolapses occur within 5 minutes of membrane rupture, two-thirds within 1 hour, 95% within 24 hours.
* '''treatment associated factors'''
** [[artificial rupture of membranes]]&lt;ref name="usta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Usta|first1=IM|last2=Mercer|first2=BM|last3=Sibai|first3=BM|title=Current obstetrical practice and umbilical cord prolapse.|journal=American Journal of Perinatology|date=1999|volume=16|issue=9|pages=479–84|pmid=10774764|doi=10.1055/s-1999-6809}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** placement of internal monitors (for example, [[internal scalp electrode]] or [[intrauterine pressure catheter]])&lt;ref name="usta" /&gt;
** [[external cephalic version|manual rotation of fetal head]]&lt;ref name="usta" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Umbilical cord prolapse should always be considered a possibility when there is a sudden decrease in fetal heart rate or variable decelerations, particularly after the rupture of membranes. With overt prolapses, the diagnosis can be confirmed if the cord can be palpated on vaginal examination. Without overt prolapse, the diagnosis can only be confirmed after a [[cesarean section]], though even then it will not always be evident at time of procedure.&lt;ref name="lin" /&gt;

===Classification===
There are three types of umbilical prolapse that can occur:&lt;ref name="lin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=MG|title=Umbilical cord prolapse.|journal=Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey|date=April 2006|volume=61|issue=4|pages=269–77|pmid=16551378|doi=10.1097/01.ogx.0000208802.20908.c6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''overt umbilical cord prolapse''': descent of the umbilical cord past the presenting fetal part. In this case, the cord is through the [[cervix]] and into or beyond the [[vagina]]. Overt umbilical cord prolapse requires rupture of membranes. This is the most common type of cord prolapse.
* '''occult umbilical prolapse''': descent of the umbilical cord alongside the presenting fetal part, but has not advanced past the presenting fetal part. Occult umbilical prolapse can occur with both intact or ruptured membranes.
* '''funic (cord) presentation''': presence of the umbilical cord between the presenting fetal part and fetal membranes. In this case, the cord has not passed the opening of the cervix. In funic presentation, the membranes are not yet ruptured.

==Management==
[[File:Herself; talks with women concerning themselves (1911) (14781210692).jpg|thumb|The knee-chest position is typically recommended&lt;ref name=GLOWM2017/&gt;]]

The gold standard for treatment of umbilical cord prolapse in the setting of a [[fetal viability|viable pregnancy]] typically involves immediate delivery by the quickest and safest route possible. This usually requires cesarean section, especially if the woman is in early labor. Occasionally, vaginal delivery will be attempted if clinical judgment determines that is a safer or quicker method.&lt;ref name="lin" /&gt;

Other interventions during management of cord prolapse are typically used to decrease the chance of complications while preparations for delivery are being made. These interventions are focused on reducing pressure on the cord to prevent fetal complications from cord compression. The following maneuvers are among those used in clinical practice:
* manual elevation of the presenting fetal part &lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duval|first1=C|last2=Lemoine|first2=JP|last3=Ba|first3=S|last4=Demory|first4=JE|title=[Prolapse of the umbilical cord. 79 cases].|journal=Revue Francaise de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique|date=March 1987|volume=82|issue=3|pages=163–7|pmid=3589354}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* repositioning of the mother to be [[trendelenburg position|head down with feet elevated]] 
* filling of the [[bladder]] by a [[foley catheter]] to elevate the presenting fetal part &lt;ref name="lin" /&gt;
* use of [[tocolytic]]s (medications to suppress labor) have been proposed, usually in addition to bladder filling rather than a standalone intervention &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Z|last2=Shoham|first2=Z|last3=Lancet|first3=M|last4=Blickstein|first4=I|last5=Mogilner|first5=BM|last6=Zalel|first6=Y|title=Management of labor with umbilical cord prolapse: a 5-year study.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=August 1988|volume=72|issue=2|pages=278–81|pmid=3393364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the mother is far from delivery, funic reduction (manually placing the cord back into the uterine cavity) has been attempted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=ed. by Kate Grady ... [et|title=Managing obstetric emergencies and trauma : the MOET course  manual.|date=2007|publisher=RCOG Press|location=London|isbn=978-1904752-219|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; with successful cases reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=JM|title=Funic reduction for the management of umbilical cord prolapse.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=September 1991|volume=165|issue=3|pages=654–7|pmid=1892193|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(91)90303-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
The primary concern with umbilical cord prolapse is inadequate blood supply, and thus oxygen, to the fetus if the cord becomes compressed. The cord can become compressed either due to mechanical pressure (usually from the presenting fetal part) or from [[vasospasm|sudden contraction of the vessels]] due to decreased temperatures in the vagina in comparison to the uterus.&lt;ref name="lin" /&gt; This can lead to [[perinatal mortality|death of the fetus]] or other complications.

Historically, the rate of fetal death in the setting of cord prolapse has been as high 40%.&lt;ref name="koonings"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koonings|first1=PP|last2=Paul|first2=RH|last3=Campbell|first3=K|title=Umbilical cord prolapse. A contemporary look.|journal=The Journal of Reproductive Medicine|date=July 1990|volume=35|issue=7|pages=690–2|pmid=2376856}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these estimates occurred in the context of home or births outside of the hospital. When considering cord prolapses that have occurred in inpatient labor and delivery settings, the rate drops to as low as 0-3%,&lt;ref name="lin" /&gt; though the mortality rate remains higher than for fetuses without cord prolapse. The reduction in mortality for hospital births is likely due to the ready availability of immediate cesarean section.

Many other fetal outcomes have been studied, including [[Apgar score]] (a quick assessment of a newborn's health status) at 5 minutes and length of hospitalization after delivery. While both measures are worse for newborns delivered after cord prolapse,&lt;ref name="kahana"/&gt; it is unclear what effect this has in the long-term. Relatively large studies that have tried to quantify long-term effects of cord prolapse on children found that less than 1% (1 in 120 studied) suffered a major neurologic handicap,&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt; and less than 1% (110 in 16,675) had diagnosed cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=WM|last2=Jacoby|first2=BN|last3=Xing|first3=G|last4=Danielsen|first4=B|last5=Smith|first5=LH|title=Adverse obstetric events are associated with significant risk of cerebral palsy.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=October 2010|volume=203|issue=4|pages=328.e1–5|pmid=20598283|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2010.05.013|pmc=2947602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Rates of umbilical cord prolapse ranges from 0.1-0.6% of all pregnancies.&lt;ref name="lin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="koonings" /&gt; This rate has remained stable over time. A recent study estimates 77% of cord prolapses occur in singleton pregnancies, or those where there is only one fetus. In twin pregnancies, cord prolapses occur more frequently in the second twin to be delivered, with 9% in the first twin and 14% in the second twin.&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt;

{{redirect|Win win}}
A '''win–win game''' is a [[game]] that, in game design or [[game theory]], is designed in a way that all participants can profit from it in one way or the other. In [[conflict resolution]], a '''win–win strategy''' is a collaborative strategy and conflict resolution process that aims to accommodate all participants.&lt;ref name=WWS-D-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWS-D-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWS-D-03/&gt; In [[economics]], it is a voluntary transaction where both parties gain wealth, as in [[the double thank-you of capitalism]].

==Types==
* In colloquial speech, a win–win situation often refers to a situation where one benefits, not necessarily through someone else's loss.
* In the context of [[group-dynamic game]]s, win–win games are also called "[[cooperative game]]s", "new games" or "games without losers".
* Mathematical [[game theory]] also refers to win–win games as [[non-zero-sum game]]s (although they may include situations where both players win or lose, as well).
* The TKI Thomas/Kilmann Conflict Profile provides a model that reveals preferences under stress and pressure. [[Collaboration]] style focuses on win–win outcomes.

===Group dynamics===
Group-dynamics win–win games have been increasingly popular since the end of the Vietnam war and have been successfully applied to all levels of society.

Group-dynamics win–win games emphasize the importance of cooperation, fun, sharing, caring and overall group success in contrast to domination, egoistic behavior and personal gain. All players are treated as equally important and valuable. Win–win games often also carry an ethical message of caring for the environment and a [[holistic]] approach to life and society. Win–win games are a powerful tool to give people [[self-confidence]] and a "we" experience, especially when they have suffered from emotional isolation.

An example would be a game where all players try to carry a huge "earth ball" (a ball several meters in diameter) over their heads while negotiating an obstacle course. This is a typical example of a win–win game for several reasons:
* There are no losers (everyone enjoys the accomplished task).
* All players are involved (no-one is left out or sits out).
* The game is psychologically working on many levels (communication, supporting each other, having fun in a group etc.)

There are also mathematical win–win games, the mathematical term being [[non-zero-sum games]]. Such games are often simply represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of payouts.
