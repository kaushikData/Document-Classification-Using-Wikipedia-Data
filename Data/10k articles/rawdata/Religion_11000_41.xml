'''''A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love'''''  is a 2003 book of selected essays and other writings by [[Richard Dawkins]]. Published five years after Dawkins's previous book ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]'', it contains essays covering subjects including [[pseudoscience]], [[genetic determinism]], [[memetics]], [[terrorism]], [[religion]] and [[creationism]]. A section of the book is devoted to Dawkins' late adversary [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

The book's title is a reference to a quotation of [[Charles Darwin]], made in reference to Darwin's lack of belief in how "a perfect world" was [[teleological argument|designed]] by God (and a reference to Reverend [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]]):
"What a book a devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low and horridly cruel works of nature!"&lt;ref&gt;This was written in 1857 as Darwin worked towards the [[publication of Darwin's theory#Struggle for existence|publication of his theory]], and has been related to his memories of [[Charles Darwin's education#Second year doldrums|his time at university]] when an "Infidel home missionary tour" by the Reverend [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]] warned Darwin of the dangers of dissent from church doctrine. While Taylor was subsequently nicknamed "the devil's chaplain," the term goes back further, and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] has [[The Parson's Prologue and Tale|his Parson]] say "Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that syngen evere placebo" in a reference to [[Placebo (at funeral)]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/scienceandnature/story/0,6000,892495,00.html "Darwin's child"], profile by Simon Hattenstone, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Robin McKie reviewed the book for ''[[The Observer]]'' and stated that the book contained a mixture of touching essays and "the good, old knockabout stuff at which Dawkins excels".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/09/scienceandnature.highereducation|first=Robin|last=McKie|title=Dawkins versus the priests and New Age shamans?

The '''Alliance of Black Jews''' was an [[United States|American]] organization that was started in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1995 by a group of [[African American]]s who self-identified as [[Jew]]s and [[Black Hebrews]]. At the time, they estimated that there were about 200,000 black Jews in the United States. The figure, which included [[Black Hebrew Israelite]]s (not recognized as Jews by [[Judaism#Jewish Denominations|mainstream Judaism]]), as well as [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[African-American Jews]] by birth or [[Conversion to Judaism|conversion]], was based in part on the 1990 Jewish Population Study, which gave figures ranging from 135,000 to 260,000, depending on the [[Who is a Jew?|definition of a Jew]].

The individuals involved in forming the organization included [[Robin Washington]], Michelle Stein-Evers, and [[Rabbi]] [[Capers Funnye|Capers C. Funnye Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ortamerica.org/site/DocServer/Summer_1995.pdf?docID=921 |title=Black Jews: Changing the Face of American Jewry |accessdate=2008-03-16 |author=Miriam Rinn |date=Summer 1995 |format=PDF |work=The Reporter |publisher=[[World ORT|Women's American ORT]] |pages=11–13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725131217/http://www.ortamerica.org/site/DocServer/Summer_1995.pdf?docID=921 |archivedate=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is no longer operational.

The king (center) receives the ring of kingship from [[Mithra]] (right). On the left, apparently sanctifying the investiture, stands a female figure generally assumed to be Anahita (but see [[#Khosrau II investiture scene|remark]], below).]]

'''Anahita''' {{IPAc-en|ɑː|n|ɑː|h|iː|t|ɑː|}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; is the [[Old Persian]] form of the name of an [[Iran]]ian goddess and appears in complete and earlier form as '''{{lang|ae|Aredvi Sura Anahita}}''' (''{{lang|ae|Arədvī Sūrā Anāhitā}}''), the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] name of an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] cosmological figure venerated as the divinity of "the Waters" ([[Aban]]) and hence associated with fertility, healing and wisdom. Aredvi Sura Anahita is ''Ardwisur Anahid'' or '''Nahid''' in [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and [[Persian language|Modern Persian]], and ''[[Anahit]]'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003"/&gt; An iconic shrine cult of Aredvi Sura Anahita was – together with other shrine cults – "introduced apparently in the 4th century BCE and lasted until it was suppressed in the wake of an iconoclastic movement under the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]]."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975b_454"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975b|p=454}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek and Roman historians of [[classical antiquity]] refer to her either as '''Anaïtis''' or identified her with one of the divinities from their own pantheons. [[270 Anahita]], a silicaceous [[S-type asteroid]], is named after her. Based on the development of her cult, she was described as a [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] goddess, which was composed of two independent elements. The first is a manifestation of the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] idea of the Heavenly River who provides the waters to the rivers and streams flowing in the earth  while the second is that of a goddess with an uncertain origin, though maintaining her own unique characteristics, became associated with the cult of the ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n goddess [[Inanna|Inanna-Ishtar]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Ancient Iranian Religion: Readings from the Avesta and Achaemenid Inscriptions|last=Malandra|first=William|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1983|isbn=0816611149|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a theory, this is attributed partly to a desire to make Anahita part of [[Zoroastrianism]] after diffusing from the extreme northwest to the rest of Persia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Nomenclature===
Only ''{{lang|ae|Arədvī}}'' (a word otherwise unknown, perhaps with an original meaning "moist") is specific to the divinity.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The words ''{{lang|ae|sūra}}'' and ''{{lang|ae|anāhīta}}'' are generic [[Avestan language]] adjectives,&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_29"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and respectively mean "mighty" and "pure".&lt;ref name="Lommel_1927_29"&gt;{{harvnb|Lommel|1927|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_202"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both adjectives also appear as epithets of other divinities or divine concepts such as {{lang|ae|[[Haoma]]}}&lt;ref name="Gray_1926_99"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1926|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Fravashi]]s.&lt;ref name="Gray_1926_133"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1926|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both adjectives are also attested in [[Vedic Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="Monier_Williams"&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Monier-Williams|1898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a divinity of the waters (''{{lang|ae|[[Aban|Abān]]}}''), the [[yazata]] is of [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] origin, according to Lommel related to Sanskrit ''[[Sarasvati River|{{IAST|Sarasvatī}}]]'' that, like its Proto-Iranian equivalent ''{{lang|ira|*Harahvatī}}'', derives from Indo-Iranian ''{{lang|iir|*Saraswṇtī}}''.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lommel_1954_405_413"&gt;{{harvnb|Lommel|1954|pp=405–413}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975a_71"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975a|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In its old Iranian form ''{{lang|ira|*Harahvatī}}'', "her name was given to the region, rich in rivers, whose modern capital is [[Delhi]] (Avestan ''{{lang|ae|Harax&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;aitī}}'', Old Persian ''{{lang|peo|Hara(h)uvati-}}'', Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Arachosia}}'')."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003"/&gt; "Like the Devi Saraswati, [Aredvi Sura Anahita] nurtures crops and herds; and is hailed both as a divinity and the mythical river that she personifies, 'as great in bigness as all these waters which flow forth upon the earth'."  Some historians note that that despite Anahita's Aryan roots and the way she represented the commonly shared concept of the Heavenly River, which in the Vedas was represented by the goddess ''[[Saraswati|{{IAST|Sarasvatī}}]]''  (the later heavenly Ganga),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ritual, State, and History in South Asia: Essays in Honour of J.C.

In the [[Middle Persian|(Middle-)Persian]] texts of the Sassanid and later eras, {{lang|ae|Arədvī Sūra Anāhīta}} appears as ''{{lang|pal|Ardwisur Anāhīd}}''.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003"/&gt; The evidence suggests a western Iranian origin of ''Anāhīta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Jong|1997|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Conflation with Ishtar|borrowing from Babylonia]], below).

Anahita also shares characteristics with [[Mat Zemlya]] (Damp Mother Earth) in [[Slavic mythology]].

===Conflation with Ishtar===
At some point prior to the 4th century BCE, this [[yazata]] was conflated with (an analogue of){{Ref_label|Anahita_Ishtar_trampoline|α|none}} [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] {{lang|akk|[[Ishtar|Ištar]]}},&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_202"/&gt; likewise a divinity of "maiden" fertility and from whom Aredvi Sura Anahita then inherited additional features of a divinity of war and of the planet [[Venus]] or "Zohreh" in [[Arabic]]. It was moreover the association with the planet Venus, "it seems, which led [[Herodotus]] to record that the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Persis]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Ref_label|Herodotus_terminology|γ|none}} learnt 'to sacrifice to "the heavenly goddess"' from the Assyrians and Arabians." &lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_29_cit_Herodotus"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=29}} Cit. {{Ref_label|Herodotus_i131a|c23|none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Widengren_1965_121"&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1965|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nyberg_1938_370"&gt;{{harvnb|Nyberg|1938|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are sources who based their theory on this aspect. For instance, it was proposed that the ancient Persians worshiped the planet Venus as *''Anahiti'', the "pure one", and that, as these people settled in Eastern Iran, *''Anahiti'' began to absorb elements of the cult of Ishtar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papers in Honour of Professor Mary Boyce|last=Duchesne-Guillemin|first=Jacques|last2=Lecog|first2=Pierre|publisher=BRILL|year=1985|isbn=9789068310023|location=Leiden|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, according to Boyce, it is "probable" that there was once a [[Old Persian language|Perso]]&amp;ndash;[[Elamite language|Elamite]] divinity by the name of ''{{lang|peo|*Anahiti}}'' (as reconstructed from the Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Anaitis}}'').&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1005_1006"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|pp=1005–1006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is then likely (so Boyce) that it was this divinity that was an analogue of Ishtar, and that it is this divinity with which Aredvi Sura Anahita was conflated.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_29" /&gt;

The link between Anahita and Ishtar is part of the wider theory that Iranian kingship had [[Mesopotamia]]n roots and that the Persian gods were natural extensions of the Babylonian deities, where Ahuramazda is considered an aspect of [[Marduk]], Mithra for [[Utu|Shamash]], and, finally, Anahita was Ishtar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=King and Court in Ancient Persia 559 to 331 BCE|last=Llewellyn-Jones|first=Lloyd|publisher=Edinburgh University Press Ltd.|year=2013|isbn=9780748641260|location=Edinburgh|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by how Ishtar "apparently"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1006"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; gave Aredvi Sura Anahita the epithet ''Banu'', 'the Lady', a typically Mesopotamian construct&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1006"/&gt; that is not attested as an epithet for a divinity in Iran before the common era. It is completely unknown in the texts of the [[Avesta]],&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1006"/&gt; but evident in Sassanid-era [[middle Persian]] inscriptions (see [[#the cult|the cult]], below) and in a middle Persian ''Zend'' translation of ''Yasna'' 68.13.&lt;ref name="Darmesteter_1892_419"&gt;{{harvnb|Darmesteter|1892|p=419}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Zoroastrian texts from the post-conquest epoch (651 CE onwards), the divinity is referred to as 'Anahid the Lady', 'Ardwisur the Lady' and 'Ardwisur the Lady of the waters'.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1967_37"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1967|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the divinity is unattested in any old [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranian language]],&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_29"/&gt; establishing characteristics prior to the introduction of Zoroastrianism in Western Iran (''c.'' 5th century BCE) is very much in the realm of speculation.

===Cosmological entity===
The cosmological qualities of the world river are alluded to in ''[[Yasht]]'' 5 (see [[#In the Avesta|in the Avesta]], below), but properly developed only in the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', a Zoroastrian account of creation finished in the 11th or 12th century CE. In both texts, Aredvi Sura Anahita is not only a divinity, but also the source of the world river and the (name of the) world river itself. The cosmological legend runs as follows:

All the waters of the world created by [[Ahura Mazda]] originate from the source Aredvi Sura Anahita, the life-increasing, herd-increasing, fold-increasing, who makes prosperity for all countries. This source is at the top of the  world mountain [[Hara Berezaiti]], "High Hara", around which the sky revolves and that is at the center of [[Airyanem Vaejah]], the first of the lands created by Mazda.

The water, warm and clear, flows through a hundred thousand golden channels towards Mount Hugar, "the Lofty", one of the daughter-peaks of Hara Berezaiti. On the summit of that mountain is Lake Urvis, "the Turmoil", into which the waters flow, becoming quite purified and exiting through another golden channel. Through that channel, which is at the height of a thousand men, one portion of the great spring Aredvi Sura Anahita drizzles in moisture upon the whole earth, where it dispels the dryness of the air and all the creatures of Mazda acquire health from it. Another portion runs down to Vourukasha, the great sea upon which the earth rests, and from which it flows to the seas and oceans of the world and purifies them.

In the Bundahishn, the two halves of the name "Ardwisur Anahid" are occasionally treated independently of one another, that is, with Ardwisur as the representative of waters, and Anahid identified with the planet Venus: The water of the all lakes and seas have their origin with Ardwisur (10.2, 10.5), and in contrast, in a section dealing with the creation of the stars and planets (5.4), the ''Bundahishn'' speaks of 'Anahid i Abaxtari', that is, the planet Venus.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1004"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In yet other chapters, the text equates the two, as in "Ardwisur who is Anahid, the father and mother of [[Aban|the Waters]]" (3.17).

This legend of the river that descends from Mount Hara appears to have remained a part of living observance for many generations. A Greek inscription from Roman times found in Asia Minor reads "the great goddess Anaïtis of high Hara".&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975a_74"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975a|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On Greek coins of the imperial epoch, she is spoken of as "Anaïtis of the sacred water."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1004"/&gt;

==In scripture==

Aredvi Sura Anahita is principally addressed in ''Yasht'' 5 (''[[Yasna]]'' 65), also known as the [[Aban]] ''Yasht'', a hymn to the waters in Avestan and one of the longer and better preserved of the devotional hymns. ''Yasna'' 65 is the third of the hymns recited at the [[Ab-Zohr]], the "offering to the waters" that accompanies the culminating rites of the Yasna service. Verses from ''Yasht'' 5 also form the greater part of the ''Aban Nyashes'', the liturgy to the waters that are a part of the ''Khordeh Avesta''.

According to Nyberg&lt;ref name="Nyberg_1938_260etc"&gt;{{harvnb|Nyberg|1938|p=260,291,438}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  and supported by Lommel&lt;ref name="Lommel_1954_406"&gt;{{harvnb|Lommel|1954|p=406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Widengren,&lt;ref name="Widengren_1955_48"&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1955|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the older portions of the ''Aban Yasht'' were originally composed at a very early date, perhaps not long after the [[Gathas]] themselves. {{Ref_label|yasht_age|ζ|none}} ''Yasna'' 38, which is dedicated "to the earth and the sacred waters" and is part of seven-chapter ''Yasna Haptanghāiti'', is linguistically as old as the Gathas.

In the ''Aban Yasht'', the river ''[[yazata]]'' is described as "the great spring Ardvi Sura Anahita is the life-increasing, the herd-increasing, the fold-increasing who makes prosperity for all countries" (5.1). She is "wide flowing and healing", "efficacious against the [[Daevas|''daeva''s]]", "devoted to Ahura's lore" (5.1). She is associated with fertility, purifying the seed of men (5.1), purifying the wombs of women (5.1), encouraging the flow of milk for newborns (5.2). As a river divinity, she is responsible for the fertility of the soil and for the growth of crops that nurture both man and beast (5.3). She is a beautiful, strong maiden, wearing beaver skins (5.3,7,20,129).

The association between water and wisdom that is common to many ancient cultures is also evident in the Aban ''Yasht'', for here Aredvi Sura is the divinity to whom priests and pupils should pray for insight and knowledge (5.86). In verse 5.120 she is seen to ride a chariot drawn by [[White horse (mythology)|four horses]] named "wind", "rain", "clouds" and "sleet". In newer passages she is described as standing in "statuesque stillness", "ever observed", royally attired with a golden embroidered robe, wearing a golden crown, necklace and earrings, golden breast-ornament, and gold-laced ankle-boots (5.123, 5.126-8). Aredvi Sura Anahita is bountiful to those who please her, stern to those who do not, and she resides in 'stately places' (5.101).

The concept of Aredvi Sura Anahita is to a degree blurred with that of [[Ashi]], the [[Gathas|Gathic]] figure of Good Fortune, and many of the verses of the ''Aban Yasht'' also appear in ''Yasht'' 17 (''Ard Yasht''), which is dedicated to Ashi. So also a description of the weapons bestowed upon worshippers (5.130), and the superiority in battle (5.34 et al.). These functions appears out of place in a hymn to the waters,&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003"/&gt; and may have originally been from ''Yasht'' 17.

Other verses in ''Yasht'' 5 have masculine instead of feminine pronouns, and thus again appear to be verses that were originally dedicated to other divinities.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975a_73"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975a|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyce also suggests that the new compound divinity of waters with martial characteristics gradually usurped the position of [[Burz|Apam Napat]], the great warlike water divinity of the [[Ahura|Ahuric]] triad, finally causing the latter's place to be lost and his veneration to become limited to the obligatory verses recited at the ''[[Ab-Zohr]]''.

There are also parts in the Yasht that show discrepancies in the description of Anahita. There was the case, for instance, of her beaver coat, which was described to an audience for whom the Yasht was redacted. It was clear that these do not know the animal given the fact that the [[Eurasian beaver|Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber)]] were found in the Caucasus but did not range south of the [[Caspian Sea]]  nor the rivers and lakes of the [[Aral–Caspian Depression|Aral-Caspian steppe]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Inscriptions and classical accounts==
===Evidence of a cult===
The earliest dateable and unambiguous reference to the iconic cult of Anahita is from the Babylonian scholar-priest [[Berossus|Berosus]], who – although writing over 70 years{{Ref_label|berosus_70years|η|none}} after the reign of [[Artaxerxes II|Artaxerxes II Mnemon]]{{Ref_label|mnemon|θ|none}} – records that the emperor had been the first to make cult statues of Aphrodite Anaitis and place them in the temples of many of the empire's major cities, including [[Babylon]], [[Susa]], [[Ecbatana]], [[Bactria]], [[Persepolis]], [[Damascus]] and [[Sardis]].{{Ref_label|Berosus_III_65a|c1|none}}&lt;!--(Fry, 1974:385, Widengren, 1965:121)--&gt; Also according to Berosus&lt;!-- cf. Clemens Alexandrinus, Protrept. V 65.3 --&gt;, the Persians knew of no images of gods until Artaxerxes II erected those images.{{Ref_label|Berosus_III_65b|c1|none}}{{Ref_label|Fragmenta_Historicorum_Graecorum|λ|none}} This is substantiated by Herodotus, whose mid-5th-century-BCE general remarks on the usages of the Perses, Herodotus notes that "it is not their custom to make and set up statues and images and altars, and those that make such they deem foolish, as I suppose, because they never believed the gods, as do the Greeks, to be the likeness of men." {{Ref_label|Herodotus_i131b|c23|none}}&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975b_456"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975b|p=456}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_179"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the cult was institutionalized, it began to spread widely, reaching beyond the borders of Persia taking root in [[Armenia]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jaina-rūpa-maṇḍana, Volume 1|last=Shah|first=Umakant|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=1987|isbn=8170172187|location=New Delhi|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary innovation of the shrine cults can thus be dated to the late 5th century BCE (or very early 4th century BCE)&lt;!-- 440=Herodotus "no temples". 404=Artaxerxes ascends the throne. 401=end of Cyrus the Younger (who purportedly built a temple in Lydia). --&gt;, even if this evidence is "not of the most satisfactory kind."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_202"/&gt; Nonetheless, by 330 BCE and under Achaemenid royal patronage, these cults had been disseminated throughout [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]], and from there to [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1004"/&gt; The temples also served as an important source of income. From the Babylonian kings, the Achaemenids had taken over the concept of a mandatory temple tax, a one-tenth tithe which all inhabitants paid to the temple nearest to their land or other source of income.&lt;ref name="Dandamaev_Lukonin_1989_361_362"&gt;{{harvnb|Dandamaev|Lukonin|1989|pp=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; A share of this income called the ''quppu ša šarri'' or "kings chest" – an ingenious institution originally introduced by [[Nabonidus]] – was then turned over to the ruler.

Nonetheless, Artaxerxes' close connection with the Anahita temples is "almost certainly the chief cause of this king's long-lasting fame among Zoroastrians, a fame which made it useful propaganda for the succeeding [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Arsacids]] to claim him (quite spuriously) for their ancestor."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_221"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arjomand_1998_247"&gt;{{harvnb|Arjomand|1998|p=247}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsa, Elam, and Media===
&lt;!-- ==== 400BCE-0 ==== --&gt;
Artaxerxes II's devotion to Anahita is most apparent in his inscriptions, where her name appears directly after that of [[Ahura Mazda]] and before that of [[Mithra]]. Artaxerxes' inscription at [[Susa]] reads: "By the will of Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra I built this palace. May Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra protect me from all evil" (A²Hc 15–10). This is a remarkable break with tradition; no Achaemenid king before him had invoked any but Ahura Mazda alone by name although the Behistun inscription of Darius invokes Ahuramazda and "The other gods who are".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avesta.org/op/op.htm DB 4.59-67]&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple(s) of Anahita at [[Ecbatana]] (Hamadan) in Media must have once been the most glorious sanctuaries in the known world.{{Ref_label|Polybius_Ecbatana|π|none}}{{Ref_label|Isidore_6a|c2|none}} Although the palace had been stripped by Alexander and the following Seleucid kings,{{Ref_label|Polybius_10_27_11|c3|none}} when [[Antiochus III]] raided Ecbatana in 209 BCE, the temple "had the columns round it still gilded and a number of silver tiles were piled up in it, while a few gold bricks and a considerable quantity of silver ones remained." {{Ref_label|Polybius_10_27_12|c4|none}}

Polybius' reference to Alexander is supported by [[Arrian]], who in 324 BCE wrote of a temple in Ecbatana dedicated to "Asclepius" (by inference presumed to be Anahita, likewise a divinity of healing), destroyed by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] because she had allowed his friend [[Hephaestion]] to die.{{Ref_label|Arrian_7_14|c5|none}} The massive stone lion on the hill there (said to be part of a sepulcral monument to Hephaestion{{Ref_label|lion_of_Ecbatana|ψ|none}}) is today a symbol that visitors touch in hope of fertility.

[[Plutarch]] records that Artaxerxes II had his concubine Aspasia consecrated as priestess at the temple "to Diana of Ecbatana, whom they name Anaitis, that she might spend the remainder of her days in strict chastity."{{Ref_label|Plutarch_Ar27|c6|none}} This does not however necessarily imply that chastity was a requirement of Anaitis priestesses. {{Ref_label|chastity_priestesses|ν|none}}

[[Isidore of Charax]], in addition to a reference to the temple at Ecbatana ("a temple, sacred to Anaitis, they sacrifice there always"){{Ref_label|Isidore_6b|c2|none}} also notes a "temple of Artemis"{{Ref_label|Boyce_on_Isodore|μ|none}} at Concobar (Lower Media, today [[Kangavar]]). Despite archaeological findings that refute a connection with Anahita,&lt;ref name="Kleiss_IE_Kangavar"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleiss|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; remains of a 2nd-century BCE Hellenic-style edifice at Kangavar continue to be a popular tourist attraction.

Isidore also records another "royal place, a temple of Artemis, founded by [[Darius III|Darius]]" at Basileia (Apadana), on the royal highway along the left bank of the [[Euphrates]].{{Ref_label|Isidore_1|c7|none}}&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1007"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ==== 0–300 CE ==== --&gt;
During the Hellenistic Parthian period, [[Susa]] had its "Dianae templum augustissimum"{{Ref_label|Pliny_6_35|c8|none}} far from [[Elymais]] where another temple, known to Strabo as the "''Ta Azara''", was dedicated to Athena/Artemis{{Ref_label|Strabo_16_1_18|c9|none}} and where tame lions roamed the grounds. This may be a reference to the temple above the Tang-a Sarvak ravine in present-day [[Khuzestan Province]]. Other than this, no evidence of the cult in Western Iran from the Parthian period survives, but "it is reasonable to assume that the martial features of Anāhita (Ishtar) assured her popularity in the subsequent centuries among the warrior classes of [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] feudalism."&lt;ref name="Arjomand_1998_248"&gt;{{harvnb|Arjomand|1998|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century CE, the center of the cult in [[Fars Province|Parsa]] (Persia proper) was at [[Istakhr|Staxr]] (Istakhr). There, Anahita continued to be venerated in her martial role and it was at Istakhr that [[Sasan|Sassan]], after whom the Sassanid dynasty is named, served as high priest. Sassan's son, Papak, likewise a priest of that temple, overthrew the King of Istakhr (a vassal of the [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Arsacids]]), and had himself crowned in his stead. "By this time (the beginning of the 3rd century), Anāhita's headgear (''kolāh'') was worn as a mark of nobility", which in turn "suggests that she was goddess of the feudal warrior estate."&lt;ref name="Arjomand_1998_248"/&gt; [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]] (''r.'' 226-241 CE)&lt;!-- , "Mazdean lord, ..., king of kings, ..., the son of Papak" (so the investiture inscription at Naqsh-e Rustam) --&gt; "would send the heads of the petty kings he defeated for display at her temple."&lt;ref name="Arjomand_1998_248_Tabari"&gt;{{harvnb|Arjomand|1998|p=248}} Cit. {{Ref_label|Tabari_1_819|c18|none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ==== 300–400 CE ==== --&gt;
During the reign of [[Bahram I]] (''r.'' 272-273 CE), in the wake of an iconoclastic movement that had begun at about the same time as the shrine cult movement, the sanctuaries dedicated to a specific divinity were - by law - disassociated from that divinity by removal of the statuary and then either abandoned or converted into fire altars.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975b_462"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975b|p=462}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So also the popular shrines to Mehr/[[Mithra]] which retained the name ''Darb-e Mehr'' - Mithra's Gate - that is today one of the Zoroastrian technical terms for a fire temple. The temple at Istakhr was likewise converted and, according to the [[Kartir]] inscription, henceforth known as the "Fire of Anahid the Lady."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1967_36"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1967|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sassanid iconoclasm, though administratively from the reign of Bahram I, may already have been supported by Bahram's father, [[Shapur I]] (''r.'' 241-272 CE). In an inscription in Middle Persian, Parthian and Greek at [[Ka'ba-i Zartosht|Ka'ba of Zoroaster]], the "Mazdean lord, ..., king of kings, ..., grandson of lord Papak" (ShKZ 1, [[Naqsh-e Rustam]]) records that he instituted fires for his daughter and three of his sons. His daughter's name: Anahid. The name of that fire: Adur-Anahid.

[[File:Naqsh i Rustam. Narses.jpg|thumb|300 px|[[Naqsh-e Rustam]] investiture of [[Narseh]] (''r''. 293-302), in which the Sassanian king (second from right) receives the ring of kingship from Anahita (right).]]
Notwithstanding the dissolution of the temple cults, the triad Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra (as Artaxerxes II had invoked them) would continue to be prominent throughout the Sassanid age, "and were indeed (with [[Tishtrya|Tiri]] and [[Verethragna]]) to remain the most popular of all divine beings in Western Iran."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_210"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the iconoclasm of Bahram I and later kings apparently did not extend to images where they themselves are represented. At an investiture scene at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], [[Narseh]] (''r.'' 293-302 CE) is seen receiving his crown from a female divinity identified as Anahita. Narseh, like Artaxerxes II, was apparently also very devoted to Anahita, for in the investure inscription at Paikuli (near [[Khanaqin|Khaniqin]], in present-day Iraq), Narseh invokes "Ormuzd and all the [[yazata]]s, and Anahid who is called the Lady."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1967_36"/&gt;

[[File:Cylinder seal harem Louvre AO22359.jpg|thumb|The figure of a female on an Achaemenid cylinder seal]]
&lt;!-- ==== 400–700 CE ==== --&gt;
{{anchor|Khosrau_II_investiture_scene}}Anahita has also been identified as a figure in the investiture scene of [[Khosrau II|Khusrow Parvez]] (''r.'' 590-628 CE) at [[Taq-e Bostan]], but in this case not quite as convincingly as for the one of Narseh.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1008"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But, aside from the two rock carvings at Naqsh-e Rustam and Taq-e Bostan, "few figures unquestionably representing the goddess are known."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1008"/&gt; The figure of a female on an Achaemenid cylinder seal has been identified as that of Anahita, as have a few reliefs from the [[Parthia|Parthian era]] (250 BCE-226 CE), two of which are from ossuaries.&lt;ref name="Girshman_1962_ossuaries"&gt;{{harvnb|Girshman|1962}}, fig. 120, 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Sassanid silverware depictions of nude or scantily dressed women seen holding a flower or fruit or bird or child are identified as images of Anahita.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1008_Trever"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1008}}, cit.

=== Asia Minor and the Levant ===
The cult flourished in [[Lydia]] even as late as end of the Hellenistic Parthian epoch.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1006"/&gt; The Lydians had temples to the divinity at [[Sardis]], [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]], [[Hieroaesarea]], [[Hypaipa]] (where she was still revered as '''Artemis Anaitis''' or Persian Artemis in Classical and Roman times), [[Maeonia]] and elsewhere;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1006"/&gt; the temple at Hieroaesarea reportedly{{Ref_label|Tacitus_3_62|c10|none}} having been founded by "Cyrus" (presumably&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_201_202"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|pp=201–202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyrus the Younger]], brother of [[Artaxerxes II]], who was [[satrap]] of Lydia between 407 and 401 BCE).

In the 2nd century CE, the geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] reports having personally witnessed (apparently Mazdean) ceremonies at Hypaipa and Hierocaesarea.{{Ref_label|Pausanias_7_27_5|c11|none}} According to [[Strabo]], Anahita was revered together with [[Omanos]] at [[Zile|Zela]] in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]].{{Ref_label|Strabo_11_8_4|c12|none}} {{Ref_label|Strabo_12_3_37|c13|none}} At Castabala, she is referred to as 'Artemis Perasia'.{{Ref_label|Strabo_12_2_7|c14|none}} Anahita and Omanos had common altars in [[Cappadocia]].{{Ref_label|Strabo_15_3_15|c15|none}}

Agathangelos 22.&lt;!--{{Ref_label|Agathangelos_22|c17|none}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Agathangelos]], tradition required the Kings of Armenia to travel once a year to the temple at Eriza (Erez) in [[Acilisene]] in order to celebrate the festival of the divinity; Tiridates made this journey in the first year of his reign where he offered sacrifice and wreaths and boughs.{{Ref_label|Agathangelos_21|c27|none}} The temple at Eriza appears to have been particularly famous, "the wealthiest and most venerable in Armenia"{{Ref_label|Cicero_9_23|c29|none}}, staffed with priests and priestesses, the latter from eminent families who would serve at the temple before marrying.{{Ref_label|Strabo_11_14_16b|c16|none}} This practice may again reveal Semitic syncretic influences,&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1007"/&gt; and is not otherwise attested in other areas. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that [[Mark Antony]]'s soldiers smashed an enormous statue of the divinity made of solid gold and then divided the pieces amongst themselves.{{Ref_label|Pliny_33_82|c19|none}} Also according to Pliny, supported by [[Dio Cassius]], Acilisene eventually came to be known as Anaetica.{{Ref_label|Pliny_5_83|c20|none}} {{Ref_label|DioCassius_36_48_1|c21|none}} Dio Cassius also mentions that another region along the Cyrus River, on the borders of [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], was also called "the land of Anaitis."{{Ref_label|DioCassius_36_53_5|c22|none}}{{Ref_label|land_of_Anaitis|σ|none}}

Anahit was also venerated at Artashat ([[Artaxata]]), the capital of the Armenian Kingdom, where her temple was close to that of Tiur{{Ref_label|tiur|φ|none}}, the divinity of oracles. At Astishat, center of the cult of [[Vahagn]], she was revered as ''voskimayr'', the 'golden mother'.{{Ref_label|Agathangelos_141|c24|none}} In 69 BCE, the soldiers of [[Lucullus]] saw cows consecrated to 'Persian Artemis' roaming freely at Tomisa in [[Sophene]] (on the [[Euphrates]] in South-West Armenia), where the animals bore the brand of a torch on their heads.{{Ref_label|Plutarch_24_6|c25|none}} Following Tiridates' conversion to Christianity, the cult of Anahit was condemned and iconic representations of the divinity were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1007"/&gt;

&lt;!-- 1007 --&gt;
Attempts have been made to identify Anahita as one of the prime three divinities in [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], but these are questionable. However, in the territories of the [[Moschia|Moschi]] in [[Colchis]], Strabo mentions{{Ref_label|Strabo_11_2_17|c26|none}} a cult of [[Leucothea]], which Wesendonck and others have identified as an analogue of Anahita.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1007"/&gt; The cult of Anahita may have also influenced [[Ainina and Danina]], a paired deities of the [[Caucasian Iberia]]ns mentioned by the medieval Georgian chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tseretheli|1935|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
As a divinity Aredvi Sura Anahita is of enormous significance to the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion, for as a representative of [[Aban]] ("the waters"), she is in effect the divinity towards whom the ''[[Yasna]]'' service – the primary act of worship – is directed. (see [[Ab-Zohr]]). "To this day reverence for water is deeply ingrained in Zoroastrians, and in orthodox communities offerings are regularly made to the household well or nearby stream."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_155"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|water_worshippers|ε|none}}

It is "very probable"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1967_37"/&gt; that the shrine of [[Shahrbanu|Bibi Shahrbanu]] at royal [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] (Rhagae, central Media)  was once dedicated to Anahita.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1967_37"/&gt;{{Ref_label|Shahrbanu|ρ|none}} Similarly, one of the "most beloved mountain shrines of the Zoroastrians of Yazd, set beside a living spring and a great confluence of water-courses, is devoted to Banu-Pars, "the Lady of Persia"."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1967_38"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1967|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1005"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1983|p=1005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, and notwithstanding the widespread popularity of Anahita, "it is doubtful whether the current tendency is justified whereby almost every isolated figure in Sassanid art, whether sitting, standing, dancing, clothed, or semi-naked, is hailed as her representation."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs_2006_1"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian cult of [[Anahit]], as well as the pre-Christian Armenian religion in general, was very closely connected to Persian Zoroastrianism,&lt;ref name=iranicaarm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iii |title=Russel, J.R. ARMENIA AND IRAN iii. Armenian religion. Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--passim--&gt; but it also had significant distinct features deriving from local pagan traditions as well as from non-Zoroastrian foreign cults.&lt;!--"It is seen that the Armenians came under Median influence at an early stage in their history, and that Zoroastrianism was introduced later, under the Achaemenids. The religion was strongly colored by local tradition and foreign influence, as indeed in Iran itself."--&gt; In present-day Armenia, it is remembered as part of the historical mythological heritage of the nation, and the name Anahid is a popular female given name. In 1997, the Central Bank of Armenia issued a commemorative gold coin with an image of the divinity Anahit on the obverse.

==Dunvegan==
{{copy edit section|date=July 2018}}
In [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Johnson]]'' the story is told of Donald McQueen who believed a building near to [[Dunvegan Castle]] to be the ruins of a temple to Anahita.  [[Samuel Johnson]] rubbished{{clarify|date=July 2018}} the theory, which was based purely on phonological similarities of names.

|Boyce (1982:29-31) proposes that there was once a Perso-Elamite divinity named ''*Anahiti'' (as she reconstructs it from the Greek rendering of Anaitis, being otherwise unattested in old Persian)&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_29"/&gt; that was an analogue of Semitic [[Ishtar]]&amp;ndash;[[Inanna]].

|According to Boyce's theory (see note α above), "the problem of how to offer veneration to a divinity unknown to the Avesta was solved by assimilating {{lang|ae|*Anāhiti}} to {{lang|ae|*Harahvaitī Arədvī Sūrā Anāhitā}}, whose third epithet was very close to the western divinity's proper name, and indeed may already in late Old Persian have become identical with it, through the dropping of the final vowel in ordinary speech." &lt;ref name="Boyce_1983_1003_1004"/&gt;

In antiquity, "to invoke a deity correctly, it was essential to know his proper name" and when people "worshipped gods other than their own, they invoked them by their original names."&lt;ref name="Bikerman_1938_187"&gt;{{harvnb|Bikerman|1938|p=187}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Persis]] is Greek for the ethnic group of people from [[Fars Province|Parsa]] (Persia proper).

|Although Taqizadeh's hypothesis is not supportable in light of the archaic nature of the Gathic nucleus of ''Yasht'' 5 (see [[#In the Avesta|In the Avesta]], above), it is worth noting that [[Artaxerxes I]] (''r.'' 465-424 BCE) moved his capital from [[Susa]] to [[Babylon]], where it would remain until [[Artaxerxes II]] moved it back in 395 BCE. Darius II was half-Babylonian and died in Babylon.  Darius's son and successor, Artaxerxes II also had a Babylonian mother, [[Parysatis]], who was immensely influential on both Darius and her sons (the other being [[Cyrus the Younger]]).

Widengren has a similar hypothesis, but places it in the Proto-Avestan period. In this opinion,&lt;ref name="Widengren_1965_18"&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1965|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anahita is ''Nahaithya'', the Avestan ''daeva''(s) that Widengren also suggests might be cognate with the [[Nasatya]]s.

'''Anomadassi Buddha''' was one of the 28 Buddhas. He was born in [[Candavati]], lived in [[Upasiri]] and later lived in the [[Dhammarama Monastery]]. Among his contemporaries, he was widely known for the twin miracle at the gates of [[Osadhi]] (Sankassa). 

Anomadassi Buddha helped at least eighty thousand of his followers obtain [[Arahant]]. Among his most notable followers were Kings [[King Soreyya|Soreyya]] and [[King Uppala|Uppala]]. He also had a son named Upavana.

Anonmadassi Buddha was suffering from a stomach disease. Then he was cured by a physician, who was a great devotee of the Buddha. The physician made a wish to live a healthy long life and become an Arahath. Anomadassi Buddha blessed him and said that he would be born during the time of [[Gautama Buddha]] and attain Nibbana. He was Bakkula Thero, who was the healthiest Bhikkhu during the time of Gautama Buddha

'''Antakrddaaśāh''' is the eighth of the 12 [[Jain]] āgamas said to be promulgated by [[Mahavira|Māhavīra]] himself. Antakrddaaśāh  translated as "Ten Chapters on End-Makers" is said to have been composed by [[Ganadhara]] [[Sudharmaswami]] as per the [[Svetambara|Śvetámbara]] tradition.

It contains stories describing those who succeeded in destroying all their [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] and succeeded in attaining Moksa and putting an end to the re-births.

The former bishopric became a double Catholic [[titular see]] (Latin and Maronite). The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Alexander Severus]] was born there. It is significant for the '''[[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] Arqa''', an archaeological site that goes back to [[Neolithic]] times, and during the [[Crusades]] there was a strategically significant [[castle]].

== Names ==
It is mentioned in Antiquity in the [[Amarna letters]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]-(as ''Irqata''), as well as in [[Assyria]]n documents.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town was named '''Caesarea''' (of Lebanon/Phoenicia) or '''Arca Caesarea'''.

== History ==

=== 1350 BC Amarna letters ''Irqata'' ===
{{Further information|Amarna letter EA 100}}
Arqa has the distinction of being a city-state that wrote one of the 382 [[Amarna letters]] to the [[Pharaoh]] of Ancient Egypt.

The [[city-state]] Irqata was the 3rd city of the [[Rib-Hadda]] letters, (68 letters), that were the last hold-outs against the [[Habiru|(H)Apiru]] invasion. Sumur(u)-([[Zemar]]) was the 2nd hold-out city besides Rib-Hadda's Byblos, (named [[Gubla]]). Eventually, the king of Irqata, [[Aduna (Irqata mayor)|Aduna]] was killed along with other city kings, and also the 'mayor' of Gubla, Rib-Hadda.  Rib-Hadda's brother, [[Ili-Rapih]], became the successor mayor of Gubla, and Gubla never fell to the Hapiru.

During Rib-Hadda's lengthy opposition to the Habiru, even the city-state of Irqata and its elders, wrote to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] for assistance. (EA 100, [[EA (el Amarna)|EA]] for el [[Amarna]]).

The letter is entitled: "The [[City-state|city]] of Irqata to the [[Pharaoh|king]]".

:This tablet-(i.e. tablet letter) is a tablet from Irqata. To the King, our Lord: Message from Irqata and its el[d]ers. We [[Prostration formula|fall at the feet]] of the king, our lord, 7 times and 7 times. To our lord, the Sun: Message from Irqata. May the heart of the king, (our) lord, know that we guard Irqata for him.
:When the [ki]ng, our lord, sent [[DUMU-Biha|D[UMU]-Bi-ha-a]], he said to [u]s, "Message of the king: "Guard Irqata"! " The sons of the traitor to the king seek our harm; Irqata see[ks] loyalty to the king. As to [ [[silver]] ] having been given to [[Subaru (region)|S[u]baru]] al[ong with] [[horse]]s and [[Chariot|cha[riots] ]], may you know the mind of Irqata. When a tablet from the king arrived (saying) to ra[id] the land that the [[Habiru|'A[piru] ]] had taken [from] the king,'they wa[ged] war with us against the enemy of our lord, the man whom you pla[ced] over us. Truly&amp;mdash;we are guarding the l[and]. May the king, our lord, heed the words of his loyal servants.
:May he grant a [[Greeting-gift (Šulmānī)|gift]] to his servant(s) so our enemies will see this and eat dirt. May the breath of the king not depart from us. We shall keep the [[city gate|city]] [[KA (gate Sumerogram)|gate]] barred until the breath of the king reaches us. Severe is the war against us&amp;mdash;terribly! terribly!  -EA 100, lines 1-44 (complete){{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Hellenistic and Roman period ===
After the death of [[Alexander the Great]] Arca came under the control first of the [[Lagids]] then of the [[Seleucids]]. When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] gained control over this part of western Asia, they entrusted Arca as a client [[tetrarchy]] or vassal principality to a certain Sohaimos, who died in AD 48 or 49. It was then incorporated in the [[Roman province]] of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], but was soon entrusted to [[Herod Agrippa II]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] counts it among the tetrarchies of Syria. It was at this time that its name was changed to Caesarea,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9y7nTpFcN3AC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=arca+caesarea+province+syria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KiJ6VJmKL-LT7Qaz3YHAAQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=arca%20caesarea%20province%20syria&amp;f=false [[Maurice Sartre]], ''The Middle East under Rome'' (Harvard University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-67401683-5}}), p. 77]&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished from other cities of that name by being called '''Caesarea ad Libanum''' or '''Arca Caesarea'''. Under [[Septimius Severus]] (193–211) it was made part of the province of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Syria Phoenicia]] and so became known as '''Arca in Phoenicia'''. Under his son [[Caracalla]] (198–217) it became a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' and in 208 [[Alexander Severus]] was born at Arca during a stay of his parents there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/tell-arqa_%28Enciclopedia-dell%27-Arte-Antica%29/ S.M. Cecchini, "Tell'Arqa" in ''Enciclopedia dell'Arte Antica'' (Treccani 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crusades period ===
At the time of the [[First Crusade]], Arca became an important strategic point of control over the roads from [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] to [[Tartus]] and [[Homs]]. [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Toulouse]] unsuccessfully [[Siege of Arqa|besieged it]] for three months in 1099. In 1108, his nephew [[William II Jordan]] conquered it and it became part of the [[County of Tripoli]]. It resisted an attack by [[Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo]] in 1167 and another in 1171.
 
It finally fell to Muslim forces of the Sultan [[Baibars]] in 1265 or 1266. When Tripoli itself [[Fall of Tripoli (1289)|fell in 1289]] to the army of Sultan [[Qalawun]] and was razed to the ground, Arca lost its strategic importance and thereafter is mentioned only in ecclesiastical chronicles.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Arca in Phoenicia became the seat of a Christian bishop in the [[Roman province]] of [[Phoenicia Prima]], a [[suffragan]] of the  capital's [[Metropolitan see|metropolitan]] [[see of Tyre]].
 
Of its bishops, Lucianus professed the faith of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] at a synod held in [[Antioch]] in 363, Alexander was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381, Reverentius became archibishop of Tyre, Marcellinus was a participant at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, Epiphanius took part in a synod at Antioch in 448, and Heraclitus participated in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 and was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the province of Syria Phoenicia sent in 458 to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] to protest about the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 823-826&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', vol. 7, p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;434&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer a residential bishopric, Arca in Phoenicia is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 837&lt;/ref&gt; in two traditions: Latin and Maronite ([[Eastern Catholic]], [[Antiochian Rite]] in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]).

'''Azargoshnasp fire temple''' ({{lang-fa|آتشکده آذرگشنسب}})
literally "''the Fire of the Warrior Kings''", is an ancient [[Fire temple]] in [[West Azarbaijan]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huff|first=Dietrich|title=Taḵt-e Solaymān|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/takt-e-solayman|date=2002-07-20|accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site includes the remains of the [[Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]] built during the [[Sassanid]]. This temple housed one of the three "Great Fires" or "Royal Fires" that Sassanid rulers humbled themselves before in order to ascend the throne. The fire at Azargoshnasp was called ''[[atar|ādur]] Wishnāsp'' and was dedicated to the ''arteshtar'' or warrior class of the Sasanid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Zakeri | first=Mohsen | authorlink=Mohsen Zakeri | coauthors= | title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: The origins of Ayyaran and Futuwwa | date= | publisher=[[Harrassowitz Verlag]] | location= | isbn=3-447-03652-4 | pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ugarit}}

The '''Baal Cycle''' is a [[Ugarit]]ic cycle of stories about the [[Canaan]]ite god [[Baʿal]] ({{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;"Owner", "Lord"), a [[storm god]] associated with [[fertility god|fertility]]. It is one of the [[Ugarit texts]].

The text identifies Baal as the god [[Hadad]], the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] form of [[Adad]]. The stories are written in [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]], a Northwest Semitic language written in a [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] consonantal alphabet, on a series of [[clay tablet]]s found in the 1920s in the [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] of [[Ugarit]] (modern [[Ras Shamra]]), situated on the Mediterranean coast of northern [[Syria]], a few kilometers north of the modern city of [[Latakia]], far ahead of the now known coast. The stories include ''The Myth of Baʿal Aliyan'' and ''The Death of Baʿal''.

==Basic synopsis==
The Baʿal Cycle series of stories are summarized thus:
* [[Yam (god)|Yam]] wants to rule over the other gods and be the most powerful of all
* Baʿal Hadad opposes Yam and slays him
* Baʿal Hadad, with the help of [[Anat]]h and [[Asherah|Athirat]], persuades [[El (god)|El]] to allow him a palace
* Baʿal Hadad commissions [[Kothar-wa-Khasis]] to build him a palace.
* King of the gods and ruler of the world seeks to subjugate [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]]
* Mot kills Baʿal Hadad
* Anath brutally kills Mot, grinds him up and scatters his ashes
* Baʿal Hadad returns to Mount Saphon
* Mot, having recovered from being ground up and scattered, challenges Baʿal Hadad
* Baʿal Hadad refuses; Mot submits
* Baʿal Hadad rules again

==Baʿal and Yam==
The beginning of the story of the battle between Baʿal and [[Yam (god)|Yam]] is lost, but we first hear of [[Kothar-wa-Khasis]], the craftsman of the gods being summoned to [[El (deity)|El]], who resides at the confluence of the rivers and the two oceans. El tells him to build a palace for Yam, and to do so quickly in case Yam should take hostile action. When [[Attar (goddess)|Athtar]] hears of this, she takes a torch down, the purpose of which is not known due to the damaged text, but she is confronted by [[Shapash (Canaanite goddess)|Shapash]], who tells her that El is to bestow royal power on Yam, and so opposition is useless. Athtar then complains that he has no place or court, and that he now fears defeat at the hands of Yam. Shapash suggests the reason to be that he has no wife, perhaps meaning he is too young. The text following is lost and resumes with El sitting in his banquet hall. Here he is addressed by the other deities, who complain that Yam is being put to shame, though the damaged text makes the reason unclear, though it is clear the reason is connected to his palace. The gods threaten that unless this situation is resolved they will wreak destruction. El gives them curdled milk, apparently a mark of esteem. El calls that his son's name hitherto has been Yaw, a personal name. El then proclaims that his name should be 'darling of El'. However, he informs Yam that he would have to drive his rival Baʿal from his throne and the seat of his dominion. Following this there is a banquet. When the story resumes, [[Kothar-wa-Khasis]] has arrived under the sea and tells Yam that he has risen presumptuously to his position, and that Baʿal cannot stand idly by. He threatens that Yam will be destroyed by a magic weapon. Yam then sends word to El, on the mount of [[Lel (mountain)|Lel]], El's abode, demanding the surrender of Baʿal and his henchmen. However, Baʿal, upon hearing this on the mount of Lel attacks the envoys, though [[Anat]] and [[Athtart]] hold him back. When the story resumes, Baʿal has already started to battle Yam, but is in despair due to the power of Yam, and the fierce sea-creatures. Kothar-wa-Khasis assures Baʿal that he will be victorious and will win a kingdom without end, and fetches two divine clubs for Baʿal's use. He gives them magic names, and strikes Yam the first two times himself. Baʿal then drags out Yam and finishes him off. Then Athtart tells Baʿal to scatter his rival, which he does, and then he cries out that Yam is dead, and that he shall be King.
{{anchor|The Palace of Baal|The Palace of Ba'al}}

==The Palace of Baʿal==
A description of the palace of Baʿal follows. It begins with a description of a banquet thrown in honour of Baʿal on Mount Zephon (modern-day [[Jebel Aqra]]). When the text resumes, we see Anat closing the door of her mansion and meeting her servants in a valley where there are two cities, which possibly represent Ugarit and its port. She kills the guards and warriors, and then drives away the townspeople. She then slaughters the guards and warriors in her palace, ending with a peace-offering. When the text resumes again, Baʿal is addressing his messengers, picturing his sister Anat sitting with her lyre and singing of her affection for him and his daughters. The messengers are told to perform a specific rite, and she will give them an important communication for Baʿal, the secret of the lightning. Together, Anat and Baʿal will search for the secret on the hill of Zephon. She replies that she would only perform the rite if Baʿal should set his thunderbolt in the sky and flash his lightning. She then joins Baʿal at Zephon.

When the text resumes Baʿal complains to Anat that he hasn't a house, nor a court like other gods, meaning that he has to live in the dwelling of his father El and [[Athirat]]. Anat thus makes a threat against El, threatening to make his grey hair run with blood unless he allows Baʿal to have a palace. The earthquakes at her feet cause El to be exposed from his chamber. Though the text following is lost, it is clear this attempt was unsuccessful, so Baʿal dispatches [[Qodesh-wa-Amrur]], the attendant of Athirat, to deliver a message to Kothar-wa-Khasis, whose home is in Egypt. When the text continues, Qodesh-wa-Amrur delivers Baʿal's message, which is that Kothar-wa-Khasis should fashion gifts for Athirat, presumably so she will support Baʿal's bid for a palace. He enters his forge, and produces magnificent pieces of furniture, a pair of sandals, and a decorated table and bowl.

When the text continues we see Athirat performing her woman's work by the seashore, when she then sees Baʿal and Anat approaching. She wonders whether he has come to kill all her sons and kinsfolk, perhaps a reference to the Hittite myth of Elkunirsa where the storm-god boasts of having killed the many sons of Athirat. However, her anger subsides when she sees the gifts, and so supports Baʿal in his bid, and she calls upon Qodesh-wa-Amrur to cast a net into the sea so she may have provisions to entertain the guests with. He does so, and when the text continues we see Anat encouraging Baʿal as they come closer to Athirat, reminding that he will have an eternal kingdom. However, Baʿal is still anxious. They persuade Athirat of their case.

She proceeds to El's abode, and makes her case. Reluctantly, he gives his assent for a house to be built for Baʿal. Baʿal is then instructed to collect cedar-wood, bricks and precious metals in order to build his house. Kothar-wa-Khasis builds him a palace, but Baʿal insists that it is built without windows, in case that his daughters may escape,{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} or that Yam may come again and trouble him. The work is completed and Baʿal rejoices. When the text resumes, Baʿal recalls his triumph over Yam, and then marches out taking many cities his own. He then consents to having windows to his Palace, and does so by thundering them out. While sitting in his palace he asks himself whether anybody would resist his power, and if anybody should, he should send word to Mot, god of death, to deal with them. He sends two messengers to Mot inviting him to a feast and to acknowledge his sovereignty. In the ending, which is lost, Mot makes his reply.
{{anchor|Baal and Mot|Ba'al and Mot}}

==Baʿal and Mot==
The final part of the Baʿal cycle is concerned with Baʿal's battle against Mot, a personification of [[Death (personification)|Death]]. Continuing from the preceding section, Mot concludes his reply to Baʿal. His reply is that he, like a lion in the desert, hungers constantly for human flesh and blood. By inviting Mot to a meal of bread and wine, Mot is offended, and threatens to cause the heavens to wilt and collapse, breaking Baʿal into pieces. Mot then will eat him piece by piece. When the text continues, Baʿal, or a speaker on his behalf admits his fear and dread of Mot. The speaker then tells Gupn and Ugar to go back to Mot and tell him that Baʿal will be eternally his slave, news to which Mot rejoices. When the text continues Baʿal complains to El that his dominion is in danger of passing to Mot. He then sends messengers to Sheger and Ithm, who are responsible for Cattle and Sheep, and asks them to provide animals for a feast, to which he will invite Mot. When the texts continue, a messenger from Mot arrives in the divine assembly, demanding to know where Baʿal is. They both go up to El's house where El asks what has been happening. When the text continues, a speaker who is probably Shapash the sun-goddess addresses Baʿal. She is advising him to find a substitute in his image, which will be sought out and slain by Mot. She then promises to bury his body, and advises him to go to the two mountains which mark the entrance of the underworld, and to move them aside. Then he is to go down into the earth and hide. He finds a heifer in the fields, and with it a human child, whom he dresses in his robes and offers as a gift to Mot.

When the text continues, two deities, presumably Gupn and Ugar arrive at El's abode, and they announce to him that they have been searching for Baʿal, but found him dead by the bank of the river of the dead. El then descends from his throne and sits on the ground, and mourns, strewing dust on his head, wears clothes of sackcloth, shaves off his beard and beats his chest in grief. Anat too wears sackcloth when she finds the fake dead body. Shapash aids Anat in burying Baʿal upon Mount Zephon, and Anat slaughters large numbers of oxen, sheep, goats, and asses as a memorial. Anat returns to El, and tells Athirat and her family (many of whom were on the side of Mot) that they can rejoice since Baʿal was dead. El asks Athirat who can he appoint in Baʿal's place, and she suggests Athtar. Athtar seats himself on Baʿal's throne but is not tall enough, confirming El's suspicion that he is too weak for the position.

When the text recontinues, Anat is searching in the netherworld for the shade of her brother. She demands that Mot restores him to her. However, Mot answers that he had searched for him over the earth, where he found him at the entrance of his domain, and then he simply ate him. Anat continues her search, until she loses patience, and she seizes Mot, and attacks him, attacking him with a sword, shaking him, burning him, crushing him, then throwing his remains to the birds. When the text continues, Anat returns to El and announces that Mot is dead. El then has a dream which tells him that Baʿal lives. Shortly after that, Baʿal returns. However, soon Mot comes back to life and complains to Baʿal of the treatment he has received. He demands that Baʿal surrender one of Mot's brothers. When Mot has returned, Baʿal sends messengers telling him that he will banish him, and that if he is hungry, he may eat the servants of Baʿal. However, this fails to please Mot, and so the two gods fight on Mount Zephon until exhausted. Shapash arrives and warns Mot that fighting Baʿal is useless, and that El is now on Baʿal's side and will overturn Mot's throne. Mot is afraid, and so declares that Baʿal is king.

==Interpretations==
The death of Baʿal and the reign of Mot has been regarded as a seasonal myth, marking Baʿal as a [[vegetation god]] whose death and rebirth is responsible for the [[Levant]]'s summer drought and autumn rains. However, [[Ulf Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] argues against this, saying it instead represents "a special catastrophe of drought and infertility when the rain does not come in its season".{{sfnp|Oldenburg|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hM8UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 37–38]}}

==Legacy==
The contest between Baʿal and Yam is now seen as the prototype for the vision recorded in the [[Daniel 7|7th chapter]] of the [[Holy Bible|Biblical]] [[Book of Daniel]].{{sfnp|Collins|1984|p=77}}&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Dan.|7|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
{{Bahá'í sidebar}}

The first mention of the Samoan Islands in [[Bahá'í literature]] is in a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916–1917 by `Abdu'l–Bahá, head of the religion until 1921 when he died, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several island nations in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Written on 11 April 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 – after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]].  The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on 4 April 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great island groups of the Pacific Ocean—[[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]], and the islands attached to these groups, such as [[New Guinea]], [[Borneo]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Philippine Islands]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], [[New Hebrides]], [[Loyalty Islands]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Seram Island|Ceram]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Friendly Islands]], [[Samoa Islands]], [[Society Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]], [[Low Archipelago]], [[Marquesas]], [[Hawaiian Islands]], [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Moluccas]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Timor]] and the other islands. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with tongues commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of God, they must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts to all the people."&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following this call to pioneer in 1919, Clara and Hyde Dunn moved from the [[Bahá'í Faith in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] to the United States where they met and married and then decided to [[pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] to Australia in 1920 and stopped briefly in Samoa on their way.&lt;ref name="dunns"/&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l–Bahá, launched the [[Ten Year Crusade]] and during this plan, 34 years after the first Bahá'ís of Australia had stopped at Samoa, a woman named Lilian Wyss pioneered to Western Samoa&lt;ref name="communities"&gt;{{Cite book

== Developing community ==

=== Connections to and from the Bahá'ís ===

From then events have multiplied involving the growing community. Starting on 29 October 1958 the first visit of a [[Hand of the Cause]] in the person of [[Enoch Olinga]] began an extended tour of the islands during which Olinga was honored with a [[Kava culture|Kava]] based ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First Visit of a Hand of the Cause to Fiji and Samoa Islands Brings Great Bounty to Baha'is and Warm Public Reception |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1959 |pages=2–4 | url = | issue = 336}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the Bahá'ís gathered in the first summer school with some 30 attendees and hosted by a local chief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Native Chief is Host to First Baha'i Summer School in Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1959 | page =8 | url = | issue = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt; purchased the first Bahá'í cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Baha'i Burial Ground Purchased in Western Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1959 | page =15 | url = | issue = 345}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gathered with Samoans from both islands to consult on the growth of the religion on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First Samoan Islands Teaching Conference Formulates Four–Year Plan for Spread of Faith|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1960 |pages=3–4 | url = | issue = 348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 the religion had reached the island of [[Savai'i]]&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; and the first public talk on the religion was given in Apia – which was extended to three additional talks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Upsurge of Teaching in the South Pacific |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1962 |pages=10–11 | url = | issue = 381}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hand of the Cause [[Collis Featherstone]] visited Bahá'ís and civic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Samoan Teaching Work Goes Forward |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1963 | page =4 | url = | issue = 382}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 the assembly of [[Pago Pago]] arranged the first observance of [[United Nations Day]] which had the acting governor and other leading figures giving talks. Coverage of the event was carried by print, radio and television media leading up to the event in general and of the Bahá'ís hosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First UN Day Observance Ever Held in American Samoa Sponsored by Baha'is |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1964 | page =7 | url = | issue = 394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 a conference on Fiji which included Bahá'ís from Tonga, Samoa, New Guinea and Fiji. Immediately following the first convention was held to elect the regional national assembly of South Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Teaching Conference Precedes First National Convention of the Baha'is of the South Pacific Ocean|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1964 | page =8 | url = | issue = 402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís continued to come and began to leave from Samoa. Also in 1965 the first Samoan [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] returned to the island of his birth – the [[Tokelau Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = South Pacific Delegates Assemble in Tonga |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1966 |pages=10–11 | url = | issue = 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was three years before authorities allowed him to promulgate his religion.&lt;ref name="Nov69"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Women Take Leading Role in South Pacific Islands |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1969 | page =12 | url = | issue = 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samoan Auxiliary Board member Niuoleava Tuataga toured Australia giving talks to Bahá'ís and Australian society on the religion in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Samoan Board Member Visits Australian States|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1968 | page =11 | url = | issue = 445}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Garcia (composer)|Russell Garcia]] and Gina, his wife, visited many islands among Samoa in 1967 and others giving concerts and classes in schools for several years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = A Teaching Trip to Samoa |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1971 | page =6 | url = | issue = 478}}&lt;/ref&gt; before ultimately moving to New Zealand.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; In 1969 Samoan Bahá'í women stretched social norms by personally taking trips to attempt to spread the religion.&lt;ref name="Nov69"/&gt; From December 1969 into January 1970 the first international youth conference of the south pacific took place in Apia drawing attendees from Samoa. Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Tonga, United States, and Western Samoa. Hand of the Cause [[Abu'l-Qásim Faizi]] attended and gave talks both to the attendees and to the public afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Western Samoa Youth Conference|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1970 | page =15 | url = | issue = 468}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of Samoa was elected at a convention hosting Hand of the Cause of God Collis Featherstone, Continental Board of Counsellors member Suhayl Ala'i, Auxiliary Board member Niuoleava Tuataga, the nine delegates and over fifty members of the religion from both Western and American Samoa. The elected members of the national assembly were from both Western and American Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First National Convention Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1970 | page =8 | url = | issue = 473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contact with civilian leaders ===

In an event that would have long range effects on the community in 1965 Tamasese, one of the first native Bahá'ís of Samoa, died and at the funeral members of a royal family of Samoa were present at the Bahá'í funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Funeral of First Samoan Believer Becomes Public Proclamation of Faith |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1966 | page =3 | url = | issue = 418}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, a fine mat is presented to the presiding officer of the funeral which in this case was an [[Bahá'í administration#Auxiliary Boards|Auxiliary Board member]]. This mat was presented to the [[Universal House of Justice]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Fine Mat Presented to Universal House of Justice |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1968 | page =2 | url = | issue = 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same mat was gifted to the King at the dedication of the temple in 1979.&lt;ref name="ceremony"/&gt; Meanwhile, cooperation with the government of Samoa expanded. In 1967 Bahá'ís presented [[Bahá'í literature]] to the kings of Tonga and Samoa with more planned for leaders of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Great Distances Bridged by Power of the Faith; Prodamation Books to be Presented |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1967 |pages=39–40 | url = | issue = 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the government of Samoa sponsored the observance of United Nations Day. In years past it had been the Baha'i community of American Samoa that had sponsored the observance, with the aid of the government of American Samoa. This year [[List of governors of American Samoa|Governor Aspinall]] appointed a United Nations Day Committee which included the chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the South Pacific Ocean, Suhayl Ala'i, as member of the Committee for Iran. Mr. Ala'i made suggestions resulting in the inclusion of the Baha'i prayer for unity in the program and the committee secured the services of Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery as guest speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Samoan Acting Governor Introduces Baha'i Speaker |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1968 | page =17 | url = | issue = 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968 King [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] of Samoa privately converted to the religion and announced it publicly in 1973&lt;ref name="communities"/&gt; when he wrote a letter to the convention to elect the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Universal House Announces Crowning Victory|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1973 | page =3 | url = | issue = 478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal House of Justice asked Bahá'ís individually to not seek publicity of the issue at the time. In 1974 King Malietoa Tanumafili II attended the national convention and congratulated work on construction of a Bahá'í center and [[KVZK-2]] recorded a series of three 15-minute programs to be broadcast as part of its daily show ''Talosaga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =  Around the World; Western Samoa; Head of State visits Convention|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1974 |pages=1–2 | url = | issue = 521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976 the national assembly was registered with the United States,&lt;ref name="communities"/&gt; the first Bahá'í center on [[Tutuila]] was raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =  Around the World; Samoa; Center is dedicated on island of Tutuila|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1976 | page =12 | url = | issue = 543}}&lt;/ref&gt; and King Tanumafili visited the grave of [[Shoghi Effendi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Royalty visits Guardian's resting place |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1976 | page =1 | url = | issue = 547}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 as part of a series of events (see below) highlighting the importance of peace the Bahá'ís had meetings with the American Samoan Speaker of the House and the prime minister of Western Samoa attended including a presentation of the statement by the [[Universal House of Justice]] called ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1987 | issn=0195-9212 | page =16| url = | issue = 638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the Bahá'ís helped celebrate the 25th anniversary of the independence of Western Samoa with a commemoration at the Bahá'í House of Worship which included a surprise unveiling of a large portrait of king Tanumafili,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Western Samoa; Portrait of the Malietoais unveiled|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1987 | issn=0195-9212 | page =17| url = | issue = 678}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at a parade for the anniversary Bahá'ís won third place in a contest of floats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1988 | issn=0195-9212 | page =17| url = | issue = 682}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 27th anniversary Bahá'ís double purposed the celebration with a service dedicated to World Environment Day which was followed by talks by Bahá'ís and head of the Forestry Division of the federal Environmental Program and Tafaese Lautua, a member of Parliament, also thanked the Bahá'ís on behalf of the minister of Lands and Survey/Park Preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1989 | issn=0195-9212 | page =13| url = | issue = 701}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 50th anniversary of the reign of king Tanumafili II a parade in which 40 Baha'is marched for the review of the Malietoa and his guest, the king of Tonga as well as entered a float in a parade depicting the oneness of mankind, which placed second in the judging.

=== Organization and growth ===

World–wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio–economic development projects. In 1983 the national assembly sponsored a conference on rural development for one hundred–ten people from Upolu, Savaii and Tutuila, at Lelata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1984 | issn=0195-9212 | page =16| url = | issue = 638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, in addition to an observance held at the Bahá'í House of Worship,  (see below), the Bahá'ís sponsored a peace essay contest where Certificates of recognition were given to each of 36 finalists and monetary prizes awarded to seven winners. At the ceremony, Lt. Governor Faleomavaega Eni Hunkin and Counsellor Suhayl Ala'i spoke about peace. The Bahá'ís also held a conference on Family Welfare and Management with a talk by Western Samoa's assistant secretary for the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture, and other talks with 200 Baha'is in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Special report; The International Year of Peace; Samoa|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1987 | issn=0195-9212 | page =11| url = | issue = 638}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987 worldwide the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

The UN's resident Representative was present, as was the UNESCO Representative and most of the UN personnel in Samoa. Some of the dependencies of a Bahá'í House of Worship have also been developed — – a cemetery and school have been set.&lt;ref name="jubilee"/&gt;

Representatives of the National Assemblies of Australia, the [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Hawaii]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Tonga]] as well as other dignitaries of the religion and Bahá'ís from the islands of Savai'i and [[Upolu]] and Bahá'í members of the royal family  – King Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa and daughter Susuga To'oa Tosi Malietoa –  attended the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Bahá'ís Faith in Samoa in 2004 along with various members of the government of Samoa who highlighted many of the services the Bahá'ís have given to the general community.&lt;ref name="jubilee"/&gt;

=== Head of State Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa ===

On the passing of Head of State Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa in 2007, the international governing body of the Bahá'ís, the [[Universal House of Justice]] wrote: "His service to the people of Samoa as Head of State was distinguished by the high principles, genuine compassion and personal humility that characterized the constancy of his concern for the welfare of all. As the first reigning sovereign to accept the Message of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], he set a record that will forever illumine the annals of our Faith, one that future generations will increasingly extol. His great interest for well–nigh four decades in the Faith's progress was reflected in the enthusiastic affirmation of his belief whenever the opportunity presented itself and in the abiding joy with which he regarded the construction in 1984 of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship#Tiapapata, Samoa|Mother Temple of the Pacific Islands]] in Samoa...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Funeral and memorial service planned for Samoan head of state | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/543 | work = Bahá'í World News Service | author = Bahá'í International Community | date = 14 May 2007 | accessdate = 15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boethus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Βοηθός}}; fl. 2nd century BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher from [[Sidon]], and a pupil of [[Diogenes of Babylon]].

He is said to have denied, contrary to the standard Stoic view, that the [[cosmos]] is an animate being,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that it was not the whole world which was divine, but only the ether or sphere of the fixed stars.&lt;ref name="laertius148"&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], vii. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the world was eternal,&lt;ref&gt;[[Philo]], ''De aeternitate mundi'' 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, he rejected the Stoic conflagration (''[[ekpyrosis]]'') because god or the World-Soul would be inactive during it, whereas it exercises [[Divine Providence]] in the actual world.

Among his works was one ''On Nature'',&lt;ref name="laertius148"/&gt; and one ''On Fate''.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 149&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a commentary on the works of [[Aratus]] in at least four volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geminus]], xvii 48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhist socialism''' is a [[political ideology]] which advocates [[socialism]] based on the principles of [[Buddhism]]. Both Buddhism and socialism seek to provide an end to suffering by analyzing its conditions and removing its main causes through [[praxis (process)|praxis]]. Both also seek to provide a transformation of personal consciousness (respectively, spiritual and political) to bring an end to human alienation and selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, James Mark; Liberation as Revolutionary Praxis: Rethinking Buddhist Materialism; Journal of Buddhist Ethics.

==Iron Age ''Camulodunon''==
[[File:Camulodunon001.png|right|thumb|The Iron Age site of Camulodunon]]
The earliest [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] defensive site at Colchester is the Pitchbury Ramparts earthwork north of the town between West Bergholt and Great Horkesley.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; The main earthwork defences of the Brythonic Celtic [[oppidum]] of ''Camulodunon'' were built later, beginning in the 1st century BC but most date from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; They are considered the most extensive of their kind in Britain.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=967 retrieved 25 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The defences consist of lines of ditches and ramparts, possibly palisaded with gateways, that mostly run parallel to each other in a north-south direction. The Iron Age settlement was protected by rivers on three sides, with the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]] bounding the site to the north and east, and the Roman River valley forming the southern boundary; the earthworks were mostly designed to close off the western gap between these two river valleys.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denney, Patrick 2004"&gt;Denney, Patrick (2004) Colchester. Published by Tempus Publishing ({{ISBN|978-0-7524-3214-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Other earthworks close off eastern parts of the settlement. These earthworks gave the oppidum its Brythonic Celtic name - ''Camulodunon'' meant "The Stronghold of [[Camulus]]", the British God of War.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Together they enclose an area of 1,000ha, much larger than the area enclosed by the [[Devil's Dyke, Hertfordshire|Iron Age defences]] at [[Wheathampstead]] (35ha).&lt;ref name="ColchArch2009"&gt;The Colchester Archaeologist. Issue no. 22. (2009). (ISSN 0952-0988)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sites within the bounds of these defences are the Gosbecks farmstead, the Sheepen industrial area and the Lexden burials. The Gosbecks site consists of a large, high-status farmstead,&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; believed to be the home of the tribal chieftains of Camulodunon.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Part of the Gosbecks complex is a large, square enclosure surrounded by a deep, wide ditch. This has been interpreted as part of a possible religious site, as during the Roman period a large temple was built in the middle of this enclosure.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; The Sheepen site, located around what is now [[St Helena School, Colchester|St Helena School]] on the banks of the River Colne, was a large industrial and port zone, where extensive iron and leather working activity was carried out,&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denney, Patrick 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roman-britain.org"&gt;http://www.roman-britain.org/places/camulodunum.htm retrieved 21 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an important coin mint.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Two coins minted at Sheepen, one found in Colchester in 1980 and another found at [[Canturbury]] in 1978, depict boats, and are the only known depictions of sailing vessels from [[Iron Age Britain]].&lt;ref name="Denney, Patrick 2004"/&gt; [[Amphorae]] containing imported goods from the continent have been found at Sheepen,&lt;ref&gt;Sealy, P.R.

The Ancient Sea Trade. Published by The University of Wisconsin Press ({{ISBN|0-299-12640-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Trinovantes 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Coin of the [[Trinovantes]] minted at [[Camulodunon]].]]
Just inside the earthworks, at Lexden, are located the burial mounds of the rulers of Camulodunon, which contain large amounts of grave goods including imported Roman material from Europe;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; the largest of these mounds is the [[Lexden#History|Lexden tumulus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=384037|mname=|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unlockingessex.essexcc.gov.uk/uep/custom_pages/monument_detail.asp?content_page_id=89&amp;monument_id=34083&amp;content_parents=48 retrieved 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Lexden area around the mounds contains several Iron Age cremation burial groups, including one containing the "Mirror burial", with other burials located around the Camulodunon site.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; A large cluster of cremations from St. Clares road and Fitzwalter Road close to the Lexden Tumulus date to 50-10 BC.&lt;ref name="ColchArch2009"/&gt;

Aside from these main activity areas, the 1,000ha area enclosed by the defensive earthworks and rivers mainly consisted of a network of droveways, [[hollow way]]s, pastures and fields associated with cattle herding.&lt;ref name="ColchArch2009"/&gt; Scattered [[Roundhouse (dwelling)#British Isles|Roundhouses]] and burials have been discovered amongst these droveways.&lt;ref name="ColchArch2009"/&gt; The defences were designed to protect the high status and industrial areas as well as prevent [[cattle rustling]] of valuable herds.&lt;ref name="ColchArch2009"/&gt; Camulodunon was surrounded by farmsteads like those at Abbotstone near [[Colchester Zoo]] and at [[Birch, Essex|Birch Quarry]], many of which continued to exist on into the Roman period until at least the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref name="ColchArch2009"/&gt;

Iron Age salt works (known as [[Red Hill (salt making)|Red hills]]) have been found in large numbers around the Essex coast, including several large concentrations located in the [[salt marshes]] close to Camulodunon in the Colne Estuary, on the Roman River near [[Fingringhoe]], in [[Alresford, Essex|Alresford Creek]], on [[Mersea Island]], the Pyefleet Channel, the [[River Blackwater, Essex|Blackwater River]] and around the [[Tendring District|Tendring]] Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Fawn, A 1990"/&gt; Two large groups existed at [[Peldon]] and [[Tolleshunt D'Arcy]].&lt;ref name="Strachan, David 1998"&gt;Strachan, David (1998) Essex from the Air, Archaeology and history from aerial photographs. Published by Essex County Council ({{ISBN|1 85281 165 X}})&lt;/ref&gt; Camulodunon may have been an at the centre of the local trade in this important preservative.&lt;ref name="Fawn, A 1990"/&gt;

[[File:Bronze coins of Cunobelin 1 to 42 CE.jpg|left|thumb|Bronze coin of Cunobelin - note the letters '''CAMV''' for ''Camulodunon'']]
[[Addedomarus]], a king of the [[Trinovantes|Trinovantes tribe]] (originally centred at [[Braughing]]), is the first identifiable ruler of Camulodunon, known from his inscribed coins dating to around 25-10&amp;nbsp;BC. For a brief period around 10&amp;nbsp;BC [[Tasciovanus]], a king of the [[Catuvellauni]] already issuing coins from [[Verlamion]], also [[Brythonic coinage|issued coins from Camulodunon]], suggesting that the Trinovantes' capital had been conquered by the Catuvellauni, but he was soon forced to withdraw, perhaps as a result of Roman pressure – his later coins are no longer marked with the Latin ''[[Rex (king)|REX]]'' (for "king"), but with the [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic]] ''RICON'' – and Addedomarus was restored. His son [[Dubnovellaunus]] succeeded him, but was soon supplanted by Tasciovanus' son [[Cunobelinus]]. Cunobelinus then succeeded his father at Verlamion, beginning the dominance of the Catuvellauni over the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;John Creighton (2000), ''Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip de Jersey]] (1996), Celtic Coinage in Britain, Shire Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt; Cunobelinus was friendly with Rome, marking his coins with the word ''REX'' and classical motifs rather than the traditional Gallo-Belgic designs. Archaeology shows an increase in imported luxury goods, probably through the Sheepen site port of Camulodunon, during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Branigan (1987), ''The Catuvellauni'', Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably one of the British kings that [[Strabo]] says sent embassies to [[Augustus]]. Strabo reports Rome's lucrative trade with Britain; the island's exports included grain, gold, silver, iron, hides, slaves and hunting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html ''Geography'' 4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Iron ingots, slave chains and storage vessels discovered at the Sheepen site appear to confirm this trade with the Empire.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;

The [[Catuvellauni]] king Cunobelinus, ruling from his capital at Camulodunon, had subjugated a large area of southern and eastern Britain,&lt;ref name="Todd, M 1981"&gt;Todd, Malcolm.

Published by Fontana Paperbacks ({{ISBN|0 00 633756 2}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; and was called by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]] "King of the Britons".&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Under his rule Camulodunon had replaced Verlamion as the most important settlement in pre-Roman Britain.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; Around 40 AD he had fallen out with his son [[Adminius]] (acting as proxy ruler of the [[Cantiaci]] tribe in his father’s name), who had fled to Rome for support.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; There he was received by [[Caligula|the Emperor Gaius]], who [[Caligula#Brittania|may have attempted an invasion of Britain]] to put Adminius on his father’s throne.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius (1989) The Twelve Caesars. Published by Penguin Classics. ({{ISBN|0-14-044072-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; After Cunobelinus’ death (c. 40 AD) his sons took power, with [[Togodumnus]] the eldest ruling the Catuvellauni homeland around Verlamion, and [[Caratacus]] ruling from Camulodunon.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Together these brothers began expanding their influence over other British tribes, including the [[Atrebates]] of the south coast. [[Verica]], king of the Atrebates, which had branches on both sides of the [[English Channel]] and had been [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|friends of Rome]] since [[Julius Caesar|Caesar’s conquest]],&lt;ref&gt;Caesar (1982) The Conquest of Gaul. Published by Penguin Classics. ({{ISBN|0-14-044433-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; appealed to the [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]] for aid. At the time of this appeal in 43 AD the newly enthroned Emperor Claudius was in need of a military victory in order to secure his shaky position with the [[Roman army|military]], and saw this call for help as the perfect pretext.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris (1997) Chronicle of the Roman Emperors.

Claudius arrived with reinforcements, including artillery and elephants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60.19-22]&lt;/ref&gt; leading the attack on Camulodunon. Caratacus fled the storming of the town, taking refuge with the [[Ordovices]] and [[Silures]] tribes in [[Wales]] and becoming a Welsh folk hero for his resistance to Rome.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; The Roman historian [[Suetonius]] and Claudius' triumphal arch state that after this battle the British kings who had been under Cunobelinus’ sons’ control surrendered without further bloodshed, Claudius accepting their submission in Camulodunon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Claudius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#17 17]; [[s:Arch of Claudius|Arch of Claudius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Fortress and Early Town===
As the stronghold of a major tribe in the south-east, Camulodunum held strategic importance.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; A Roman legionary fortress or ''[[castrum]]'', the first permanent legionary fortress to be built in Britain,&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; was established within the confines of Camulodunon  (which was [[latinised]] as ''Camulodunum'') following the successful invasion in 43, and was home to the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|Twentieth Legion]].&lt;ref name="Todd, M 1981"/&gt; A smaller fort was built against the Iron Age earthworks close to the Gosbecks high-status farmstead, and was home to the Ala Primae Thracum ("First Wing of [[Thracians]]", a cavalry regiment) and the Cohors Primae Vangionum ("First Cohort of [[Vangiones]]", a mixed cavalry-infantry unit from [[Gaul]]).&lt;ref name="RBStan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/places/stanway.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114318/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/stanway.htm |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }} retrieved 29 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceni Revolt===
{{Main article|Battle of Camulodunum}}

The city was the capital of the Roman province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], and its temple (the only classical-style temple in Britain) was the centre of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial Cult]] in the province.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; The Roman philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] mentioned the temple when he [[Apocolocyntosis|mocked the province for its piety towards the Deified Claudius]].&lt;ref&gt;Petronius – The Satyricon/Seneca – The Apocolocyntosis (1986) Published by Penguin Classics. ({{ISBN|0-14-044489-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; The colonia was also initially home to the [[Procurator (Roman)|provincial Procurator]] of Britain. Aside from the [[Roman citizen|Roman]] population, the city and surrounding territorium was also home to a large native population. Examples of cooperation between the two groups include the Romano-British [[Stanway, Essex#Druid of Colchester|Stanway Burials mounds]]&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camulos.com/gosbecks.htm retrieved 21 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and the warrior graves of native elites from the 50s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/10677948._/ retrieved 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeology.org/news/1309-130918-england-warrior-catuvellauni-spears retrieved 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These graves represent members of the native aristocracy who have been Romanised.&lt;ref name="Strachan, David 1998"/&gt;

However tensions arose in 60/61 when the Roman authorities used the death of [[Prasutagus]] as a pretext for seizing the [[Iceni|Iceni client state]] from his widow [[Boudica]]. The [[Boudica#Boudica's uprising|Iceni rebels]] were joined by the Trinovantes around Colonia Victricensis, who held several grudges against the Roman population of the town. These included the [[Centuriation|seizure of land for the colonia’s veteran population]], the use of labour to build the Temple of Claudius, and the sudden recall of loans given to the local elites by leading Romans (including Seneca and the Emperor), which had been needed to allow the locals to qualify for a position on the city council.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tacitus"&gt;Tacitus (1876), [[s:The Annales (tacitus)/Book14#31|XIV:31]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Procurator [[Catus Decianus]] was especially despised.&lt;ref name="Todd, M 1981"/&gt;

Tacitus recorded that certain ominous portents occurred in the town prior to the rebellion:

::"[...]the statue of [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] fell down, its back turned as though in retreat from the enemy. Women roused into frenzy chanted of approaching destruction, and declared that the cries of the barbarians had been heard in the council-chamber, that the theatre had re-echoed with shrieks, that a reflection of the ''colonia'', overthrown, had been seen in the Thames estuary. The sea appeared blood-red, and spectres of human corpses were left behind as the tide went out."&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;

As the symbol of Roman rule in Britain the city was the first target of the rebels, with its Temple seen in British eyes as the ''arx aeternae dominationis'' ("stronghold of everlasting domination") according to Tacitus.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; He wrote that it was undefended by fortifications when it was attacked&lt;ref name="Tacitus"/&gt; with a garrison of only 200 members of the procurator's guard.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He wrote of a last stand at the Temple of Claudius:

:"In the attack everything was broken down and burnt. The temple where the soldiers had congregated was besieged for two days and then sacked.".&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;

The rebels destroyed the city and slaughtered its population. Archaeologists have found layers of ash in the site of the city, suggesting that Boudica ordered her rebel army to burn the city to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13560 retrieved 21 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A relief army consisting of the [[Legio IX Hispana]] led by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] attempted to rescue the besieged citizens, but was [[Battle of Camulodunum|destroyed outside of the town]]. After the Romans under governor [[Gaius Suetonius Paullinus]] finally defeated the uprising, the Procurator of the province moved his seat to the newly established commercial settlement of [[Londinium]] ([[London]]).&lt;ref&gt;Graham Webster, ''Boudica: the British Revolt against Rome AD 60'', 1978, pp. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boudican Destruction Layer====
[[File:Boudica's Sprit^ Colchester - geograph.org.uk - 132842.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Boudica in Colchester commemorating her sacking of the Roman town.]]
The destruction of the early town by the rebels has left a thick layer of ash, destroyed buildings and smashed pottery and glasswork across the town centre and at the Sheepen river port site outside the NW corner of the town. The destruction layer, also found at [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]) and [[Londinium]] ([[London]]), is famous for the charred preservation of artefacts and furniture,&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; including a samian store, a glass store, beds and matresses, wall plaster, [[Roman mosaic|tessalated floors]], a few human bones with wounds and even [[Dates (fruit)|dates]] and [[plums]].&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13385 retrieved 24 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; During excavations in 2014 at [[Williams and Griffin]] on the High Street a collection of gold and silver jewellery was discovered buried in the floor of a Roman building destroyed during the revolt.&lt;ref name="Fenwick1"&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=14844 Retrieved 4 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the "[[Fenwick (department store)|Fenwick]] Treasure", it appears to have been buried just prior to the buildings destruction by a victim of the Boudican attack.&lt;ref name="Fenwick1"/&gt; The layer is important to [[historians]] as it is one of the first archaeological contexts in Britain that can be given a definitive date, as well as to [[archaeologists]] as it provides a snapshot of artifacts from 60, allowing [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]] of finds to be tied into a historical timeline, for example in Samian production.&lt;ref name="Bedoyere, Guy 1988"/&gt; The rubble from the destruction was landscaped during the rebuilding of the town that took place in the years after the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13568 retrieved 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Colonia Victricensis'' in the Second and Third Centuries==
[[File:ColoniaVictricensisMap02.png|thumb|right|The Roman '''Colonia Victricensis''' in its wider landscape]]
Following the destruction of the Colonia and [[Suetonius Paulinus]]’ crushing of the revolt the town was rebuilt on a larger scale and flourished,&lt;ref name="roman-britain.org"/&gt; growing larger in size than its pre-Boudican levels (to 108 acres/45 ha)&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; despite its loss of status to [[Londinium]], reaching its peak in the Second and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; The town's official name was ''Colonia Claudia Victricensis'' (City of Claudius’ Victory), but it was known colloquially by contemporaries (such as on the monument of Gnaeus Munatius Aurelius Bassus in Rome - ''see below'') as ''Camulodunum'' or simply ''Colonia''.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;
The colonia became a large industrial centre, and was the largest, and for a short time the only, place in the province of Britannia where [[samian ware]] was produced, along with glasswork and metalwork, and a coin mint.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Roman brick making and wine growing also took place in the area. Colonia Victricensis contained many large townhouses, with dozens of mosaics and tessellated pavements found, along with [[hypocaust]]s and sophisticated waterpipes and drains.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13656 retrieved 21 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonia is mentioned by name several times by contemporaries, including in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [[Ptolemy's Geography]], Tacitus' [[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]], The [[Antonine Itinerary]] and the [[Ravenna Cosmography]].&lt;ref name="roman-britain.org"/&gt; The 2nd century tomb inscription for Gn. Munatius Bassus in Rome, which describes the name of the town and its Roman citizenship, reads:

===Status===
The city was one of the few Roman settlements in Britain designated as a ''Colonia'' rather than a ''[[Municipia]]'', meaning that in legal terms it was an extension of [[Rome|the city of Rome]], not a provincial town. Its inhabitants therefore had [[Roman citizen]]ship. Of the two [[Roman province|provincial administrators]] the [[Roman senator|senatorial]] military [[Roman governor|governor]] was always located in areas of conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus (1986) The ''Agricola'' and the ''Germania''. Published by Penguin Classics ({{ISBN|0-14-044241-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the civilian [[Procurator (Roman)|Procurator’s office]] had moved from Camulodunum to the new port of Londinium sometime around the Boudican Revolt.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; However the Colonia did retain the [[Sodales Augustales|Imperial cult centre and priesthood]] at the Temple of Claudius. The colonia was at the centre of a large territorium containing many [[Roman villa|villa sites]], including an important cluster around the [[River Colne, Essex|Colne estuary]].&lt;ref name="Todd, M 1981"/&gt;

===Walls===
[[File:Balkerne Gate, Colchester - geograph.org.uk - 189116.jpg|thumb|right|Balkerne Gate]]
Following the rebuilding of the town after 60/1 new walls and a large defensive ditch were built around the colonia (the first town walls in Britain, predating other such walls in the province by at least 150 years&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;). They were completed by 80, twenty years after the revolt.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; They were built with two external faces of alternating layers of [[Imbrex and tegula|tile]] and [[Septaria|septaria mudstone]] containing a core of septaria boulders, with a 10&amp;nbsp;ft wide and 4&amp;nbsp;ft deep foundation trench, the whole structure taking up 45,000 cubic metres of stone, tile and mortar.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strachan, David 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; They were 2,800m long and 2.4m thick, and survive up to a height of over 6m in the 21st Century.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Later, in around 175-200 a large earth bank was built up against the inner face of the walls.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; The walls had between 12 and 24 towers and six large gates.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Balkerne Gate, in the centre of the Western section of the walls, was the main gate out of the town. It has a large fortified barbican that still stands as Britain’s largest Roman gateway, which incorporated the earlier monumental arch built before the Iceni rebellion and was flanked by two possible temples,&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; one of which may have contained the [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] statuette found during the 1973-76 excavations.&lt;ref&gt;Crummy, Nina (1983) Colchester Archaeological Reports 2: The Roman small finds from Colchester 1971-9.

===Streets===
[[File:Roman Colchester Street Plan.gif|thumb|right|Roman streets and excavated remains of '''Colonia Victricensis''' (''Camulodunum'')]]
The [[Cardo maximus]], the main North-South street, ran between North Gate and Head Gate, whilst the [[Decumanus Maximus]], the main East-West street, ran between Balkerne Gate and East Gate, and have their origins in the Legionary fortresses two main axial streets.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; They were well paved, had drainage channels and were fronted with houses and shops.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13656 retrieved 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Many included footways, a feature that is rare in other Roman British towns.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; The rest of the colonia was gridded into around forty blocks known as [[Insula (building)|insula]], with paved streets and colonnaded paths between.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; As well as a system of local roads leading to settlements around the colony, Camulodunum was linked to the rest of the Province by several major roads, including [[Stane Street (Colchester)|Stane Street]], [[Camlet Way]], [[Pye Road]] and the [[Via Devana]].

===Public Buildings===
Within the town walls was located the [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Temple of Claudius]] in its large [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#templum|temple precinct]] with a monumental columned arcade.&lt;ref name="thecolchesterarchaeologist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13840 |title=Colchester: grand Roman arcade on a monumental scale &amp;#124; The Colchester Archaeologist |publisher=thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBTemp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/places/colchester_temples.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603222036/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/colchester_temples.htm |archivedate=3 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }} retrieved 20 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the temple precinct wall are still visible to the NW of the present castle, jutting out from beneath the [[Normans|Norman]] bailey rampart.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; The front of the precinct wall consisted of a large columned arcade screen extending the full width of the frontage.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; At the centre of this arcade stood the entranceway to the temple precinct, which took the form of a tufa-faced monumental arch that at 8&amp;nbsp;m wide was about 2&amp;nbsp;m wider than the one at the Eastern entrance to the town, which had been incorporated into Balkerne Gate.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;

To the west of the temple on the modern Maidenburgh Street was a 3,000&amp;nbsp;seat capacity [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]], which now has the Norman chapel of [[St Helena]] built into the corner of it,&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; currently open to public viewing.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt; Opposite the Temple, on the south side of the Decumanus Maximus, the remains of a possible [[Basilica]] have been identified.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; At least seven [[Romano-Celtic Temple|Romano-Celtic temples]] have been identified at Camulodunum,&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; with the largest located at the [[Colchester#Gosbecks Archaeological Park|Gosbecks area]] to the south of the town, built within the site of a former Iron-Age enclosure.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;

A large portico with an eastern entrance ran all the way around the outside of the site, with a solid outer wall, a row of columns down the centre of the portico and a second row of columns around the inner side.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; In all there were about 260&amp;nbsp;columns placed 2&amp;nbsp;m apart, and reaching a height of at least 5&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; The portico ran around the outside of a deep, Iron-Age enclosure ditch, which separated the portico from the central space in the middle of the site. This central space contained a large Romano-Celtic temple, which stood off-centre, leading to suggestions that something else stood at the heart of the religious complex.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;

Next to the Gosbecks temple stood a second 5,000&amp;nbsp;seat theatre, Britain’s largest at 82&amp;nbsp;m in diameter.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strachan, David 1998"/&gt; A group of four Romano-Celtic temples stood at the Sheepen industrial site, one of which was dedicated to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=15908 retrieved 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temple I'' at the Sheepen site was found to be enclosed by a large, buttressed precinct wall during excavations in 1935 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=16086 Retrieved 7 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Several temples and religious monuments in and around the colonia have evidence for the deity honoured by them:
* A statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was found in the vicinity of the temple outside of the Balkerne Gate.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;

* A statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was found at the site of the Gosbecks temple.&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt;

*The Temple at the [[Colchester Royal Grammar School]] has several plaques dedicated to [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]],&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; including:

* A Bronze plaque dedicated sometime between 222–235&amp;nbsp;CE by a [[Roman Syria|Syrian]] to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the [[Alexander Severus|Emperor Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Severus]], himself a Syrian:

Marble from many of these public structures has been found, including [[Purbeck Marble]] and ''giallo antico'' (a rare yellow marble from [[Tunisia]]),&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; as well as statutes, inscriptions and plaques.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;

Several other public buildings have been postulated for which evidence is so far lacking, for example:
* Depictions on pottery, glasswork, and wall plaster from the colonia of [[Roman gladiators|gladiators]] has been suggested as evidence that the town could have possessed an [[Roman amphitheatre|amphitheatre]].&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;
* A mound called "The Mount", which formerly stood in the [[St. John's Abbey, Colchester|Abbey grounds]], was once thought to have been part of a Roman burial mound,&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; although after the discovery of the Roman Circus just to the south of where it once stood, there have been suggestions by Colchester Archaeological Trust that it could have been the remnants of an amphitheatre.&lt;ref name="ColchArch2011"/&gt;

===Water Management===
The town's streets and walls feature many brick built drains, including several large examples in Castle Park and near [[St Botolph's Priory]].&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; As well as drains the colonia also possessed pipes for bringing pressurised water into the settlement. At the excavations at Balkerne Lane four lines of hollow wooden pipes, joined with iron collars were found bringing water from nearby springs, as well as evidence of a possible [[Roman aqueduct|raised wooden aqueduct]] which may have been briefly in existence next to Balkerne Gate.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; Further pipes have been discovered across the town.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=14116 Retrieved 5 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The water would have been pressurised in reservoirs; it has been argued by archaeologist Philip Crummy that the pipes would have been fed by a ''castellum divisiorum'', a water tower with multiple outlets, and that in order to get water to where the pipes at Balkerne Lane were found some form of aqueduct or water-lifting wheel would have been need to bring it from springs West of the town.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; Within the town, a complicated system of chambers, water pipes and slots for possible water-wheels was found in Castle Park that were once described as a [[Mithraeum]] but that has now been reinterpreted as a reservoir system. A large overflow drain ran from the structure down to a culvert near Duncan's Gate where the excess water exited the town into the River Colne.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Timber framed wells have also been discovered, and there are at least nine springs located within the walls of Camulodunum.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Nina 1993"&gt;Crummy, Nina; Crummy, Philip; and Crossan, Carl (1993) Colchester Archaeological Report 9: Excavations of Roman and later cemeteries, churches and monastic sites in Colchester, 1971-88.

Many houses have been found in the colonia during archaeological excavations. Stone founded buildings largely replaced timber ones in the course of the 2nd century, while average house size tended to increase in size up to a peak at around 250.&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; They have painted plaster walls and tiled roofs, many with tessellated mosaic floors, [[Hypocaust|hypocaust systems]], private baths and courtyards.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; Latrine pits, with examples well over a metre deep, have been discovered next to some of the houses.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt; Large houses were also found in the extramural suburbs outside of the town walls, with the Middleborough House beneath the old Cattle Market being the largest, containing many rooms, mosaics and basements.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; The Beryfield mosaic (of 180/200) from the SE corner of the colonia is the best preserved of the more than 50 mosaics found in the town.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt;

===Cemeteries===

[[File:Colchester sphinx.jpg|thumb|right|Roman [[sphinx]] sculpture from a tomb found in Colchester]]

In keeping with [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman burial customs]] the cemeteries for adults of the colonia in the First, Second and Third centuries are all located outside of the walls along the main roads out of the town,&lt;ref name="Crummy, Nina 1993"/&gt; with infants and neo-natals buried within the walls.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; The cemeteries, some of which are walled, initially contained [[Cremation|cremation burials]], with ashes placed within jars and urns depicting human faces or glass vessels; these jars were sometimes buried in "boxes" made from ceramic tiles and hypocaust flue blocks to protect the vessel.&lt;ref name="Toynbee, J. 1996"&gt;Toynbee, J.M.C.

===Industry and economy===

====Pottery production====

Camulodunum was a centre for pottery production, peaking at around 200,&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; and over 40 kilns have been in the town, including those found in the northern suburbs of the colonia around Middleborough&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; and a large group at Warren Fields and Oak Drive on the southern outskirts of the Sheepen site.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; Many of the kilns are of the oval "Colchester type", whilst tile kilns have larger rectangular chambers.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; Camulodunum produced many types of pottery, including [[Terra sigillata|decorated Samian pottery]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13052 retrieved 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[mortaria]], buff wares,&lt;ref&gt;Swan, Vivien G.

====Other Activities====

[[File:Britannica Drinking Vessels 1.jpg|thumb|right|Glass vessel found in Colchester depicting chariot racing]]

As well as pottery, ceramics produced in Camulodunum also include a large tile industry, oil lamps and figurines.&lt;ref name="Bedoyere, G 2000"/&gt; The colonia was also a major centre of glass production,&lt;ref name="McWhirr, Alan 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cat.essex.ac.uk/reports/CAR-report-0008{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 22 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and glass moulds (including a complete example) have been discovered in the town.&lt;ref name="Allen, Denise 1998"&gt;Allen, Denise (1998) Roman Glass in Britain.

Archaeological excavations suggest that the period between 150 and 250 saw the largest number of active workshops in the colonia.&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; The town was at the centre of a largely rural economy,&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; with archaeological evidence of agricultural buildings in the colonia including the large buttressed tower granary found in the Southern part of the town, in use for much of the 2nd century, with a nearby corn-drying oven.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt; Many ovens have been located in excavations around the town.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt; A system of [[watermill]]s appears to have operated along Salary Brook near [[Ardleigh]] to the north of the settlement,&lt;ref&gt;Spain, R.

==Late Roman Town==
The late 3rd century and 4th centuries saw a series of crises in the Empire, including the breakaway [[Gallic Empire]] (of which Britain was a part), and raids by [[Saxon]] pirates, both of which lead to the creation of the [[Saxon Shore|Saxon Shore forts]] along the East coast of Britain.&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; The fort at [[Othona]] overlooking the confluence of the [[River Blackwater, Essex|Blackwater]] and Colne estuaries, and two more at the mouth of the [[River Colne, Essex|river into the colonia]] were built to protect the town.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strachan, David 1998"/&gt; Balkerne Gate and Duncan’s Gate were both blocked up in this period, with the later showing signs of being attacked.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; The extramural suburbs outside of Balkerne Gate had gone by 300&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; and were replaced by cultivation beds.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1987"/&gt; The re-cutting of the town ditch in front of the newly blocked Balkerne Gate in 275-300 involved destroying the water pipes which entered the colonia through the gate. However a small portal in the gateway may have been opened up later.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1987"&gt;Crummy, Philip (1987) The Coins as Dating Evidence. In Crummy, N. (ed.)

[[File:The Roman Empire ca 400 AD.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The location of Camulodunum within the Late Roman Empire, c. 400]]
As with many towns in the Empire, the colonia shrunk in size in the 4th century but continued to function as an important town.&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"&gt;Faulkner, Neil. (1994) Late Roman Colchester, In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 13(1)&lt;/ref&gt; Although houses tended to shrink in size, with 75% of the large townhouses being replaced by smaller buildings by c. 350,&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; in the period 275 to 325 a weak "building boom" (the "[[Constantine the Great|Constantinian]] renaissance") occurred in the town, with new houses being built and old ones reshaped.&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; Many of the towns mosaics date from this period, including the famous Lion Walk mosaic.&lt;ref name="Wilson, Roger J 2002"/&gt; Late Roman robber trenches have been found at some sites for removing and salvaging tessalated floors and tiles for reuse in later houses.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; The pottery industry in the town had declined significantly by 300,&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; but the 4th century did see an increase in the bone-working industry for making furniture and jewellery,&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt; and evidence of blown glass making has also been found.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt; Large areas of the Southern part of the town were given over to agriculture.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt;

Despite the scaling down of private buildings an increase in the size and grandeur of public buildings occurs in the period 275-400.&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; The Temple of Claudius and its associated ''[[temenos]]'' buildings were reconstructed in the early-4th century, along with the possible forum-basilica building to the south of it.&lt;ref name="Drury, P 1984"&gt;Drury, P.J, (1984) The Temple of Claudius Reconsidered. Britannia XV, 7-50&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple appears to have had a large apsidal hall built across the front of the podium steps, with numismatic dating evidence taking the date of the building up to at least 395.&lt;ref name="Drury, P 1984"/&gt; A large hall at the Culver Street site, dated 275-325 to c. 400, may have been a large centralised storage barn for taxes paid in kind with grain.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt;

Although the Gosbecks Theatre had been demolished by the 3rd century, the theatre at Maidenburgh Street may still have been in use throughout the 4th century.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1982"&gt;Crummy, Philip (1982) The Roman Theatre at Colchester.

Increases in the number of [[Coin clipping|clipped coins]] from the 4th century have been interpreted as a breakdown in the Roman monetary economy,&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; with most new Bronze coins ceasing to be introduced in the town c. 395 and silver coins in 402 (however these coins may have remained in circulation long after being minted).&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; For example, the coin sequence at the Butt Road church goes up to around 425, 14 years after Roman rule ended in the province.&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt;

[[Late Roman military]] equipment has been discovered in the town,&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; including an official ''[[cingulum militare]]'' belt buckle made in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]] for Roman frontier units.&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; Alongside Roman military equipment 4th and early 5th century [[Germanic peoples#Warfare|Germanic]] weaponry has been found alongside Germanic domestic objects in the Late Roman town, which has been interpreted by archaeologist Philip Crummy as perhaps representing Saxon ''[[foederati]]'' mercenaries living and settling in the town during this period, several decades before the [[Adventus Saxonum|Saxon migrations]] of the mid to late 5th century.&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt;

===Christianity in the Late Roman Town===
{{See also|Christianity in the 4th century}}
During this period the [[Late Roman Empire|late Roman]] church at Butt Road&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; just outside the town walls was built with its associated cemetery containing over 650 graves (some containing fragments of [[Sino-Roman relations|Chinese silk]]), and may be one of the earliest churches in Britain.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Nina 1993"/&gt; A strong numismatic chronology has been obtained from the over 500 coins found at the site, and puts its date from 320 to c.425.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1987"/&gt; Five of the extramural pagan Romano-British Temples were abandoned in c.300, whilst ''Temple II'' at Sheepen was rebuilt in 350 and continued in existence until c. 375.&lt;ref name="Hull, M 1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1980"/&gt; ''Temple X'' outside of the Balkerne Gate had its ambulatory demolished in 325-50 leaving just its [[Cella]], perhaps repurposed as a Christian temple.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; A nearby shrine may also have survived into the late 4th century.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1984"/&gt; Several other possible churches or Christian buildings have been postulated, such as ''Building 127'' at Culver Street and possible Roman remains beneath St Helena’s Chapel, St Nicholas Church and Roman "vaults" beneath [[St Botolph's Priory]] which might be a late-Roman [[Martyrium (architecture)|Martyrium]], although over interpretations include a bath-house.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1980"/&gt; The Temple of Claudius, which underwent large-scale structural additions in the 4th century, may also have been repurposed as a Christian church, as a [[Chi Rho]] symbol carved on a piece of Roman pottery found in the vicinity of the ''temenos''.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Further Roman Christian objects found in the town include a candlestick from Balkerne Lane inscribed with an [[IX monogram|Iota Chi]] symbol and a bronze spoon with [[Eternal life (Christianity)|AETERNVS VITA]] written on it.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Nina 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toynbee, J 1953"/&gt; Three British Bishops attended the [[Council of Arles (314)]], one from London, one from York and a third from a place whose first word is ''Colonia'' but whose second word is too corrupted to make out with any certainty, but has been interpreted as something like ''Camulodensium'' (although [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] and [[Gloucester]] are other possible candidates).&lt;ref name="Crummy, Nina 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toynbee, J 1953"&gt;Toynbee, JMC (1953)'Christianity in Roman Britain' in Journal of Brit.

==Sub-Roman Period==
{{Main article|Sub-Roman Britain}}

The [[Honorius (emperor)#Stilicho and the defence of Italy|formal collapse of Roman administration in the province]] occurred in the years 409-411. Activity in the 5th century continued in Camulodunum at a much reduced level,&lt;ref name="Faulkner, Neil 1994"/&gt; with evidence of at the Butt Road site showing that it briefly carrying on into the early 5th century.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Nina 1993"/&gt; Several burials within the towns walls have been dated to the 5th century. These include two burials discovered at East Hill House in 1983, which have been surgically decapitated (in a fashion found in both [[Celts|Pre-Roman]] and some early pagan-Saxon burial practices),&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; and other burials cut into the 4th century barn at Culver Street.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; A skeleton of a young woman found stretched out on a Roman mosaic floor at Beryfield, within the SE corner of the walled town, was initially interpreted as a victim of a Saxon attack on the Sub-Roman town; however, it is now believed that the burial is a post-Roman grave cut down to the hard floor surface (the name ''Beryfield'' means "burial field", a reference to the Medieval graveyards in the area).&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; Burials of men armed with Germanic weaponry have also been found outside of the town walls, and might be the graves of [[Saxon]] ''[[foederati]]'' or Saxon settlers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=1154 retrieved 9 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Roman/early Saxon burials from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, some buried with weapons, have been found outside of the walls in the areas of former Roman cemeteries, suggesting a continuity of practice.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; A study by archaeologist Henry Laver concluded that all of the Roman cemeteries around Colchester contain later burials dating to the early Saxon period.&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"&gt;Crummy, Philip (1981).

Several structures from the Saxon and Medieval period incorporated Roman structural remains within their walls and outlines.&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; The Temple of Claudius was a standing ruin until the Normans cleared the superstructure to incorporate the podium into [[Colchester Castle]] in the 11th Century.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; In 2014 the discovery of marble pillars belonging to the Monumental Facade of the Temple precinct was made behind the High Street, with evidence suggesting that they were still standing until the Castle-builders knocked them over to make way for the Castle Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/?p=13902 retrieved 26 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Normans referred to the Temple as King Coel's Palace and to the barbican of Balkerne Gate as Colkyng's Castle, reflecting a myth that continued into the Medieval period, and was recorded in the ''Colchester Chronicle'' (written in the 13th or early 14th century at [[St John's Abbey, Colchester|St John's Abbey]]), that the Roman town was founded by a warlord called [[Coel Hen|Coel]]. According to the Medieval legend,&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; which garbles folk-tales and pseudo-historical events together, he was supposedly the father of [[St Helena]], who was married off to [[Flavius Valerius Constantius|Constantius]] in a bid to get the latter to lift his two-year siege of the town. Their son, [[Constantine the Great]] was then supposedly born in the town. St Helena is today the patron saint of Colchester, and the [[Coat of arms of Colchester|town's coat of arms]] depict the True Cross and crowns of the Three Kings that she is supposed to have found in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt; Other examples of Roman remains used in later buildings include several Medieval cellars on the High Street,&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; [[Churches in Colchester|St Nicholas Church]] (demolished in the 1950s), which was built on a Roman building and originally incorporated the remains of standing Roman walls,&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; and St Helens Chapel, which was built into the corner of the Roman theatre in the town.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; A study in the late 1970s by Colchester Archaeological Trust discovered that many of the Medieval property boundaries within Colchester's town centre followed the lines of Roman street frontages and the walls of Roman buildings.&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; This was especially prominent along the High Street, where the Medieval street "frontage of the High Street between St Runwald's Church and Maidenburgh Street has fossilized the imprint of the Roman town underneath...".&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; St Runwald's Church (demolished in the 19th century) formerly stood in the centre of the High Street market just east of the current Town Hall, and was built into the corner of a junction between two Roman streets.&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt; The study concluded that Roman building ruins and old street remains were in some cases used as a template for later property divisions.&lt;ref name="Crummy 1981"/&gt;

The name of the town and the River Colne are also a legacy of the Romans. "Colchester" (first appearing in written form in the 10th Century as ''Colencaester'' and ''Colneceastre'') is a [[Old English|Saxon]] name derived from the Latin words ''Colonia'' and ''Castra'',&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt; with the River Colne also taking its name from ''Colonia''.&lt;ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/&gt;

'''Chorten Kora''' is an important [[stupa]] next to the Kulong Chu River in [[Trashiyangtse District|Trashiyangtse]], in East [[Bhutan]]. Nearby is a town of the same name. The stupa was built in the 18th century  by Lama Ngawang Lodrö, the nephew of [[Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal]] in order to subdue a harmful [[demon]] believed to have been living at the site where the chorten is now located. The stupa is modeled after the famous [[Boudhanath|Boudhanath stupa]] in [[Nepal]] popularly known as Jarung Khashor. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Chorten Kora took twelve years to construct and was [[consecration|consecrated]] by [[Je Yonten Thaye]]. The demon that had harmed the people of the valley was apparently subdued and banished. Thereafter, it is said that the people of the valley continue to live in peace and harmony. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Chorten Kora Festivals==
There is an annual ''Dakpa Kora'' (circumambulation of the Chorten by the Dakpas) festival held on the 15th of the first lunar month, and a Drukpa Kora (circumambulation of the Chorten by the Bhutanese) festival held at the end of the first lunar month which celebrate the stupa. These festivals are attended by Dakpa people of the neighboring [[Tawang District]] of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in [[India]], and Bhutanese from Tashiyangtse, [[Trashigang District|Tashigang]], and Kurtoe.   
[[File:Chorten Kora, Trashiyangtse District, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|Chorten Kora]]
A popular belief is that when the stupa was constructed, a pious [[Dakini]] princess from neighboring [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India entombed herself within, as the Yeshe Semba, to meditate on behalf of all beings. A popular Bhutanese ([[Dzongkha|Dzongkha language]]) film "Chorten Kora" is based on this legend.

'''Culai Academy''' or '''Culai Academy of Classical Learning'''  (徂徕书院 ''cúlái shūyuàn'') was built by the [[Northern Song]] scholar [[Shi Jie (scholar)|Shi Jie]] during the time of his mourning (1038–40). Beside the academy was the "Duyi-tang" (读易堂 ''dúyì-táng'', "Hall for Reading the Yi"), where Shi Jie, [[Sun Fu]], and Shi Jie's disciple Jiang Qian studied the [[Zuo Zhuan]] to the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] and the [[I Ching|Book of Changes]].

It has been classed as one of the Four Great [[Academies (China)|Academies]] of the Early Song.

The academy was located on the north side of [[Mt Culai]], currently [[Tai'an]] City, [[Shandong]] province. The place is now called ''Shufang'' (書坊), meaning "library".

The kingdom existed until 1898 in what is now the country of [[Benin]]. Slaves taken from Dahomey to the Caribbean used elements of the religion to form [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] and other religions of the [[Afro-Caribbean]] diaspora.&lt;ref name="ak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="an"/&gt;

==''Mawu'' and ''Lisa''==
[[Lisa (mythology)|Lisa]] (male) and [[Mawu]] (female), married twin siblings of [[Nana Buluku]], are the creator spirits, occasionally combined as [[Mawu-Lisa]], an androgynous spirit. Mawu-Lisa created the world and made it orderly, then made [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[human]]s; the entire process took four days.
*The first day, Mawu-Lisa created the world and humanity;
*The second day the earth was made suitable for human life;
*On the third day, humans were given intellect, language, and the senses;
*Finally, on the fourth day, mankind received the gift of technology.

{{History of Bengal}}
{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
'''Deva Dynasty''' (c. 12th &amp;ndash; 13th centuries) was a [[Hindu]] dynasty which originated in the [[Bengal]] region of the [[Indian subcontinent]]; the dynasty ruled over eastern Bengal after the [[Sena dynasty]]. The capital of the dynasty was [[Bikrampur|Chittagaung]] in present-day [[Munshiganj District]] of [[Bangladesh]].

This Hindu [[Vaishnava]] dynasty is different from an earlier Buddhist Dabnyawatti dynasty (c. 8th-9th centuries) of [[Samatata]], whose capital was Danyawatti. Four rulers of this dynasty are known from the inscriptions: Shantideva, Viradeva, Anandadeva and Bhavadeva. The rule of the Devas was indeed a period of peace, prosperity, and creative excellence, and may be designated as the "Golden Age".

==Rulers==
The major sources of the history of this dynasty are the three copperplate inscriptions of Damodaradeva issued in years 1156, 1158 and 1165 of the [[Saka era]], which were his 4th, 6th and 13th [[regnal year]]s. Although there are many myths about this dynasty, none were proved with strong evidence. The first three rulers are known from the Chittagong copperplate inscription of Damodaradeva dated Saka era 1165. The first ruler of this dynasty was Purushottamadeva, who rose from the position of a village chief (''gramani''). His son Madhumathana or Madhusudanadeva was the first independent ruler of this dynasty, who assumed the title of ''nripati''. He was succeeded by his son Vasudeva and Vasudeva was succeeded by his son Damodaradeva. Damodaradeva (reigned 1231&amp;ndash;1243) was the most powerful ruler of this dynasty. He took the title of ''Ariraja-Chanura-Madhava-Sakala-Bhupati-Chakravarti''. The inscriptional evidences show that his kingdom was extended up to the present-day [[Comilla District|Comilla]]-[[Noakhali district|Noakhali]]-[[Chittagong District|Chittagong]] region. A later ruler of this dynasty ''Ariraja-Danuja-Madhava'' [[Dasharathadeva]] extended his kingdom up to [[Bikrampur]] and made it his capital.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Niharranjan (1993). ''Bangalir Itihas: Adiparba'' Calcutta: Dey's Publishing, {{ISBN|81-7079-270-3}}, pp.408-9&lt;/ref&gt; He issued an inscription from here.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi|Yahya bin Ahmad]] in his ''Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi'' mentioned that he (referred as [[Danuj Rai]] of Sonargaon by Yahya) made an alliance with [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Ghiyas-ud-Din Balban]] in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Majumdar |editor1-first=Ramesh Chandra |editor1-link=R.

This is the last recorded history of this dynasty.

'''''Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man''''' (original French: ''Dialogue entre un prêtre et un moribond'') is a dialogue written by the [[Marquis de Sade]] while incarcerated at the [[Château de Vincennes]] in 1782. It is one of the earliest known written works from de Sade to be dated with certainty, and was first published in 1926 together with an edition of ''[[Historiettes, Contes et Fabliaux]]'' (written originally in 1788). It was subsequently published in English in 1927 by [[Pascal Covici]] in a limited, hand-numbered edition of 650 copies.

==Plot==
The work expresses the author's [[atheism]] by having a dying man (a [[libertine]]) tell a priest about what he views as the mistakes of a [[pious]] life.

According to John Phillips, Emeritus Professor of French Literature and Culture at London Metropolitan University:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of all the direct expressions of atheism in Sade's work, the ''Dialogue''... is probably the most incisive and, at the same time, the most artistically satisfying... The influence of Sade's Jesuit training in rhetorical debate is the mainspring of this brilliant dramatic essay, which, as the title suggests, is not so much theatre as philosophical dialogue. But what makes the work charming as well as persuasive is the impish humour that lies behind its characters and situation.&lt;ref name=phillips2005&gt;Phillips, John (2005). ''The Marquis de Sade: a very short introduction.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp.37-38. {{ISBN|0-19-280469-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Steven Barbone, of [[San Diego State University]] notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We can postulate one of two things: Sade was entirely pleased with this manuscript and saw no reason to make any changes to it or Sade completely gave up on the dialogue and had decided to abandon it. The reason for either of these hypotheses is that the manuscript itself contains almost no trace of Sade’s editing. It is up to the reader to divine whether the “Dialogue between the Priest and a Dying Man” is Sade’s position or not. Either way, it is worth reading even in the very unlikely event that it presents a position Sade would have repudiated.

==Publication history==

Sade completed the notebook which contains the Dialogue on 12 July 1782, while imprisoned at [[Château de Vincennes]].&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt; He took the manuscript with him when he was transferred to the [[Bastille]] in 1784.&lt;ref name=barbone2000 /&gt;{{rp|343}}

Following the [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July [[1789]], Sade's prison writings disappeared (Sade had been moved to [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton]] on 4 July), the manuscript of the Dialogue among them. However, it survived in private collections and was sold on at auction a number of times during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt; On 6 November 1920 it was bought by [[Maurice Heine]] at an auction at the [[Hôtel Drouot]], [[Paris]], and he oversaw its publication in France for the first time in 1926 &lt;ref name=heine&gt;de Sade, Donatien-Alphonse-François, Marquis. ''Dialogue entre un prêtre et un moribond, par Donatien-Alphonse-François, marquis de Sade, publié, pour la première fois, sur le manuscrit autographe inédit, avec un avant-propos et des notes, par Maurice Heine.'' Paris, Société générale d'imprimerie et d'édition (71, rue de Rennes; Stendhal et Cie), 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; in a limited edition of 500 copies for which he wrote an introduction.&lt;ref name=seaverwainhouse /&gt;

===English translations===

The first English translation was published in the United States by [[Pascal Covici]] in 1927, again in a limited edition of 650 numbered copies.&lt;ref name=walter2001note /&gt; The translator was [[Samuel Putnam]].

==Legacy==
The dialogue inspired a similar scene in [[Luis Buñuel]]'s film ''[[Nazarín]]'' (1959), wherein a dying woman wards off a priest while on her deathbed. Buñuel had previously adapted ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' into a scene in his earlier ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'' (1930) and would go on to feature the Marquis himself as a character in ''[[The Milky Way (1969 film)|La Voie Lactée]]'' (1969).

The '''Ghatotkach Caves''' are located 18&amp;nbsp;km to the west of [[Ajantha, Maharashtra|Ajantha]], near Jinjala village, [[India]].&lt;ref name=AHIR /&gt;  
The caves include three [[Buddhist]] [[caves]], one is a [[chaitya]] and two are [[vihara]]s. The caves were excavated in the 6th century AD, and were influenced by [[Mahayana Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=AHIR /&gt;

The caves have an inscription from a minister of the [[Vakataka]] dynasty. The inscription is about the [[Buddha]], the [[Dhamma]] and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref name=AHIR&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahir|first=D.

[[File:Izumo-shrine Haiden01.jpg|thumb|250 px|[[Izumo Taisha]]'s ''haiden'']]In [[Shinto shrine]] architecture, the {{nihongo||拝殿|'''haiden'''}} is the hall of worship or [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]]. It is generally placed in front of the shrine's main sanctuary (''[[honden]]'') and often built on a larger scale than the latter. The ''haiden'' is often connected to the ''honden'' by a ''[[Heiden (Shinto)|heiden]]'', or hall of offerings. While the ''honden'' is the place for the enshrined ''[[kami]]'' and off-limits to the general public, the ''haiden'' provides a space for ceremonies and for worshiping the ''kami''.&lt;ref name="haiden-encycl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

'''Islam in Australia''' is a [[Minority group|minority]] religious affiliation. According to the 2016 [[Australian Census]], the combined number of people who [[Self-concept|self-identified]] as [[Muslim]] in [[Australia]], from all forms of [[Islam]], constituted 604,200 people, or 2.6% of the total Australian population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Religion%20Data%20Summary~25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710020910/http://abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Religion%20Data%20Summary~25 |archivedate=10 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of over 15% of its previous population share of 2.2% reported in the previous census 5 years earlier. Of that earlier 2.2% figure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2071.0main+features902012-2013|title=2071.0 -  Reflecting a Nation: Stories from the 2011 Census, 2012–2013|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "some estimate more than half are non-practicing"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/city-of-imams/story-e6frezz0-1226479395793  |title=Inside Sydney's City of Imams |first1=Jordan|last1= Baker |first2=Caroline |last2=Marcus |date=23 September 2012|work=Sunday Telegraph|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  muslim's stemming from all the varying denominations and sects of Islam present in Australia. 

That total Muslim population made [[Islam]], in all its denominations and sects, the second largest religious grouping in Australia, after all denominations and sects of [[Christianity in Australia|Christianity]] (61.1%, also including practicing and non-practicing [[cultural Christians]]).

Demographers attribute [[Muslim]] community growth trends during the most recent census period to relatively high birth rates, and recent immigration patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/old-trend-no-leap-of-faith-20120621-20r29.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Old trend no leap of faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2012/06/21/australians-lose-their-faith/ | title=Australians Lose Their Faith|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of Islam represent the majority of the population in [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Athyal|first1=Jesudas M.|title=Religion in Southeast Asia: An Encyclopedia of Faiths and Cultures: An Encyclopedia of Faiths and Cultures|date=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=1610692500|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of Muslims in [[Australia]] belong to the two major denominations of Islam, the [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] denominations, with the followers of each of these further split along different [[Madh'hab]] (schools of thought within [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] for the interpretation and practice of [[Shariah|Islamic law]]), there are also practitioners of other smaller [[Islamic schools and branches|denominations of Islam]], including [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Australians of various national backgrounds, [[Ibadi]] Muslim Australians of [[Oman]]i descent, as well as some [[non-denominational Muslim]]s, and approximately 20,000 [[Druze]] Australians whose religion emerged as an offshoot of Islam which arrived in Australia with the immigration of Druze mainly from Lebanon and Syria. There are also [[Sufi]] (Islamic [[mysticism]]) minorities among Muslim practitioners in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2yiyLLOj88C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices | page=247 |author1=J. Gordon Melton |author2=Martin Baumann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the overall Australian Muslim community is defined largely by a common [[religious identity]] with "Islam", Australia's Muslims are not a monolithic community, and it is only the Qur'an that unites them. The Australian Muslim community is fragmented into not only the traditional [[sectarian]] divisions of what each sect defines as Islam, but it is also extremely diverse [[Race (classification of human beings)|racially]], [[ethnicity|ethnically]], [[culture|culturally]] and [[language|linguistically]].&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/disunity-not-anger-is-muslim-dilemma-20120921-26c4m.html  |title=Disunity, not anger, is Muslim dilemma |author=Burke, Kelly|date=22 September 2012|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different Muslim groups within the Australian Muslim community thus also espouse parallel non-religious [[Ethnicity|ethnic identities]] with related non-Muslim counterparts, either within Australia or abroad.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History==

===Prior to 1860===
{{Main article|Makassan contact with Australia}}
Indonesian Muslims [[trepanger]]s from the southwest corner of [[Sulawesi]] visited the coast of northern Australia, "from at least the eighteenth century"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/yalangbara/yolngu|title=The Yolngu |work=[[National Museum of Australia]]|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collect and process ''[[sea cucumber|trepang]]'', a marine invertebrate prized for its culinary and medicinal values in [[China|Chinese]] markets. Remnants of their influence can be seen in the culture of some of the northern Aboriginal peoples. Regina Ganter, an associate professor at [[Griffith University]], says, "Staying on the safe grounds of historical method ... the beginning of the trepang industry in Australia [can be dated] to between the 1720s and 1750s, although this does not preclude earlier, less organised contact." Ganter also writes "the cultural imprint on the [[Yolngu people]] of this contact is everywhere: in their language, in their art, in their stories, in their cuisine."&lt;ref name="Ganter"&gt;Ganter, R.(2008) ''Journal of Australian Studies,'' Volume 32,4, 2008: "Muslim Australians: the deep histories of contact."{{cite web|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/58309/Ganter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415153222/https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/58309/Ganter.pdf |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy }} Retrieved on 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  According to anthropologist John Bradley from [[Monash University]], the contact between the two groups was a success: "They traded together. It was fair - there was no racial judgement, no race policy." Even into the early 21st century, the shared history between the two peoples is still celebrated by Aboriginal communities in Northern Australia as a period of mutual trust and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Janak Rogers|title=When Islam came to Australia|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27260027|accessdate=25 June 2014|agency=BBC News Magazine|date=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of "[[Mohammedans]]" were listed in the musters of 1802, 1811, 1822, and the [[Census in Australia#1828|1828 census]], and a small number of Muslims arrived during the [[Convicts in Australia|convict period]]. Beyond this, Muslims generally are not thought to have settled in large numbers in other regions of Australia until 1860.&lt;ref name=halalafic/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Muslims were among the earliest settlers of [[Norfolk Island]] while the island was used as a British [[penal colony]] in the early 19th century. They arrived from 1796, having been employed on British ships. They left following the closure of the penal colony and moved to [[Tasmania]]. The community left no remnants; only seven permanent residents of the island identified themselves as "non-Christian" in a 2006 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.info.gov.nf/reports/reports/census_2006.pdf|title = Norfolk Island Census of Population and Housing 2006|publisher = Government of Norfolk Island|page = 25|accessdate = 30 June 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723042720/http://www.info.gov.nf/reports/Reports/Census_2006.pdf|archivedate = 23 July 2011|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eduweb.vic.gov.au/edulibrary/public/teachlearn/student/lem/keynotes6islam.pdf|title = Combating Racism and Prejudice in Schools|publisher = Victorian Department of Education|page = 13|accessdate = 30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Shahram Akbarzadeh|first1 = |last2 = Abdullah Saeed|first2 = |title = Muslim communities in Australia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ERsRbpV8P5oC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22norfolk+island%22+muslims&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DNUMTt6EM--gmQWvwY3VDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22norfolk%20island%22%20muslims&amp;f=false|year = 2001|publisher = UNSW Press|pages = 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early Muslims were the [[Afghan (Australia)|"Afghan" camel drivers]] who migrated to and settled in Australia during the mid to late 19th century. Between 1860 and the 1890s a number of Central Asians came to Australia to work as camel drivers. Camels were first imported into Australia in 1840, initially for exploring the arid interior (see [[Australian camel]]), and later for the [[camel train]]s that were uniquely suited to the demands of Australia's vast deserts. The first camel drivers arrived in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], in June 1860, when eight Muslims and Hindus arrived with the camels for the [[Burke and Wills expedition]]. The next arrival of camel drivers was in 1866 when 31 men from [[Rajasthan]] and [[Baluchistan (region)|Baluchistan]] arrived in [[South Australia]] with camels for [[Thomas Elder]]. Although they came from several countries, they were usually known in Australia as [[Afghan (Australia)|'Afghans']] and they brought with them the first formal establishment of Islam in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Philip G and Kenny, Anna (2007) ''Australia’s Muslim cameleers : pioneers of the inland, 1860s–1930s''  Kent Town, S. Aust. : Wakefield Press. {{ISBN|978-1-86254-778-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameleers settled in the areas near [[Alice Springs]] and other areas of the [[Northern Territory]] and inter-married with the Indigenous population. The [[Adelaide]], South Australia to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, railway is named [[The Ghan]] (short for The Afghan) in their memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198801/camels.down.under.htm |title=Camels Down Under |publisher=Saudi Aramco World |date=January–February 1988 |author=Arthur Clark |accessdate=19 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60Y6l9wcB?url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198801/camels.down.under.htm |archivedate=29 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marree Mosque|first mosque in Australia]] was built in 1861 at [[Marree, South Australia|Marree]], South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2007/09/01/perspective.htm |title=A History of Muslims in Australia |publisher=The (Dhaka) Daily Star, Bangladesh |date=7 September 2007 |author= Nahid Kabir |accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Adelaide Mosque|Great Mosque of Adelaide]] was built in 1888 by the descendants of the Afghan cameleers.

During the 1870s, Muslim [[Malay race|Malay]] divers were recruited through an agreement with the Dutch to work on Western Australian and Northern Territory [[pearl hunting|pearling]] grounds. By 1875, there were 1800 Malay divers working in Western Australia. Most returned to their home countries.

One of the earliest recorded Islamic festivals celebrated in Australia occurred on 23 July 1884 when 70 Muslims assembled for Eid prayers at Albert Park in Melbourne. “During the whole service the worshippers wore a remarkably reverential aspect.”&lt;ref&gt;“Mahomedan Festival in Melbourne”, Auckland Star, 16 August 1884, page 3.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1900 to present ===
In the early 20th century, under the provisions of the [[White Australia policy]], immigration to Australia was restricted to persons of [[White people|white]] [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European descent]] (including [[European Muslims|white Europeans of the Muslim faith]]). Meanwhile, persons not of white European heritage (including most Muslims) were denied entry to Australia during this period. 

Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s [[Albanians|Albanian]] Muslims, whose European heritage made them compatible with the White Australia Policy, immigrated to the country. Albanian Muslims built the first mosque in [[Shepparton, Victoria]] in 1960, first mosque in [[Melbourne]] in 1963 and a mosque in [[Mareeba|Mareeba, Far North Queensland]] in 1970. The Albanian community in [[Far North Queensland]] settled in the area in the early 20th century searching for work in the [[sugarcane]] and [[tobacco]] industries with many descendants still living in [[Mareeba]], [[Cairns]] and other small towns across the [[Atherton Tableland|Atherton Tablelands]].

====Increased immigration====
The perceived need for population growth and economic development in Australia led to the broadening of Australia's [[immigration policy]] in the post-World War II period. This allowed for the acceptance of a number of displaced white European Muslims who began to arrive from other parts of Europe, mainly from the [[Balkans]], especially from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. As with the Albanian Muslim immigrants before them, the European heritage of these dispaced Muslims also made them compatible with the White Australia Policy.

Later, between 1967 and 1971, during the final years of the step-by-step dismantling of the White Australia policy, approximately 10,000 [[Turkish people|Turkish citizens]] settled in Australia under an agreement between Australia and [[Turkey]]. From the 1970s onwards, there was a significant shift in the government's attitude towards immigration, and with the White Australia policy now totally dismantled from 1973 onwards, instead of trying to make newer foreign nationals assimilate and forgo their heritage, the government became more accommodating and tolerant of differences by adopting a policy of [[multiculturalism]].

[[File:Chullora Greenacre Mosque.JPG|300px|thumb|The Chullora Greenacre Mosque]]
Larger-scale Muslim migration of non-White non-European Muslims began in 1975 with the migration of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] Muslims, which rapidly increased during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] from 22,311 or 0.17% of the Australian population in 1971, to 45,200 or 0.33% in 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Lebanese Muslims are still the largest and highest-profile Muslim group in Australia, although Lebanese Christians form a majority of [[Lebanese Australian]]s, outnumbering their Muslim counterparts at a 6-to-4 ratio.

By the beginning of the 21st-century, Muslims from more than sixty countries had settled in Australia. While a very large number of them come from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Lebanon]], there are Muslims from [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Iran]], [[Fiji]], [[Albania]], [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], among others.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} At the time of the 2011 census, 476,000 Australians (representing 2.2 percent of the population) reported Islam as their religion.&lt;ref name="ABS 2012 Cultural Diversity in Australia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Diversity in Australia|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2071.0main+features902012-2013|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=30 September 2014|date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Since the 1990s====
Trade and educational links have been developed between Australia and several Muslim countries. Muslim students from countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]], are among the thousands of international students studying in Australian universities.{{quantify|date=August 2008}}{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A number of Australian Arabs experienced [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab backlash]] during the [[First Gulf War]]. Newspapers received numerous letters calling for Arab Australians to "prove their loyalty" or "go home", and some Arab Australian Muslim women wearing ''hijab'' head coverings were reportedly harassed in public. The Australian government's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission included accounts of racial harassment experienced by some Australian Arabs in their 1991 report on racism in Australia.&lt;ref name=halalafic/&gt;{{rp|11–13}}

On a few occasions in the 2000s and 2010s, tensions have flared between Australian Muslims and the general population. The [[Sydney gang rapes]] formed a much reported set of incidents in 2000; a group of Lebanese men sexually assaulted non-Muslim women. In 2005, tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] area of Sydney led to [[2005 Cronulla riots|violent rioting]]; the incident resulted in mass arrests and criminal prosecution. In 2012, Muslims [[2012 Sydney anti-Islam film protests|protesting in central Sydney]] against ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'', an anti-Islam film trailer, resulted in rioting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8534089/govt-hopes-no-islamic-protest-in-melbourne "Govt Hopes No Islamic Protests In Melbourne."]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Nine MSN''.

Shared practices include male circumcision, arranged or promised marriages and polygamy, and similar cultural attitudes like respect for land and resources, and respecting one's elders. "Many Aboriginal people I spoke with explained these cultural synergies often by quoting the well-known phrase from the Koran that 124,000 prophets had been sent to the Earth," says Stephenson. "They argued that some of these prophets must have visited Aboriginal communities and shared their knowledge."}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others see it as a fresh start and an aid against common social ills [[Indigenous Australians#Contemporary issues|afflicting indigenous Australians]], such as alcohol and drug abuse.&lt;ref name=Janak/&gt;

==Issues==
Concerns and contemporary issues facing the Australian Muslim community include rates of unemployment, the rights of women, concerns over [[Islamism]] and [[Islamic radicalism]], among others.

In December 2015 the Director General of ASIO [[Duncan Lewis]] stated that the number of Australians seeking to travel overseas to fight with groups such as ISIS had "plateaued a bit" due to better awareness of the issue among the Islamic community, few young Australians being attracted to ISIS and improvements to the speed with which passports could be cancelled. He also stated that a "tiny, tiny" proportion of Australian Muslims were influenced by ISIS. At this time the government believed there were around 110 Australians fighting with extremist groups, which was slightly lower than previous levels, and 44 Australians had been killed in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wroe|first1=David|title=Flow of Australian Islamic State fighters has hit 'plateau', says ASIO boss|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/flow-of-australian-islamic-state-fighters-has-hit-plateau-says-asio-boss-20151216-glp6ur.html|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=The Canberra Times|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, "What is the likelihood that Islamic State will carry out a large scale terrorist attack in Australia?"   24% of the respondents said "it is inevitable",  23% said "very likely" and 29% said "likely".

In May 2017, answering the questions during the [[Australian Senate]]-hearing, [[Duncan Lewis]], the director-general of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]], stated that there's de facto no connection between refugees and terrorism in Australia whilst adding: "But the context is very important. The reason they are terrorists is not because they are refugees but because of the violent, extremist interpretation of [[Sunni Islam]] that they have adopted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/asio-chief-duncan-lewis-radical-sunni-islam-not-refugees-the-source-of-terrorism-20170531-gwgsex.html|title=ASIO chief Duncan Lewis: Radical Sunni Islam, not refugees, the source of terrorism|first=Fergus|last=Hunter|date=30 May 2017|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 the Grand Mufti of Australia and several high profile imams issued a new year's message supporting a fatwa against Islamic State.

===Discrimination===
{{see also|Islamophobia in Australia}}
According to some scholars, a particular trend of anti-Muslim prejudice has developed in Australia since the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Poynting&gt;Poynting, Scott, and Victoria Mason. "The resistible rise of Islamophobia Anti-Muslim racism in the UK and Australia before 11 September 2001."

A report published in 2004 by the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] pointed to many Muslim Australians who felt the Australian media was unfairly critical of, and often vilified their community due to generalisations of terrorism and the emphasis on crime. The use of ethnic or religious labels in news reports about crime was thought to stir up racial tensions.&lt;ref name="HREOC_report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/isma/report/chap2.html |title=National consultations on eliminating prejudice against Arab and Muslim Australians |accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=16 June 2004 |work= |publisher=[[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission|HREOC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[White Australia]] immigration laws were replaced with [[multicultural]] policies the social disadvantage of Muslims was thought to have been alleviated. Some sources, however, note that Muslims now face some disadvantages on account of their religion.&lt;ref name=halalafic/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} At times there has been opposition to the construction of new mosques in Australia. A 2014 report from the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy, [[University of Western Sydney]], on mosques in New South Wales found that 44 percent of mosques in the state had "experienced resistance from the local community when the mosque was initially proposed". In around 20 percent of these cases opposition was from a small number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Underabi|first1=Husnia|title=Mosques of Sydney and New South Wales|url=http://uws.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/754140/IS0001_ISRA_NSW_Msq_Rprt.pdf|publisher=Charles Sturt University; ISRA Australia; University of Western Sydney|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Michael Humphrey, a professor of [[sociology]] at the [[University of Sydney]], much of Islamic culture and organisation in Australia has been borne of the [[marginalisation|social marginalisation]] experiences of Muslim [[working class]] migrants. This "immigrant Islam" is often viewed by the host society as a force of "cultural resistance" toward the multicultural and secular nature of the general Australian culture. Muslim practices of praying, fasting and veiling appear as challenging the conformity within public spaces and the values of gender equality in social relationships and individual rights. The immigrant Muslims are often required to "negotiate their Muslimness" in the course of their encounters with Australian society, the governmental and other social institutions and bureaucracies.&lt;ref name=ozislamcity&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Akbarzadeh|editor1-first=Shahram|editor2-last=Saeed|editor2-first=Abdullah|last=Humphrey|first=Michael|chapter=An Australian Islam?

A poll of nearly 600 Muslim residents of Sydney released in November 2015 found that the respondents were three to five times more likely to have experienced racism than the general Australian population. However, approximately 97 per cent of the Muslim respondents reported that they had friendly relations with non-Muslims and felt welcome in Australia.&lt;ref name="Sydney Muslims feel at home"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Safi|first1=Michael|title=Sydney Muslims feel at home despite very high racism exposure, survey finds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/30/sydney-muslims-feel-at-home-despite-very-high-racism-exposure-survey-finds|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an Australia-wide survey published in November 2015, which was based on 1,573 interviews, which asked, "Are Muslims that live in Australia doing enough to integrate into the Australian community, or should they be doing more?", only 20% of respondents thought Muslims are currently "doing enough".&lt;ref name = "Islam poll"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/terror/australians-fear-terror-will-hit-home-newspoll/story-fnpdbcmu-1227618940517  |title=Australians fear terror will hit home: Newspoll | author=Hudson Phillip|date=23 November 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Muslim poll"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://resources.news.com.au/files/2015/11/22/1227618/907024-151123terror.pdf  |title= NewsPoll|date=23 November 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An association of Sephardic Jews, it supports a large synagogue in [[Caracas]] and counts about 800 families among its members.&lt;ref&gt;David Krusch.

==2009 attack==

In late January 2009, the synagogue was badly damaged in a well-organized attack, following an article inciting anti-Semitic violence, which appeared (later removed, and replaced by an apology) on a government website, after the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]].

They also called for Jews to be expelled from the country. Venezuela's Foreign Minister [[Nicolas Maduro]] condemned the act as a "criminal act of vandalism". The Information Minister [[Jesse Chacón]] also condemned the attack and denied it had any connection with the government.

&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;Multi-storied pagodas in wood and stone, and a ''gorintō''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;Pagodas in Japan are called {{nihongo|'''tō'''|塔|lit. pagoda}}, sometimes {{nihongo|'''buttō'''|仏塔|lit. Buddhist pagoda}} or {{nihongo|'''tōba'''|塔婆|lit. pagoda}} and historically derive from the [[Chinese pagoda]], itself an interpretation of the Indian ''[[stupa]]''.&lt;ref name="IK "/&gt;  Like the ''stupa'', pagodas were originally used as [[reliquaries]] but in many cases they ended up losing this function.&lt;ref name="jaanustou"/&gt; Pagodas are quintessentially Buddhist and an important component of [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Japanese Buddhist temple]] compounds but, because until the [[Shinbutsu bunri|Kami and Buddhas Separation Act]] of 1868, a [[Shinto shrine]] was normally [[Shinbutsu-shūgō|also a Buddhist temple and vice versa]], they are not rare at shrines either. The famous [[Itsukushima Shrine]], for example, has one.&lt;ref name=hamashima group=&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamashima|first=Masashi|title=Jisha Kenchiku no Kanshō Kiso Chishiki|year=1999|publisher=Shibundō|location=Tokyo|pages=88|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Meiji Restoration]] the word ''tō'', once used exclusively in a religious context, came to mean also "[[tower]]" in the western sense, as for example in {{nihongo|[[Eiffel tower]]|エッフェル塔|Efferu-tō}}.

Of the Japanese pagoda's many forms, some are built in wood and are collectively known as {{nihongo|''mokutō''|木塔|lit. wood pagoda}}, but most are carved out of stone ({{nihongo|''sekitō''|石塔|lit. stone pagoda}}. Wood pagodas are large buildings with either two stories (like the {{nihongo|''tahōtō''|多宝塔|lit. [[:ja:多宝如来|Tahō]] pagoda}}, see photo below) or an odd number of stories. Extant wood pagodas with more than two storeys have almost always either three storeys (and are therefore called {{nihongo|''sanjū-no-tō''|三重塔|lit. three-storeyed pagoda}}) or five (and are called {{nihongo|''gojū-no-tō''|五重塔|lit. five-storeyed pagoda}}. Stone pagodas are nearly always small, usually well below 3 metres, and as a rule offer no usable space. If they have more than one story, pagodas are called {{nihongo|''tasōtō''|多層塔|lit. multi-storied pagoda}} or {{nihongo|''tajūtō''|多重塔|lit. multi-storied pagoda}}.

A pagoda's size is measured in ''[[Ken (architecture)|ken]]'', where a ''ken'' is the interval between two pillars of a traditional-style building. A  ''[[tahōtō]]'' for example can be either 5x5 ken or 3x3 ''ken''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title=Nihon Kenchiku-shi   | editor=Fujita Masaya, Koga Shūsaku   | publisher=Shōwa-dō   | date=April 10, 1990   | edition=September 30, 2008   | isbn=4-8122-9805-9   | language=Japanese   |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is usually translated in English as "bay" and is better understood as an indication of proportions than as a unit of measurement.

==History==
[[File:Hokiji03ds1536.jpg|Japan's oldest three-storeyed pagoda at [[Hokki-ji]], [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara Pref.]] It was built in 706.|thumb|160 px]]The ''stupa'' was originally a simple mound containing the [[Buddha]]'s ashes which in time became more elaborate, while its finial grew proportionally larger.&lt;ref name="jaanustou"&gt;Jaanus, ''Tou''&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching China, the stupa met the Chinese watchtower and evolved into the pagoda, a tower with an odd number of storeys.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Odd numbers are strongly favoured by Chinese [[numerology]] and Buddhism. They are supposed to represent [[yin and yang|yang]], that is, the male and positive principle, and are therefore considered lucky.&lt;/ref&gt; Its use then spread to Korea and, from there, to Japan. Following its arrival in Japan together with [[Buddhism]] in the 6th century, the pagoda became one of the focal points of the early Japanese ''[[garan]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Temple compound, ideally composed of seven buildings.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan it evolved in shape, size and function, finally losing its original role as a reliquary.&lt;ref name="nk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fujita|Koga|2008|pp=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became extremely common, while on the Asian continent it is rare.&lt;ref name="scheidpa"&gt;Scheid, Japanische Pagoden&lt;/ref&gt;

With the birth of new sects in later centuries, the pagoda lost importance and was consequently relegated to the margins of the ''garan''. Temples of the [[Jōdo]] sects rarely have a pagoda.&lt;ref name="jaanustou"/&gt; During the [[Kamakura period]] the [[Zen]] sect arrived in Japan and their temples do not normally include a pagoda.

Pagodas originally were reliquaries and did not contain sacred images, but in Japan many, for example [[Hōryū-ji]]'s five-storied pagoda, enshrine statues of various deities.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; To allow the opening of a room at the ground floor and therefore create some usable space, the pagoda's central shaft, which originally reached the ground, was shortened to the upper stories, where it rested on supporting beams.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; In that room are enshrined statues of the temple's main objects of worship. Inside [[Shingon]] pagodas there can be paintings of deities called {{nihongo|Shingon Hasso|真言八祖}}; on the ceiling and on the central shaft there can be decorations and paintings.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt;

===Design and structure evolution===
The edge of a pagoda's [[eaves]] forms a straight line, with each following edge being shorter than the other. The more difference in length (a parameter called {{nihongo|''teigen''|逓減|gradual diminution}} in Japanese) between stories, the more solid and secure the pagoda seems to be. Both ''teigen'' and the [[finial]] are greater in older pagodas, giving them a sense of solidity.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; Vice versa, recent pagodas tend to be steeper and have shorter finials, creating svelter silhouettes.

From the structural point of view, old pagodas had a {{nihongo|stone base|心礎|shinso}} over which stood the {{nihongo|main pillar|心柱|shinbashira}}. Around it would be erected the first story's supporting pillars, then the beams supporting the eaves and so on. The other stories would be built over the completed one, and on top of the main pillar would at last be inserted the finial.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; In later eras, all of the supporting structures would be erected at once, and later to them were fixed parts of more cosmetic function.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt;

Early pagodas had a central pillar that penetrated deep into the ground. With the evolution of architectural techniques, it was first put to rest on a base stone at ground level, then it was shortened and put to rest on beams at the second story to allow the opening of a room.&lt;ref name="jaanustou"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt;

Their role within the temple declined gradually while they were being functionally replaced by [[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|main halls]] (''kondō''). Originally the centerpiece of the Shingon and Tendai ''[[garan]]'', they were moved later to its edges and finally abandoned, in particular by the Zen sects, the last to appear in Japan.

===Loss of importance of the pagoda within the garan===
[[Image:飛鳥寺復元図.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of [[Asuka-dera]]'s original layout with a pagoda at its center]]

Because of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas used to be the centerpiece of the ''[[shichidō garan|garan]]'', the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple.&lt;ref name="tamura"&gt;*{{cite book   |last=Tamura   |first=Yoshiro   |title=Japanese Buddhism - A Cultural History   |publisher=Kosei Publishing Company   |location=Tokyo   |year=2000   |edition=First   |pages=40–41 pages   |isbn=4-333-01684-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They gradually lost importance and were replaced by the ''[[Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)|kondō]]'' (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that Zen schools, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not have any pagoda in their ''garan''. The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order [[Asuka-dera]], [[Shitennō-ji]], [[Hōryū-ji]], and [[Yakushi-ji]].&lt;ref name="tamura"/&gt; In the first, the pagoda was at the very center of the ''garan'' surrounded by three small ''kondō'' (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single ''kondō'' is at the center of the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large ''kondō'' at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.

==Stone pagodas==
[[File:16-tier-buttou.jpg|thumb|150 px|A rare 16-story stone pagoda at [[Chōshō-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]]]
Stone pagodas (''sekitō'') are usually made of materials like [[apatite]] or [[granite]], are much smaller than wooden ones and are finely carved.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; Often they bear [[sanskrit]] inscriptions, Buddhist figurines and Japanese lunar calendar dates ''[[nengō]]''. Like wooden ones, they are mostly classifiable on the basis of the number of stories as ''tasōtō'' or ''hōtō'', but there are however some styles hardly ever seen in wood, namely the ''gorintō'', the ''muhōtō'', the ''hōkyōintō'' and the ''kasatōba''.&lt;ref name="jaanusseki"&gt;JAANUS, ''Sekitou''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tasōtō'' or ''tajūtō''===
With a few very rare exceptions, ''tasōtō'' (also called ''tajūtō'', 多層塔) have an odd number of stories, normally comprised between three and thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS, ''Tasoutou''&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually less than three meters tall, but they can occasionally be much taller. The tallest still extant is a 13-story pagoda at Hannya-ji in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], which is 14.12 m. They are often dedicated to Buddha and offer no usable room, but some have a small space inside which holds a sacred image.&lt;ref name="jaanusseki"/&gt; In the oldest extant specimen, while the edge of each story are parallel to the ground, each successive story is smaller than the next, resulting in a strongly slanted curve. More modern ''tasōtō'' tend to have a less pronounced curve.
*{{Commons category-inline|tasōtō}}

===''Hōtō''===
[[File:Houtou - Ankokuron-ji.jpg|150px|left|thumb|A ''hōtō'' at [[Ankokuron-ji]]]]
A {{nihongo|''hōtō''|宝塔|lit. jewel stupa}} is a pagoda consisting of four parts: a low foundation stone, a cylindrical body with a rounded top, a four-sided roof and a [[finial]].&lt;ref name="jaanushoutou"/&gt; Unlike the similar ''tahōtō'' (see section below) it has no enclosed pent roof (''[[mokoshi]]'') around its circular core.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; Like the  ''tahōtō'' it takes its name from Buddhist deity [[:ja:多宝如来|Tahō Nyorai]].  The ''hōtō'' was born during the early [[Heian period]], when the [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] sects first arrived in Japan. Indeed, because it does not exist on the Asian continent, it is believed to have been invented in Japan.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt;

There used to exist full-size ''hōtō'', but almost only miniature ones survive, normally made of stone and/or metal.&lt;ref name="jaanushoutou"&gt;JAANUS, ''Houtou''&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Commons category-inline|hōtō}}

===''Gorintō''===
''{{main|Gorintō}}''

[[File:Mimizuka-M1773 corrected.jpg|thumb|150 px|A ''gorintō'']]The {{nihongo|''gorintō''|五輪塔|lit. five ring tower}} is a pagoda found almost only in Japan and believed to have been first adopted by the [[Shingon]] and [[Tendai]] sects during the mid [[Heian period]].&lt;ref name="jaanusgo"&gt;JAANUS - ''Gorintou''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used as a tomb marker or as a cenotaph, and is therefore a common sight in Buddhist temples and cemeteries. It is also called {{nihongo|''gorinsotōba''|五輪卒塔婆}} ("five-ringed stupa") or {{nihongo|''goringedatsu''|五輪解脱}}, where the term ''sotoba'' is a transliteration of the Sanskrit word [[stupa]].&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;

In all its variations, the ''gorintō'' is made of five blocks (although that number can sometimes be difficult to detect), each having one of the five shapes which symbolize of the [[Five elements (Japanese philosophy)|Five Elements]] believed to be the basic building blocks of reality: earth (cube), water (sphere), fire (pyramid), air (crescent), and ether, energy, or void (lotus).&lt;ref name="jaanusgo"/&gt; The last two rings (air and ether) are visually and conceptually united into a single subgroup.

[[File:Jikoji hokyointo.JPG|thumb|left|150 px|A ''hōkyōintō'']]The {{nihongo|''hōkyōintō''|宝篋印塔}} is a large stone pagoda so called because it originally contained the {{nihongo|Hōkyōin|宝篋印}} {{nihongo|[[dharani]]|陀羅尼}} [[sūtra]].&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;Iwanami Kōjien Japanese dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally used as a cenotaph for the King of [[Wuyue (Ten Kingdoms)|Wuyue]] - [[Qian Liu]] in China.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;

The ''hōkyōintō'' tradition in Japan is believed to have begun during the [[Asuka period]] (550–710 CE).&lt;ref name="YMM"/&gt; They used to be made of wood and started to be made in stone only during the Kamakura period.&lt;ref name="YMM"/&gt; It is also during this period that they started to be used as tombstones and cenotaphs.&lt;ref name="YMM"/&gt;  The ''hōkyōintō'' started to be made in its present form during the [[Kamakura period]].&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt; Like a ''gorintō'', it is divided in five main sections representing the five elements of Japanese cosmology.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; The sūtra it sometimes hides contain all the pious deeds of a [[Tathagata]] Buddha, and the faithful believe that, by praying in front of the ''hōkyōintō'', their sins will be canceled, during their lives they will be protected from disasters and after death they will go to heaven.&lt;ref name="YMM"&gt;Yatsushiro Municipal Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|''muhōtō''|無縫塔|lit. no stitch tower}} or {{nihongo|''rantō''|卵塔|lit. egg tower}} is a pagoda which usually marks the gravesite of a Buddhist priest. It was originally used by just the Zen schools, but it was later adopted by the others too.&lt;ref name="jaanusmu"&gt;JAANUS - ''Muhoutou''&lt;/ref&gt;  Its characteristic egg-shaped upper portion is supposed to be a [[phallic symbol]].

===''Kasatōba''===
A {{nihongo|''kasatōba''|笠塔婆|umbrella stupa}} (see photo in the gallery below) is simply a square stone post placed over a square base and covered by a pyramidal roof. Over the roof stand a bowl-shaped stone and a lotus-shaped stone. The shaft can be carved with Sanskrit words or low-relief images of Buddhist gods. Within the shaft there can be stone wheels which allow the faithful to turn the stupa around while praying as with a [[prayer wheel]].&lt;ref name="jaanuskasatouba"&gt;JAANUS - Kasatouba&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|''sōrintō''|相輪橖}} is a type of small pagoda consisting just of a pole and a ''[[sōrin]]''.

==Wooden pagodas==

===''Tasōtō''===
[[File:Yakushiji Nara11s5bs4200.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Yakushi-ji's Eastern Pagoda]]Wooden ''tasōtō'' are pagodas with an odd number of stories. Some may appear to have an even number because of the presence between stories of purely decorative enclosed pent roofs called ''[[mokoshi]]''&lt;ref group=note&gt;Besides being decorative in themselves,they are also used also to hide structural components which would otherwise mar the pagoda's feel.&lt;/ref&gt; A famous example is [[Yakushi-ji]]'s eastern pagoda (see photo to the left), which seems to have six stories but has in fact only three. Another is the ''tahōtō'' (see below), which has a single story, plus a ''mokoshi'' under its roof, and seems therefore to have two stories.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On the subject, see also the articles ''[[Hisashi (architecture)|Hisashi]]'', [[Mokoshi]] and [[Moya (architecture)|Moya]].&lt;/ref&gt; There existed specimen with seven or nine stories, but all extant ones have either three (and are therefore called {{nihongo|''sanjū-no-tō''|三重塔|lit. three-storied pagoda}}) or five (and are called {{nihongo|''gojū-no-tō''|五重塔|lit. five-storied pagoda}}.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt;（Tanzan Jinja in Sakurai, [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], has a pagoda having thirteen, which however for structural reasons is classified separately, and is not considered a ''tasōtō''.)&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; The oldest three-storied pagoda stands at Nara's [[Hokki-ji]] and was built between 685 and 706.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; The oldest extant five-storied pagoda belongs to [[Hōryū-ji]] and was built some time during the [[Asuka period]] (538 -710).  The tallest wooden ''tasōtō'' belongs to [[Tō-ji]], Kyoto. It has five stories and is 54 m tall.
*{{Commons category-inline|tasōtō}}

===Hōtō===
[[File:Yaakuouji houtou.jpg|thumb|150 px|A ''hōtō'' at Yakuō-ji, Tokushima prefecture]]A wooden ''hōtō'' is a rare type of pagoda consisting of four parts: a low foundation stone, a cylindrical body with a rounded top, a pyramidal roof and a [[finial]].&lt;ref name="jaanushoutou"/&gt; Unlike the similar ''tahōtō'' (see section below) it has no square enclosed pent roof (''[[mokoshi]]'') around its cylindrical core.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; Like the  ''tahōtō'' it takes its name from Buddhist deity {{nihongo|[[:ja:多宝如来|Tahō Nyorai]]}}.  The ''hōtō'' was born during the early [[Heian period]], when the [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] Buddhist sects first arrived in Japan.

There used to be many full-size ''hōtō'', but almost only miniature ones survive, normally made of stone and/or metal. A good example of full-size ''hōtō'' can be seen at [[Ikegami Honmon-ji]] in [[Nishi-magome Station|Nishi-magome]], [[Tokyo]]. The pagoda is 17.4 meter tall and 5.7 meter wide.&lt;ref name="jaanushoutou"/&gt;

*{{Commons category-inline|hōtō}}

===''Tahōtō''===
{{main|Tahōtō}}
[[File:Negoroji03s3200.jpg|thumb|150 px|left|Negoro-ji's ''daitō'']]The ''tahōtō'' is a type of wooden pagoda unique for having an even number of stories (two), the first square with a rounded core, the second circular. This style of ''tō'' was created surrounding the cylindrical base of a ''hōtō'' (see above) with a square, roofed corridor called ''[[mokoshi]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For reasons of space, however, the wall separating the ''mokoshi'' from the core of the pagoda is present only in large ''tahōtō'' called ''daitō'' (see the next section).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; The core of the pagoda has just one story with its ceiling below the circular second story, which is inaccessible. Like the ''tasōtō'' and the ''[[rōmon]]'', in spite of its appearance it therefore offers usable space only at the ground floor.&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt;

Because its kind does not exist either in Korea or in China, it is believed to have been invented in Japan during the [[Heian period]] (794 - 1185). The ''tahōtō'' was important enough to be considered one of the seven indispensable buildings (the so-called ''[[shichidō garan]]'') of a [[Shingon]] temple.&lt;ref name="jaanusdaitou"&gt;JAANUS, Daitou&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kūkai]] himself is responsible for the construction of the ''tahōto'' at [[Mount Kōya]]'s [[Kongōbu-ji]].

====''Daitō''====
[[File:Negoroji-daitou-flooplan.svg|thumb|180 px|The floorplan of Negoro-ji's ''daitō'']]Usually the base of a ''tahōtō'' is 3-''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'' across with four main, supporting pillars called {{nihongo|''shitenbashira''|四天柱}} at the corners (see drawing).&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; The room the ''shitenbashira'' form houses a sanctuary where the main objects of worship (the ''[[gohonzon]]'') are enshrined.

Larger, 5x5 ''ken'' ''tahōtō'' however exist and are called {{nihongo|''daitō''|大塔|lit. large pagoda}} because of their dimensions. This is the only type of ''tahōtō'' to retain the original structure with a wall separating the corridor (''mokoshi'') from the core of the structure. This type of pagoda used to be common but, of all ''daitō'' ever built, only three are still extant. One is at [[Wakayama prefecture]]'s [[Negoro-ji]], another at [[Kongōbu-ji]], again in Wakayama, and the last at Kirihata-dera, [[Tokushima prefecture]].&lt;ref name="jaanusdaitou"/&gt; The ''daitō'' at Kongōbu-ji was founded by [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon sect]]'s  [[Kūkai]]. The specimen found at Negoro-ji (see photo above) is 30.85 meters tall and a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]].

===''Sotōba''===
Often offertory strips of wood with five subdivisions and covered with elaborate inscriptions called {{nihongo|''sotōba''|卒塔婆}} can be found at tombs in Japanese cemeteries (see photo in the gallery below).&lt;ref name="nk"/&gt; The inscriptions contain [[sūtra]] and the posthumous name of the dead person. Their name derives from the Sanskrit [[stūpa]], and they can be also considered pagodas.

A '''kalari''' is a traditional training space for [[kalaripayattu]], a martial art of [[Kerala]]. The word "''kalari''" means "threshing floor" or "battlefield" in [[Malayalam]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Also, the past village schools of Kerala, run by the traditional astrologers families, were known by the name "''kalari''" or [[Ezhuthu Kalari]].&lt;ref name=" A.Ayyappan Page26"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mbkiAAAAMAAJ |last=Ayyappan | first=A  | title=Social revolution in a Kerala village: a study in culture change |pages=26–27 |publisher=Asia publication house |location=New Delhi |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Poothara.JPG|thumb|Puttara]]
Every kalari has a ''[[puttara]]'' (meaning "platform where flowers are kept" in Malayalam). The puttara is a seven tiered platform placed in the south-west corner and houses the guardian deity of the kalari. The seven tiers symbolise the seven sisters of Amritavani whom where [[Chekavar]]s of North Malabar were born. These 7+1 system is the basis of 7+1 illams of Thiyyas (Chekavar) of North Malabar. Other deities, most of them incarnations of the Bhagavathi or Shiva, are installed in the corners. Flowers, incense and water are offered to the deity every day.

Meenakshi Amma has been awarded Padma Sri in the year 2017 . Sri. S.R.D. Prasad is the recipient of Kerala State Folklore Academy award in 2013 and the National Sangeet Natak Academy award in 2015 and also Senior Fellowship of Ministry of Culture to write the Encyclopedia.

==Kalari teachers==
[[File:Gurukkal with Student.jpg|thumb|Gurukkal with Student]]
The teacher in kalari is called [[Gurukkal (kalaripayattu)|Guru ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;or [[Kadhirur Gurukkal |Gurukkal]] or [[Aasaan| Asan]]. Teachers of [[Ezhuthu Kalari]] or Ezhuthu Palli&lt;ref name="Anupama Mohan Page142"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=y_h6vX0i7rsC |first=Anupama | last=Mohan | title=Utopia and the Village in South Asian Literatures  |pages=142|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan. |location=[[New Delhi]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; too were known as [[Aasaan|Asan]] or ''Ezhuthassan''.The traditional astrologer caste [[Kaniyar|Ganaka]] or [[Kaniyar]] were the [[preceptors]] of fencing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;L. Krishna Anantha Krishna Iyer (Diwan Bahadur); The Cochin tribes and castes; 1909&lt;/ref&gt; They are still addressed by the title Panickar in certain regions of Kerala.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Edgar Thurston, K. Rangachari : Castes and tribes of Southern India: Volume 1 :2001 :Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the duty of training martial arts was assigned to this sect by [[Parashurama]] in Keralolpathy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Meenakshi Amma was awarded Padma Shree in 2017.

==Construction of a kalari==

Traditionally the kalari is constructed by digging a hollow in the ground forming a sunken area four feet in depth, forty-two feet in length and twenty-one feet in breadth. This is usually called ''kuzhikalari''. Kuzhi means "portions formed by caving in the earth" in Malayalam.

The entrance to the Kalari is in the east, to let in the morning sunlight, and leads into the forty-two foot leg running East-West while the twenty-one foot leg runs North-South. Another consideration taken when constructing the kalari is that it is built in the south-west side of the main plot, just like the puttara which is kept in the South-West corner of the kalari itself. The floor of the kalari is leveled using mud.

In the southern and central kerala some kalaries were constructed in circular form and weapons and other instruments were placed on one end and outside the circular are the students used to sit and watch the training.

==''Ankakalari'' and ''ankathattu''==

[[Ankathattu]] is a four to six feet high platform constructed temporarily for the purpose of fighting [[duels]]. [[Ankam|"''Ankam''"]] means "war" in Malayalam. This platform is constructed as per tradition and is in the center of the ground from where people can watch the fight. The entire arrangement is called a''nkakalar'''''i'''.

Historically, in [[Kerala]], quarrels between local rulers were resolved by fixing an ''ankam'', a duel to the death, between two ''ankachekavar''s, each ruler being represented by one ''ankachekavar''. The ruler represented by the surviving ''ankachekavar'' was considered the winner.

==Kalari in literary works==
Information about kalari is found in the Tamil literary work [[Purananuru]]. The word "kalari" appears in the Puram (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and Akam (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe to both a battlefield and combat arena. It speaks of the kalari talents of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] kings of the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]], [[Chola Dynasty|Chola]] &amp; [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]] dynasties and Pallavas.

He is one of the demons which represented mountains. He is pictured in late iconography holding a ''banduddû'', "bucket". On a stela of [[Meli-Shipak II|Meli-Šipak]], the [[land grant to Ḫasardu kudurru]], he is pictured carrying a spade.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Das geistige Erfassen der Welt im Alten Orient Sprache, Religion, Kultur und Gesellschaft | chapter = The Four Winds and the Origin of Pazuzu | author = F.

==Mythology==

In the Sumerian myth, ''[[Angim]]'' or "[[Ninurta]]'s return to [[Nippur]]", the god "brought forth the [[Battle Bison beast | Bison (gud-alim)]] from his battle dust" and "hung the Bison on the beam". He is one of [[Tiamat|Tiāmat]]'s offspring vanquished by [[Marduk]] in the Epic of Creation, [[Enûma Eliš]]. In the prologue of the Anzû Myth, Ninurta defeats the kusarikku "in the midst of the sea". In an incantation against the evil eye of the [[Lamashtu|Lamaštu]], an incantation meant to soothe a crying child, kusarikku is portrayed as being ''negeltû'', "roused", and ''gullutu'', "frightened".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mesopotamian Magic: Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspectives | chapter = Magic at the cradle: A reassessment | author = K. Van Der Toorn | editor = I. Tzvi Abusch, K. Van Der Toorn | publisher = Styx | year = 1999 | page = 143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Ugallu]], [[Girtablilu|Girtablullû]], and others, he is one of the seven mythological ''[[apkallu]]'' or "sages" shown on neo-Assyrian palace reliefs, and with figurines &amp;ndash; to guard against the influence of evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Studies in the Iconography of Northwest Semitic Inscribed Seals: Proceedings of a symposium held in Fribourg on April 17-20, 1991 | chapter = The Mesopotamian Influence on West Semitic Inscribed Seals: A Preference for the Depiction of Mortals | author = Tally Ornan | editor = Benjamin Sass, Christopher Uehlinger | publisher = Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht | year = 1993 | page = 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The constellation of kusarikku, or gud-alim, corresponds to part of [[Centaurus]].

He was associated with the god of justice, [[Shamash|Šamaš]], along with Girtablullû, the "[[Scorpion man|Scorpion-Man]]", and alim, the "[[Battle Bison beast|Bison]]". There were three species of [[ungulates]] in Mesopotamia: the [[Aurochs]], the [[European bison|Bison]], and the [[Water buffalo]], and it is not always certain as to which of these was represented in some of the earlier text references.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Epics of Sumerian Kings: The Matter of Aratta | author = Herman L. J. Vanstiphout, Jerrold S. Cooper | publisher = Brill Academic Pub | year = 2004 | page = 163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to have been a distinction between the Sumerian terms gud-alim, "bison-man", and alim, "human-faced bison".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Gudea's Temple Building: The Representation of an Early Mesopotamian Ruler in Text and Image | author = Claudia E.

{{Celtic mythology}}
{{Main|Celtic pantheon}}
The [[Celtic pantheon]] is known from a variety of sources such as written [[Celtic mythology]], ancient places of worship, statues, engravings, religious objects, and place or personal names. The Celtic pantheon has over 1,200 named deities; a comprehensive list is difficult to assemble.

Celtic deities can belong to two categories: ''general deities'' and ''local deities''. "General deities" were known by [[Celts]] throughout large regions, and are the gods and goddesses invoked for protection, healing, luck, and honour. The "local deities" that embodied [[Celtic nature worship]] were the spirits of a particular feature of the landscape, such as mountains, trees, or rivers, and thus were generally only known by the locals in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Trung|title=History of Gods|publisher=EnCognitive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Celtic nations|Celtic lands]] became [[Christianisation|Christianised]], there were attempts by Christian writers to [[euhemerism|euhemerize]] or even [[demonize]] the pre-Christian deities. For example, the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] of [[Irish mythology|Irish mythological]] sources have commonly been interpreted to be a divine [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], despite certain redactors' interjecting that the Tuatha Dé Danann were merely mortals, or else that they were demons.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt;

==Gaulish and Brythonic deities==
The [[Gauls|Gaulish Celts]] inhabited the region corresponding to modern-day [[France]], [[Switzerland]], southern and western [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], Frisia, Netherlands, [[Holland]], [[Luxembourg]] and northern [[Italy]]. The Brythonic Celts, or [[Britons (historic)|Britons]], inhabited most of the island of [[Great Britain]] and later migrated to [[Brittany]].

==Welsh deities/characters==
The Welsh are the Britons that inhabit modern-day [[Wales]] ({{Lang-cy|Cymru}}). After the [[Anglo-Saxons]] invaded Britain, many Brythonic territories came under Anglo-Saxon influence; in Wales, however, Brythonic Celtic religion was largely retained. Many Welsh myths were later Christianized so it is sometimes difficult to determine if their characters were originally gods, mortals, or historical figures.

==History of Buddhist temples in Japan==
[[Buddhism]] arrived in Japan in the mid–6th century, and was officially adopted in the wake of the [[Battle of Shigisan]] in 587, after which [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] began to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|Sansom|1958|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soga no Umako]] built Hōkō-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 and 596. It was later renamed as [[Asuka-dera]] for [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], the name of the capital where it was located. [[Prince Shotoku]] actively promoted Buddhism and ordered the construction of [[Shitennō-ji]] in [[Osaka]] (593) and [[Hōryū-ji]] near his palace in [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga]] (completed in 603).&lt;ref name="young-p38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ancient period, the temple layout was strictly prescribed and followed mainland styles, with a main gate facing south, and the most sacred area surrounded by a semi-enclosed roofed corridor (''[[kairō]]'') accessible through a middle gate (''chūmon''). The sacred precinct contained a pagoda, which acted as a reliquary for sacred objects, and an image hall (''kon-dō''). The complex might have other structures such as a lecture hall (''kōdō''), a [[Bell tower|belfry]] (''shōrō''), a sutra repository (''[[kyōzō]]''), priests' and monks'
quarters and bathhouses.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p731"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal temple had a heart formed by seven structures—called ''[[Shichidō garan]]''. Buddhism, and the construction of temples, spread from the capital to outlying areas in the [[Hakuhō period]] from 645 to 710.&lt;ref name="young-p38"/&gt; Because of fire, earthquakes, typhoons and wars, few of the ancient temples
remain. [[Hōryū-ji]], rebuilt after a fire in 670, is the only temple with 7th century structures which are the oldest extant wooden
buildings in the world.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p731"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996|p=731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike early [[Shinto shrine]]s, early Buddhist temples were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical.&lt;ref name="young-p44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the late 7th century Hōryū-ji, temples began to move towards indigenous methods expressed by irregular ground plans that resulted in an asymmetric arrangement of buildings, greater use of natural materials such as cypress bark instead of roof tiling, and an increased awareness of natural environment with the placement of buildings among trees. This adaption was assisted by the [[Shinbutsu shūgō|syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="young-p44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youngyew-p52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|Yew|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youngyew-p44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|Yew|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the first half of the 8th century, [[Emperor Shōmu]] decreed temples and nunneries be erected in each province and that [[Tōdai-ji]] be built as a headquarters for the network of temples.&lt;ref name="young-p39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young-p46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head temple was inaugurated in 752 and was of monumental dimensions with two seven-storied pagodas, each ca. {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} tall and a Great Buddha Hall (''daibutsuden'') about {{convert|80|x|70|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="nishi-p16"/&gt; [[Nara period]] Buddhism was characterised by seven influential state supported temples, the so-called ''[[Nanto Shichi Daiji]]''.&lt;ref name="young-p46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octagonal structures such as the Hall of Dreams at Hōryū-ji built as memorial halls and storehouses exemplified by the [[Shōsōin]] first appeared during the Nara period.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p731"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher-p732"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996|p=732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple structures, such as pagodas and main halls, had increased significantly in size since the late 6th century. The placement of the pagoda moved to a more peripheral location and the roof [[Bracket (architecture)|bracketing]] system increased in complexity as roofs grew larger and heavier.&lt;ref name="young-p49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Heian period]] (9th–10th century) saw an evolution of style based on the [[Esoteric Buddhism|esoteric]] sects [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]], which were situated in mountainous areas. A new style termed {{nihongo||[[wayō]]|和様|Japanese style}} emerged with the following characteristics: a main hall divided in two parts; an outer area for novices and an inner area for initiates; a hip-and-gable roof that covered both areas; a raised wooden floor instead of the tile or stone floors of earlier temples; extended eaves to cover the front steps; [[Shake (roof)|shingles]] or bark rather than tile roofing; and an adaption to the natural environment in contrast to symmetrical layouts.&lt;ref name="young-p44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youngyew-p47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|Yew|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tahōtō]], a two-storied tower with a resemblance to Indian [[stupa]]s was also introduced by these sects during the Heian period.&lt;ref name="nishi-p17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kleiner-p97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleiner|Mamiya|2009|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an ancient Buddhist prophecy, the world would enter a [[Mappō|dark period]] in 1051. During this period the Tendai sect believed enlightenment was possible only by the veneration of [[Amida Buddha]]. Consequently, Paradise or Amida Halls—such as the Phoenix Hall at [[Byōdō-in]] (1053), the main hall of
Jōruri-ji (1157) or the Golden Hall at [[Chūson-ji]] (1124)—were built by the imperial family or members of the aristocracy to recreate the western paradise of Amida on earth.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p732"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kleiner-p97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youngyew-p48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|Yew|2004|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young-p56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|2007|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kleiner-p98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleiner|Mamiya|2009|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Halls that enshrined the nine statues of Amida{{#tag:ref|The statues represented the nine stages of nirvana.&lt;ref name="youngyew-p49"/&gt;|group="nb"}} were popular during the 12th century in the late Heian period. The main hall of Jōruri-ji is the only extant example of these halls.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p732"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youngyew-p49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Young|Yew|2004|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Daibutsuyō|Daibutsu]] style and the [[Zen'yō|Zen]] style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century. The Daibutsu or Great Buddha style, introduced by the priest Chogen, was based on [[Song dynasty]] architecture and represented the antithesis of the ''wayō'' style. The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style.&lt;ref name="young-p44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher-p737"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996|p=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nishi-p20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishi|Hozumi|1996|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristics of the Zen style are earthen floors, subtly curved pent roofs (''[[mokoshi]]'') and pronouncedly curved main roofs, [[wikt:cusped|cusped]] windows and panelled doors.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p737"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher-p738"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fletcher|Cruickshank|1996|p=738}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this style include Butsuden at [[Kōzan-ji (Shimonoseki)|Kōzan-ji in Shimonoseki]], Shakadō at [[Zenpuku-in]] and Octagonal Three-storied Pagoda at [[Anraku-ji (Ueda)|Anraku-ji]].&lt;ref&gt;Publication of Asahi Shimbun "Beauty of national treasure No.39, 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; The three Japanese styles, ''wayō'', Daibutsu and Zen were combined in the [[Muromachi period]] giving rise to a conglomerate eclectic style represented by the main hall at [[Kakurin-ji (Kakogawa)|Kakurin-ji]].&lt;ref name="young-p44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fletcher-p738"/&gt; By the end of the Muromachi period (late 16th century), Japanese Buddhist architecture had reached its apogee.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p738"/&gt; Construction methods had been perfected and building types conventionalized. Early pre-modern temples were saved from monotony by elaborate structural details, the use of undulating ''[[karahafu]]'' gables and monumental size of the buildings.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p738"/&gt; Representative examples for [[Momoyama period|Momoyama]] (1568–1603) and [[Edo period]] (1603–1868) temple architecture are the [[Karamon]] at [[Hōgon-ji]] and the main hall of [[Kiyomizu-dera]] respectively.&lt;ref name="fletcher-p738"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4343">{{Uruk Epics}}
'''''Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave''''' is a [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] mythological account. It is one of the four known stories that belong to the same cycle describing conflicts between [[Enmerkar]], king of Unug ([[Uruk]]), and an unnamed king of [[Aratta]]. The story is also referred to as “Lugalbanda in the Wilderness” or “Lugalbanda I” and followed by the story known as [[Lugalbanda and the Anzud Bird|Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird]], together forming the two parts of one story. The stories, from the composer’s point of view, take place in the distant past. The accounts are believed to be composed during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III Period]] (21st century BCE), although almost all extant copies come from [[History of Mesopotamia|Isin-Larsa period]] (20th-18th centuries BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Vanstiphout, H. (2003). ''Epics of Sumerian Kings'', Atlanta: SBL. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An unpublished Ur III period fragment exists. Michalowski, P. (2009) “Maybe Epic: The Origins and Reception of Sumerian Heroic Poetry” in ''Epic and History'', D. Konstans and K. Raaflaub (eds.), Oxford: Blackwells. p.18 and n.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Tablets containing these stories were found in various locations of southern Iraq, primarily in the city of [[Nippur]], and were part of the curriculum of Sumerian scribal schools during the Old Babylonian period (20th-17th centuries BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Vanstiphout, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Sumerian king Enmerkar wants to conquer the land of Aratta. Rounding up his army, Enmerkar marches toward Aratta, a city on the eastern highlands. Amongst the soldiers is [[Lugalbanda]], who falls seriously ill and is left by his brothers to live or die in a cave along with some provisions. Lugalbanda lies ill for two days; he prays to the gods [[Shamash]], [[Inanna]], and [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]] to be healed of his sickness and is eventually healed by them. A few days later he captures a wild bull and two wild goats before lying down to dream.  He is sent a dream instructing him to sacrifice the animals he has captured and he proceeds to do so. The end of the text is very fragmented and not well understood, but sheds light on the gods who, although they hold great power, exhibit a dark side.

==Comments==
In separate Sumerian traditions, specifically in the text referred to as [[Sumerian King List]], Lugalbanda is known as the successor of Enmerkar as the king of Uruk, but in these Lugalbanda stories there is no such indication, and Lugalbanda appears only as one of the soldiers of king Enmerkar. In other accounts Lugalbanda is also known as the father of the mythical hero [[Gilgamesh]], who succeeds Lugalbanda to the throne of Uruk.

Among Sumerian literary narratives including the four of Enmerkar-Aratta cycle and five known Gilgamesh stories, “Lugalbanda in the Wilderness” and its continuation “Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird” are considered to be the most elaborate and complex texts of their period with a combined length of 1000 lines, as well as their complicated symbolism, strong mythological elements, and unpredictable plot that moves back and forth between the mundane and divine worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski, p.15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although earlier generations of scholars have sought behind these stories a historical reality dating back to [[Early_Dynastic_Period_of_Sumer#Early_Dynastic_period|Early Dynastic Period]], such attempts are mostly based on an amalgamation of data from the epic traditions of the 2nd millennium with unclear archaeological observations.&lt;ref&gt; Lugalbanda, ''Reallexikon der Assyriologie'' 7, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that even if the earlier oral traditions may have had an influence in the origin of these stories, the texts that have reached us are the highly stylized and literary products of the scribes of the Ur III Period and later, and for such scribes “these texts were about the present, albeit projected into the past; indeed it is this very act of projection that marks them as fiction, not as
ethnography or history.”&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Moses-Hess.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Moses Hess in 1846]]

'''Moses''' ('''Moshe''') '''Hess''' (January or June 21, 1812 – April 6, 1875) was a French-Jewish philosopher and a founder of [[Labor Zionism]]. His socialist theories, predicated on racial struggle,  led to conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class%20Readings/Marx/The%20German%20Ideology.pdf|title=The German Ideology|last=Marx|first=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|date=|website=marxists.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Moses (Moshe) Hess was born in [[Bonn]], which was under French rule at the time. In his French-language birth certificate, his name is given as "Moïse"; he was named after his maternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Avineri, ''Moses Hess: Prophet of Communism and Zionism'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verification needed|date=August 2017}} His father was an ordained rabbi, but never practiced this profession&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Avineri: Moses Hess: Prophet of Communism and Zionism. New York: New York University Press, 1985, s. 7. {{ISBN|0814705847}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hess received a Jewish religious education from his grandfather, and later studied philosophy at the [[University of Bonn]], but never graduated.

He married a poor Catholic seamstress, Sibylle Pesch, "in order to redress the injustice perpetrated by society". Although they remained happily married until Hess' death&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/subject/jewish/moses-hess.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, Sibylle may have had an affair with Friedrich Engels while he was smuggling her from Belgium to France to be reunited with her husband. The incident may have precipitated Hess' split from the Communist movement&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fr/books?id=4eYXc1B1vPoC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=Friedrich+Engels+Sybille+Pesch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DF7Kbfh9MJ&amp;sig=4lS0Ocq0B6B36fTKNAU1jNzlRJc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0tsOQwfzWAhUH5xoKHee_CewQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Friedrich%20Engels%20Sybille%20Pesch&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Hess was an early proponent of [[socialism]], and a precursor to what would later be called [[Zionism]]. As correspondent for the ''Rheinische Zeitung'', a radical newspaper founded by liberal Rhenish businessmen, he lived in Paris. He was a friend and collaborator of [[Karl Marx]] (who also worked on the ''Rheinische Zeitung'') and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref name="Hunt_2010"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hunt |first=Tristram |year=2010 |title=Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mdj3AXU2YEEC |publisher=Macmillan |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hess introduced Engels, the future famous communist, to the [[communism]] of the early 1840s.&lt;ref name="Hunt_2010"/&gt;

But Marx and Engels would become well known for their fickle and pugnacious approach to fellow socialists who showed insufficient agreement with their own form of socialism. By the late 1840s, they had fallen out with Hess.&lt;ref name="Hunt_2010"/&gt; They mocked him, first behind his back and later openly. The work of Hess was also criticized in part of ''[[The German Ideology]]'' by Marx and Engels.&lt;ref&gt;[[The German Ideology]]'',Tome II Part V&lt;/ref&gt;

Hess fled to [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]] temporarily following the suppression of the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 commune]]. He would also go abroad during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71.

Hess died in Paris in 1875. As he requested, he  was buried in the Jewish cemetery of [[Cologne]]. In 1961 he was re-interred in the [[Kvutzat Kinneret|Kinneret]] Cemetery in Israel along with other [[Labor Zionism|Socialist-Zionists]] such as [[Nachman Syrkin]], [[Ber Borochov]], and [[Berl Katznelson]]. 

[[Moshav]] [[Kfar Hess]] was named in his honour.
[[Image:Moses Hess.jpg|thumb|right|Moses Hess]]

==Views and opinions==
Hess became reluctant to base all history on economic causes and [[class struggle]] (as Marx and Engels did), and he came to see the struggle of races, or nationalities, as the prime factor of history.

According to George Litcheim, Hess, who differed from Marx on a number of issues, still testified in a letter to [[Alexander Herzen]] that what he and Herzen were writing about "resembles a neat sketch drawn on paper, whereas Marx's judgment upon these events [European upheavals] is as it were engraved with iron force in the rock of time" (Paraphrased by Litcheim, A Short History of Socialism, 1971 p.&amp;nbsp;80).

From 1861 to 1863 he lived in Germany, where he became acquainted with the rising tide of German [[antisemitism]]. It was then that he reverted to his Jewish name Moses (after apparently going by Moritz Hess&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/264113/Moses-Hess&lt;/ref&gt;) in protest against [[Jewish assimilation]]. He published ''[[s:Rome and Jerusalem|Rome and Jerusalem]]'' in 1862. Hess interprets history as a circle of [[Ethnic nationalism|race]] and national struggles. He contemplated the rise of [[Italian nationalism]] and the German reaction to it, and from this he arrived at the idea of Jewish national revival, and at his prescient understanding that the Germans would not be tolerant of the national aspirations of others and would be particularly intolerant of the Jews. His book calls for the establishment of a Jewish socialist commonwealth in Palestine, in line with the emerging national movements in Europe and as the only way to respond to antisemitism and assert Jewish identity in the modern world.

==Published works==
Hess's ''Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question'' went unnoticed in his time, as most German Jews preferred [[cultural assimilation]]. His work did not stimulate political activity or discussion.  When [[Theodor Herzl]] first read ''Rome and Jerusalem'' he wrote that "since [[Spinoza]] Jewry had no bigger thinker than this forgotten Moses Hess." He said he might not have written ''Der Judenstaat'' (''The Jewish State'') if he had known ''Rome and Jerusalem'' beforehand. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky|Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] honored Hess in ''The Jewish Legion in the World War'' as one of the people that made the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour declaration]] possible, along with Herzl, [[Walter Rothschild]] and [[Leon Pinsker]].

A '''nun''' is a member of a religious community of women, typically living under vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]] in the enclosure of a monastery.&lt;ref name=def&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary, vol X, page 599.&lt;/ref&gt; Communities of nuns exist in numerous religious traditions, including [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].

In the Buddhist tradition, female [[monastic]]s are known as [[Bhikkhuni]], and take several [[The Eight Garudhammas|additional vows]] compared to male monastics ([[bhikkhus]]). Nuns are most common in [[Mahayana Buddhism]], but have more recently become more prevalent in other traditions.

Within Christianity, women religious, known as nuns or '''religious sisters''', are found in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheran]] traditions among others. Though the terms are often used interchangeably, ''nuns'' historically take solemn vows and live a life of prayer and contemplation in a [[monastery]] or [[convent]], while ''[[Religious sister|sister]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s'' take simple vows&lt;ref name=mw_sister&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sister|title=Sister|publisher=Merriam-Webster|quote=[A] member of a women's religious order (as of nuns or deaconesses); especially : one of a Roman Catholic congregation under simple vows }}&lt;/ref&gt; and live an active vocation of prayer and charitable works in areas such as education and healthcare. Examples include the monastic [[Order of Saint Clare]] founded in 1212 in the [[Franciscan]] tradition, or the [[Missionaries of Charity]] founded in 1950 by [[Mother Teresa]] to care for people living in grave poverty.

{{Main|Bhikkhuni}}
{{peoplepalicanon}}
All [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions have nuns, although their status is different among Buddhist countries. The Buddha is reported to have allowed women into the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' only with great reluctance, predicting that the move would lead to Buddhism's collapse after 500 years, rather than the 1,000 years it would have enjoyed otherwise. (This prophecy occurs only once in the Canon and is the only prophecy involving time in the Canon, leading some to suspect that it is a late addition.)&lt;ref&gt;Hellmuth Hecker, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel273.html#n-30].&lt;/ref&gt; Fully ordained Buddhist nuns (''[[bhikkhuni]]s'') have more ''[[Patimokkha]]'' rules than the monks (''[[bhikkhu]]s''). The important vows are the same, however.

As with monks, there is quite a lot of variation in nuns' dress and social conventions between Buddhist cultures in Asia. Chinese nuns possess the full ''bhikkuni'' ordination, Tibetan nuns do not. In [[Theravada]] countries it is generally believed that the full ordination lineage of ''bhikkunis'' died out, though in many places they wear the "saffron" colored robes, observing only ten precepts like novices.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]], a country which never had a tradition of fully ordained nuns (''bhikkhuni''), there developed a separate order of non-ordained female renunciates called ''[[mae ji]]''. However, some of them have played an important role in dhamma-practitioners' community. There are in [[Thai Forest Tradition]] foremost nuns such as Mae Ji Kaew Sianglam, the founder of the Nunnery of Baan Huai Saai, who is believed by some to be [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/10/MCK/preface%20n%20intro.pdf Mae Chee Kaew - Her Journey to Spiritual Awakening &amp; Enlightenment e-book]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Upasika Kee Nanayon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enabling.org/ia/vipassana/Archive/N/Nanayon/keeNanayonThanisarro.html Upasika Kee Nanayon and the Social Dynamic of Theravadin Buddhist Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004073724/http://www.enabling.org/ia/vipassana/Archive/N/Nanayon/keeNanayonThanisarro.html |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 21st century, some Buddhist women in Thailand have started to introduce the ''bhikkhuni sangha'' in their country as well, even if public acceptance is still lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1295,0,0,1,0 Buddhist Channel | Buddhism News, Headlines | Issues | Authoritarianism of the holy kind&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhammaweb.net/dhammananda.html Bhikkhuni Dhammananda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly the successful academic scholar Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, established a controversial monastery for the training of Buddhist nuns in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaibhikkhunis.org/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3 Thai Bhikkhunis - Songdhammakalyani Monastery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226082911/http://www.thaibhikkhunis.org/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3 |date=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===

The relatively active roles of Taiwanese nuns were noted by some studies. Researcher Charles Brewer Jones estimates that from 1952 to 1999, when the Buddhist Association of the ROC organized public ordination, female applicants outnumbered males by about three to one. He adds:

:"All my informants in the areas of Taipei and Sanhsia considered nuns at least as respectable as monks, or even more so. [...] In contrast, however, Shiu-kuen Tsung found in Taipei county that female clergy were viewed with some suspicion by society. She reports that while outsiders did not necessarily regard their vocation as unworthy of respect, they still tended to view the nuns as social misfits."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brewer Jones, ''Buddhism in Taiwan: Religion and the State, 1660-1990''; University of Hawaii Press, 1999; pp. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;

Wei-yi Cheng studied the Luminary (Hsiang Kuang 香光) order in southern Taiwan. Cheng reviewed earlier studies which suggest that Taiwan's [[Zhaijiao]] tradition has a history of more female participation, and that the economic growth and loosening of family restriction have allowed more women to become nuns. Based on studies of the Luminary order, Cheng concluded that the monastic order in Taiwan was still young and gave nuns more room for development, and more mobile believers helped the order.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Tibet ===
The August 2007 [[International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha]], with the support of H. H. [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|XIVth Dalai Lama]], reinstated the [[Gelongma]] ([[Dharmaguptaka]] [[vinaya]] bhikkhuni) lineage, having been lost, in India and Tibet, for centuries. Gelongma ordination requires the presence of ten fully ordained people keeping exactly the same vows. Because ten nuns are required to ordain a new one, the effort to establish the Dharmaguptaka bhikkhu tradition has taken a long time.

It is permissible for a Tibetan nun to receive bhikkhuni ordination from another living tradition, e.g., in Vietnam. Based on this, Western nuns ordained in Tibetan tradition, like [[Thubten Chodron]], took full ordination in another tradition.

The ordination of monks and nuns in Tibetan Buddhism distinguishes three stages: rabjung-ma, getshül-ma and gelong-ma. The clothes of the nuns in Tibet are basically the same as those of monks, but there are differences between novice and ''gelong'' robes.

===Japan===
[[Hokke-ji]] in 747 was established by the consort of the Emperor. It took charge of provincial convents, performed ceremonies for the protection of the state, and became the site of pilgrimages. Aristocratic Japanese women often became Buddhist nuns in the premodern period.  Originally it was thought they could not gain salvation because of the [[Five Hindrances]], which said women could not attain Buddhahood until they changed into men.  However, in 1249, 12 women received full ordination as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Lori Meeks, '' Hokkeji and the Reemergence of Female Monastic Orders in Premodern Japan'' (2010)  [https://www.amazon.com/Hokkeji-Reemergence-Monastic-Premodern-Buddhism/dp/0824833945/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholic ===

In the Roman Catholic tradition, there are a large number of [[religious institute]]s of nuns and sisters (the female equivalent of male [[monk]]s or [[friar]]s), each with its own [[charism]] or special character. Traditionally, nuns are members of [[enclosed religious orders]] and take solemn [[religious vows]], while sisters do not live in the papal enclosure and formerly took vows called "simple vows".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

As [[monastic]]s, nuns living within an enclosure historically commit to recitation of the full [[Liturgy of the Hours]] throughout the day in church, usually in a solemn manner. They were formerly distinguished within the monastic community as "choir nuns", as opposed to [[lay brothers#Lay sisters|lay sisters]] who performed upkeep of the monastery or errands outside the cloister. This last task is still often entrusted to women, called "externs", who live in the monastery, but outside the enclosure. They were usually either [[oblate]]s or members of the associated [[Third Order]], often wearing a different habit or the standard woman's attire of the period.

====Membership and vows====
In general, when a woman enters a [[religious order]] or [[monastery]], she first undergoes a period of testing the life for six months to two years called a postulancy. If she, and the order, determine that she may have a [[vocation]] to the life, she receives the [[Religious habit|habit]] of the order (usually with some modification, normally a white veil instead of black, to distinguish her from [[Profession (religious)|professed]] members) and undertakes the [[novitiate]], a period (that lasts one to two years) of living the life of the religious institute without yet taking [[vows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P25.HTM Canon 648], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of this period she may take her initial, temporary vows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 656], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt; [[Temporary vows]] last one to three years, typically, and will be professed for not less than three years and not more than six.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 655], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, she will petition to make her "perpetual profession", taking permanent, [[solemn vow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 657], CIC 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

In the branches of the [[Benedictine]] tradition, (Benedictines, [[Cistercian]]s, [[Camaldolese]], and [[Trappist]]s, among others) nuns take vows of stability (that is, to remain a member of a single monastic community), obedience (to an [[abbess]] or [[prioress]]), and conversion of life (which includes poverty and celibacy). In other traditions, such as the [[Poor Clares]] (the [[Franciscan]] Order) and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican nuns]], they take the threefold vows of [[poverty]], [[chastity]] and [[vow of obedience|obedience]]. These are known as the ‘evangelical counsels’ as opposed to ‘monastic vows’ proper. Most orders of nuns not listed here follow one of these two patterns, with some Orders taking an additional vow related to the specific work or character of their Order (for example, to undertake a certain style of devotion, praying for a specific intention or purpose).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Cloistered nuns ([[Carmelites]], for example) observe "papal enclosure"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM Canon 667] §3, CIC 1983, SCRIS instruction, "Venite seorsum" August 15, 1969, in AAS 61 (1969) 674–690&lt;/ref&gt; rules, and their nunneries typically have walls separating the nuns from the outside world. The nuns rarely leave (except for medical necessity or occasionally for purposes related to their contemplative life) though they may receive visitors in specially built parlors, often with either a grille or half-wall separating the nuns from visitors. They are usually self-sufficient, earning money by selling jams, candies or baked goods by mail order, or by making liturgical items (such as vestments, candles, or hosts to be consecrated at Mass for Holy Communion).

They often undertake contemplative ministries &amp;mdash; that is, a community of nuns is often associated with prayer for some particular good or supporting the missions of another order by prayer (for instance, the Dominican nuns of [[Corpus Christi Monastery]] in [[the Bronx]], New York, pray in support of the priests of the [[Archdiocese of New York]]). Yet religious sisters can also perform this form of ministry, e.g., the [[Maryknoll]] Missionary Sisters have small houses of [[contemplative]] sisters, some in mission locations, who pray for the work of the priests, brothers and other sisters of their congregation, and since Vatican II have added retreat work and spiritual guidance to their apostoloate;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maryknollsisters.org/sisters/sister-grace-corde-myerjack/|title=Sister Grace Corde Myerjack - Maryknoll Sisters|work=Maryknoll Sisters|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sister Disciples of the Divine Master]] are also cloistered sisters who receive visitors and pray in support of their sister congregation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pddm.us/p.promise94.php|title=Vocation: Sister Disciples Of The Divine Master|website=www.pddm.us|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Daughters of St. Paul]] in their media ministry.

====Leadership====
A [[canoness]] is a nun who corresponds to the male equivalent of [[Canon (priest)|canon]], usually following the Rule of S. Augustine. The origin and rules of monastic life are common to both. As with the canons, differences in the observance of rule gave rise to two types: the [[canoness regular]], taking the traditional religious vows, and the secular canoness, who did not take vows and thus remained free to own property and leave to marry, should they choose. This was primarily a way of leading a pious life for the women of aristocratic families and generally disappeared in the modern age, except for the modern [[Stift#Stift as endowment for unmarried Protestant women|Lutheran convents]] of Germany.

A nun who is elected to head her religious house is termed an [[abbess]] if the house is an abbey, a prioress if it is a monastery, or more generically may be referred to as "Mother Superior" and styled "Reverend Mother". The distinction between abbey and monastery has to do with the terms used by a particular order or by the level of independence of the religious house. Technically, a [[convent]] is any home of a community of sisters &amp;mdash; or, indeed, of priests and brothers, though this term is rarely used in the United States. The term "monastery" is often used by The Benedictine family to speak of the buildings and "convent" when referring to the community. Neither is gender specific. ‘Convent’ is often used of the houses of certain other institutes.

The traditional dress for women in religious communities consists of a [[tunic]], which is tied around the waist with a cloth or leather belt. Over the tunic some nuns wear a [[scapular]] which is a garment of long wide piece of woolen cloth worn over the shoulders with an opening for the head. Some wear a white [[wimple]] and a veil, the most significant and ancient aspect of the habit. Some Orders – such as the Dominicans – wear a large rosary on their belt. Benedictine abbesses wear a cross or crucifix on a chain around their neck.

After the [[Second Vatican Council]], many religious institutes chose in their own regulations to no longer wear the traditional habit and did away with choosing a religious name. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church canon law]] states: "Religious are to wear the habit of the institute, made according to the norm of proper law, as a sign of their consecration and as a witness of poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Distinction between a nun and a religious sister ====

Although usage has varied throughout church history, typically "nun" (Latin: ''monialis'') is used for women who have taken solemn vows, and "sister" (Latin: ''soror'') is used for women who have taken simple vows.

During the first millennium, nearly all religious communities of men and women were dedicated to prayer and [[contemplative prayer|contemplation]]. These [[monasteries]] were built in remote locations or were separated from the world by means of a [[precinct wall]]. The [[mendicant orders]], founded in the 13th century, combined a life of prayer and dedication to God with active works of preaching, hearing confessions, and service to the poor, and members of these orders are known as [[friars]] rather than [[monks]]. At that time, and into the 17th century, Church custom did not allow women to leave the [[cloister]] if they had taken religious vows. Female members of the mendicant orders ([[Dominican Order|Dominican]], [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] and [[Carmelite]] nuns and [[Poor Clares]]) continued to observe the same enclosed life as members of the [[Monasticism|monastic orders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15551c.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mary Ward|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1521, two years after the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] had forbidden the establishment of new religious institutes, [[Pope Leo X]] established a religious [[monasticism|Rule]] with simple vows for those [[third order|tertiaries]] attached to existing communities who undertook to live a formal religious life. In 1566 and 1568, [[Pope Pius V]] rejected this class of congregation, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval.&lt;ref name=Vermeersch/&gt; Finally in the 20th century, [[Pope Leo XIII]] recognized as religious all men and women who took simple vows.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution "Conditae a Christo" of 8 December 1900, cited in [http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf Mary Nona McGreal, ''Dominicans at Home in a New Nation'', chapter 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150743/http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to [[social service]] and to [[evangelization]], both in [[Europe]] and in mission areas. Their number had increased dramatically in the upheavals brought by the [[French Revolution]] and subsequent [[Napoleonic]] invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of religious of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living the religious life. But members of these new associations were not recognized as "religious" until [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Constitution "Conditae a Christo" of 8 December 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf Mary Nona McGreal, ''Dominicans at Home in a New Nation'', chapter 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150743/http://www.dom.edu/export/sites/dominican/mcgreal/volumeone/DaHCHAP11.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1917 [[Code of Canon Law]] reserved the term "nun" (Latin: ''monialis'') for religious women who took solemn vows or who, while being allowed in some places to take simple vows, belonged to institutes whose vows were normally solemn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P1D.HTM#6T|title=CIC  1917: text - IntraText CT|website=www.intratext.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used the word "sister" (Latin: ''soror'') exclusively for members of institutes for women that it classified as "[[Congregation of Papal Right|congregations]]"; and for "nuns" and "sisters" jointly it used the Latin word ''religiosae'' (women religious). The same religious order could include both "nuns" and "sisters", if some members took solemn vows and others simple vows.

The new legal code of the Catholic Church which was adopted in 1983, however, remained silent on this matter. Whereas previously the code distinguished between orders and congregations, the code now refers simply to religious institutes.

Since the code of 1983, the Vatican has addressed the renewal of the contemplative life of nuns. It produced the letter ''Verbi Sponsa'' in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccscrlife/documents/rc_con_ccscrlife_doc_13051999_verbi-sponsa_en.html|title=Verbi Sponsa (13 May 1999)|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the apostolic constitution ''[[Vultum Dei quaerere]]'' in 2016, and the instruction ''Cor Orans'' in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccscrlife/documents/rc_con_ccscrlife_doc_20180401_cor-orans_en.html|title=“Cor Orans” – Implementing Instruction of the Apostolic Constitution "Vultum Dei quaerere" on women’s contemplative life, of the Congregation for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Societies of Apostolic Life (1 April 2018)|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "which replaced the 1999 document ''Verbi Sponsa'' and attempted to bring forward the ideas regarding contemplative life born during the Second Vatican Council".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2018/11/22/contemplative-nuns-roll-with-the-changes-under-pope-francis/|title=Contemplative nuns roll with the changes under Pope Francis|date=2018-11-22|work=Crux|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== United States ====
{{main|Catholic sisters and nuns in the United States}} Nuns and sisters played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M.

There were very few rich [[American Catholics]], and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James M. |last1=O'Toole |title=The Faithful: A History of Catholics in America |year=2008 |page=104 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674034884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M.

==== Canada ====
{{main|Catholic sisters and nuns in Canada}}
Nuns have played an important role in Canada, especially in heavily Catholic Quebec. Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Roman Catholic nuns, especially in Québec. Stimulated by the influence in France, the popular religiosity of the [[Counter Reformation]], new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century. In the next three centuries women opened dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by [[Religious dower|dowries]] provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, [[maternity home|homes for unwed mothers]], and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Carr, Jr., "Writing the Convent in New France: The Colonialist Rhetoric of Canadian Nuns", ''Quebec Studies'' (2009), Issue 47, pp 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Modern Spain'''

Prior to women becoming nuns during early modern Spain, aspired nuns underwent a process. The process was ensured by the [[Council of Trent]], which [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] (1556-1598) adopted within Spain.&lt;ref name="Schmitz 375–399"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Timothy J.|date=2006-01-01|title=The Spanish Hieronymites and the Reformed Texts of the Council of Trent|jstor=20477841|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=37|issue=2|pages=375–399|doi=10.2307/20477841}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Phillip II acquired the aid of the [[Hieronymites|Hieronymite order]] to ensure that monasteries abided by the decrees of the Council of Trent.&lt;ref name="Schmitz 375–399"/&gt; This changed the way in which nuns would live.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehfeldt|first=Elizabeth A.|date=1999-01-01|title=Discipline, Vocation, and Patronage: Spanish Religious Women in a Tridentine Microclimate|jstor=2544609|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1009–1030|doi=10.2307/2544609}}&lt;/ref&gt; One edict of the Council of Trent was that female monasteries be enclosed in order to limit nuns' relationship with the secular world.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt; Enclosure of monasteries during this time was associated with chastity.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt; Another decree issued by the Council of Trent was that religious devotion be "true and voluntary".&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt; A male clergy member would ask the aspiring nuns if whether or not their vocation was "true and voluntary" in order to ensure no enforced conversion.&lt;ref name="Lehfeldt 1009–1030"/&gt;

To be considered as a nun, one must have the economic means to afford the convent dowry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehfeldt|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2000-01-01|title=Convents as Litigants: Dowry and Inheritance Disputes in Early-Modern Spain|jstor=3789215|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=33|issue=3|pages=645–664}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time convent dowries were affordable, compared to secular marriages between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuns: A history of convent life, 1450-1700|last=Evangelisti|first=Silvia|publisher=Oxford ; New York : Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically during early modern Spain a large number of nuns were from elite families who had the means to afford the convent dowry and "maintenance allowances", which were annual fees.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Monasteries were economically supported through convent dowries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Convent dowries could be waived if the aspiring nun had an artistic ability benefiting the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taggard|first=Mindy Nancarrow|date=2000-01-01|title=Art and Alienation in Early Modern Spanish Convents|jstor=3201923|journal=South Atlantic Review|volume=65|issue=1|pages=24–40|doi=10.2307/3201923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an aspiring nun has entered the convent and has the economic means to afford the dowry, she undergoes the process of apprenticeship known as the novitiate period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brides of Christ: Conventual life in colonial Mexico|last=Lavrin|first=Asuncion|publisher=Stanford University Press, 2008.|year=2008|isbn=|location=Stanford, Calif. :|pages=49|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novitiate period typically lasts 1–2 years, and during this time the aspiring nun lives the life of a nun without taking the official vows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brides of Christ: Conventual life in colonial Mexico|last=Lavrin|first=Asuncion|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Stanford, Calif|pages=48|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she lives in the convent she is closely monitored by the other women in the community to determine if her vocation is genuine. This would be officially determined by a vote from the choir nuns.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; If the aspiring nun passes the scrutiny of the women of the religious community, she then can make her [[solemn vow]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Prior to making the vows, the family of the nun is expected to pay the convent dowry.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Nuns were also expected to denounce their inheritance and property rights.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Religious class distinctions:  
* Choir nuns: Usually from elite families, they held office, could vote within the convent, and were given the opportunity to read and write.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuns: A history of convent life, 1450-1700|last=Evangelisti|first=Silvia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=30|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lay-sisters: Lower class women, assigned tasks related to the labour of the convent, generally were not given the opportunities to read and write, and paid a lower dowry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodox ===
[[File:Saint Sofia of Suzdal crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Solomonia Saburova|Saint Sophia]] of [[Suzdal]], wearing the full monastic habit of a [[Schemanun]]]]
{{Main|Eastern Christian Monasticism}}

In the Eastern Orthodox Church there is no distinction between a monastery for women and one for men. In [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and other Eastern European languages, both domiciles are called "monasteries" and the ascetics who live therein are "monastics". In English, however, it is acceptable to use the terms "nun" and "convent" for clarity and convenience. The term for an abbess is the feminine form of abbot (''[[hegumen]]'') – Greek: ''hegumeni''; {{lang-sr|Игуманија }}(''Igumanija''); Russian: игумения, (''[[igumenia]]''). Orthodox monastics do not have distinct "orders" as in Western Christianity. Orthodox monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives.&lt;ref&gt;Archpriest Seraphim Slobodskoy, ''The Law of God'' (Printshop of St. Job of Pochaev, Jordanville, NY, {{ISBN|0884650448}}), p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt; There may be slight differences in the way a monastery functions internally but these are simply differences in style (Gr. ''[[typica]]'') dependent on the abbess or [[abbot]]. The abbess is the spiritual leader of the convent and her authority is absolute (no [[priest]], [[bishop]], or even [[patriarch]] can override an abbess within the walls of her monastery.) There has always been spiritual equality between men and women in the Orthodox Church ({{bibleverse||Galatians|3:28|KJV}}). Abbots and Abbesses rank in authority equal to bishops in many ways and were included in [[ecumenical council]]s. Orthodox monasteries are usually associated with a local synod of bishops by jurisdiction, but are otherwise self-governing. Abbesses hear [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s (but do not [[absolution|absolve]]) and dispense [[blessing]]s on their charges, though they still require the services of a [[presbyter]] (i.e., a priest) to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] and perform other priestly functions, such as the absolution of a penitent.

Orthodox monastics, in general have little or no contact with the outside world, especially family. The pious family whose child decides to enter the monastic profession understands that their child will become "dead to the world" and therefore be unavailable for social visits.

There are a number of different levels that the nun passes through in her profession:
{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}

*'''Novice –''' When one enters a monastery the first three to five years are spent as a [[novitiate|novice]]. Novices may or may not (depending on the abbess's wishes) dress in the black inner robe ([[cassock|Isorassa]]); those who do will also usually wear the [[apostolnik]] or a black [[scarf]] tied over the head (see photo, above). The isorassa is the first part of the monastic "[[Religious habit|habit]]" of which there is only one style for Orthodox monastics (this is true in general, there have been a few slight regional variations over the centuries, but the style always seems to precipitate back to a style common in the 3rd or 4th century). If a novice chooses to leave during the novitiate period no penalty is incurred.
*'''Rassaphore –''' When the abbess deems the novice ready, the novice is asked to join the monastery. If she accepts, she is [[tonsure]]d in a formal service during which she is given the outer robe ([[Cassock|Exorassa]]) and veil ([[Epanokamelavkion]]) to wear, and (because she is now dead to the world) receives a new name. Nuns consider themselves part of a sisterhood; however, tonsured nuns are usually addressed as "Mother" (in some convents, the title of "Mother" is reserved to those who enter into the next level of Stavrophore).
*'''Stavrophore –''' The next level for monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbess feels the nun has reached a level of discipline, dedication, and [[humility]]. Once again, in a formal service the nun is elevated to the "Little Schema" which is signified by additions to her habit of certain symbolic articles of clothing. In addition, the abbess increases the nun’s [[prayer rule]], she is allowed a stricter personal ascetic practice.
*'''Great Schema –''' The final stage, called "Megaloschemos" or "[[Great Schema]]" is reached by nuns whose Abbess feels they have reached a high level of excellence. In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.

=== Protestantism ===
[[Image:Monastery Ebstorf.jpg|thumb|[[Ebstorf Abbey]] continued as a Lutheran convent in the Benedictine tradition since 1529.]]
After the Protestant Reformation, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] near [[Negenborn]] and [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Rehburg-Loccum]]) and convents (such as [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near the town of [[Uelzen]] and [[Bursfelde Abbey]] in [[Bursfelde]]) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/kloster-ebstorf-convent-bad-bevensen-near-luneburg/|title=Kloster Ebstorf|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Medieval Histories|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2017|quote=The monastery is mentioned for the first time in 1197. It belongs to the group of so-called Lüneklöstern (monasteries of Lüne), which became Lutheran convents following the Protestant Reformation. […] It is currently one of several Lutheran convents maintained by the Monastic Chamber of Hanover (Klosterkammer Hannover), an institution of the former Kingdom of Hanover founded by its Prince-Regent, later King George IV of the United Kingdom, in 1818, in order to manage and preserve the estates of Lutheran convents.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convents, especially those in Reformed areas, closed after the Reformation, with some sisters deciding to marry.

A modern resurgence of the early Christian [[Deaconess]] office for women began in Germany in the 1840s and spread through Scandinavia, Britain and the United States, with some elements of the religious life, such as simple vows, and a daily obligation of prayer. Lutherans were especially active, and within both Lutheranism and Anglicanism some Deaconesses formed religious communities, with community living, and the option of life vows in religion.&lt;ref&gt;See CSA history [http://anglicanhistory.org/women/rich_deaconesses1907/ here].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern movement reached a zenith about 1910, then slowly declined as secularization undercut religiosity in Europe, and the professionalization of nursing and social work offered better career opportunities for young women. A small movement still exists, and its legacy is seen in the names of numerous hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Jurisson,  "The Deaconess Movement", in Rosemary Skinner Keller et al., eds. ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America'' (Indiana U.P., 2006). pp. 821-33 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC&amp;pg=PA821 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of the Deaconess communities eventually led to the establishment of religious communities of monks and nuns within some Protestant traditions,&lt;ref&gt;One example of a Protestant [http://www.lutheranfranciscans.org/Home.html religious order] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716185753/http://www.lutheranfranciscans.org/Home.html |date=2014-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those influenced by the more liturgical Protestant reformers (such as [[Martin Luther]]) rather than the more extreme reformers (such as [[John Calvin]]). This has allowed for communities of nuns (or, in some cases, mixed communities of nuns and monks) to be re-established in some Protestant traditions. Many of these are within the episcopal Lutheran tradition and the closeness of Lutheranism with Anglicanism its belief and practice has led to local arrangements of inter-Communion between the two traditions, such as the [[Porvoo Communion]].&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;Israeli press report concerning one [http://www.timesofisrael.com/lutheran-nuns-end-jerusalem-mission-to-shoah-survivors/ German Lutheran order] of nuns.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anglicanism ====
{{main|Anglican religious order}}
Religious communities throughout England were destroyed by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] when he separated the [[Church of England]] from papal authority during the [[English Reformation]] (see [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]). Monasteries and convents were deprived of their lands and possessions, and monastics were forced to either live a secular life on a pension or flee the country.  Many Roman Catholic nuns went to France.

[[File:Julianofnorwich.jpg|thumb|Two Anglican nuns]]
Anglican religious orders are organizations of [[laity]] or clergy in the [[Anglican Communion]] who live under a common rule. The term "religious orders" is distinguished from [[Holy Orders]] (the sacrament of [[ordination]] which bishops, priests, and deacons receive), though many communities do have ordained members.

The structure and function of religious orders in Anglicanism roughly parallels that which exists in Roman Catholicism. Religious communities are divided into orders proper, in which members take solemn vows and congregations, whose members take simple vows.

With the rise of the [[Oxford Movement]] in Anglicanism in the early 19th century came interest in the revival of "religious life" in England. Between 1841 and 1855, several religious orders for nuns were founded, among them the Community of St. Mary at [[Wantage]] and the Community of St. Margaret at [[East Grinstead]].

In the United States and Canada, the founding of Anglican religious orders of nuns began in 1845 with the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion (now defunct) in New York.

Whilst there is no single central authority for all religious orders, and many member churches of the Anglican Communion have their own internal structures for recognising and regulating religious orders, some central functions are performed by the Anglican Religious Communities Department at [[Church House, Westminster]], the headquarters of the Church of England's [[Church Commissioners]], [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]], [[Archbishops' Council]], and [[National Society for Promoting Religious Education|National Society]]. This department publishes the bi-annual ''Anglican Religious Life'', a world directory of religious orders, and also maintains an official Anglican Communion website for religious orders. ''Anglican Religious Life'' defines four categories of community.&lt;ref&gt;Anglican Religious Life 2012-13, published Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, pp. iii, iv, 19, 147, 151, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Traditional celibate religious orders and communities": Members take a vow of celibacy (amongst other vows) and follow a common Rule of life. They may be enclosed and contemplative or open and engaged in apostolic works.
* "Dispersed communities": These are orders or communities whose members, whilst taking vows (including celibacy), do not live together in community. In most cases the members are self-supporting and live alone, but follow the same Rule of life, and meet together frequently in assemblies often known as 'Chapter meetings'. In some cases some members may share a common life in very small groups of two or three.
* "Acknowledged communities": These communities live a traditional Christian life, including the taking of vows, but the traditional vows are adapted or changed. In many cases these communities admit both single and married persons as members, requiring celibacy on the part of those who are single, and unfailing commitment to their spouse on the part of married members. They also amend the vow of poverty, allowing personal possessions, but requiring high standards of tithing to the community and the wider church. These communities often have residential elements, but not full residential community life, as this would be incompatible with some elements of married family life.
* "Other communities": This group contains communities that are ecumenical (including Anglicans) or that belong to non-Anglican churches that have entered into relationships of full communion with the Anglican Church (particularly, but not only, certain Lutheran churches).

In the United States (only), there is a clear distinction between "orders" and "communities", as the Episcopal Church has its own two-fold definition of "religious orders" (equivalent to the first two groups above) and "Christian communities" (equivalent to the third group above).&lt;ref&gt;See Title III, Canon 24, sections 1 and 2 of the Canons of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, also quoted at [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org Anglican Communion Religious Communities].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Anglican Religious Life'' directory affirms this, stating "This distinction in not used in other parts of the Anglican Communion where 'communities' is also used for those who take traditional vows."&lt;ref&gt;''Anglican Religious Life 2012-13'', Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kloster Bursfelde von NO.jpg|thumb|[[Bursfelde Abbey]] has continued as a Lutheran convent since A.D. 1579]]

==In popular culture==
{{example farm|date=November 2013}}

Nuns play an important role in the public's image of religious symbolism. A list of notable works in which nuns play a major part ranges from ''[[A Time for Miracles]]'', which is [[hagiography]], to realistic accounts by [[Kathryn Hulme]] and [[Monica Baldwin]], to the blatant [[nunsploitation]] of ''[[Sacred Flesh]]''. Works can include those which portray Catholic nuns or non-Catholic such as ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (Anglican), and ''[[Minsara Kanavu]]''  (church of south India).

Many stories that have depicted nuns have gone on to critical and audience acclaim such as ''[[Sister Act]]'', ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. These stories have been reproduced in both stage and film. Other examples of nuns in television and film include [[Sally Field]] in ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', [[Stephanie Beacham]] in ''[[Sister Kate (TV series)|Sister Kate]]'' and [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''.

'''Our Lady of the Atonement''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: '''''Domina Nostra Adunationis''''') is a title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] first invoked by Father (Louis) Paul T. Wattson, S.A. and Mother Lurana White, S.A, the founders of the [[Society of the Atonement]]. The feast day of Our Lady of the Atonement is July 9. 

==History==
In June 1899 Episcopal priest Rev. Lewis T. Wattson professed his vows as a Friar of the Atonement, taking the name Paul James Francis. In 1901, Fr. Paul initiated for his Friars of the Atonement devotion to the Blessed Mother invoked under the title, “Our Lady of the Atonement”,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atonementfriars.org/our-lady-of-the-atonement/ "Our Lady of the Atonement", Franciscan Friars of the Atonement]&lt;/ref&gt; adapting prayers to Our Lady of Sorrows. That same year, he and Society of Atonement co-founder, Mother Lurana White, established the Rosary League of Our Lady of the Atonement. In the early 1900's Wattson was a popular preacher in Episcopal churches, and Mother Lurana edited a small magazine called “Rose Leaves from Our Lady’s Garden at Graymoor”. This brought a greater awareness of the devotion to the Episcopalian community. The title became popular common among Anglicans and Anglo-Catholics who have a similar devotion in their liturgical traditions. In 1909 the Society of the Atonement entered the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1919, the title was formally approved by [[Pope Benedict XV]]. In the September 1932 issue of ''The Lamp'', Father Paul wrote, "When we, therefore, give to our Blessed Mother the title of 'Our Lady of the Atonement', we mean 'Our Lady of Unity.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatherpaulofgraymoor.org/his_legacy/our_lady_of_the_atonement.html "Our Lady of the Atonement", Father Paul of Graymoor Guild]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her image was painted by Giovanni Martini in 1929 and by Mother Margaret Mary Nealis in 1933. Stained glass windows at the St. Francis Chapel at Graymoor also depict Our Lady of the Atonement.[https://www.atonementfriars.org/our-lady-of-the-atonement/] The Franciscan Sisters of the Atonement have a shrine to Our Lady of the Atonement near the entrance to Graymoor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graymoor.org/gallery/ "Gallery", Franciscan Sisters of the Atonement]&lt;/ref&gt; The feast day of Our Lady of the Atonement, July 9, was approved by the [[Holy See]] in 1946.

==Description of the Image==
Our Lady of the Atonement is depicted wearing a golden crown or a crown of 12 stars and a blue tunic. The red mantle signifies the Precious Blood of Jesus.  She holds in her arms the Christ Child who holds a cross in his right hand.

==Legacy==
In 1983, Our Lady of the Atonement Catholic Church in San Antonio, Texas was founded as an [[Anglican Use]] parish in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio]], under the 1980 [[Pastoral Provision]] of [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://church.atonementonline.com/ Our Lady of the Atonement Catholic Church, San Antonio, Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pastoral Provision authorizes the establishment of personal parishes in dioceses of the United States for Episcopalian converts who had entered into full communion with the Catholic Church but wished to preserve liturgical aspects of Anglican worship tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastoralprovision.org/ "The Pastoral Provision for Former Episcopal Clergymen in the United States", The Pastoral Provision]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, the parish of Our Lady of the Atonement became part of the [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ordinariate.net/news/becoming-one "Becoming One", The Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atonement Academy]] is its [[parochial school]].

The [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Baguio Cathedral|Cathedral of Our Lady of Atonement]] in [[Baguio]], [[Philippines]] is named in honour of this devotion. The Cathedral survived the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[carpet bombing]] of the city towards the end of the [[Second World War]]. It is the [[Episcopal see|see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Baguio|Bishop of Baguio]].

'''Our Lady of the Sacred Heart''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón}} {{lang-fr|Notre Dame du Sacré Coeur}} {{lang-it|Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore}}) is a Roman Catholic title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] by Father [[Julio Chevalier]] in 1857. Mary is showing the [[Child Jesus|Child Jesus´s]] heart while Jesus points to his mother.

==History==
In 1854, in Issoudun (France), during the ninth of the [[Immaculate Conception]], Father Julio Chevalier promises that if his dream of forming a missionary congregation in honor of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] becomes a reality, he will teach the faithful to love Mary of a special way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscperu.org/msc/nscc/NsscEspiritMision.htm Nuestra Señora]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Art. III.- In testimony of gratitude to Mary, they will consider her as their Founder and Sovereign, they will associate her with all her works and they will make her love in a peculiar way|Chevalier's promise with Virgin Mary}}

During various ninths made to the [[Virgin Mary]], Chevalier obtained several economic donations that allow him to build the '''Basilica of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart''' in [[Issoudun|Issoudun (France)]] and in 1857 hi consolidated him Brotherhood and gave Mary the new name:&lt;ref&gt;[https://santavirgenmaria.com/2016/05/28/oracion-nuestra-senora-del-sagrado-corazon/ Historia]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...When pronouncing this name, we thank and glorify God, because he has chosen Mary among all creatures to form in his virginal womb the adorable Heart of Jesus. We recognize through this special title, a summary in a certain way of the other titles of Mary, the ineffable power that the sweetest Savior has granted her over him adorable Heart. We beseech this compassionate Mother leads us to the heart of her Son... As the power of Mary surpasses what our weak reason can conceive, and Jesus always listens to the humble supplications and prayers of his Mother, we will entrust her with the success of difficult and desperate causes ...|Julio Chevalier 1857}}

==Iconography==
Julio Chevalier created in 1861 a stained-glass window where Mary and Jesus of feet appear, the boy touches his heart with the left hand and with his right he points to his mother in high, sending the message that through Mary the faithful can reach the heart of Jesus. In 1868 the [[Pope Pius IX]] blesses a pair of crowns which are placed in the stained-glass window of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart and the Congregation becomes an Archconfraternity.

At the end of the 19th century, this devotion spreads throughout America and Europe, so the Vatican decides to make changes in the image, and begins the representation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus while still a child and in the arms of his mother, while Mary shows the heart of his son.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.religionenlibertad.com/nuestra-senora-del-sagrado-corazon-jesus-57043.htm Aspecto de Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prayer==
Remember, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, what ineffable power thy divine Son hath given thee over His own adorable Heart. Full of trust in thy merits, we come before thee and beg thy protection. O heavenly Treasurer of the Heart of Jesus, that Heart which is the inexhaustible source of all graces, which thou mayest open to us at thy good pleasure, in order that from it may flow forth upon mankind the riches of love and mercy, light and salvation, that are contained therein; grant unto us, we beseech thee, the favors which we seek. . . . We can never, never be refused by thee, and since thou art our Mother, O our Lady of the Sacred Heart, graciously hear our prayers and grant our request. Amen.

"'''Prayer in C'''" is a song by French-Israeli [[folk pop]] duo [[Lilly Wood and the Prick]], originally released on their album ''Invincible Friends'' in 2010.

In 2014, German DJ and record producer [[Robin Schulz]] remixed the song, and the remix was re-released in June 2014. Schulz re-mixed the song, using a CD of ''Invincible Friends'' as the source. He initially made his remix available as a free download, to the consternation of the copyright owners, [[Wagram Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcaline, le Mag avec Camélia Jordana|url=http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/emissions/france-2/alcaline/alcaline-le-mag/alcaline-le-mag-avec-camelia-jordana-162099|publisher=France Télévisions|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schulz remix topped the charts in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] (both [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] regions), [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Hungary]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Mexico]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. This track also reached the top 10 in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] and charted in the top 40 in [[Canada]] and [[United States]]. In September 2014, [[Kiesza]] covered the song on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Lounge: Kiesza 'gets vulnerable' writing own songs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/29132272|publisher=BBC|date=9 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiesza – Prayer In C|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/clips/p026cnwc|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 September 2014|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit}}

==Background==
The song gets its title from the fact that its lyrics are in the form of a prayer and it is recorded in the key of C. [[Genius (website)|Genius]] suggests that the "Yah" at the beginning of the song is an abbreviation of "Yahweh", which specifically sends the prayer towards the Judaeo-Christian God.&lt;ref&gt;https://genius.com/Lilly-wood-and-the-prick-prayer-in-c-robin-schulz-remix-lyrics&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="754">'''Prophetic traditions''' refers to any written or oral [[prophet|prophecies]] within a culture, usually of [[religion|religious]] nature.

A major source of such early prophetic traditions comes from the [[Nevi'im|Jewish religion]] where it is called [[Tradition|Masorah]], and is identified in [[Oral Torah]], notably in the [[Pirkei Avot]] that spans the tradition from [[Moses]] to the time of the [[Second Temple]].

In the Christian prophetic tradition the texts are reflected in the [[New Testament]].

The Islamic prophetic tradition is exemplified by the [[Hadith]]

The [[Mormon]] prophetic tradition was started by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]].

Non-religious prophetic traditions are represented by [[Nostradamus]] in France.

'''Scottie Wilson''' (6 June 1888 – 1972), born '''Louis Freeman''', was a [[Scotland|Scottish]], Jewish,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[outsider art]]ist known particularly for his highly detailed style. Starting his artistic career at the age of 44, his work was  admired and collected by the likes of [[Jean Dubuffet]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and is generally accepted to be in the forefront of 20th-century [[outsider art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56329899|title=Scottie Wilson: Peddler Turned Painter|last=Anthony|first=Petullo|date=2004|publisher=Petullo Pub.

==Early years==
Born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], at 24 Ropework Lane, Wilson dropped out of school at  the age of 8 to help subsidise his family's meagre income by, amongst other things, selling newspapers on the street. In 1906 he enlisted with the [[52nd Division (British)|Scottish Rifles]] and subsequently served in India and South Africa. He bought himself out in 1911 but rejoined in 1914 during [[World War I]]  to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the end of the war he emigrated to [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], where he owned and operated a [[second-hand]] shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58051366|title=Self-taught &amp; outsider art: the Anthony Petullo collection|last=Anthony|first=Petullo|date=2005|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0252072774|location=Urbana, Ill.|oclc=58051366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==
===Beginning===
At the age of 44 he began [[doodle|doodling]] with one of the [[fountain pens]] that he collected for resale in his shop and discovered his passion for art. In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m listening to classical music one day – Mendelssohn – when all of a sudden I dipped the bulldog pen into a bottle of ink and started drawing – doodling I suppose you’d call it – on the cardboard tabletop. I don’t know why. I just did. In a couple of days – I worked almost ceaselessly – the whole of the tabletop was covered with little faces and designs. The pen seemed to make me draw, and them images, the faces and designs just flowed out. I couldn’t stop – I’ve never stopped since that day.&lt;ref name="petullo"&gt;http://www.petulloartcollection.org/the_collection/about_the_artists/artist.cfm?a_id=62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was there that he began his work, embodying a personal code of morality wherein characters called "evils and greedies" are juxtaposed with naturalistic symbols of goodness and truth. The first dealer to encounter Wilson’s work was a Canadian, [[Douglas Duncan]], who displayed them in various gallery shows. While Wilson did not want to part with his drawings, he found the idea of an artistic career preferable to shopkeeping and attempted to solve the problem of raising money by staging travelling shows for viewing only and charging modest entrance fees or holding tray collections.

===Success===
After receiving recognition for his work in Toronto, he abruptly went to London in 1945 and continued to exhibit his drawings for modest fees while maintaining a deep distrust of dealers. A few months after his arrival he was persuaded by dealers to show in galleries, and had a solo exhibition at the [[Arcade Gallery]] in London, shown concurrently with other works by such 20th-century artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Joan Miró]], amongst others. Wilson's rejection of commercialism was unabated, however, and he continued to sell his work on the street for a minute fraction of the prices the gallery owners were asking. He said of the working-class customers he attracted, "''They're'' the intellect, you know".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/606553|title=Outsider Art|last=Roger|first=Cardinal|date=1972|page=79|publisher=Studio Vista|isbn=0289701686|location=London|oclc=606553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Scottie Wilson Platter Royal Worcester.jpg|thumb|Royal Worcester dinnerware by Scottie Wilson]]
Wilson spent his remaining years in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], an area of northwest London, working alone in his small lodgings. In the early 1950s, he travelled to [[France]] at the persuasion of artist and outsider art fanatic Jean Dubuffet. There Wilson was met by not only Dubuffet, but also by Pablo Picasso; both were fans and owners of Wilson's work. According to art critic [[Bill Hopkins (novelist)|Bill Hopkins]], a friend of Wilson who accompanied him on the trip:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we arrived, not only was Dubuffet waiting, Pablo Picasso was with him. Both owned a few of Scottie’s pieces, and Picasso had come to see – and perhaps buy – some more. I vividly remember both artists eagerly admiring Scottie’s work, squabbling in their fierce, theatrical, Gallic voices over who would buy which piece.&lt;ref name="petullo" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1960s, Wilson began to create paintings on plates and was subsequently commissioned by [[Royal Worcester]] and had designed a series of dinnerware, which was produced until 1965. The pattern was based on totem poles and imagery from North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.museumofroyalworcester.org/learning/research/workers-and-factory-owners/scottie-wilson/|title=Scottie Wilson {{!}} Museum of Royal Worcester|website=www.museumofroyalworcester.org|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His picture ‘Bird Song’ was chosen as a design for the 1970 [[UNICEF]] Christmas Card. He died in 1972 from cancer. Though he always complained of poverty, Wilson was discovered at the time of his death to have secreted a suitcase full of money under his bed and large sums in various bank accounts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/264639113|title=It's All Writ Out for You: The Life and Work of Scottie Wilson|last=George|first=Melly|date=1988|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=0500274096|location=London|oclc=264639113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter and style==
The evolution of his style was notoriously non-existent and, because he did not date most of his works, it is very difficult to place his works in time apart from the few documentary records that exist. He stuck mainly to a narrow range of visual elements: botanical forms, birds and animals, clowns (self-portraits), and "Greedies" and "Evils" (malignant personifications).&lt;ref name="rawvision" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/scottie-wilson-2152|title=Scottie Wilson 1889-1972 {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://outsiderart.me/about-scottie-wilsons-work/|title=About Scottie Wilson’s work {{!}} Inside Outsider Art|website=outsiderart.me|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.petulloartcollection.org/the_collection/about_the_artists/artist.cfm?a_id=62|title=Scottie Wilson: Learn About The Artists: The Collection: The Anthony Petullo Collection of Self-taught &amp; Outsider Art|website=www.petulloartcollection.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work can be placed in a purely speculative chronological order by the subtle changes and progressions in his subject matter and style. His earlier pieces are thought to be generally more organic in composition and have less precise cross-hatching and detail. Certain images did become more prevalent, while others were used less frequently, and the level of detail is thought to have increased over time. As he once said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I'm working I can see what's happening, and I can imagine what's going to happen. I can see best when I'm finishing my pictures with a pen. When I'm making strokes; hundreds and thousands of strokes.&lt;ref name="rawvision"&gt;[http://www.rawvision.com/rawvision/back/scottiewilson/scottiewilson.html]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319012512/http://www.rawvision.com/rawvision/back/scottiewilson/scottiewilson.html |date=March 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Shalom Aleichem''' ({{lang-he-n|שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם}}, "Peace be upon you") is a traditional song sung by Jews every Friday night upon returning home from synagogue prayer. It signals the arrival of the Jewish Sabbath, welcoming the [[angel]]s who accompany a person home on the eve of the Sabbath.

==Sources==
This liturgical poem was written by the kabbalists of [[Safed]] in the late 16th or early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;It is first found in the ''Tikkune Shabbat'', published in Prague in 1641, according to B.S. Jacobson, ''The Sabbath Service'' (Sinai Publ'g, Tel-Aviv, English ed. 1981) page 123; M. Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (Aronson, N.J. 1993) page 290; and A.Z. Idelsohn, ''Jewish Liturgy and its Development'' (New York, 1931) page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A complete survey of extant manuscripts, compiled by Chaim Leiberman, is available in Kirjath Sepher vol. 38–9.&lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, H., 'ספר ״תקוני שבת״'  Kirjath Sepher 38 (1962–1963) p. 401–414; 39 (1963/1964) p. 109–116. http://bookreader.nli.org.il/NliBookViewer/?ie_pid=IE47264668&amp;_ga=2.92572701.1262827958.1526342677-1205974753.1526342676#page/n0/mode/2up

http://bookreader.nli.org.il/NliBookViewer/?ie_pid=IE47265177&amp;_ga=2.169298081.1262827958.1526342677-1205974753.1526342676#page/n0/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a homiletic teaching in the [[Talmud]], two angels accompany people on their way back home from [[synagogue]] on Friday night—a good angel and an evil angel. If the house has been prepared for the Shabbat ("the lamp has been lit, the table set, and his couch spread"), the good angel utters a blessing that the next Shabbat will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond "[[Amen]]". but if the home is not prepared for Shabbat, the evil angel expresses the wish that the next Shabbat will be the same, and the good angel is forced to respond "Amen".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 119b.&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of singing Shalom Aleichem on Friday night before [[Kiddush]] is now nearly universal, even though certain rabbinical authorities have expressed misgivings. The 18th century Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] in his Sidur Beth Ya'aqov prayer book pointed out many problems regarding this song (addressing requests to angels, expressions that do not make sense, etc.). A similar attitude to the singing of Shalom Aleichem is attributed to Rabbi Elijah, the [[Vilna Gaon]].

==Words==

The lyrics, in Hebrew, are as follows:

|}

The song in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is transliterated as follows:

:''[[Shalom aleichem]] malachei hash-sharet malachei Elyon,''
:''mi-melech malachei ham-melachim haq-qadosh Baruch Hu.''

:''Bo'achem le-shalom malachei hash-shalom malachei Elyon,''
:''mi-melech malachei ham-melachim haq-qadosh Baruch Hu.''

:''Barchoni le-shalom malachei hash-shalom malachei Elyon,''
:''mi-melech malachei ham-melachim haq-qadosh Baruch Hu.''

:''Tzeitechem le-shalom malachei hash-shalom malachei Elyon,''
:''mi-melech malachei ham-melachim haq-qadosh Baruch Hu.''

The words to the song translate as follows:

:Peace unto you, ministerial angels, messengers of [the] Highest,
:from the King, king(s) of the kings — the Holy, blessed be He.

:[May] your coming [be] to peace, envoys of the peace,  messengers of [the] Highest,
:from the King, king(s) of the kings — the Holy, blessed be He.

:Bless me for peace, envoys of the peace, messengers of [the] Highest,
:from the King, king(s) of the kings — the Holy, blessed be He.

:[May] your departure [be] to peace, envoys of the peace, messengers of [the] Highest,
:from the King, king(s) of the kings — the Holy, blessed be He.

☼ ''NOTE'':  Mizrahi (not Sefard) tradition includes a penultimate verse, beginning {{Script/Hebrew| בְּשִׁבְתְּכם&amp;nbsp;ל&amp;#64298;ל&amp;#64331;ם}}, "''[May] your rest [be] for peace'' ..." and the final verse has a בְּ inserted in front of the צ  which does not change the meaning of the last verse.&lt;ref&gt;''Koren Siddur Tefila'', Mizrahi ed., 1988 Jerusalem, page 156; ''Orot Sephardic Shabbat Siddur'', 1995 NJ, page 140; M. Nulman, ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'', 1993 NJ, page 291; but not found in the "Sefard" prayerbooks by Koren, ArtScroll, or de Sola Pool.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter בְּ is also present in Tikunei Shabbos, the earliest known printing of the poem; as is one before the ב of the second verse.

[[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]], in his work ''Kaf Hachayim'', (262:16) notes:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Script/Hebrew|ומנהגינו לומר אחר ברכוני לשלום וכו' בשבתכם לשלום וכו' ואח"כ חוזרים לומר ברכוני לשלום וכו' ואח"כ אומרים בצאתכם לשלום וכו' וחוזרים לומר ברכונו לשלום וכו' ור"ל ברכוני בעת בואכם ובעת שבתכם ובעת צאתכם ור"ל בשעה שאתם יוצאים באיזה שעה שרוצים לצאת}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"And our custom is to say, after 'Bless me for peace etc.', '[May] your rest [be] for peace etc.'. And afterwards we repeat, saying 'Bless me for peace etc.,' and then we say '[May] your departure [be] for peace etc.,' and then we repeat, saying 'Bless me for peace etc.;' the purpose being to request a blessing during your arrival and during your rest and during your departure — and my meaning is, at the time that you depart, i.e. at whatever time you wish to depart."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi Jacob Emden, in his prayerbook, ''Bet El'' (1745), criticized both the use of the hymn (on the grounds that supplications on the Sabbath and supplications to angels were inappropriate) and its grammar—arguing that the inclusion of the prefix מִ at the beginning of every second line (i.e., ''&lt;u&gt;mee-&lt;/u&gt;melech'') was bad form, as it rendered the passage, "angels of the Most High, ''away from'' the King who rules over kings". He therefore deleted that מִ, thereby reducing ''mi-melech'' to ''melech'', and that deletion has been emulated in some other prayerbooks (apparently a small minority) such as Seligman Baer's ''Siddur Avodat Yisroel'' (1868), the Orot Sephardic, and Koren's Mizrahi (but not Koren's Ashkenaz or Sefard) prayerbook, although it makes the musical meter a bit awkward.&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Jacobson, ''The Sabbath Service'' (Sinai Publ'g, Tel-Aviv, English ed. 1981) pages 124–125; ''Siddur Avodat Yisroel'' page 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melodies==
Many different melodies have been written for ''Shalom Aleichem''.

The slow, well-known melody for the song was composed by the American composer and conductor Rabbi [[Israel Goldfarb]] on May 10, 1918 while sitting near the [[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]] statue in front of [[Low Memorial Library]] at [[Columbia University]], and first published later that year as ''"Sholom Alechem—שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם"'' in ''Friday Evening Melodies'' by Israel and his brother [[Samuel E. Goldfarb|Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Friday Evening Melodies—שיר ישראל לליל שבת'', composed by Rabbi Israel Goldfarb and Samuel Eliezer Goldfarb, published by Bureau of Jewish Education, New York, 1981, pages 83–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Goldfarb song is often presumed to be a traditional [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] melody. I. Goldfarb wrote in 1963, "The popularity of the melody traveled not only throughout this country but throughout the world, so that many people came to believe that the song was handed down from Mt. Sinai by Moses."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kanestreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/hjbinder06sacred_music.pdf#page=6&lt;/ref&gt; In the Preface to "Friday Evening Melodies" the composers articulated the goal of avoiding the extremes of both the free-form emotive Eastern European musical liturgical style and the classical Western European musical structure of "Israel Emancipated."

Lately, a modern, exuberantly joyful version of this melody has been popularized by Idan Yaniv and Kinderlach.

As one of her last acts, [[Debbie Friedman]] shared her beautiful and haunting{{according to whom?|date=October 2018}} "Shalom Aleichem" with Rabbi Joy Levitt.  Friedman believed it was this song that would become her legacy.

The Faster Common Traditional Melody was composed by Rabbi Shmuel Brazil.

[[File:Suraumerbok.jpg|thumb|A modern Surau]]

'''Surau''' is an Islamic assembly building in some regions of [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]] used for worship and religious instruction. Generally smaller physical structures, its ritual functions are similar to a mosque, allow men and women, and are used more for religious instruction and festive prayers. They depend more on grassroots support and funding. They can be compared to the Arab [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]].&lt;ref name="Az" /&gt; In Minangkabau society they continued pre-Islamic traditions of an all-male gathering place to worship ancestors and were built up high on posts.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In contemporary usage, Surau is often used to refer to either a small mosque, or a designated room in a public building (such as a shopping mall, a university, or a [[rest stop]] along a highway) for men or women to do their [[Salat|prayers]].

==Indonesia==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een moskee bij Fort de Kock TMnr 10016669.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bingkudu Mosque]], an archetypal Minangkabau mosque with its multi-tiers, curving form and exaggerated roof height.]]
Surau among the Minankabau of Sumatra date to pre-Islamic times. Men lived together in them. The first Islamic Surau in Minangkabau is believed to have been built in the late 17th century in the coastal town of [[Ulakan]].

Smaller surau are known as Surau Mangaji, and consist mostly of a small room for to 20 students and one teacher who is usually also the Imam and teaches Quran recitation. Large Surau, during the heyday of Surau culture in the 18th century, help up to 1,000 students and included up to 20 buildings.

The central figure of Surau was the Tuanku shaikh who mostly as carriers of Baraka was. He oversaw in large Surau usually a large number of teachers who as Guru were called and had mostly learned even with him or even met with him. The establishment and maintenance of Surau performed usually by foundations ( waqf ) and donations from parents as well as by the work of Surau residents. Minangkabau Surau has great similarities with the institution of the [[pesantren]], which was initially distributed only to Java.&lt;ref name="Az"&gt;Azyumardi Azra, ''Islam in the Indonesian World: An Account of Institutional Formation''. Bandung 2006, S. 63-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Surau were simultaneously centers of Sufi orders. In this case, the Tuanku Shaikh was the spiritual leader of Surau-residents, and this kept him the oath of allegiance. The Surau of Ulakan served as a center of [[Shattari|Shattāriyya]] Order, which had been introduced by [[Burhanuddin Ulakan|Burhan ad-Din]], a student of [[Abd al-Rauf al-Sinkili|Abd al-Ra'uf as-Singkilī]]. Other orders, which had their own Surau in Minangkabau, were the [[Naqshbandi|Naqshbandīyya]] and [[Qadiriyya]]. Some students visited various Surau succession and could be introduced in different orders. The fact that the students of Tuanku shaikh as Mureed or Faqīr are called, shows the great impact of Sufism on the Surau culture.&lt;ref&gt;RA Core, ''The Origin of the Malay Surau''. The Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 29/1 (1956) 179-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 19th century was the Surau system of Hāddschis that in Mecca with the teachings of the Wahhabi had come into contact, radically questioned. They and their followers, the so-called Padris, denounced the Surau as centers of dissemination un-Islamic teachings and practices and burning some of them during the so-called Padri Wars (1821–38) down. Other steps that heralded the demise of Surau culture, were in 1870 to introduce a new type of school, the so-called Sekolah Nagari, by the Dutch, and in 1900 the intellectual attacks of reformist Muslims who denounced the Surau as hoards of backwardness and own secular schools established.&lt;ref&gt;Kerstin Steiner. ''Madrasah in Singapore: Tradition and Modernity in Religious Education''. Intellectual Discourse, 19 (2011) 41-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are tentative attempts to revive the Surau culture at the Minangkabau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iium.edu.my/intdiscourse/index.php/islam/article/viewArticle/181]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Malay Peninsula, the functional difference between mosque and Surau is not always so clear. In rural areas the Surau was for centuries the center of Islamic worship and thus tantamount to a mosque. In today's urban area in Malaysia and Singapore there are also Surau. Sharifa Zaleha who has dealt with Surau in Malaysia, concludes that the difference between the two institutions is that the mosques are built by the state, while the Surau depend grassroots initiatives. As with Minangkaba the success of the Surau depends very much on the religious scholars involved. During the heyday of the Dakwah movement in the 1970s and 1980s the Surau in Malaysia were also centers of student life. Many male and female students spent several nights a month in Surau to there in the form of i'tikaf to pray until morning to recite the Quran and perform devotions.&lt;ref&gt;Sharifa Zaleha.

'''''The Profits of Religion: An Essay in Economic Interpretation''''' is a nonfiction book, first published in 1917, by the American novelist and [[muck-raking]] journalist [[Upton Sinclair]]. It is a snapshot of the religious movements in the U.S. before its entry into [[World War I]].

The book is the first of the “Dead Hand” series: six books Sinclair wrote on American [[institution]]s. The series also includes ''[[The Brass Check]]'' (journalism), [[The Goose-step (book)|''The Goose-step'']] (higher education), ''The Goslings'' (elementary and high school education), ''[[Mammonart]]'' (art) and ''Money Writes!'' (literature). The term “Dead Hand” ironically refers to Adam Smith’s concept that allowing an "invisible hand" of individual self-interest to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole.

In this book, Sinclair attacks institutionalized religion as a “source of income to parasites, and the natural ally of every form of oppression and exploitation.”

==Overview==
Most [[clergy]]men are hypocrites, but they are not entirely to blame. Like other men, they are victimized by “the competitive wage-system, which presents them with the alternative to swindle or to starve.”

Sinclair savages the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] establishment for transforming the [[proletarian]] [[Jesus]] into a defender of wealth and privilege, and for a long history of alliance with political power in England and the United States.

Turning to the “nonconforming” [[Protestant]] sects, adherents of "The Church of the Merchants" are focused on achieving prosperity within the existing economic system. So are the devotees of the mostly [[California]]-based ‘new religions’ or ‘cults’, including [[New Thought]].

Sinclair wants to rescue the true message of Jesus, the friend of the poor and brother of all men.

== Style ==
The writing is fluent, vivid and personal. At the same time, almost every paragraph is built upon evidence that includes historic and contemporary quotations, articles, events, and anecdotes. It is not meant to be objective, but to present a compelling case. It reads like the exhaustive oral argument of a very able prosecuting attorney.

== Divisions of the book ==
Note: The chapters of Book Six are listed to give a flavor of Sinclair's writing style.
* Book One: The Church of the Conquerors (Priesthoods living off the wealth produced by workers)
* Book Two: The Church of Good Society ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal]])
* Book Three: The Church of the Servant Girls ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]])
* Book Four: The Church of the Slavers (how institutionalized religion, particularly in Germany, oppresses the people)
* Book Five: The Church of the Merchants (nonconformist [[Protestantism|Protestant]])
* Book Six: The Church of the Quacks
** Tabula Rasa
** The Book of [[Mormonism|Mormon]]
** [[Holy Roller|Holy Rolling]]
** Bible Prophecy
** [[Koreshanity]]
** [[Mazdaznan]]
** Black Magic
** Mental Malpractice
** [[Christian Science|Science and Wealth]]
** New Nonsense
** "Dollars Want Me!"
** Spiritual Financiering
** The Graft of Grace
* Book Seven: The Church of the Social Revolution (based on Jesus the proletarian and brother of all humankind)

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing several of the Dead Hand series, a contemporary critic wrote, "These great pamphlets…are storehouses of laborious research. They are indispensable to any student of present American life. I have heard Upton Sinclair charged with reckless, inaccurate and indiscreet use of his material. I am glad to say here that in my own experience I have found him scrupulously anxious, at whatever trouble to himself, to report the exact facts and to weigh carefully his judgments upon them. Why, then, have not these books the authority which they should have?…His explanation is oversimplified; he tends to see his facts in the light of a single motive." &lt;ref name="Lovett"&gt;[[Robert Morss Lovett|Lovett, Robert Morss]], "Upton Sinclair," ''The English Journal'' 17 (9) (Nov., 1928), 706–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Brass Check'' (1919), Sinclair wrote, "''The Profits of Religion'' was practically boycotted by the capitalist press of America. Just one newspaper, the ''Chicago Daily News'', reviewed it—or rather allowed me space in which to review it myself. Just one religious publication, the ''Churchman,'' took the trouble to ridicule it at length. Half a dozen others sneered at it in brief paragraphs, and half a dozen newspapers did the same, and that was all the publicity the book got, except in the radical press."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9199">The '''Wabunowin''' (also spelled '''Wabanowin''', '''Wabenowin''', and '''Wabunohwin'''; '''''Waabanoowiwin''''' in the "double-vowel" spelling) is the "Dawn Society", also sometime improperly called the "Magical Dawn Society", a distinct [[Anishinaabeg]] society of visionaries, practiced among the [[Anishinaabe]]g peoples, consisting of the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]]/[[Nipissing First Nation|Nipissing]], [[Ojibwa|Ojibwa/Chippewa]]/[[Saulteaux]]/[[Mississaugas]], [[Odawa people|Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]] and [[Oji-cree]], located primarily in the Great Lakes region of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Like the ''[[Midewiwin]]'', the Wabunowin is a secretive [[Animism|animistic]] religion, requiring an initiation, thus early non-indigenous writers lumped the information on the Wabunowin with the Midewiwin. But unlike the ''Mide'', the ''Waabano'' have sometimes two levels, and sometimes four. This variation is dependent on the particular lodge.

This society was mentioned in ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] who used informational materials made available from [[Henry Schoolcraft]] to compose the epic poem. The Dawn Society members were systematically imprisoned in [[mental hospital]]s by the United States government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vecsey|first=Christopher|title=Traditional Ojibwa Religion and its Historical Changes|year=1983|publisher=American Philosophical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Because of this persecution, the Wabunowin went underground and have just begun to reemerge in the last decade.{{When|date=October 2017}} While many of the ceremonies and traditions are closely guarded, one that is known is the Fire Dance.

The Waabanowin have been coming out from underground and re-establishing themselves for about 15 years now.{{When|date=October 2017}} There are active lodges in Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, Indiana and Michigan.

== Name ==

The word for "dawn" or "east" in the [[Anishinaabe language]] is ''waaban''. Its practitioners are called ''Waabanow'' (plural: ''Waabanowag'') and the practices of ''Waabanowin'' referred to as the ''Waabano'' (often transcribed as "Waubuno"). Unlike the ''mide'' where gender-specific references could be made for its practitioners, ''Waabano'' do not. Though of differing etymology, culturally, ''waaban'' is associated with ''owaabi'aan'' ([[Ottawa phonology#Vowel syncope|syncope]]d as ''waabhaan''), "they see them", from ''waabi′'', "to see &lt;small&gt;SOMEBODY&lt;/small&gt;". This word association reinforces the idea of the ''Waabanowag'' as being visionaries.

== Origin ==

There are differing stories about the origins of the ''Waabanowin''. Many writings put them as a late 19th-century origin, but the members with their oral traditions place the origin many centuries ago. The oral traditions of the lodge put the formation of the society happening shortly after creation.

== Oral tradition ==

The ''Waabanowin'' elders trace the origins of the lodge or society to the original teachings of [[Nanabozho]]. The stories of Nanabozho are used in the ceremonies and teachings of the Society. Further, the ''Waabanowin'' lodge, usually with less than 25 participants, but as many as 300, only needed one or two elders to perform the ceremonies, unlike the ''[[Midewiwin]]'' which required several. This would allow the ''Waabanowin'' ceremonies to have existed in the much smaller settlements that the Anishinaabeg lived before contact with Europe.

== Beliefs ==
The ''Waabanowin'' have a basic set of beliefs that anthropologist call 'animist.' In many ways this is correct but in some ways it is not. They do not believe in a multitude of deities in every living thing, but there is a single creator entity called ''[[Gichi-manidoo]]''. There are ''[[Manidoo]]g'' in all living things and these are spirits but not deities. It is the goal of ''Waabanow'' to live a life in balance with everything around them and with all of creation. They do not try to do only good and no bad.

The elders in the ''Waabano'' guide those who come to the lodge. It is not their way to dictate a what a person believes, or does. The ''Waabanow'' points the person in the correct direction using the stories and traditions of the lodge. There is no dogma or absolutes. Each person has their own path to walk and their own things to learn because what one person has to learn is different from another, they cannot have absolutes.

There is no effort to convert people to the beliefs of the lodge. People will find their way to the traditions or they will not. It is the belief of the lodge is that every person is placed on this earth to learn certain things. Each person has different things to learn. If the individual does not learn his or her individual life purpose lesson, then that individual will come back to this world again; if the individual does learn his or her life purpose lesson, then the individual will move on to the next world and lesson.

== Ceremonies ==

The lodge has several ceremonies they share in common with the other [[Anishinaabe traditional beliefs|medicine traditions]] of the Anishinaabe people. They also have ceremonies that are specific to the Dawn Society. While many would like to know more the actual ceremonies are not written down and traditions of the society prohibit the writing or the ceremonies. For these that want to know more it is recommended that they seek out a ''Waabanowin'' and learn from the lodge and elders directly. What follows is a basic overview of the ceremonies.

=== Solstice/equinox ceremonies ===

On the solstice and equinox the lodge performs a set of ceremonies that begin at dusk and end at dawn. Each of the ceremonies differ, with the winter ceremony being the highest ceremony of the lodge. All of the lodge ceremonies begin with a purification done through a ''Madoodiswan'' ([[sweat lodge]]). After the sweat the ceremony begins at dusk and goes until dawn.

==== Minookamin ====

The Spring Equinox was the beginning of the new year to the ''Waabanowin'', which unlike the dominate ''Midewiwin'' whose new year began in Winter. ''Minookamin'' (Late Spring) was a time to celebrate and fell just after the [[Maple sugar|Maple]] camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maple Camps|url=http://www.crystalinks.com/ojibway.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Spring Ceremony the focus is on the ''Waabanong [[Manidoo]]'' (Spirit of the East), the Grandfather.

==== Niibin ====

The Summer Solstice is a time of gathering of many villages or bands. The ceremony goes for 4 days and is more of a time of teaching and fellowship. It is normally the largest of the ''Waabanowin'' ceremonies in the number of people. The ceremony starts at dusk with the lighting of the ''Mishi-ishkode'' or sacred fire.

==== Dagwaagin ====

Like the Spring the ''dagwaagin'' (Autumn) ceremony fell just before the [[Wild rice]] camps.

==== Biboon ====

Traditionally the Anishinaabe peoples only told certain traditions during ''biboon'' (winter). This was because the underwater ''Manidoo'' hibernated at that time. Because of this the ''Waabanowin'' would recount the ''Nanabozho'' and creation stories as a part of the winter ceremonies. The Ceremony was a teaching time and a prayer for healing of individuals and ''aki'' (Earth). It was at this time that the fire dance was done as a part of the ceremony.

==== Ziigwan ====

Winter Solstice is the most important of all of the ''Waabanowin'' ceremonies. It is the time of healing for ''Aki'' (Earth) and for personal healing. The traditional ceremony calls for ''Madoodiswan'' to be performed at dusk for two days, then again on the solstice with the sweat ending at dusk. The ceremonies including the fire dance go on throughout the longest night of the year. At dawn the ceremony is finished and the men come out a ''Madoodiswan'' again. They then sweat twice more for the following two days.

=== Personal Healing ===

The ''Waabanowin'' are known as spiritual healers. There is a ceremony they perform to bring the person's spirit and body back into alignment thus healing them. In ''Waabanowin'' teachings sickness that cannot be cured by the herbs and medicines of the herbal healers are caused those things in a persons life that are out of balance with creation. These can and are performed as needed but are also part of the Solstice ceremonies.

'''Wadi es-Sebua''', or '''Valley of the Lions''' (so-called because of the [[sphinx]]-lined approach to the temple forecourts) ([[Arabic language|Arab]]: وادي السبوع), is the site of two [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] [[Egyptian temple]]s, including one [[speos]] temple constructed by the [[19th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], in [[Lower Nubia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The first temple was built by the [[18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] and subsequently restored by Ramesses II.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, 1993. p.106&lt;/ref&gt;  In its first stage, this temple "consisted of a rock-cut sanctuary (about 3 m by 2 m) fronted by a brick-built pylon, a court and a hall, partly painted with wall paintings."&lt;ref&gt;John Baines &amp; Jaromír Málek, Atlas of Ancient Egypt, Facts on File Publications New York, 1982. p.182&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple was perhaps dedicated to one of the local Nubian forms of [[Horus]], but his representations were altered to Amun at a later point in time.&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182"&gt;Baines &amp; Málek, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Amarna]] period, images of Amun were attacked and the decorations deteriorated but Ramesses II later restored and extended Amenhotep III's temple by building structures in front of the pylon.&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182" /&gt;

==The temple of Amun of Ramesses II==
[[Image:Sphinx of Ramesses II from Wadi es-Sebua temple by Dennis G. Jarvis.jpg|thumb|130px|Sphinx of Ramesses II from his Wadi es-Sebua temple]]
[[Image:Forecourt of Wadi es-Sebua temple by Dennis G. Jarvis.jpg|thumb|The forecourt of Wadi es-Sebua]]
[[Image:Temple relief from Wadi es-Sebua by Dennis G. Jarvis.jpg|thumb|Relief of Ramesses II presenting an offering to the gods at Wadi es-Sebua]]
The second larger temple which was built at el-Sebua was known as "''The Temple of Ri'amesse-meryamun'' [Ramesses II] ''in the Domain of Amun''" and constructed roughly 150&amp;nbsp;m northeast of Amenhotep III's temple.&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182"/&gt; Contemporary monuments and representations of the viceroy of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], [[Setau]], indicate that this temple was set up between Years 35 and Year 50 of Ramesses II.&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182" /&gt; Setau is known to have served as the Viceroy of Kush or Nubia between Year 38 to 63 of this pharaoh's reign and was responsible for Ramesses' later Nubian temples.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Tyldesley, Ramesses: Egypt's Greatest Pharaoh, Penguin Books 2001 paperback, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The temple of Wadi es-Sebua was the third sanctuary or chapel constructed from rock with a forecourt built with stones that Ramesses II erected in Nubia. Located at approximately a hundred and fifty kilometers south of Aswan, on the western bank of the Nile, the temple owed its importance to the fact that during the Ramesside period, the city was built at the outlet of the caravan roads, was used as the place of residence for the viceroy of Kush and because it was located at a difficult stretch of the Nile which was difficult for boats to traverse up against the current. Ramesses II entrusted the management of his work projects here to the viceroy of Nubia Setau which, if one judges by the poor quality of the Osiride style and statues of the court, was forced to settle on an "untrained work force, many of whom were snatched from the Libyan oases" and by "inferior raw materials."&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; 

The temple of ''"Ramesses beloved of Amon in the field of Amun"'' was used as a quay or resting place for boats during its descent of the Nile river. The local Arabs, inspired by the stone sculptures of sphinxes which lined the entrance to the first temple, baptized the place as 'Wadi es-Sebua' or the Valley of the lions. The temple comprised three distinct parts: two open courts which were decorated with sphinxes or dromos, a large interior court with Osiride pillars and the rock hewn temple. This temple was, hence, "partly free-standing and partly rock-cut."&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Oakes, Pyramids, Temples and Tombs of Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Atlas of the Land of the Pharaohs, Hermes House:Anness Publishing Ltd, 2003. p.202&lt;/ref&gt; 

The temple once possessed three pylons. The first two, however, were made of inferior Nile mud brick and have since crumbled. Only the stone gate passageway through them has survived. Beyond the first tower, the first courtyard appears with two human headed sphinxes accompanied by two statues of the pharaoh himself which originally stand on both sides of the passageway. Only the left-hand statue of Ramesses II remains ''in situ'' whereas the other statue now lies in the desert.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.202"&gt;Oakes, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the second pylon, a second courtyard with four falconheaded sphinxes appear representing Horus of Miam, of Meha, of Baki and, curiously, Horus of Edfu when one would expect that of Buhen instead in Nubia. Between their legs, a statuette with the image of Ramesses capped with the némès crown appears. On their base, an inscription states Ramesses "Lord of Sed-festivals, as his/her Ptah father" refers to the desire for longevity on behalf of this pharaoh which was already expressed on the vestiges of the second door: "Ramsès-Meryamun, lord of Sed-festivals, like Ptah." Just prior to entering the third tower, four colossal statues of Ramesses II appear of which, only one statue remains upright today. The third pylon is decorated with the conventional Egyptian style of the Pharaoh smiting his enemies and making offerings to the gods, including himself.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.202" /&gt; Once one passes through the third pylon, the rock cut section of the temple begins with a [[hypostyle]] hall composed of 12 square pillars:
: "of which the central six were once adorned with Osirid statues of the king; these were chiselled off by the Christians. However, the offering scenes on the walls survive, and some retain their [original] colour."&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.202" /&gt;

The "antechamber opens into two side rooms, two side chapels and the sanctuary itself."&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182"/&gt; Although the statues in the sanctuary niches were destroyed, they "undoubtedly represented Amon-Re, Re-Harakhty and Ramesses II himself."&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182" /&gt; The larger temple at Wadi es-Sebua was built in the rather rough Nubian style, which marked some of Ramesses II's larger buildings.

==Development into a church==
In the 5th century AD, the temple was converted into a Christian church. Some temple reliefs were covered with a layer of plaster, where painted images of God was done. This layer helped to preserve for posterity the original reliefs; the best examples here are located in the sanctuary and associated chapels of Ramesses' temple where colourful scenes depict Ramesess adoring the sacred boats of Amun-Re and Re-Horakhty.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.203"&gt;Oakes, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an interesting scene in the central niche of Wadi es-Sebua temple where two statues of Amun and Re-Horakhty which stood besides Ramesses II were hacked away by later Christian worshippers and replaced by an image of St. Peter.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.203" /&gt; When the plaster coating was removed from the carved reliefs, one finds a bizarre image of Ramesses II offering flowers to...St Peter instead.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.203" /&gt;

==Relocation of the Temple==
When the Wadi es-Sebua temples were threatened by flooding from the construction of the Aswan Dam project, the temple was dismantled in 1964 with U.S. support by the Egyptian Antiquities Service. They were moved to a new site only 4&amp;nbsp;km west from their original location.&lt;ref&gt;Baines &amp; Málek, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Temple of Dakka]] and [[Temple of Maharraqa]] were also moved and rebuilt at the new Wadi es-Sebua temple complex area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2424">'''Yunzhongzi''' ({{zh|c=云中子|p=Yúnzhōngzǐ|l=Master in Cloud}}) is a character featured within the famed classic Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. 

Yunzhongzi is a renowned immortal of the Jade Column Cave atop Mount South End. After the sinister [[Daji]] had taken her grasp over [[King Zhou of Shang]], Yunzhongzi would be the first immortal to see the injustice from above the clouds. After Yunzhongzi had realized that this had been none other than the Thousand-Year Vixen, he exclaimed the words, "''If she is not eliminated, great disaster will befall the Red Dust! I must prevent this from happening!''" Following this event, Yunzhongzi would present himself before King Zhou. After the king had asked for Yunzhongzi's home, Yunzhongzi would respond by saying that he is from water -- heart of cloud; mind of fluidity. Thus following this point, Yunzhongzi would engage in a great reformative conversation with the king, in hopes that he would be rid of Daji and employ the [[taoist]] way to his kingdom. Before Yunzhongzi leaves the king, he hands him his wooden [[sword]] - a sword that will gradually kill Daji through its latent spiritual power instilled by Yunzhongzi. 

5 chapters later during the time of chapter 10, Yunzhongzi would be seen once again before the Grand Duke of the West, [[Ji Chang]]. After a special child had been found in a mysterious tomb following a very rare and sudden lightning storm, Yunzhongzi would once again appear. When Yunzhongzi had held the small baby in his arms after receiving consent, he said the words, "''My Grand Duke. Please let me take this child to Mount South End, to raise and educate. When you come back in seven years, I will return him to you.''" Thus holding the baby in his hands, he parts the clouds and returns to the skies, determined to instill the taoist ways into this future savior of the new dynasty. 

Later on within chapter 22, Yunzhongzi would vape over his Mount South End and see Ji Chang being chased by Generals Yin and Lei of [[Zhaoge]]. Once Yunzhongzi unleashes [[Leizhenzi]] to save Ji Chang, he is not shown again for some time.
