==Grammar==

Alur has an SVO word order.

== Orthography ==

The Alur language has no officially accepted orthography. However, informal conventions have been established in written materials and road signs.

First, there is usually no written tonal distinction. Second, the phonemic distinction between /ŋ/ and /ng/ is occasionally reflected in the orthography, with /ŋ/ represented by 'ŋ' and /ng/ represented by 'ng'. However, /ŋ/ is also frequently written as 'ng', confusing it orthographically with /ng/.

The uncontrolled hypertension in AD may result in mild symptoms, such as sweating above the lesion level, goosebumps, blurred vision, or headache; However, severe hypertension may result in potentially life-threatening complications including [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]], [[Intracranial hemorrhage|intracranial bleed]], or [[retinal detachment]].&lt;ref name="Daroff_2016" /&gt;

AD is triggered by either noxious or non-noxious stimuli, resulting in [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] stimulation and hyperactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krassioukov A, Warburton DE, Teasell R, Eng JJ | title = A systematic review of the management of autonomic dysreflexia after spinal cord injury | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 682–95 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19345787 | pmc = 3108991 | doi = 10.1016/j.apmr.2008.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common causes include bladder or bowel over-distension, from [[urinary retention]] and fecal compaction, respectively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eldahan KC, Rabchevsky AG | title = Autonomic dysreflexia after spinal cord injury: Systemic pathophysiology and methods of management | journal = Autonomic Neuroscience | volume = 209 | pages = 59–70 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28506502 | pmc = 5677594 | doi = 10.1016/j.autneu.2017.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] surge transmits through intact [[peripheral nerves]], resulting in systemic [[vasoconstriction]] below the level of the spinal cord lesion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963181140|title=Youmans and Winn neurological surgery|others=Winn, H. Richard,|isbn=9780323287821|edition=Seventh|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=963181140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension activates the [[baroreceptor]]s, resulting in a [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] surge originating in the [[central nervous system]] to inhibit the sympathetic outflow; however, the parasympathetic signal is unable to transmit below the level of the spinal cord lesion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This results in bradycardia, [[vasodilation]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[Pupillary response|pupillary constriction]] and [[Nasal congestion|nasal stuffiness]] above the spinal lesion, while there's [[Goose bumps|piloerection]], pale and cool skin below the lesion due to the prevailing sympathetic outflow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Initial treatment involves sitting the patient upright, removing any constrictive clothing (including abdominal binders and support stockings), rechecking blood pressure frequently, and then checking for and removing the inciting issue, which may require [[urinary catheterization]] or bowel disimpaction.&lt;ref name="Daroff_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSCI_2002" /&gt; If systolic blood pressure remains elevated (over 150&amp;nbsp;mm Hg) after initial steps, fast-acting short-duration [[Antihypertensive drug|antihypertensives]] are considered,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10790268.2015.1118186|title=A retrospective review of safety using a nursing driven protocol for autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injuries|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other inciting causes must be investigated for the symptoms to resolve.&lt;ref name="Daroff_2016" /&gt;

Prevention of AD involves educating the patient, family and caregivers of the precipitating cause, if known, and how to avoid it, as well as other triggers.&lt;ref name="CSCI_2002" /&gt; Since bladder and bowel are common causes, prevention involves routine bladder and bowel programs and urological follow-up for [[cystoscopy]]/[[Urodynamic testing|urodynamic]] studies.&lt;ref name="Daroff_2016" /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==

This condition is distinct and usually episodic, with the people potentially experiencing remarkably high blood pressure, intense headaches, profuse sweating, facial [[erythema]], goosebumps, nasal stuffiness, a "feeling of doom" or apprehension, and blurred vision.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; An elevation of 20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg over baseline systolic blood pressure, with a potential source below the neurological level of injury, meets the current definition dysreflexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/1079026812Z.00000000053|title=International standards to document remaining autonomic function after spinal cord injury|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complications ===

Autonomic dysreflexia can become chronic and recurrent, often in response to longstanding medical problems like soft tissue pressure injuries or [[hemorrhoids]]. Long term therapy may include [[alpha blocker]]s or [[calcium channel blocker]]s.

Complications of severe acute [[hypertension]] can include seizures, [[pulmonary edema]], [[myocardial infarction]], or [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Additional organs that may be affected include the [[kidneys]] and [[retinas]] of the eyes.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

== Causes ==

The first episode of autonomic dysreflexia may occur weeks to years after spinal cord injury takes place, but most people at risk (80%) develop their first episode within the first year after injury. Early AD tends to be associated with less severe increases in blood pressure. 

One common causative factor may be an undetected urinary tract infection. The difficulty in assessing this may be complicated with the usage of indwelling or suprapubic catheters. Other causes include medication side effects and various disease processes. The use of stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines which can result in urinary retention, and the use of CNS depressants and other psychoactive drugs can also lead to urinary retention and constipation thus leading to autonomic dysreflexia when in use over an extended period of time. 

=== Pain ===

Current scientific literature suggests that noxious (painful) stimuli are the primary initiators of AD. (Note: Not all noxious stimuli will cause AD. Some otherwise severe noxious stimuli in normal people, e.g. broken bones, may not result in AD, and may in fact even go unnoticed.)  However, different studies have found that activation of pain receptors in muscle and skin below the lesion in spinal cord injured individuals did not trigger AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton AR, Brown R, Macefield VG | title = Selective activation of muscle and skin nociceptors does not trigger exaggerated sympathetic responses in spinal-injured subjects | journal = Spinal Cord | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 660–5 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18427566 | doi = 10.1038/sc.2008.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh DR, Weaver LC | title = Autonomic dysreflexia, induced by noxious or innocuous stimulation, does not depend on changes in dorsal horn substance p | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 817–28 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15253807 | doi = 10.1089/0897715041269605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies suggests that not all noxious stimuli are reliable triggers of AD, and because non-noxious stimuli can also trigger AD, attribution of an episode of AD to noxious stimuli may cause clinicians to overlook underlying non-noxious triggers.  As a result, non-noxious trigger factors remain undetected, prolonging an episode of AD. They concluded that when deducing the potential causes of AD it is important to consider non-noxious sources of stimulation in addition to noxious triggers. Current assessment of autonomic dysreflexia in patients with known causative factors include palpation of the bladder and bowel and can also include bladder scan.

== Mechanism ==
Supraspinal vasomotor neurons send projections to the [[Intermediolateral nucleus|intermediolateral]] cell column, which is composed of sympathetic [[Preganglionic nerve fibers|preganglionic neurons]] (SPN) through the T1-L2 segments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The supraspinal neurons act on the SPN and its tonic firing, modulating its action on the [[Sympathetic ganglion|peripheral sympathetic chain ganglia]] and the [[adrenal medulla]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The sympathetic ganglia act directly on the blood vessels they innervate throughout the body, controlling vessel diameter and resistance, while the adrenal medulla indirectly controls the same action through the release of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The descending autonomic pathways, which are responsible for the supraspinal communication with the SPN, are interrupted resulting in decreased sympathetic outflow below the level of the injury.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this circumstance, the SPN is controlled only by spinal influences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first couple weeks after a spinal injury, the decreased sympathetic outflow causes reduced blood pressure and sympathetic reflex.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eventually, synaptic reorganization and plasticity of SPN develops into an overly sensitive state, which results in abnormal reflex activation of SPN due to afferent stimuli, such as bowel or bladder distension.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Reflex activation results in systemic vasoconstriction below the spinal cord disruption.  The peripheral arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension activates the [[baroreceptor]]s, resulting in a [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] surge originating in the [[central nervous system]], which inhibits the sympathetic outflow; however, the parasympathetic signal is unable to transmit below the level of the spinal cord lesion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This results in [[vasodilation]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[Pupillary response|pupillary constriction]] and [[Nasal congestion|nasal stuffiness]] above the spinal lesion, while there's [[Goose bumps|piloerection]], pale and cool skin below the lesion due to the prevailing sympathetic outflow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

The symptoms are usually not subtle, although asymptomatic events have been documented. Autonomic dysreflexia differs from [[autonomic instability]], the various modest cardiac and neurological changes that accompany a spinal cord injury, including [[bradycardia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], and ambient temperature intolerance.  In autonomic dysreflexia, patients will experience hypertension, sweating, spasms (sometimes severe spasms) and [[erythema]] (more likely in upper extremities) and may suffer from headaches and blurred vision.  Mortality is rare with AD, but morbidity such as stroke, retinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema if left untreated can be quite severe.  Older patients with very incomplete spinal cord injuries and systolic [[hypertension]] without symptoms are usually experiencing essential hypertension, not autonomic dysreflexia. Aggressive treatment of these elderly patients with rapidly acting [[antihypertensive]] medications can have disastrous results.

== Treatment ==

Proper treatment of autonomic dysreflexia involves administration of anti-hypertensives along with immediate determination and removal of the triggering stimuli. Often, sitting the patient up and dangling legs over the bedside can reduce blood pressures below dangerous levels and provide partial symptom relief. Tight clothing and stockings should be removed. [[Straight catheterization]] of the bladder or relief of a blocked urinary catheter tube may resolve the problem.  The rectum should be cleared of stool impaction, using anaesthetic lubricating jelly. If the noxious precipitating trigger cannot be identified, drug treatment is needed to decrease elevating intracranial pressure until further studies can identify the cause.

Drug treatment includes the rapidly acting [[vasodilator]]s, including sublingual or topical [[nitrate]]s or oral hydralazine or [[clonidine]].  [[Ganglionic blockers]] are also used to control [[sympathetic nervous system]] outflow.  Topical nitroglycerin ointment is a convenient and safe treatment—an inch or two can be applied to the chest wall or forehead, and wiped off when blood pressures begin to normalize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/sc201758|title=Pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of topical nitroglycerin at lowering blood pressure during autonomic dysreflexia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Autonomic dysreflexia is abolished temporarily by [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]] or [[general anaesthesia]]. These treatments are used during obstetric delivery of women with autonomic dysreflexia.

== Prognosis ==
The cause of autonomic dysreflexia itself can be life-threatening, and must also be completely investigated and treated appropriately to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

The Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine has developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of autonomic dysreflexia in adults, children, and pregnant women. There is also a consumer version of this guideline.

A '''brand''' is a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes an organization or product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Marketing Association]] [http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=B Dictionary]. Retrieved 2011-06-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Marketing|publisher=fahy&amp; jobber|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brands are used in [[business]], [[marketing]], and [[advertising]]. '''Name brands''' are sometimes distinguished from generic or [[store brand]]s.

The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who were known to have engaged in [[livestock branding]] as early as 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, H., ''The Miracle Of Man,'' London, Longacre, 1946, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Branding was used to differentiate one person’s cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal’s skin with a hot [[branding iron]]. If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. However, the term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that ‘brand’ now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics and fish sauce.

'''Branding''' is a set of [[marketing]] and communication methods that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand’s identity, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 |title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=17 |pages=4 |year=2008 |last1=Ghodeswar |first1=Bhimrao M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, and therefore branding is one of a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;ranchhod, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by assessing the effectiveness of these branding components.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin Lane|date=1993-01-01|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|jstor=1252054|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.2307/1252054}}&lt;/ref&gt; As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is a marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; When a customer is familiar with a brand, or favours it incomparably to its competitors, this is when a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation’s balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and [[brand valuation]] is an important management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.

The word ‘brand’ is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''commodity brand'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].

==Etymology==
The word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|publication-date=1983|publication-place=Springfield, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with branding irons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandingirons.com/index.html |title=The Evolution of Branding | publisher=Branding Irons Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/slave2.html The branding of slaves.] ''The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities''&lt;/ref&gt;  The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current meaning.

==History==
[[File:Amphorae for wine and oil, Archaeological Museum, Dion (6934667366).jpg|thumb |In pre-literate society, the distinctive shape of amphorae provided potential consumers with information about goods and quality. Pictured: Amphorae for wine and oil, [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|Archaeological Museum, Dion]].]] 
Branding and labelling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice of [[Livestock branding|branding livestock]] in order to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref name=KhanMufti2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Khan |first1= Saif Ullah |last2= Mufti |first2= Owais |title= The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands |journal= Journal of Managerial Sciences |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |year= 2007 |pages= 75–87 |url= http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, purchasers realised that the brand provided information about origin as well as about ownership, and could serve as a guide to quality. Branding was adapted by farmers, potters and traders for use on other types of goods such as pottery and ceramics. Forms of branding or proto-branding emerged spontaneously and independently throughout Africa, Asia and Europe at different times, depending on local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seals, which acted as quasi-brands, have been found on early Chinese products of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE); large numbers of seals survive from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the Indus Valley (3,300–1,300 BCE) where the local community depended heavily on trade; cylinder seals came into use in [[Ur]] in Mesopotamia in around 3,000 BCE and facilitated the labelling of goods and property; and the use of maker's marks on pottery was commonplace in both ancient Greece and Rome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The origin and historical development of branding and advertising in the old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity marks, such as stamps on ceramics, were also used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Starcevic, S., "The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old Civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe," ''Marketing,'' Vol. 46, No, 3, 2015, pp 29-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Twede has argued that the "consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |page= 107 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1,500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which consumers used to glean information about the type of goods and the quality. Systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer, which were understood to convey information about product quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |pages= 98 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the [[urban revolution]] in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality-control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, gave way to clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/523676 |title= Prehistories of Commodity Branding |journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 49 |pages= 7 |year= 2008 |last1= Wengrow |first1= David }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all historians agree that these markings are comparable with modern brands or labels, with some suggesting that the early pictorial brands or simple thumbprints used in pottery should be termed ''proto-brands''&lt;ref name=MooreReid2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/00076790802106299 |title= The birth of brand: 4000 years of branding |journal= Business History |volume= 50 |issue= 4 |pages= 419 |year= 2008 |last1= Moore |first1= Karl |last2= Reid |first2= Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other historians argue that the presence of these simple markings does not imply that mature [[brand management]] practices operated.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G.

In [[ancient Rome]], a commercial brand or inscription applied to objects offered for sale was known as a [[titulus pictus]]. The inscription typically specified information such as place of origin, destination, type of product and occasionally quality claims or the name of the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: Latin Words and Phrases, http://www.2qk.net/latin-words-and-phrases.html - "Titulus pictus[:] A titulus pictus is a commercial inscription made on the surface of certain artefacts.

One merchant who made good use of the [[titulus pictus]] was Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii, circa 35 CE. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house feature images of [[amphora]]e bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic depicts four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.2307/504744 |jstor= 504744 |title= A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii |journal= American Journal of Archaeology |volume= 88 |issue= 4 |pages= 557 |year= 1984 |last1= Curtis |first1= Robert I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scauras' fish sauce was known by people across the Mediterranean to be of very high quality, and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In both Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use across a broad range of goods. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius"; probably references to the name of the producer.

The use of identity marks on products declined following the fall of the Roman Empire. However, in the European Middle Ages, [[heraldry]] developed a language of visual symbolism which would feed into the evolution of branding,&lt;ref&gt;

and with the rise of the [[merchant]]'s [[guild]]s the use of marks resurfaced and was applied to specific types of goods. By the 13th century the use of maker's marks had become evident on a broad range of goods. In 1266 makers' marks on bread became compulsory in England.&lt;ref&gt;Martino, T., ''Trademark Dilution,'' Clarendon Press, 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians used brands in the form of [[watermark]]s on paper in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Colapinto|first= John|title= Famous Names |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_colapinto |accessdate= 9 October 2011|newspaper= The New Yorker|date= 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blind stamp]]s, [[hallmark]]s, and silver-makers' marks - all types of brand - became widely used across Europe during this period.

A characteristic feature of 19th-century mass-marketing was the widespread use of branding, originating with the advent of packaged [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref name=KhanMufti2007/&gt; [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] moved the production of many household items, such as [[soap]], from local communities to centralized [[factory|factories]]. When shipping their items, the factories would literally [[wood branding|brand]] their [[logo]] or company insignia on the barrels used, effectively using a corporate trademark as a quasi-brand.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: How Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900–1930," ''CGR Working Paper,'' Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Factories established following the [[Industrial Revolution]] introduced mass-produced goods and needed to sell their products to a wider market - that is, to customers previously familiar only with locally produced goods. &lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993, Chapter 2; scholars describe this period as the era of "mass marketing"&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar, local products. Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realise that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands. &lt;ref&gt;Arnold E. J. and Thompson C. J., "Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research," Journal of Consumer Research,'' vol. 31, 2005, pp 868-882&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] with [[personality]] traits such as youthfulness, fun, sex appeal, luxury or the "cool" factor. This began the modern practice now known as ''branding'', where the consumers buy ''the brand'' instead of the product and rely on the brand name instead of a retailer's recommendation.

The process of giving a brand "human" characteristics represented, at least in part, a response to consumer concerns about mass-produced goods.&lt;ref&gt;Haig, M., ''Brand Failures: The truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time,'' London, Kogan-Page, 2005, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quaker Oats Company]] began using the image of the ''Quaker man'' in place of a trademark from the late 1870s, with great success.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 104; Martino, T., ''Trademark Dilution,''  Clarendon Press, 1996, pp 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pears (soap)|Pears' soap]], [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's soup]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Juicy Fruit| Juicy Fruit chewing gum]] and [[Aunt Jemima]] pancake mix were also among the first products to be "branded" in an effort to increase the consumer's familiarity with the product's merits. Other brands which date from that era, such as [[Uncle Ben's]] rice and [[Kellogg's]] breakfast cereal, furnish illustrations of the trend.

[[File:Quaker Oats (3092914571).jpg|thumb|right|The Quaker Company was one of the earliest to use a character on its packaging, branding and advertising. Pictured: The Quaker Man, c. 1900]]

By the early 1900s, [[trade press|trade-press]] publications, [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] and advertising [[expert]]s began producing books and pamphlets exhorting manufacturers to bypass retailers and to advertise direct to consumers with strongly branded messages. Around 1900, advertising guru [[James Walter Thompson]] published a house advertisement explaining [[trademark]] advertising. This was an early commercial explanation of what scholars now recognize as modern branding and the beginnings of brand management.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, pp 106-08.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued to the 1980s, and {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} is quantified in concepts such as [[value (ethics)|brand value]] and [[brand equity]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Naomi Klein]] has described this development as "brand equity mania".&lt;ref name="nologo" /&gt; In 1988, for example, [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] purchased [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] for six times what the company was worth on paper. Business analysts reported that what they really purchased was the brand name.

With the rise of [[mass media]] in the early 20th century, companies soon adopted techniques that would allow their messages to stand out; [[slogan]]s, [[mascot]]s, and [[jingle]]s began to appear on [[radio]] in the 1920s and in early [[television]] broadcasting in the 1930s. Soap manufacturers sponsored many of the earliest [[radio drama|radio-drama]] series, and the genre became known as ''[[soap opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers had started to develop relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Mildred Pierce, [http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm Newmediagroup.co.uk] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206032132/http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm |date= December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers began to use [[motivational research]] and [[consumer research]] to gather insights into consumer purchasing. Strong branded campaigns for Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn from research into psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing", in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt; Brand advertisers began to imbue goods and services with a personality, based on the insight that consumers searched for brands with personalities that matched their own.&lt;ref&gt;

==Concepts==

Effective branding can result in higher sales of not only one product, but of other products associated with that brand.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} If a customer loves Pillsbury biscuits and trusts the brand, he or she is more likely to try other products offered by the company - such as chocolate-chip cookies, for example. Brand development, often the task of a [[design]] [[team]], takes time to produce.

===Brand names and trademarks===
{{See|Trademark|Trademark symbol}}
[[File:CocaColaBottle.jpg|thumb|''Coca-Cola'' is a brand name, while the distinctive Spencerian script and the contour bottle are trademarked]]
A brand name is the part of a brand that can be spoken or written and ''identifies'' a product, service or company  and sets it apart from other comparable products within a category. A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a "memory heuristic"; a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.

===Corporate brand identity===
Simply, the brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler,|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''. However, that expansion of the meaning of brand identity causes some confusion because it overlaps with other common branding terms, such as brand image, brand personality, and brand meaning. [...] ''Brand identity'' and ''brand image'' are only two of the buzz words that are used and confused by brand experts and brand managers.

&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for a company to exude a strong sense of brand identity, it must have an in-depth understanding of its target market, competitors and the surrounding business environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brand identity includes both the core identity and the extended identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The core identity reflects consistent long-term associations with the brand; whereas the extended identity involves the intricate details of the brand that help generate a constant motif.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Kotler et al. (2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:

# attributes
# benefits
# values
# personality

A brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a "just do it" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value. Even more extensive than its perceived values is a brand's '''personality'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quite literally, one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining long-lasting relationships with consumers, as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639213 |title=INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATION (IMC) AND BRAND IDENTITY AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF BRAND EQUITY STRATEGY: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=69 |year=2005 |last1=Madhavaram |first1=Sreedhar |last2=Badrinarayanan |first2=Vishag |last3=McDonald |first3=Robert E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish, and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Brand personality===

'''Brand personality''' refers to “the set of human personality traits that are both applicable to and relevant for brands.” &lt;ref&gt;Azoulay, A and  Kapferer, J.N., "Do Brand Personality Scales Really Measure Brand Personality?" ''Journal of Brand Management,'' Vol. 11, No. 2, 2003 p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Marketers and consumer researchers often argue that brands can be imbued with human-like characteristics which resonate with potential consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610421011033467 |title=Impact of brand personality on three major relational consequences (trust, attachment, and commitment to the brand) |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=114 |year=2010 |last1=Louis |first1=Didier |last2=Lombart |first2=Cindy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such personality traits can assist marketers to create unique, brands that are differentiated from rival brands. Aaker conceptualised brand personality as consisting of five broad dimensions, namely: sincerity (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful), excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up to date), competence (reliable, intelligent, and successful), sophistication (glamorous, upper class, charming), and ruggedness (outdoorsy and tough).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151897 |jstor=3151897 |title=Dimensions of Brand Personality |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=347 |year=1997 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research studies have suggested that Aaker's dimensions of brand personality are relatively stable across different industries, market segments and over time. Much of the literature on branding suggests that consumers prefer brands with personalities that are congruent with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151914 |jstor=3151914 |title=The Malleable Self: The Role of Self-Expression in Persuasion |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=36 |pages=45 |year=1999 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.07.031 |title=Moderators of the self-congruity effect on consumer decision-making: A meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1179 |year=2012 |last1=Aguirre-Rodriguez |first1=Alexandra |last2=Bosnjak |first2=Michael |last3=Sirgy |first3=M. Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may distinguish the psychological aspect (brand associations like thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, attitudes, and so on that become linked to the brand) of a brand from the experiential aspect. The experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is termed the consumer's ''[[brand experience]]''. The brand is often intended to create an emotional response and recognition, leading to potential loyalty and repeat purchases. The brand experience is a brand's action perceived by a person.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The psychological aspect, sometimes referred to as the ''brand image'', is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people, consisting of all the information and expectations associated with a product, with a service, or with the companies providing them.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Marketers or product managers responsible for branding seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience, creating the impression that a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics that make it special or unique.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A brand can therefore become one of the most valuable elements in an [[advertising theme]], as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the [[market (place)|marketplace]].{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The art of creating and maintaining a brand is called [[brand management]]. Orientation of an entire organization towards its brand is called [[brand orientation]]. Brand orientation develops in response to [[market intelligence]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Careful brand management seeks to make products or services relevant and meaningful to a [[target audience]]. Marketers tend to treat brands as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price; rather brands represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer and are often treated as the total investment in brand building activities including marketing communications.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, pp  295-97&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic (see also [[#Brand promise|brand promise]]). From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.

===Brand awareness===

{{Main|Brand awareness}}
[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos and branded advertising. Brands helps customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers &amp; potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.

Brand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing. That is, customers will not consider a brand if they are not aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Donald (2010). "Success Factors In Establishing Your Brand" Franchising and Licensing Association. Retrieved from http://www.flasingapore.org/info_branding.php&lt;/ref&gt; Brand awareness is a key component in understanding the effectiveness both of a brand's identity and of its communication methods.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title= integrated marketing communications|last= Chitty|first= Williams|publisher= Thomson|year= 2005|isbn= 0 17 012008 2|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful brands are those that consistently generate a high level of brand awareness, as this can often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} be the pivotal factor in securing customer transactions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1002/mar.4220090402|title= A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal= Psychology and Marketing|volume= 9|issue= 4|pages= 263|year= 1992|last1= Percy|first1= Larry|last2= Rossiter|first2= John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various forms of brand awareness can be identified. Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Marketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.

* Most companies aim for "'''Top-of-Mind'''" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, "Kleenex", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.
* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category
* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.
* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.

===Brand recognition===

'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product: |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263–274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.

Brand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's "signature" logo), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].

=== Brand recall===

Unlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market. Thus, brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding [[touchpoint]]s have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Marketing mix modeling|Marketing-mix modeling]] can help [[marketing leader]]s optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales. Managing brands for [[Value proposition|value creation]] will often involve applying marketing-mix modeling techniques in conjunction with [[brand valuation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Brand communication===

{{See|Advertising management|Integrated marketing communications|Marketing communications|Promotion (marketing)}}
Although brand identity is regarded{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the most fundamental asset to a brand's [[brand equity|equity]], the worth of a brand's identity would become obsolete without ongoing brand communication.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi A, Lorestani HZ, Mazidi AK. Investigating the effects of brand identity on customer loyalty from social identity perspective. Iranian Journal of Management Studies. 2013;6(2):153-78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrated marketing communications]] (IMC) relates to how a brand transmits a clear consistent message to its [[stakeholder (disambiguation)|stakeholder]]s .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Five key components comprise IMC:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# advertising
# sales promotions
# direct marketing
# personal selling
# public relations

The effectiveness of a brand's communication is determined by how accurately the customer perceives the brand's intended message through its IMC. Although IMC is a broad strategic concept, the most crucial brand communication elements are pinpointed{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to how the brand sends a message and what touch points the brand uses to connect with its customers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One can analyse the traditional communication model into several consecutive steps:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Firstly, a source/sender wishes to convey a message to a receiver. This source must encode the intended message in a way that the receiver will potentially understand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* After the encoding stage, the forming of the message is complete and is portrayed through a selected channel.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Advertising and promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last= Belch|first= G .E|publisher= McGrawHill Irwin|year= 2012|isbn= |location= New York, NY United States of America|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In IMC, channels may include media elements such as advertising, public relations, sales promotions, etc.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* It is at this point where the message can often deter from its original purpose as the message must go through the process of being decoded, which can often lead to unintended misinterpretation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* Finally, the receiver retrieves the message and attempts to understand what the sender was aiming to render. Often, a message may be incorrectly received due to noise in the market, which is caused by "…unplanned static or distortion during the communication process".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The final stage of this process is when the receiver responds to the message, which is received by the original sender as feedback.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

When a brand communicates a brand identity to a receiver, it runs the risk of the receiver incorrectly interpreting the message. Therefore, a brand should use appropriate communication channels to positively "…affect how the psychological and physical aspects of a brand are perceived" &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Dahlen M, Lange F, Smith T. Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for brands to effectively communicate to customers, marketers must "…consider all [[touchpoint|touch point]]s, or sources of contact, that a customer has with the brand".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Shimp TA. Integrated marketing communications in advertising and promotion. 8 ed. Mason, OH United States of America: South Western, Cengage Learning; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Touch points represent the channel stage in the traditional communication model, where a message travels from the sender to the receiver. Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate - defines a touch point. According to Dalen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the "…potential to add positive - or suppress negative - associations to the brand's equity" &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thus a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilising the best communication channel, is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Brand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 |title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=592 |year=2014 |last1=Uzunoğlu |first1=Ebru |last2=Misci Kip |first2=Sema }}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of brand communication which companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM). EWoM is a relatively new{{when|date=August 2016}} approach identified{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to communicate with consumers. One popular method of eWOM involves [[Social networking service|social networking sites]] (SNSs) such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, E., Sung, Y. and Kang, H., 2014. Brand followers' retweeting behavior on Twitter: How brand relationships influence brand electronic word-of-mouth. Computers in Human Behavior, 37, pp.18–25&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that consumers classed their relationship with a brand as closer if that brand was active on a specific social media site (Twitter). Research further found that the more consumers "retweeted" and communicated with a brand, the more they trusted the brand. This suggests that a company could look to employ a [[social-media marketing|social-media campaign]] to gain consumer trust and loyalty as well as in the pursuit of communicating brand messages.

McKee (2014) also looked into brand communication and states that when communicating a brand, a company should look to simplify its message as this will lead to more value being portrayed as well as an increased chance of target consumers recalling and recognizing the brand.&lt;ref&gt;.McKee, S., 2014. Branding Made Simple. [online] Bloomberg Business. Available at: &lt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-13/branding-made-simple&gt; [Accessed 6 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Riefler stated that if the company communicating a brand is a global organisation or has future global aims, that company should look to employ a method of communication which is globally appealing to their consumers, and subsequently choose a method of communication with will be internationally understood.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2011.11.001 |title=Why consumers do (not) like global brands: The role of globalization attitude, GCO and global brand origin |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=29 |pages=25 |year=2012 |last1=Riefler |first1=Petra }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way a company can do this involves choosing a product or service's brand name, as this name will need to be suitable for the marketplace that it aims to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/296297 |title=To Brand or Not to Brand? A Theoretical and Empirical Question |journal=The Journal of Business |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=279 |year=1985 |last1=Sappington |first1=David E. M |last2=Wernerfelt |first2=Birger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that if a company wishes to develop a global market, the company name will also need to be suitable in different cultures and not cause offense or be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., 2009. Idea Branding. [online] ''The Economist''. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/14126533&gt; [Accessed 1 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found{{by whom|date=August 2016}} that when communicating a brand a company needs to be aware that they must not just visually communicate their brand message and should take advantage of portraying their message through multi-sensory information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2011.09.005 |title=The consumer psychology of brands |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |volume=22 |pages=7 |year=2012 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Bernd }}&lt;/ref&gt; One article suggests that other senses, apart from vision, need to be targeted when trying to communicate a brand with consumers.&lt;ref&gt;
Anon., 2007. Sensory branding Sound effects. [online] The Economist. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/9079881&gt; [Accessed 5 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a jingle or background music can have a positive effect on brand recognition, purchasing behaviour and brand recall.

Therefore, when looking to communicate a brand with chosen consumers, companies should investigate a channel of communication which is most suitable for their short-term and long-term aims and should choose a method of communication which is most likely to be adhered to{{clarify|date=August 2016}} by their chosen consumers.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"/&gt; The match-up between the product, the [[consumer lifestyle]], and the endorser is important for effectiveness of brand communication.

==Global brand variables==

===Brand name===
[[File:Relationships trade marks – brand.svg|thumb|Relationship between trade marks and brand]]
The term "brand name" is quite often used interchangeably with "brand", although it is more correctly used to specifically denote written or spoken linguistic elements of any product. In this context a "brand name" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through trademark registration - such trademarks are called "Registered Trademarks"{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].

====Types of brand names====
Brand names come in many styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few include:
* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as "UPS" or "IBM"
* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as "Whole Foods" or "Toys R' Us"
* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as "Reese's Pieces" or "[[Dunkin' Donuts]]"
* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as "Amazon" or "Crest"
* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as "Wii" or "[[Häagen-Dazs]]"
* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as "Volvo" or "Samsung"
* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as "[[Hewlett-Packard]]", "Dell", "Disney", "Stussy" or "Mars"
* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as "[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]" or "[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]"
* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|"Nike"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as "[[Betty Crocker]]"
* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as "[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]", "Wok on Water" or "Eggs Eggscetera"
* '''combination''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as "[[Microsoft]]" ("microcomputer" and "software"), "[[Comcast]]" ("communications" and "broadcast"), "[[Evernote]]" ("forever" and "note"), "[[Vodafone]]" ("voice", "data", "telephone")

The act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]—which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word "copy".

===Brand line===
A brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].


[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.

===Brand identity===
{{Main|Corporate identity}}
The outward expression of a brand – including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance – is brand identity.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand"&gt;Neumeier, Marty (2004), ''The Dictionary of Brand''. {{ISBN|1-884081-06-1}}, pp.20&lt;/ref&gt; Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand – and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand" /&gt; The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.

Brand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.

====Visual brand identity====
[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]

A brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement – simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of "Less is more") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [Lippincott and Margulies], [[Paul Rand]], and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.

Color is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/col.20594 |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=36 |pages=55 |year=2011 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Zena }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brand trust===
Brand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Brand management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33–58 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.

''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is a syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of action, behavior, communication and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. Action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in the transferring the trust experience to audiences which have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.

===Brand parity===
Brand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=28 |year=1994 |last1=Richardson |first1=Paul S |last2=Dick |first2=Alan S |last3=Jain |first3=Arun K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.

==Expanding role of brands==
The original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.

Today, brands play a much bigger role. Brands have been co-opted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as powerful symbols in larger debates about economics, social issues, and politics. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Bianca |url= http://merriamassociates.com/2010/12/wikileaks-hacktivism-and-brands-as-political-symbols/ |title= Wikileaks, Hacktivism and Brands as Political Symbols « Merriam Associates, Inc.

===Company name===
Often, especially in the industrial sector, it is just the company's name which is promoted (leading to{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} one of the most powerful statements of branding: saying just before the company's downgrading. This approach has not worked as well for [[General Motors]], which recently overhauled how its corporate brand relates to the product brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |title=General Motors: A Reorganized Brand Architecture for a Reorganized Company « Merriam Associates, Inc. Brand Strategies |publisher=Merriamassociates.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604181905/http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |archivedate=2012-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Exactly how the company name relates to product and services names is known as [[brand architecture]]. Decisions about company names and [[Product naming|product names]] and their relationship depends on more than a dozen strategic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nisha Roy (nisharoy) – Pearltrees |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |title=Brand Architecture: Strategic Considerations « Merriam Associates, Inc. Brand Strategies |publisher=Merriamassociates.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520102618/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |archivedate=2013-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, a strong brand name (or company name) is made the vehicle for a range of products (for example, [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[Black &amp; Decker]]) or a range of subsidiary brands (such as [[Cadbury]] Dairy Milk, Cadbury Flake, or [[Cadbury Fingers]] in the UK).

===Individual branding===
{{Main|Individual branding}}
Each brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]]), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).

===Challenger brands===
{{main|Challenger brand}}
A challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader or a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset which sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.

===Multiproduct branding strategy===
Multiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all their products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  
Other examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church &amp; Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church &amp; Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. Multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.

====Product line extension====
{{main|Product line extension}}
Product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in a lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.

====Subbranding====
{{main|Subbranding}}
Subbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].

====Brand extension====
{{main|Brand extension}}
Brand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.

====Co-branding====
{{main|Co-branding}}
Co-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.

===Multibranding strategy===
Multibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestlé]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].

This approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.

====Fighting brands====
{{main|Fighter brand}}
The main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.

===Private branding strategy===

{{main|Store brand}}
Private branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.

In Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.

===Mixed branding strategy===
Mixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. 
For example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the "skin simple" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.

===Attitude branding and iconic brands===
Attitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 2000 book ''[[No Logo]]'',&lt;ref name="nologo"&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} [[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2000) ''[[No logo]]'', Canada: Random House, {{ISBN|0-676-97282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a "fetish strategy". Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' - brands that are able to gain and retain "meaning beyond the material."&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015. Rethinking Prestige Branding - Secrets of the Ueber-Brands. Kogan Page. p.17. {{ISBN|9780749470036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathur, S., Kuehlwein, J.P. and Schaefer, W., ''Asia Management Insights,'' Singapore Management University, Vol.3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A great brand raises the bar – it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. – [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])

Iconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be "identity brands". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them "iconic brands". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.

There are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):
# "Necessary conditions" – The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.
# "Myth-making" – A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.
# "Cultural contradictions" – Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.
# "The cultural brand management process" – Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.

Schaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015.

==="No-brand" branding===
Recently, a number of companies have successfully pursued "no-brand" strategies by creating packaging that imitates [[generic brand]] simplicity. Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means "No label" in English (from 無印良品 – "Mujirushi Ryohin" – literally, "No brand quality goods"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, a simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Heig, Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive and Survive, pg.216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130122022144/http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|deadurl=yes|title=The ‘no brand’ brand - EMEASEE|date=22 January 2013|archivedate=22 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"No brand" branding may be construed as a type of branding as the product is made conspicuous through the absence of a brand name.
"Tapa Amarilla" or "Yellow Cap" in Venezuela during the 1980s is another good example of no-brand strategy. It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.

==={{anchor|derivative}} Derived brands&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt;===

{{See|Derived demand}}
In this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) "[[Intel Inside]]".

===Brand extension and brand dilution===

{{See|brand extension}}
The existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;
for example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.

Mars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.

There is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.
When [[Coca-Cola]] launched "Diet Coke" and "Cherry Coke", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.

The risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Social media brands===
In 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. "We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us – but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see." &lt;ref name="Media Democracy"&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Better-Mousetrap-Invention-Democracy/dp/0749466219], 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2013) Simon Pont. Kogan Page. {{ISBN|978-0749466213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-brands===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Alternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the share of the market which will in any case go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as multi-brand strategy.

Individual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what
business the company is in or diluting higher quality products.

[[Procter &amp; Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of "facings" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate—from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).

[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.

===Private labels===

{{See|Private label}}
[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this "own brand" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.

'''Designer Private Labels'''

A relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer’s budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.

In Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and ‘L’ for Lisa Ho.&lt;ref&gt;Schetzer, A., "Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers ‘Collette’ for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research,"Private Label Could be the New Black" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337&lt;/ref&gt; Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her “Petites’ range.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research, "Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion," Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520&lt;/ref&gt; Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frames designed by Peter Morrissey.

===Individual and organizational brands===
With the development of brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.&lt;ref name="The Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is leave social impact so their brand become associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims. Organizational brands have well determined brand guidelines and logo variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|title=AIESEC BLUE BOOK Brand Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625183605/http://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal branding====
{{main|Personal branding}}

====Employer branding====
{{main|Employer branding}}

===Crowd sourced branding===
These are brands that are created by "the public" for the business, which is opposite to the traditional method where the business create a brand.

===Personalised branding===

Many businesses have started to use elements of personalisation in their branding strategies, offering the client or consumer the ability to choose from various brand options or have direct control over the brand. Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people. [[AirBNB]] has created the facility for users to create their own symbol for the software to replace the brand's mark known as The Bélo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |title=Airbnb says its new logo belongs to everyone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921204457/http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |archivedate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation branding (place branding and public diplomacy)===
{{See|Place branding}}
[[Nation branding]] is a field of theory and practice which aims to measure, build and manage the reputation of countries (closely related to [[place branding]]). Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state "and the successful transference of this image to its exports – is just as important as what they actually produce and sell."

===Destination branding===

Destination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote to themselves. This work is designed to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations. The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization.

==Doppelgänger brand image (DBI)==
{{Main|Doppelgänger brand image}}
A doppelgänger brand image or "DBI"  is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture. DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands. The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.&lt;ref name="Thompson 50–64"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''gänger'' (walker).

Doppelgänger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.

Due to the ability of Doppelgänger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand. Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re-position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism.

Examples include:
* '''Joe Chemo''' campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Chemo: A Camel Who Wishes He'd Never Smoked|url=http://www.joechemo.org/|website = www.joechemo.org|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Version of the '''Coca-Cola''' logo crafted to protest their sponsorship of the '''2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar''' and associated human rights abuses (see citation for original Reddit thread featuring the image).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coke's slogan is "Share Happiness". So I made an ad to remind them of the kind of happiness they're sharing in Qatar. • /r/sports|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/36voua/cokes_slogan_is_share_happiness_so_i_made_an_ad/|website=Reddit|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parody of the '''Pepsi logo as an obese man''' to highlight the relationship between soft drink consumption and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Designer Makes Fun Of Pepsi, Turns Its Logo Into A Fat Man - DesignTAXI.com|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/360382/Designer-Makes-Fun-Of-Pepsi-Turns-Its-Logo-Into-A-Fat-Man/|website=designtaxi.com|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''FUH2 campaign''' protesting the Hummer SUV as a symbol of corporate and consumer irresponsibility toward public safety and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FUH2 {{!}} Fuck You And Your H2|url = http://www.fuh2.com |website = www.fuh2.com|accessdate = 2015-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319105357/http://www.fuh2.com/|archivedate=2016-03-19|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2006 article "Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image", Thompson, Rindfleisch, and Arsel suggest that a doppelgänger brand image can be a benefit to a brand if taken as an early warning sign that the brand is losing emotional authenticity with its market.&lt;ref name="Thompson 50–64"/&gt;

[[File:Broadcasting1.JPG|thumb|right|Broadcasting antenna in [[Stuttgart]]]]
'''Broadcasting''' is the [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[sound|audio]] or video content to a dispersed [[audience]] via any electronic [[medium (communication)|mass communications medium]], but typically one using the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] ([[radio wave]]s), in a [[:wikt:one-to-many|one-to-many]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=John Durham|title=Speaking into the Air|date=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226662763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3656803.html|title=Speaking into the Air|website=Press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasting began with [[AM radio]], which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of [[vacuum tube]] [[radio transmitter]]s and [[radio receiver|receivers]].  Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early [[radio]], [[telephone]], and [[telegraph]]) were [[wikt:one-to-one|one-to-one]], with the message intended for a single recipient.  The term ''broadcasting'' evolved from its use as the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas|first1=Susan J.|title=Inventing American Broadcasting, 1899–1922|date=1987|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9780801838323}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted for describing the widespread distribution of information by printed materials&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822031033079;view=1up;seq=80 ''The Hand-book of Wyoming and Guide to the Black Hills and Big Horn Regions''], 1877, p. 74: "in the case of the estimates sent broadcast by the Department of Agriculture, in its latest annual report, the extent has been sadly underestimated".&lt;/ref&gt; or by telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015070278273;view=1up;seq=340 "Medical Advertising"], ''Saint Louis Medical and Surgical Journal'', December 1886, p. 334: "operations formerly described in the city press alone, are now sent broadcast through the country by multiple telegraph".&lt;/ref&gt; Examples applying it to "one-to-many" radio transmissions of an individual station to multiple listeners appeared as early as 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101050973286;view=1up;seq=841 "Wireless Telegraphy"], ''The Electrician'' (London), October 14, 1898, p. 815: "there are rare cases where, as Dr. Lodge once expressed it, it might be advantageous to 'shout' the message, spreading it broadcast to receivers in all directions".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Over-the-air broadcasting|Over the air broadcasting]] is usually associated with [[radio]] and [[television]], though in recent years, both radio and television transmissions have begun to be distributed by cable ([[cable television]]). The receiving parties may include the general public or a relatively small subset; the point is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology and equipment (e.g., a radio or television set) can receive the signal. The field of broadcasting includes both government-managed services such as [[public radio]], [[community radio]] and [[public television]], and private [[commercial radio]] and [[commercial television]]. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, title 47, part 97 defines "broadcasting" as "transmissions intended for reception by the general public, either direct or relayed".&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Code of Federal Regulation. (2017, September 28`). Retrieved October 02, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Private or two-way [[telecommunication]]s transmissions do not qualify under this definition. For example, [[amateur radio|amateur]] ("ham") and [[citizens band radio|citizens band]] (CB) radio operators are not allowed to broadcast. As defined, "transmitting" and "broadcasting" are not the same.

Transmission of radio and television programs from a radio or television station to home receivers by [[radio wave]]s is referred to as "over the air" (OTA) or [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcasting and in most countries requires a [[broadcast license|broadcasting license]].  Transmissions using a wire or cable, like [[cable television]] (which also retransmits OTA stations with their [[retransmission consent|consent]]), are also considered broadcasts but do not necessarily require a license (though in some countries, a license is required).  In the 2000s, transmissions of television and radio programs via [[Streaming media|streaming]] digital technology have increasingly been referred to as broadcasting as well.

==History==
{{Main article|History of broadcasting}}
&lt;!-- Please maintain section synchronized with main article; see [[Wikipedia:SYNC]] for guidelines. --&gt;
The earliest broadcasting consisted of sending telegraph signals over the airwaves, using [[Morse code]], a system developed in the 1830s by   Samuel [[Samuel F. B. Morse|F.B. Morse]], [[physicist]] [[Joseph Henry]] and [[Alfred Vail]]. They developed an [[electrical telegraph]] system which sent pulses of [[electric current]] along wires which controlled an [[electromagnet]] that was located at the receiving end of the telegraph system. A code was needed to transmit natural language using only these pulses, and the silence between them. Morse therefore developed the forerunner to modern [[International Morse code]]. This was particularly important for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication, but it became increasingly important for business and general news reporting, and as an arena for personal communication by radio amateurs (Douglas, op. cit.).  Audio broadcasting began experimentally in the first decade of the 20th century.  By the early 1920s radio broadcasting became a household medium, at first on the [[AM band]] and later on [[FM band|FM.]]  Television broadcasting started experimentally in the 1920s and became widespread after World War II, using [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] spectrum. [[Satellite broadcasting]] was initiated in the 1960s and moved into general industry usage in the 1970s, with DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellites) emerging in the 1980s.

Originally all broadcasting was composed of [[analog signal]]s using [[analog transmission]] techniques but in the 2000s, broadcasters have [[Digital switchover|switched]] to [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signals]] using [[digital transmission]].  In general usage, broadcasting most frequently refers to the transmission of information and entertainment programming from various sources to the general public.

* [[Analog television]] vs. [[Digital television]]
* [[Wireless]]

The world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks more than quadrupled during the two decades from 1986 to 2007, from 432 [[exabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information, to 1.9 [[zettabytes]].&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the information equivalent of 55 newspapers per person per day in 1986, and 175 newspapers per person per day by 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 |title=video animation on The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010 |publisher=Ideas.economist.com |date= |accessdate=26 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118072720/http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Historically, there have been several methods used for broadcasting [[electronic media]] audio and video to the general public:
* [[Telephone]] broadcasting (1881–1932): the earliest form of electronic broadcasting (not counting data services offered by stock [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph companies]] from 1867, if [[ticker tape|ticker-tapes]] are excluded from the definition). Telephone broadcasting began with the advent of [[Théâtrophone]] ("Theatre Phone") systems, which were telephone-based distribution systems allowing subscribers to listen to live [[opera]] and [[theatre]] performances over telephone lines, created by French inventor [[Clément Ader]] in 1881. Telephone broadcasting also grew to include [[telephone newspaper]] services for news and entertainment [[Radio programming|programming]] which were introduced in the 1890s, primarily located in large [[Europe]]an cities. These telephone-based [[Subscription business model|subscription services]] were the first examples of electrical/electronic broadcasting and offered a wide variety of programming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* [[Radio broadcasting]] (experimentally from 1906, commercially from 1920); [[sound|audio]] signals sent through the air as [[radio waves]] from a [[transmitter]], picked up by an [[radio antenna|antenna]] and sent to a [[tuner (radio)|receiver]]. [[Radio stations]] can be linked in [[radio network]]s to broadcast common [[radio program]]s, either in [[broadcast syndication]], [[simulcast]] or [[subchannel]]s.
* [[Television]] broadcasting (telecast), experimentally from 1925, [[commercial television|commercially]] from the 1930s: an extension of radio to include [[video]] signals.
* [[Cable radio]] (also called "cable FM", from 1928) and [[cable television]] (from 1932): both via [[coaxial cable]],  originally serving principally as transmission media for programming produced at either radio or [[television station]]s, but later expanding into a broad universe of cable-originated [[cable channel|channels]].
* [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) (from c. 1974) and [[satellite radio]] (from c. 1990): meant for direct-to-home broadcast programming (as opposed to studio network uplinks and downlinks), provides a mix of traditional radio or television broadcast programming, or both, with dedicated satellite radio programming. (See also: [[Satellite television]])
* [[Webcast#Origins|Webcasting]] of video/television (from c. 1993) and audio/radio (from c. 1994) streams: offers a mix of traditional radio and television station broadcast programming with dedicated [[Internet radio]] and [[Internet television]].

==Economic models==
There are several means of providing financial support for continuous broadcasting:
* [[Commercial broadcasting]]: for-profit, usually privately owned stations, channels, networks, or services providing programming to the public, supported by the sale of air time to advertisers for [[radio advertisement|radio]] or [[television advertisement]]s during or in breaks between programs, often in combination with cable or [[pay cable]] subscription fees.
* [[Public broadcasting]]: usually [[non-profit]], publicly owned stations or networks supported by license fees, government funds, grants from foundations, corporate [[underwriting]], audience memberships, contributions or a combination of these.
* Community broadcasting: a form of [[mass media]] in which a [[television station]], or a [[radio station]], is owned, operated or [[broadcast programming|programmed]], by a community group to provide programs of local interest known as [[local programming]]. Community stations are most commonly operated by [[non-profit group]]s or [[cooperatives]]; however, in some cases they may be operated by a local [[college]] or [[university]], a [[cable company]] or a municipal government.

Broadcasters may rely on a combination of these [[business model]]s. For example, in the United States, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) and the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS, television)  supplement public membership subscriptions and grants with funding from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (CPB), which is allocated bi-annually by Congress. US public broadcasting corporate and charitable grants are generally given in consideration of [[underwriting spot]]s which differ from commercial advertisements in that they are governed by specific [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] restrictions, which prohibit the advocacy of a product or a "call to action".

==Recorded and live forms==
{{anchor|Recorded broadcasts and live broadcasts}}
[[File:TV Station Control Room.JPG|thumb|A [[television studio]] [[production control room]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], August 2008.]]
[[File:On Air DSC0004 1.jpg|thumb|On Air sign illuminated usually in red while recording or broadcasting]]
The first regular television broadcasts started in 1937. Broadcasts can be classified as "recorded" or "live". The former allows correcting errors, and removing superfluous or undesired material, rearranging it, applying [[slow-motion]] and repetitions, and other techniques to enhance the program. However, some live events like [[sports television]] can include some of the aspects including slow-motion clips of important goals/hits, etc., in between the [[live television]] telecast. American radio-network broadcasters habitually forbade prerecorded broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s requiring radio programs played for the Eastern and Central [[time zone]]s to be repeated three hours later for the Pacific time zone (See: [[Effects of time on North American broadcasting]]). This restriction was dropped for special occasions, as in the case of the German [[dirigible]] airship ''[[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]]'' disaster at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]], in 1937. During [[World War II]], prerecorded broadcasts from war correspondents were allowed on U.S. radio. In addition, American radio programs were recorded for playback by [[Armed Forces Radio]] [[radio station]]s around the world.

A disadvantage of recording first is that the public may know the outcome of an event from another source, which may be a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]". In addition, prerecording prevents [[live radio]] [[announcer]]s from deviating from an officially approved [[screenplay|script]], as occurred with [[propaganda]] broadcasts from Germany in the 1940s and with [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] in the 1980s. Many events are advertised as being live, although they are often "recorded live" (sometimes called "[[live television|live]]-to-[[video tape|tape]]"). This is particularly true of performances of musical artists on radio when they visit for an in-studio [[concert]] performance. Similar situations have occurred in [[television production]] ("''[[The Cosby Show]]'' is recorded in front of a [[live television]] studio [[audience]]") and [[news broadcasting]].

A broadcast may be distributed through several physical means. If coming directly from the [[radio studio]] at a single station or [[television station]], it is simply sent through the [[studio/transmitter link]] to the [[transmitter]] and hence from the [[television antenna]] located on the [[radio masts and towers]] out to the world. Programming may also come through a [[communications satellite]], played either live or recorded for later transmission. Networks of stations may [[simulcast]] the same programming at the same time, originally via [[microwave]] link, now usually by satellite. Distribution to stations or networks may also be through physical media, such as [[magnetic tape]], [[compact disc]] (CD), [[DVD]], and sometimes other formats. Usually these are included in another broadcast, such as when [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) returns a story to the station for inclusion on a [[news program]]me.

The final leg of broadcast distribution is how the signal gets to the listener or viewer. It may come over the air as with a [[radio station]] or [[television station]] to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] and [[radio receiver]], or may come through [[cable television]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diwaxx.ru/|title=Информационно – развлекательный портал – DIWAXX.RU – мобильная связь, безопасность ПК и сетей, компьютеры и программы, общение, железо, секреты Windows, web-дизайн, раскрутка и оптимизация сайта, партнерские программы|website=Diwaxx.ru|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[cable radio]] (or "[[wireless cable]]") via the station or directly from a network. The [[Internet]] may also bring either [[internet radio]] or [[streaming media]] television to the recipient, especially with [[multicast]]ing allowing the signal and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to be shared. The term "[[broadcast network]]" is often used to distinguish networks that broadcast an over-the-air television signals that can be received using a [[tuner (television)]] inside a [[television set]] with a [[television antenna]] from so-called networks that are broadcast only via [[cable television]] ([[cablecast]]) or [[satellite television]] that uses a [[dish antenna]]. The term "[[broadcast television]]" can refer to the [[television program]]s of such networks.

==Social impact==

[[File:WTUL Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Radio station]] [[WTUL]] studio, [[Tulane University]], [[New Orleans]]]]
The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a [[scheduling (broadcasting)|schedule]]. As with all technological endeavors, a number of technical terms and [[slang]] have developed. A list of these terms can be found at [[List of broadcasting terms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qsl.net/n2jac/jota2k/BROADCAST+GLOSSARY.htm|title=|website=Qsl.net|accessdate=11 November 2017}}{{deadlink|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television]] and [[radio]] programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or [[cable television|cable]], often both simultaneously. By coding signals and having a [[cable converter box]] with [[Code (cryptography)|decoding]] equipment in [[home]]s, the latter also enables [[subscription]]-based channels, [[pay-tv]] and [[pay-per-view]] services. In his essay, [[John Durham Peters]] wrote that [[communication]] is a tool used for dissemination. Durham stated, "[[Dissemination]] is a lens—sometimes a usefully distorting one—that helps us tackle basic issues such as interaction, presence, and space and time...on the agenda of any future [[communication theory]] in general" (Durham, 211).&lt;ref name="uchicago.edu"/&gt; Dissemination focuses on the message being relayed from one main source to one large [[audience]] without the exchange of [[dialogue]] in between. It is possible for the message to be [[Propaganda|changed or corrupted by government officials]] once the main source releases it. There is no way to predetermine how the larger population or audience will absorb the message. They can choose to listen, analyze, or simply ignore it. Dissemination in communication is widely used in the world of broadcasting.

Broadcasting focuses on getting a message out and it is up to the general public to do what they wish with it. Durham also states that broadcasting is used to address an open-ended destination (Durham, 212). There are many forms of broadcasting, but they all aim to distribute a signal that will reach the target [[audience]]. Broadcasters typically arrange audiences into entire assemblies (Durham, 213). In terms of media broadcasting, a [[radio show]] can gather a large number of followers who tune in every day to specifically listen to that specific [[disc jockey]]. The disc jockey follows the script for his or her radio show and just talks into the [[microphone]].&lt;ref name="uchicago.edu"/&gt; He or she does not expect immediate feedback from any listeners. The message is broadcast across airwaves throughout the community, but there the listeners cannot always respond immediately, especially since many radio shows are recorded prior to the actual air time.

A '''buffer zone''' is generally a [[wikt:zone|zonal]] area that lies between two or more other areas (often, but not necessarily, [[country|countries]]), but depending on the type of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are [[demilitarized zone]]s, [[border zone]]s and certain restrictive easement zones and [[Green Belt|green belts]]. Such zones may be, but not necessarily be, comprised by a sovereign state, forming a [[buffer state]].

Buffer zones have various purposes, political or otherwise. They can be set up to prevent violence, protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, keep prisoners intent on escaping from rapidly acquiring hostages or a hiding place, and have uses in several other scenarios. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions which are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world.{{examples|date=October 2013}}

== Conservation ==

For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their [[biodiversity]] importance. The buffer zone of a [[protected area]] may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it which links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|protected area categories]] (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/10/ A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Buffer Zones]&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'buffer zone' initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:

{{cquote|A buffer zone serves to provide an additional layer of protection to a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage property]]. The concept of a buffer zone was first included in the ''Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention'' in 1977. In the most current version of the ''Operational Guidelines'' of 2005 the inclusion of a buffer zone into a nomination of a site to the World Heritage List is strongly recommended but not mandatory.|cquote}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buffer zone is one of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] (BMPs). A buffer zone is intended to avert the effect of negative environmental or human influences, whether or not it embodies great natural or cultural value itself.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Oliver, and Piatti, Giovanna (ed.) ''World Heritage and
Buffer Zones'', International Expert Meeting on World Heritage and Buffer Zones Davos, Switzerland 11 – 14 March 2008 (Paris: UNESCO, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance and function of a buffer zone and the necessary protective measures derived thereof is a relatively new concept in conservation science and can differ greatly for each site.&lt;ref&gt;Ebregt, Arthur and de Greve, Pol, ''Buffer Zones and their Management: Policy and Best Practices for Terrestrial Ecosystems in Developing Countries'' (Wageningen: Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological functions (conservation) ==

=== Improve water quality ===
It shows that the quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse because humans do not use land properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=S. R.|last2=Caraco|first2=N. F.|last3=Correll|first3=D. L.|last4=Howarth|first4=R. W.|last5=Sharpley|first5=A. N.|last6=Smith|first6=V. H.|date=1998-08|title=Nonpoint Pollution of Surface Waters with Phosphorus and Nitrogen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2641247|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=3|pages=559|doi=10.2307/2641247|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the buffer zone occupies a small area, it greatly improves the quality of water in the agricultural [[wikt:drainage basin|watershed]] due to its filtering effect on nutrients in the underground water and surface water. 

Because farmland is sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, some of which can seep into surface water. It will have a negative impact on fish and other aquatic life, which can lead to environmental damage. Vegetation buffer has been proved to be an effective filter for sediment, especially for sediment-bound pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syversen|first=Nina|last2=Bechmann|first2=Marianne|date=2004-05|title=Vegetative buffer zones as pesticide filters for simulated surface runoff|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=22|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|issn=0925-8574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pesticides are sprayed in excess, a vegetation buffer can be built to reduce the penetration of pesticides into surface water. The buffer zone also prevents heavy metals or toxins from spreading to [[Protected area|protected areas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deroanne-Bauvin|first=J|last2=Delcarte|first2=E|last3=Impens|first3=R|date=1987-01|title=Monitoring of lead deposition near highway: A ten years study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|journal=Science of The Total Environment|volume=59|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stabilize the riverbanks ===
When the riverbanks are low, due to the plant root can enter the interior of the riverbank vertically, the sediment of riverbank is affected by the action of plant root, and the ability to resist erosion is higher than that without plant root. But when the riverbanks are higher, the roots of the plants do not penetrate deeply into the soil, and the lakeshore soil is not very strong. Herbaceous plants can play a role to some extent, but in the long term, vegetation buffer zone can effectively solve the problem of water level rise and water erosion. 

The adsorption capacity of buffer zone can reduce the speed of surface runoff and increase the effective water content of soil. Through increasing soil organic matter content and improving soil structure, it has a positive effect on soil water storage performance. In addition, plant roots make the soil stronger, withstand waves and rainstorm, mitigate the erosion of riverbanks by [[Flood|floods]], and effectively control the erosion of the beach. 

=== Provide food and habitat to wildlife ===
The riparian buffer zones have been used in many areas to protect the habitats of many animals which are being devastated by increased human activity. The areas around the buffer zone can form the habitat of many animals, the woody parts and leaves of plants can become food for small [[Aquatic animal|aquatic animals]]. The buffer zone itself can also support the life activities of various [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and birds. Plants and animals can migrate or spread in response to these buffer zones and then increasing the biodiversity in the area. 

A study shows that the species and number of animals and plants in riparian zones are higher than in other ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturtevant|first=Brian R|date=1998-10|title=A model of wetland vegetation dynamics in simulated beaver impoundments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=112|issue=2-3|pages=195–225|doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|issn=0304-3800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to provide abundant water, soft soil and stable climate, small animals such as ''[[Mouse-eared bat|Myotis]]'' and ''[[Marten|Martes]]'' prefer to live along riverbanks rather than in hilly areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=A. T.|date=1990-02-20|title=Use of Riparian and Upland Habitats by Small Mammals|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1381312|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=71|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.2307/1381312|issn=1545-1542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buffer zone can also provide a good environment for upland habitat, which is in line with the living conditions of freshwater [[Turtle|turtles]], making them more dependent on the wetland environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Vincent J.|last2=Gibbons|first2=J. Whitfield|date=1995-12|title=Terrestrial Buffer Zones and Wetland Conservation: A Case Study of Freshwater Turtles in a Carolina Bay|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1365–1369|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection level of the buffer zones will affect the habitat range of amphibians and [[Reptile|reptiles]], and the environmental management of the wetland habitat around buffer zone is extremely important. 

=== Provide [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value ===
As an important part of riparian zone, the vegetation buffer zones form a variety of [[landscape]], and the landscape pattern of combining land and water improves the aesthetic value of river basin landscape. The riparian buffer is rich in plant resources, and the wetland, grassland and forest ecosystem make the landscape more beautiful. In addition, some recreational facilities can be built in the buffer zone to provide better living conditions for residents or tourists and improve people's quality of life. 

In the buffer zone, those trees up to 6 meters tall greatly enhance the aesthetic value of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borin|first=Maurizio|last2=Passoni|first2=Matteo|last3=Thiene|first3=Mara|last4=Tempesta|first4=Tiziano|date=2010-01|title=Multiple functions of buffer strips in farming areas|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|journal=European Journal of Agronomy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|issn=1161-0301}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tall trees have luxuriant branches and leaves, especially their upright posture, making them of higher ornamental value. Some colorful landscape tree species can be planted on both sides of rivers with tourism and sightseeing value to improve the aesthetic value of the place. The establishment of vegetation buffer zone can increase green land, improve forest coverage, beautify environment and visual effect, improve people's living environment, enrich humanistic landscape and enhance aesthetic value. we need to call on people to pay attention to the importance of the buffer zone, encourage local residents to participate in the protection and management of the buffer zone, and set up checkpoints around the buffer zone to make it more secure and effective.

==History==

[[United States Central Command|United States Central Command (USCENTCOM)]] began envisioning and exploring a coalition data-sharing network in early 1999.&lt;ref name=whitepaper&gt;{{Citation | last = Boardman | first = Jill L. | last2 = Shuey | first2 = Donald W. | title = Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS); Supporting Coalition Warfare World-Wide | pages = 15 | date = April 2004 | publisher = [[United States Central Command|USCENTCOM]] | url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ccrp/centrixs.pdf | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of the global war on terrorism, as USCENTCOM prepared to conduct Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) in late 2001, efforts focused on speeding the development of just such a network. Additionally, the global nature of the war on terrorism demanded that CENTRIXS become a global multinational information sharing initiative.&lt;ref name=whitepaper/&gt;

The CENTRIXS Program Office (CPMO) was established by the Office of the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration]] in late January 2002. The CPMO was responsible to coordinate the planning, resources, and implementation of CENTRIXS world-wide to support the combatant commands.&lt;ref name=whitepaper/&gt;

Most CENTRIXS-ISAF and CENTRIXS-GCTF have been migrated to the newly created CENTCOM Partner Network (CPN).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afceatampa.org/events/pdf/presentations/May%202013%20ACFEA%20Luncheon.pptx{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chiquitano''' (also ''Bésiro'' or ''Tarapecosi'') is an indigenous [[language isolate]] of eastern [[Bolivia]], spoken in the central region of the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]] province.

==Classification==
Chiquitano is a [[language isolate]]. Greenberg linked it to the [[Macro-Jê languages]] in his discredited proposal, which was never substantiated.

According to traditional sources, dialects were ''tao (yúnkarirsh), piñoco, penoqui, kusikia, manasi, san simoniano, churapa.''

A '''circuit party''' is a large dance event. It extends through the night and into the following day, almost always with a number of affiliated events in the days leading up to and following the main event. Proto-circuit parties in the late 1970s, the precursors of what later became circuit parties, were called '''disco parties.''' They lasted only one evening and were held in various large venues in [[metropolitan area]]s with large gay populations.

Circuit parties were first developed in connection with the early [[tea dance]]s attended by a subset of [[gay]] men, as well as theme parties held on [[Fire Island]], in the days before the beginning of the health crisis of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. They came to resemble underground [[rave party|rave parties]] in some respects, but differ in that circuit parties are highly publicized and professionally produced, and tend to attract people from a wider age range and a broader geographic area.

==Background==

===Founding as disco parties (1970s)===
{{See also|White Party}}
[[Image:CircuitParty.jpg|thumb|A circuit party in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].]]
The start of the circuit has been attributed to many different parties that sprang up during the time-frame of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  These proto-circuit parties in the late 1970s, the precursors of what later became circuit parties, were called ''disco parties.'' They lasted one evening only, and were held in various large venues in [[metropolitan area]]s with large gay populations.  Although Flamingo and 12 West were New York clubs that had theme-centered gay parties, these nightclubs were eclipsed by the opening of the mega-nightclub, [[The Saint (club)|The Saint]], in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] in 1980. This members-only male (with very limited exceptions) club was very technologically advanced.  Some say its like has not been recreated since.

The Saint, which was constructed inside the renovated space that had once housed the renowned Fillmore East theatre, featured a dome-covered dance floor, the dome being suspended in mid-air, and a complete [[planetarium]] mechanism that projected a starscape onto the dome above the dance floor.  While open every weekend beginning in September, The Saint's once monthly parties became marathon events that drew gay men from around the world. These parties created the concept of a single party being the focal point for a weekend get-away in the gay community.

What was to become another circuit party was founded during the same time period by Corbett Reynolds, a [[Columbus, Ohio]]-based artist and [[nightclub]] owner in the late 1970s.  Initially, Reynolds envisioned a one-night party-to-end-all-parties, designed around the theme of the color Red (hence the name "Red Party"), which was to be held at Reynolds' nightclub, “Rudely Elegant.”

The Red Party proved to be so successful, and drew so many outside visitors, that it filled the Valley Dale Dance Hall to capacity and became an annual event, outliving the closure of the bar in the early 1980s. Reynolds was a true artist, creating complete party-scapes all in red. On the 25th anniversary of the Red Party, the theme of which was to have been "Rome", Mr. Reynolds died. Those in charge of his estate thought about how, if at all, to continue the event and, in the end, decided to retire the concept of the "Red Party" and leave it to history.

===AIDS crisis and growth of parties (1980s-1990s)===
The early 1980s saw the start of the AIDS crisis, and entire communities were affected.  Several benefit parties sprang up around the country, which were run by volunteer organizations that donated their proceeds to AIDS|HIV-related charities, such as ''[http://www.halloweenneworleans.com  Halloween's in New Orleans]''  The success of these early parties gave way to other events hosted in other cities, with each party having its own theme.  Many were named after colors, such as ''[[White Party]]'', ''Black Party'', ''[[Blue Ball (circuit party)|Blue Ball]]'', and ''[http://www.bbcm.org/ Black and Blue Festival]''.  And many center around other events, such as ''[http://www.southerndecadence.net/ Southern Decadence]'' and the [[Folsom Street Fair]]. Dance parties provided an environment in which gay men processed the experience of HIV/AIDS and served to build particular forms of communal response to the epidemic &lt;ref name="Race" /&gt;

[[File:White Diamonds Party.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The White Diamonds Party at [[Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend]].]]
One economic reality of a well-run circuit party is that the event can bring large amounts of tourist dollars to the locality where the event is held.  Because of their economic impact, Circuit parties have actually been welcomed into some of the more liberal cities where they are held.

In early 1990s, as more and more gay men became attracted to these mega dance-events, the real modern day circuit party scene emerged and expand into ever-larger productions, featuring superstar DJs and performers.  Promoters sometimes turned events from one party into a major series of parties at various venues, transforming a weekend into a three-day or longer continuous party.  For example, a pool party might go from noon to 5PM, a "[[Tea dance|t-dance]]" from 5PM to 9PM, a main event from 9PM to 4AM, and an after-hours party from 4AM until 12 noon, after which the cycle repeats itself.

To keep putting together these increasingly elaborate and costly productions, the prices (cover charge) of circuit parties increased greatly, so that it was not uncommon for a ticket covering the full weekend of parties to cost $400 or more.&lt;ref name="Cheves"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheves|first1=Alexander|title=Gay circuit parties are awesome — but they come at a price. At what point does it become too much?|url=https://www.hivplusmag.com/prevention/love-sex/2015/11/09/you-cant-afford-gay-circuit|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=hivplusmag.com|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak and decline in popularity (2000s)===
Having reached its peak around 1999–2000 (as evidenced by the total number of events during those years, and the steady decline in the number of events since), the Circuit found itself a smaller part of a much larger whole. In 2004, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation

The central focus was to determine why thousands of men spend multi-thousands of dollars to travel to this yearly event. Taken from the viewpoint of an experienced (female) raver, this gave the mainstream a view into what makes Circuit Parties so compelling for many and highlighted many of the changes taking place in these commercial events.

Nonetheless, the downward trend continued through the entire decade, with the downfall of a dozen events such as The Red Party, FireBall, Hotlanta, The Morning Party, Hell Ball, Reunion, and Motorball.

In the early 2000s, promoters became worried as attendance decreased dramatically at many circuit events.  This decline in attendance was attributed to several factors.  The original circuit audience that began attending the circuit parties of the '80s and '90s had grown older and no longer had such an active interest in multi-day partying. The communal experience of HIV/AIDS changed in the context of the availability of more effective treatments.&lt;ref name="Race" /&gt; In addition, all-gay cruises, which attract upwards of 1,500 passengers, have had a dramatic impact on the attendance at circuit parties.

Much had been said about the decline of the Circuit in recent years.  Some parties have disappeared from the landscape.  But the scene continues to thrive in many places with attendance rebounding from the dip that occurred after the new Millennium.  This is especially true at the better produced events, like Black and Blue in Montreal, and events that have more than just a circuit party to offer, such as Southern Decadence weekend in New Orleans.  Also, all-gay cruises that carry upwards of 2,000 passengers on week-long excursions to exotic ports continue to be very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2 men on gay cruise arrested in Dominica for having sex|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/2_men_on_gay_cruise_arrested_i.html|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=nj.com|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent resurgence (2010s)===
Circuit parties are currently organized in many international cities, each of them having another leading company, such as Rapido in Amsterdam, Matinee and WE Party in London and Madrid.

Circuit parties seem to gain widespread popularity again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barcelona Circuit Festival and Girlie Circuit 2017: Top 5|url=https://www.timeout.com/barcelona/things-to-do/barcelona-circuit-festival-and-girlie-circuit-2017|website=9 August 2017|publisher=timeout.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the annually organized Circuit Festival by the Matinée Group since 2008. Circuit Festival is currently the biggest international gay and lesbian event, hosting more than 50 DJ's every year during twelve days of circuit parties, bringing together all leading international circuit brands in [[Barcelona]]. In 2017, it attracted over 70,000 gay visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barcelona Circuit Festival 2018|url=https://www.gaybarcelona4u.com/event/barcelona-circuit-festival/|publisher=gaybarcelona4u.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and controversy ==
{{further|Party and play}}
Observers within the gay and medical communities have published concerns about the culture of circuit parties, particularly the use of drugs including: [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[methamphetamine]], [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], ketamine, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], [[amyl nitrite]], and other "[[party drug]]s". They point to the risks of overdose, dehydration, and impaired judgment leading to unsafe sex and transmission of [[sexually transmitted diseases]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal=Journal of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care (JIAPAC)| volume=4 |issue=2|pages=32–46|year=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications | title = Reducing HIV Infections at Circuit Parties: From Description to Explanation and Principles of Intervention Design | author = Amin Ghaziani and Thomas D. Cook, PhD|doi=10.1177/1545109705277978 | pmid = 16103025 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Sexual Ecology]]''). Circuit parties have been blamed for the spread of methamphetamine abuse and the rise in transmission of STDs, particularly HIV, among North American gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Overview and media perception==
While open to anyone, the parties generally are viewed as social events for gay men. Circuit parties charge admission, with some being run for-profit and others benefiting charities, generally those that benefit the [[LGBT]] communities or HIV/health related programs. Circuit parties are typically lavish affairs with elaborate lighting, music, and decor and are held in venues that can accommodate large crowds.

Some of the larger circuit parties are the [[White Party]] in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], the Black and Blue Party in [[Montreal]], and the Winter Party in [[Miami]], each of which attracts attendees in the thousands to tens of thousands. The White Party in [[Miami, Florida]] is now the longest running Circuit event and for twenty-four years has been held at Villa Vizcaya. White Party Miami is referred to as the Crown Jewel of the Circuit.

Circuit parties are known to attract a broad range of demographics, from young gay men in their early 20s to those in their 40s, 50s and even 60s, and both single gay men and couples in long-term relationships. The parties are described by attendees as very important social events, analogous to a major holiday for the gay community. They can be described as a "celebration" of gay life and gay sexuality, an expression of freedom, and as a statement of the power and strength of the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis LA &amp; Ross MW (1995): ''A Select Body: The gay dance party subculture and the HIV/AIDS pandemic'' New York: Cassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Circuit parties are not without controversy, and they are often perceived by outsiders as characterized by a high degree of superficiality; moreover those who attend them are often the target of broad and negative judgments by others in the gay community, usually because of the amount of promiscuous sex and drug use that is often perceived to be associated with the events. A small body of empirical research from different research groups does, indeed, point to a high prevalence of drug use among people who attend circuit events during the course of the events and raises questions about an association between drug use and risky sex practices among gay and bisexual men&lt;ref name="Race"&gt;Race K (2009): ''Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The queer politics of drugs'' Durham: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattison, A.M., Ross, M.W., Wolfson, T., &amp; Franklin, D.

'''Dirasha''' (also known as Ghidole, Diraasha, Dirayta, Gidole, Gardulla, Dhirasha) is a member of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family. It is spoken in the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo]] region of [[Ethiopia]], in the hills west of [[Lake Chamo]], around the town of [[Gidole]].

A number of speakers also use [[Oromo language|Oromo]] or [[Konso language|Konso]]. According to Wondwosen, the "Dirasha" is the name of the people, and the name of the language is given variously as "Dirashitata, Dirayta and Diraytata" (2006:3,4).

The language has a three [[ejective consonants|ejective consonant]] phonemes and two [[implosive consonant]] phonemes, fitting the pattern of the [[Ethiopian Language Area]]. It has two tones and five vowels.  Duration (or [[gemination]]) is distinctive for both consonants and vowels (Wondwosen 2006:9,10).

A '''fact''' is something that is consistent with objective [[reality]] or that can be proven with [[evidence]]. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [[experience]]. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word "fact" derives from the Latin ''factum'', and was first used in English with the same meaning: ''a thing done or performed'' a meaning now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact". OED_2d_Ed_1989, (but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (1a). OED_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact is sometimes used synonymously with ''[[truth]]'', as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste.  This use is found in such phrases as, "''It is a fact that the cup is blue"'' or "''Matter of fact"'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (4a) OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "...&amp;nbsp;not history, nor fact, but imagination." Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] distinguishes between the two, claiming that "Fact creates norms, and truth illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |title=Werner Herzog Film: Statements / Texts |publisher=Wernerherzog.com |date=1999-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715011254/http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). Compact_OED)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an ''allegation or stipulation'' of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', "Fact has a long history of usage in the sense 'allegation'" AHD_4th_Ed. The OED dates this use to 1729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority.  [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A "fact" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true.&lt;ref&gt;"A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true." – ''Fact'' in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is ''about'' the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book
| title     = Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy

| last      = Craig

| year      = 2005
| isbn        = 0-415-32495-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth
| first     = Pascal
| last      = Engel
| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press- MQUP
| year      = 2002
| isbn        = 0-7735-2462-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book
| title     = Truth and Interpretation
| first     = Donald
| last      = Davidson
| publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford
| year      = 1984
| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[logic of relatives|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations" Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "[[Paris]] is the capital city of [[France]]" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on.  The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{main|Fact–value distinction}}
Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:
what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well."

Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.

==In science==
{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}

In science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]].  Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]].  Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction
| first     = Barry
| last      = Gower
| publisher = Routledge
| year      = 1997
| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation.  Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;(Gower 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref&gt;(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"&gt;Gower, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"/&gt; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: "Facts and their evolution")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;ots=3V6-UmUFmP&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;sig=YtQTgNbisFSQ1QfV-JNkmW7D0n4#PPA181,M1 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' (among other interests) in scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;(Ravetz 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In history ==
{{further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]." This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean," of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined.  Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).

=== Legal pleadings ===
{{main|Pleading}}
A party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.&lt;ref&gt;(McDonald 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Final protective fire''' refers to a tactical plan for a military unit, set up in support of the [[infantry]], to protect itself against overwhelming attack.  Final protective fire ("FPF") is a request for artillery support (a "fire mission") generally reserved for a unit being overrun, and has absolute priority over any other kind of request.

A final protective fire is an immediately available preplanned barrier of direct and indirect fire designed to provide close protection to friendly positions and installations by impeding enemy movement into defensive areas.

The size of the FPF depends on the number and type of weapons firing (e.g., FPF size for one battery of 155&amp;nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s is 300&amp;nbsp;m × 50&amp;nbsp;m). The supported maneuver commander designates the location of the FPF and it is adjusted into place by the forward observer. Normally, the FPF is within 200 to 400 meters of friendly positions (known as "danger close") and is integrated into the final protective line of the maneuver unit.

As the "final" in the name implies, it is the last resort in defensive plans, involving [[artillery]] integrated with small arms and [[heavy machine gun]] [[fire]] directed dangerously close to friendly defensive positions that are at risk of being overrun by the enemy.

Final Protective Fire is commonly also incorporated into a defensive plan that incorporates a Final Protective Line, in which the Final Protective Line is a line that once the enemy has crossed, the FPF plan is enacted.

'''Doroteo Gerardo N. "Gerry" Alanguilan, Jr.''' (born January 20, 1968), better known in the Philippines by his stage name '''Komikero''', is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[comic book artist]] and [[writer]] from [[San Pablo, Laguna]], best known for his graphic novels ''[[Wasted (comics)|Wasted]]'' and ''[[Elmer (comics)|Elmer]]''.

== Early life ==
Gerry Alanguilan was born in the city of [[San Pablo, Laguna]] in the Philippines. Filipino legend states that Alanguilan's family was originally named San Gabriel, but the name changed when a witch placed a curse on the family that would make them destitute for seven generations. Alanguilan would later use this legend as the basis for his story ''San Dig 1944'' in the ''Siglo: Freedom'' anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerry.alanguilan.com/archives/3505|title=100 Araw ng Komiks: Siglo Freedom|access-date=2012-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011243/http://gerry.alanguilan.com/archives/3505|archive-date=2012-04-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Alanguilan owned a chicken named Solano, who would later become the inspiration for Alanguilan's graphic novel [[Elmer (comics)|Elmer]].

== Career ==
As a young man, Alanguilan studied to become an architect, but decided to turn his hobby of comic book illustration into a career in order to be with his then-girlfriend. At first, much of Alanguilan's work in comic was on conventional American [[superhero]] titles. His first self-written comic was ''[[Wasted (comics)|Wasted]]''. Alanguilan at first intended the comic to be for himself and his friends to read, and was embarrassed by the large amounts of violence and profanity in the title. Eventually Alanguilan allowed Wasted to be published in the Philippines, and from there its popularity spread to the United States and put Alanguilan on the [[independent comics]] map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerry.alanguilan.com/archives/3426|title=100 Araw ng Komiks: WASTED, The Comic Book That Saved My Life|access-date=2011-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910013141/http://gerry.alanguilan.com/archives/3426|archive-date=2011-09-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Wasted'', Alanguilan created several other titles which were published in several Filipino publications, such as ''Johnny Balbona'', ''Humanis Rex!'', ''[[Elmer (comics)|ELMER]]'', ''Timawa'' and ''Where Bold Stars go to Die''. He also contributed to anthologies like ''Siglo: Freedom'', ''Siglo: Passion'' and ''Filipino Komiks'', all published in the [[Philippines]]. His self-created titles have also attracted a fanbase all over the world, including comic creators [[Neil Gaiman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alanguilan.com/komikero/reviews02.html|title=Neil Gaiman Review|access-date=2011-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927233420/http://alanguilan.com/komikero/reviews02.html|archive-date=2011-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Warren Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alanguilan.com/komikero/reviews03.html|title=WASTED REVIEW - From the Desk Of Warren Ellis|access-date=2011-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927233556/http://alanguilan.com/komikero/reviews03.html|archive-date=2011-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], he is known as an inker for such titles like ''[[Wetworks]]'', ''[[X-Men]]'', ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'', ''[[High Roads (comic book)|High Roads]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Silent Dragon]]''. He has also worked alongside fellow Filipino comic book creators [[Leinil Francis Yu]] and [[Whilce Portacio]].

Many of Alanguilan's graphic novels incorporate elements of social commentary, especially ''Elmer'', which satirizes racism.

In 2007, Alanguilan created an autobiographical slice-of-life [[webcomic]] called ''Crest Hut Butt Shop'', based on an earlier minicomic of the same name. However, the webcomic has not been updated since September 12, 2007. Alanguilan played the antagonist, a human trafficker, in ''Tin-Tin 15'', a short film created to increase awareness of child trafficking in the Philippines. The protagonist of [[Whilce Portacio]] and [[Brian Haberlin]]'s comic series ''Stone'', Gerry Alan, is named for Alanguilan.

After a long sabbatical from mainstream comics, Alanguilan, partnered again with Leinil Yu in 2012 to help [[Mark Millar]] bring ''[[Supercrooks]]'' to success.

== Viral video fame ==
His comedic short film ''Hey Baby'', which consists mainly of him making lecherous facial expressions at his webcam, has given him a sizable following on [[YouTube]], and was featured on the January 25th, 2011 episode of American television show [[Tosh.0]]. In October 2010, Gerry was voted "The Greatest Man On The Internet" by [[Ray William Johnson]]. Gerry's creepy smiling face was also a popular meme in Indonesia, known as ''Ayo sini sama om'' (literally means "come here to uncle"), and is usually used for comedic effect combined with other memes

'''Gysbert Japiks''' or '''Japicx''' or '''Japix''' (1603&amp;ndash;1666) was a [[West Frisians|West Frisian]] writer, poet, [[schoolmaster]], and [[Cantus|cantor]].

==Life==
Japiks was born in [[Bolsward]], Friesland.  He admired the [[Latin]] poets [[Horace]] and [[Ovid]], but was also an enthusiast for his own [[Middle Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''memmetaal'', or [[mother tongue]]. His work was the most notable in that language of his day and had the effect of elevating Frisian to literary status.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Jellema, ''Country fair: poems from Friesland since 1945 in Frisian and English'' (Eerdmans, 1985), pp. xiv–xv&lt;/ref&gt; The poems of Japiks were published in ''Friessche Tjerne'' (1640) and also posthumously in ''Fryske Rijmlerye'' (1668).&lt;ref&gt;Horst Haider Munske, Nils Århammar, Volker F. Faltings, ''Handbuch des Friesischen / Handbook of Frisian Studies'' (2001), p. 710&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
Japiks's Frisian songs were [[contrafacta]] to well-known tunes by composers such as [[Goudimel]], [[Louis Bourgeois (composer)|Bourgeois]], and [[Pierre Guédron]]. A selection from them was recorded by Frisian singers and [[Camerata Trajectina]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''Gysbert Japix (1603-1666)'', Frisian soloists: Tetsje van der Kooi, soprano; Femke de Boer, alto; Jaap Hoekstra, tenor; Siebren Kramer, baritone; Rozemarijn Palma, song; GLO 6055&lt;/ref&gt;

Poles adopted the [[Latin alphabet]] in the 12th century. This alphabet, however, was ill-equipped to deal with [[Polish phonology]], particularly the [[palatal consonant]]s (now written as [[ś]], [[ź]], [[ć]], [[Dź (digraph)|dź]]), the [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] group (now [[Sz (digraph)|sz]], [[ż]], and [[Cz (digraph)|cz]]) as well as the nasal vowels (now written as [[ą]], [[ę]]). Consequently, Polish spelling in the [[Middle Ages]] was highly inconsistent as writers struggled to adapt the Latin alphabet to the needs of the Polish language. There was no unified system; different writers came up with different systems before the modern [[Polish orthography]] was firmly established. 

In the earliest documents the letter c could signify '''c, cz''', or '''k''' while the letter z was used for '''ś, z, ź,''' and '''ż'''. Writers soon began to experiment with [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (combinations of letters), new letters (φ and ſ), and eventually [[diacritic]]s. 

Some examples from the [[Bull of Gniezno]] (1136) and the [[Holy Cross Sermons]] (13th-14th centuries):

==Subsequent reforms==

Many orthography reforms happened in the end of the 18th century (under the auspices of [[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]] ([[Onufry Kopczyński]]) and during the course of the 19th century, when the modern Polish language developed differently in the three parts created after the [[Partition of Poland]].

A major reform of Polish orthography happened in 1936, as decided by [[Polska Akademia Umiejętności]]. Lesser changes happened after 1956.

'''Immersia''' is a privately held software development company co-founded by [[Guy Bar-ner]], [[Karen Shlimovich]] and [[Paul Kuklis]] in 2013. Its headquarters are located in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel.

== History ==
Immersia was co-founded in 2013 by entrepreneurs [[Guy Bar-ner]], [[Karen Shlimovich]] and [[Paul Kuklis]]. Bar-ner and Shlimovich met at a French language course in a class which consisted of 30 students. After learning how to conjugate different verbs and after having to memorize table after table, for upcoming tests, the two became disillusioned with the fact that they still could not, in their words, "order 'La Soupe' at the [[Brasserie]]".&lt;ref name="immersia-heb"&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=http://www.immersia.org/#!hebrew/c1me8|title=לימוד צרפתית בבר עם אימרסיה}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The team, which consisted of an [[SAT]] teacher, an English teacher and a linguist, came to the conclusion that they were tired of memorizing words. They wanted to engage in conversation and simulate real-life situations as though they were on a trip to Paris and as hard-core gamers their solution was simple. Within a few weeks they released their first French language-learning game and soon to follow were games for learning Spanish, German, Chinese and Japanese.&lt;ref name="immersia-heb" /&gt;

== Products ==
Immersia's initial [[self-titled]] series of online [[language-learning]] games is set within the animated backdrop of a bar. Different types of characters occupy the bar among which are an elderly bartender, an attractive blue-eyed woman and a couple situated at one of the tables. The object of the game is to engage in conversation with the various characters either via the built-in [[speech recognition]] technology or by typing words using a [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]]&lt;ref name="geektime" /&gt; and thus progress through the game by scoring points and ultimately improving language skills. This method of [[language learning]] is known as [[language immersion]].

According to Immersia's [[Linkedin]] page, their motto is: "Studies show that classrooms aren't as fun as bars. Learn a language at a bar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/immersia|title=Immersia: Overview|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Immersia launched their first [[Android app]] entitled ''Spanish Injection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.immersia.inj.spanish.gplay|title=Spanish Injection|publisher=[[Google Play Store]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khwe''' (also rendered ''Kxoe, Khoe''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔɪ}}) is a [[dialect continuum]] of the [[Khoe languages|Khoe]] family of [[Namibia]], [[Angola]], [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]], and parts of [[Zambia]], with some 8,000 speakers.&lt;ref name=Brenzinger/&gt;

== Classification ==
Khwe is a member of the [[Khoe languages|Khoe]] language family.

The 2000 meeting of the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in South Africa (WIMSA) produced the Penduka Declaration on the Standardisation of Ju and Khoe Languages,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Penduka Declaration on the Standardisation of Ju and Khoe Languages|last = Working Group of Indigenous Minorities of Southern Africa (WIMSA)|first = |date = 20 April 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = |location = Windhoek, Nambia|publisher = Penduka Training Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recommends Khwe be classified as part of the Central Khoe-San family, a cluster language comprising Khwe, ||Ani and Buga.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://lexikos.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/134/75|title = The Role of Dictionaries in the Documentation and Codification of African Languages: The Case of Khoisan|last = Chebanne|first = Andy|date = 19 July 2010|journal = Lexikos|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society (CASAS)|volume = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Khwe'' is the preferred spelling as recommended by the Penduka Declaration,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the language is also referred to as ''Kxoe'', ''Khoe-dam'' and ''Khwedam''. ''Barakwena, Barakwengo'' and ''Mbarakwena'' refer to speakers of the language and are considered pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The International Encyclopedia of Linguistics|last = |first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = 363|editor-last = Bright|editor-first = William|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names and spellings of ǁAni include ''ǀAnda, Gǀanda, Handá, Gani, Tanne,'' and ''Tsʼéxa'' with various combinations of ''-kwe/khwe/khoe'' and ''-dam.''

==History==
The Khwe-speaking population has resided around the “bush” in areas of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] for several thousand years.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Brenzinger, M (No Date). The Vanishing of Nonconformist Concepts.&lt;/ref&gt; Testimonies from living Khwe speakers note that their ancestors have come from the [[Tsodilo|Tsodilo Hills]], in the [[Okavango Delta]], where they primarily used [[hunter-gatherer]] techniques for subsistence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These testimonies also indicate that living Khwe speakers feel as though they are land-less, and feel as though the governments of Botswana and Namibia have taken their land and rights to it.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Until the 1970s, the Khwe speaking population lived in areas that were inaccessible to most Westerners in remote parts of Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Botswana, and South Africa.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Since then, livelihoods have shifted from primarily from hunter-gatherer to more Westernized practices.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Chumbo, Sefako, and Kotsi Mmabo. Xom Kyakyare Khwe: Am Kuri Kx'ûî = The Khwe of the Okavango Panhandle: The past Life. Shakawe: Teemacane Trust, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking education that Khwe speakers received was in 1970 at a settlement in Mùtc’iku, a settlement proximate the Okavango River.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Some argue that this put the language in a state of decline, as younger populations learned Bantu languages, such as [[Tswana language|Tswana]]. Khwe is learned locally as a second language in Namibia, but the language is being lost in Botswana as speakers shift to Tswana.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is also argued that this has led to a semantic broadening in meaning of words in the Khwe language. For example, “to write”, ''//gàràá'', was formerly used to describe an “activity the community members perform during healing ceremonies”.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The semantic broadening of word meanings has also permeated other parts of Khwe-speaking culture, such as food, animals, and other forms of naming that some argue have introduced nonconformity. Noting this, the original meanings of these words is still understood and used during Khwe cultural practices.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

While Khwe-speakers were in minimal contact with the outsiders until 1970, there was limited interaction between the Khwe and [[Missionary|missionaries]] in early and mid-twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The missionaries, for the most part, failed to convert the Khwe-speaking population.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The introduction to missionaries, however, introduced [[Western culture]] and languages, in addition to Bantu languages.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Despite the influence of Bantu languages in Khwe speakers education, historically, Khwe, and other [[Khoisan languages]], have had linguistic influences on Bantu languages, historically.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Gunnink, H., Sands, B., Pakendorf, B., &amp; Bostoen, K. (2015). Prehistoric language contact in the Kavango-Zambezi transfrontier area: Khoisan influence on southwestern Bantu languages. ''Journal of African Languages and Linguistics,'' ''36''(2). doi:10.1515/jall-2015-0009&lt;/ref&gt; The Bantu language speakers of the Okavango and [[Zambezi]] regions migrated to the area during the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu Migration]], and came in contact with the native Khoe speakers in the area.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Through this initial contact, Bantu languages such as [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], amongst others, adapted the clicks of the Khoe languages and integrated them into their [[phonology]], in a reduced manner through paralexification.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some scholars argue that the “contact-induced” changes in Bantu languages have contributed to [[language shift]] away from Khoe languages, such as Khwe, to Bantu languages because of the increased familiarity in phonology.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Distribution ==
The Khoe mainly occupy the Okavango Delta of Botswana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Specifically, Khwe speakers primarily live in the western [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi]] area in Namibia, however, the entirety of the Khoe population occupies a much larger geography. Khwe speakers in the western Caprivi are somewhat distant, [[Lexicon|lexically]], from other similar Khoe languages, such as [[Damara people|Damara]]. According to a [[dialect]] survey conducted by the [[University of Namibia]]’s Department of African Languages, it was revealed that proto-Damara most likely migrated through the western Caprivi area before the Khwe settled the area, as there is little lexical overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Haacke, W. (2008, December). Linguistic hypotheses on the origin of Namibian Khoekhoe speakers.''Southern African Humanities,'' ''20'', 163-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khwe speakers’ distribution in the greater Kavango-Zambezi region influenced [[Click consonant|clicks]] in Khoisan languages, some argue.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The Khwe, and other Khoe language speaking peoples, resided in greater Southern Africa, prior to the great Bantu Migration, which occurred about 5,000 years ago. In this migration, the Bantu speaking population of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]], around the [[Nigeria]]-[[Cameroon]] borderlands, migrated to [[Southern Africa]], and in this process, encountered the native Khwe population.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While the Khwe migrated into the Caprivi and greater Kavango-Zambezi region after the Damara, they were certainly there 5,000 years ago when Bantu speakers migrated to the area, and through their linguistic and cultural exchanges, both languages were fundamentally altered.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and phonology sections on this page further discuss the changes occurred, and how it has influenced contemporary Khwe.

Today, there is an estimated 3700 Khwe speakers live in Namibia, with the vast majority residing in the western region of the [[Zambezi Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Moving to Survive: Kxoe Communities in Arid Lands|last = Brenzinger|first = Matthias|publisher = Institut für Afrikanistik|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Universität zu Köln|pages = 321–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest known Khwe settlements are Mutc'iku, located adjacent to the [[Okavango River]], and Gudigoa in Botswana.&lt;ref name="Brenzinger" /&gt;

Noting this, there have been major [[forced migration]]s from government pressures that have influenced the contemporary distribution of Khwe speakers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 1990, 4000 Xhu and Khwe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Indigenous Peoples' Rights in Southern Africa|last = Hitchcock|first = Robert K.|publisher = International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|year = 2004|isbn = 8791563089|location = Copenhagen, Denmark|pages = 29–32|last2 = Vindig|first2 = Diana}}&lt;/ref&gt; including former members of the [[31 Battalion (SWATF)]] who fought under the [[South African Defence Force]] in the [[Namibian War of Independence|Namibian War]], were settled in a tent town in [[Schmidtsdrift]], South Africa. In 2003, the majority of this community relocated to Platfontein, outside [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], following the Schmidtsdrift Community Land Claim.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Schmidtsdrift Community Land Claim|url = http://www.plaas.org.za/sites/default/files/publications-pdf/RR34.pdf|website = www.plaas.org.za|accessdate = 4 October 2015|last = Kleinbooi|first = Karin|publisher = Programme for Land and Agrarian Studies, School of Government, University of the Western Cap|date = August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Khwe has 70 phonemic [[consonant]]s, including 35 [[Click consonant|clicks]], as well as 25 vowel phonemes, including diphthongs and nasalised vowels. Khwe's tone system has been analysed as containing 9 syllabic tones (3 register and 6 contour),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The development of sound systems in human language|last = Köhler,|first = K.|date = 1998|journal = Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and Cognitive Bases|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |editor-last = Hurford|editor-first = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although more recent proposed analyses identify only 3 lexical tones, high, mid and low, with the [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] as the basic unit of phonological structure.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A grammar of modern Khwe|last = Kilian-Hatz|first = Christa|publisher = Rüdiger Köppe|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Cologne|pages = |work = Quellen zur Khoisanforschung 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tone sandhi processes are common in Khwe and related languages.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Perception and Cognition in Language and Culture|last = Storch|first = Ann|publisher = Brill|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Leiden|pages = |first2 = Alexandra|last2 = Aikhenvald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khoe click inventories generally combine four anterior constrictions types with nine to eleven anterior constrictions. The exact size of the click inventory in Khwe is unclear. Köhler established an inventory of 36 click phonemes, from combinations of four influxes and nine effluxes, as well as a borrowed [[voiced alveolar click]], ⟨ǃ̬⟩. Kilian-Hatz identifies only 32 phonemic segments, due to gaps in the alveolar click type series, with Khwe being the only language to have a pre-nasalized voiced click.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Khwe dictionary with a supplement on Khwe place names of West Caprivi|last = Kilian-Hatz|first = Christa|publisher = Rüdiger Köppe Verlag|year = 2003|isbn = 3-89645-083-2|location = Cologne|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clicks occur exclusively in initial position on grammatical morphemes and lexical roots.

== Morphology ==
Khwe is a suffixing language, and thus has a rich inventory of head-marking suffixes on nouns and verbs. Verbs take [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense-aspect-mood suffixes]] (TAMs), marking for [[causative]], [[Applicative voice|applicative]], [[Comitative case|comitative]], [[Locative case|locative]], [[Passive voice|passive]], [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Linguistic Geography of Africa|last = Heine|first = Bernd|publisher = A. Cambridge University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 9781281156112|location = |pages = |first2 = Derek|last2 = Nurse|series = Cambridge Approaches to Language Contact}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns are marked with person-gender-number suffixes (PGNs). Gender division in Khwe is based on sex, and is expressed by PGNs, with gender being marked even in first-person dual and plural.

Negation in Khwe is indicated with the clause-final negative particle ''vé,'' which can be used to indicate non-occurrence of an event, non-equation between entities, and the non-possession of an entity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The post-verbal particle ''tí'' can also be used, although its application is limited to prohibitive functions, such as negative [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and the negative [[hortative]] and [[Jussive mood|jussive]] constructions, in which ''vé'' can also be used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Syntax ==
Generally, Khoisan languages have an SV constituent order. Central Khoisan languages have a dominant AOV [[constituent order]], including Khwe, though AOV and OAV order is used more frequently in casual conversation and storytelling.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Coding Participant Marking: Construction Types in Twelve African Languages|last = Killian-Hatz|first = Christa|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = |editor-last = Dimmendaal|editor-first = Gerrit Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khwe lacks a separate class of [[adjective]]s. [[Pronoun]]s, [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s, especially state verbs, can be used attributively. Khwe has a [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]]-[[Head (linguistics)|head]] order,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in which manner adverbs precede the verb, and adjectives and possessors attributes precede the noun.

In Khwe, subjects of [[intransitive verb]]s, subjects and direct objects of transitive verbs, and one of the objects of ditransitive verbs are commonly omitted when the participants are known to the speakers through inner- or extra-linguistic context.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Serial Verb Constructions: A Cross-Linguistic Typology|last = Aikenvald|first = Alexandra|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 108–110|last2 = Dixon|first2 = R.M.W.|series = Explorations in Linguistic Typology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khwe has two multiverbal constructions that may denote a series of closely connected events: serial verb constructions (SVC) and converb constructions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An SVC expresses a complex event composed by two or more single events that happen at the same time, and a converb construction marks the immediate succession of two or more events.

SVCs in Khwe consist of two or more verbs forming a single intonation unit, with only the last verb being marked for TAM. The preceding verbs obligatorily take the active voice suffix. Converb constructions may consist of two or more verbs, only one of which takes the TAM marking.

== Vocabulary ==
In opposition to the postulated [[linguistic universal]] regarding the primacy of the visual domain in the hierarchy of the verbs of perception,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The verbs of perception: a typological study|last = Viberg|first = Ake|publisher = de Gruyter|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Berlin/New York|pages = 1294–1309|work = Language Typology and Language Universals: An International Handbook|editor-last = Haspelmath|editor-first = M. et. al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khwe's most widely applied verb of perception is ''ǁám̀'', 'taste, smell, touch'.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Khwe has three verbs of perception, the other two being ''mṹũ'' 'see', and ''kóḿ'' 'hear', but ''ǁám̀'', which is semantically rooted in oral perception, is used to convey holistic modes of sensory perception.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Khwe term ''x|óa'' functions both as a verb 'to be little, few, some' and as an alternative way of expressing the quantity 'three'. This term is unique in its ambiguity among numeral terms used by African hunter-gatherer subsistence communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On numeral complexity in hunter-gatherer languages|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/lity.2012.16.issue-1/lity-2012-0002/lity-2012-0002.xml|journal = Linguistic Typology|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1515/lity-2012-0002|first = Patience|last = Epps|first2 = Claire|last2 = Bowern|first3 = Cynthia A.|last3 = Hansen|first4 = Jane H.|last4 = Hill|first5 = Jason|last5 = Zentz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khwe has a large number of loan words from [[Afrikaans]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Orthography ==
In 1957, Oswin Köhler, founder of the Institut für Afrikanistik at the [[University of Cologne]], designed an orthography of Khwe in which he published three volumes of texts and grammatical sketches, based on observations of language and culture made over 30 years of visits to Namibia.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Linguistic research for literary empowerment of Khoesaan languages of Namibia|last = Haacke|first = W.G.|date = 2006|journal = African Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|volume = 64|series = |issue = 2|pages = 157–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Köhler's orthography was designed for academic purposes, his volumes were published in German or French, and therefore inaccessible to the Khwe themselves. Köhler never made an attempt to teach literacy to members of the community.

Attempts to teach the Khwe orthography to first language speakers were not made until 1996, bÿ scholars of the Institut who took up Köhler's work. At the request and with the consultation of the Khwe, the orthography was revised and simplified by Matthias Brenzinger and Mathias Schladt between 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Multipurpose Orthography for Kxoe: Development and Challenges|last = Schladt|first = Mathias|publisher = Basarwa Language Project|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 125–139|editor-first = H.M.|editor-last = Batibo|editor-last2 = Tsonope|editor-first2 = J.|work = The State of Khoesaan Languages in Botswana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of Khwe folktales was published in 1999 by Christa Kilian-Hatz and David Naude, using the revised orthography along with interlinear and free translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Folktales of the Kxoe in the West Caprivi|last = Kilian-Hatz|first = Christa|journal = Namibian African Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 5|publication-place = Cologne|publisher = Rüdiger Köppe|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilian-Hatz also published a dictionary of Khwe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Khwe Dictionary (with a Supplement on Khwe Place-names of West Caprivi by Matthias Brenzinger)|last = Kilian-Hatz|first = Christa|publisher = Rüdiger Köppe Verlag|year = 2003|isbn = 3-89645-083-2|location = Cologne|pages = |series = Namibian African Studies 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' although this is written in the linguistic orthography which uses symbols from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] in place of the [[Latin script]] use for the applied orthography.

The revised orthography has not been granted official status in Namibia. The Khwe language is not taught as a subject or used as a language of instruction in formal education, and few literacy materials exist.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Krushna Chandra Kar''' (1907&amp;ndash;1995) was an [[India]]n [[poet]] and [[literary critic]] who has written both in the [[Odia language|Odia]] and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Education, Culture and Children's Literature: v. 4. Children's literature and education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfLATnA1IAMC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2009|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-8450-151-3|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has authored books on Odia literature and inspired other writers like Bidyut Prabha Devi and [[Chakhi Khuntia]]. He received a feliciation from the Odisha Sahitya Academy for his contribution to Odia literature in the year 1971 to 1972. He spent most of his life in [[Cuttack]], [[Odisha]].

His better known Odia books include the "Ramayana" and "Shakuntala". He also authored collections of poetry, including "[[Rutu Samhara]]" and "[[Hansa Dutam]]".

He was arguably best known for [[children literature|children's literature]] and wrote "[[Pari Raija]]", "[[Kuhuka Raija]]", "[[Panchatantra]]", and "[[Adi Jugara Galpa Mala]]", among other works.
He wrote biographies of a number of historical personalities such as "[[Kapila Deva]]"

One of his famous English books was "The Maharaja : As I Knew Him".

==Awards==
He received the Odisha Sahitya Academy Feliciation, 1971-72&lt;ref&gt;http://odishasahityaakademi.org/ovation1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuwaiti''' (in Kuwaiti '''كويتي''', /{{ipa|kwe:ti}}/) is a [[Gulf Arabic]] [[dialect]] spoken in [[Kuwait]]. Kuwaiti Arabic shares many phonetic features unique to Gulf dialects. Due to Kuwait's soap opera industry, Kuwaiti Arabic spread throughout the Arabic-speaking world and became familiar even to people in countries such as Tunisia and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Mansfield |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Some+Kuwaiti+soap+operas+have+become+extremely+popular+and%2C+although+they+are+usually+performed+in+the+Kuwaiti+dialect%2C+they+have+been+shown+with+success+as+far+away+as+Tunisia.&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;gws_rd=ssl|title=Kuwait: vanguard of the Gulf |publisher=Hutchinson |date=1990 |page=113 |quote=Some Kuwaiti soap operas have become extremely popular and, although they are usually performed in the Kuwaiti dialect, they have been shown with success as far away as Tunisia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.kw/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;pg=PA286|title=Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Development ==
Since Kuwait was a nation of immigrants with no native population, Kuwait has a different sociolinguists structure. Three groups make up the Kuwaiti population: the first being the descendant of Arab tribes, while the second are people originally from [[Al-Hasa]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Iraq]], and the third are people originally from [[Persia]] (modern-day [[Iran]]), known in Kuwait by the name [[Ayam (people)|Ayam]]{{ref|a}}.

Kuwaiti Arabic is rapidly changing due to many factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= AlBader |first= Yousef |date= April 2015 |title= Semantic Innovation and Change in Kuwaiti Arabic: A Study of the Polysemy of Verbs |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 1.1 Purpose|publisher= Cardiff University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/9696/1/Semantic%20Innovation%20and%20Change%20in%20Kuwaiti%20Arabic.pdf |access-date= 24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{empty section|date=October 2016}}

=== Emphatics ===

/b/, /f/, /l/, /m/, /n/ and /r/ become the emphatics ḅ, f, ḷ, ṃ, ṇ, and ṛ only when
they are in the contiguity of an emphatic, a back vowel, or if they precede /a:/.

== Varieties ==
Kuwaiti is divided into two varieties: Urban (Sedentary) and Nomadic or Bedouin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Mahsain |first= Fatima |date= April 2007 |title= Motivations Behind Code-switching Among Kuwaiti Bilingual Schools‟ Students |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 1.2.4.1 Language |publisher=  University of Manchester |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf |access-date= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is believed to have developed due to exposure to the outside world, as well as Kuwait being a country of multi-regional immigrants during its infancy. The Urban dialect is seen as more prestigious than the Bedouin one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Dashti |first= Abdulmuhsin |date= 1997 |title= Language choice in the state of Kuwait : a sociolinguistic investigation. |type=Ph.D. |page= 41 |publisher=  |docket= |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urban dialect is divided into four sub-dialects, while the Bedouin is divided into two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203 |title=خالد الرشيد: "اللهجة الكويتية" "مظلومة" في مدارسنا.. لأن أغلب معلمينا وافدون |date=2015-01-20 |access-date=2016-10-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120084008/http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203 |archivedate=2015-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four sedent dialects are:
* Sharq: Mainly used by [[Ayam (people)|Ayam]] people, who settled the district. It is a result of a mixture of the various different dialects spoken in Kuwait in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Taqi|first=Hanan|year=2010|title=Two ethnicities, three generations: Phonological variation and change in Kuwait|type=PhD|publisher=Newcastle University|url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf}} p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Sharg, Kuwait City|Sharg]])&lt;ref&gt;http://alwatan.kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?id=218774&amp;yearquarter=20123&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jibla (See also [[Jibla, Kuwait City|Jibla]])
* Failicha (See also [[Failicha Island, Kuwait]])
* Fintaas (See also [[Fintas, Kuwait|Fintaas, Kuwait]])
While the two Bedouin varieties are:
* Jahra (See also [[Jahra, Kuwait]])
* Dimna: Used mainly by the descendents of Al-Azmy tribe. ad-Dimna is the old name of [[Salmiya City, Kuwait]]

Historians and researchers usually demonstrate differences between the dialects using the Kuwaiti word for Sugar, which has three different pronunciation. It is pronounced Shikar (/ʃɪkɐr/) in Sharg dialect, Shakar (/ʃɐkɐr/) in Fintaas dialect, and Shakir (/ʃɐkɪr/) in Jibla dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203 |title=خالد الرشيد: "اللهجة الكويتية" "مظلومة" في مدارسنا.. لأن أغلب معلمينا وافدون |date=2015-01-20 |access-date=2016-10-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120084008/http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203 |archivedate=2015-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kuwaitmag.com/index.jsp?inc=5&amp;id=1031&amp;pid=219&amp;version=9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lahjah.com/web/pages/properties.php|title=:: Lahjah :: لـهجـة  ::|website=www.lahjah.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==
Dashti identifies four varieties of Arabic in Kuwait. [[Classical Arabic]] (CA), the language of the Quran, the liturgical language of [[Islam]], the religion of the vast majority of Kuwaitis, and old Arabic literature, [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), which is the medium of formal communication and school education. This variety is considered the second language of Kuwaitis as they are only introduced to when they start school. Kuwaiti Arabic (KA), the language of everyday's life and the symbol of the Kuwaiti identity. It is a symbol of prestige in the Kuwaiti society. The last variety is Educated Standard Arabic (ESA), in which the speaker mixes between MSA and KA. This language is used in Radio, TV, and academics' informal discussions. Kuwait is [[diglossia|diglossic]], like the rest of the Arab world, with the Arabic language being seen us the high variety, while Kuwaiti is seen more like a patois or a low-variety colloquial dialect of Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Akbar |first= Rahima |date= April 2007 |title= Students' and Teachers' attitudes towards Kuwaiti/English code-switching |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 1.3 The Sociolinguistic Situation in Kuwait |publisher= Cardiff University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf |access-date= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Mahsain |first= Fatima |date= April 2007 |title= Motivations Behind Code-switching Among Kuwaiti Bilingual Schools‟ Students |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 1.2.4.2 Literacy |publisher=  University of Manchester |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf |access-date= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuwaiti is the "normal" way of speaking in everyday's life and is acquired naturally at home and not taught at schools (as it is considered a mere dialect of the Arabic language by the public).

After conducting several interviews with speakers of Kuwaiti, Akbar states that for many, speaking Kuwaiti is the most important criterion of being considered Kuwaiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Akbar |first= Rahima |date= April 2007 |title= Students' and Teachers' attitudes towards Kuwaiti/English code-switching |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 2.2.2 Language as a Symbol of Group Identity |publisher= Cardiff University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf |access-date= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and characteristics ==
Kuwaiti Arabic is a variant of [[Gulf Arabic]], sharing similarities with the dialects of neighboring coastal areas in Eastern Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203 |title=خالد الرشيد: "اللهجة الكويتية" "مظلومة" في مدارسنا.. لأن أغلب معلمينا وافدون |date=2015-01-20 |access-date=2016-10-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120084008/http://kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?Id=161203 |archivedate=2015-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to immigration during its early history as well as trade, Kuwaiti was influenced by many languages such as Persian, English, Italian, Urdu, Turkish, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Mahsain |first= Fatima |date= April 2007 |title= Motivations Behind Code-switching Among Kuwaiti Bilingual Schools‟ Students |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 1.2.4.1 Language |publisher=  University of Manchester |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf |access-date= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic in Kuwait is the use of words and phrases by women exclusively, for example "يَا حَافِظ", roughly translated to "Oh Saver [God]", is rarely or never used by men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lahjah.com/web/pages/properties.php Lahjah Kuwaiti-Arabic dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It's also different than a lot of Arabic variants in the way that phonological [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] occurs to a multitude of words, but not to all of them. The only case of full assimilation is /dˤ/ changing to /ðˤ/ in all words.

== Differences between Arabic and Kuwaiti ==
{{See also|Arabic#Koine}}
Standard Arabic is a dead language; meaning it is not spoken natively by people anymore. Each variety of Arabic has evolved and developed over time. Some of the differences between the formal Arabic and Kuwaiti are:
* Kuwaiti uses [[Subject-Verb-Object|SVO]] almost always (unless the subject is omitted because of the verb's conjugation), while Modern Standard Arabic uses [[Verb-Subject-Object|VSO]] most of the time.
* [[Copula (linguistics)|Copula]]s are used in Kuwaiti, unlike Arabic. Below is a table of copulas used in Kuwaitis:
''Note:'' Copulas are used before verbs only, not adjectives. For example: I am drinking, not I &lt;s&gt;am&lt;/s&gt; drunk.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb !! In Kuwaiti !! Transliteration
|-
| am, is || قَعَ/قَامْ/قَاعِدْ/قَاعْ/قَعْدْ || /gɐʕ/, /gam/, /gaʕɪd/, /gaʕ/, /gɐʕd/
|-
| are || قَعَ/قَامْ/قَاعْدِينْ/قَاعْ/قَعْدْ || /gɐʕ/, /gam/, /gaʕdin/, /gaʕ/, /gɐʕd/
|}
The past tenses are formed by adding كَانْ /kaan/ before each copula.
* Almost all of [[ʾIʿrab|Arabic declensions]] are omitted in Kuwaiti.
* [[Dual (grammatical number)|Dual grammatical person]] is not used, though dual nouns are still used.
* Feminine forms in plural second and third person are not used.
* The definite article, al- (/al/), became el- (/ɪl-) in Kuwaiti.

== Lexicon ==
Kuwaiti borrowed a lot of words from different languages due to immigration and trade. Below are few examples with the corresponding Arabic words. As noticed, a lot of words come from Persian. This is due to the fact that the only original inhabitants of Kuwait were mixture of Arabs and Persians.

''Note:'' A green box indicates that the MSA word is used in Kuwaiti (most of the times interchangeably), while a red box means it's not.

=== Old-fashioned or obsolete words ===
some words were replaced by native Arabic words over time. A few examples of such words include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ألفاظ اللهجة الكويتية في كتاب – لسان العرب – لإبن منظور|last=al-Ghaneem|first=Ya'goob|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* رنق (ring), A Persian word that means colour.
* بنسل (binsil), from English ''Pencil''. 
* كنديشن (candeshin), from English Conditioner (as in Air conditioner).
* فنگر (finger), from English.&lt;ref&gt;Dashti, Abdulmuhsin (2015). "The Role and Status of the English Language in Kuwait". English Today. pp. 28-33. doi:10.1017/S026607841500022X&lt;/ref&gt;
* كرفاية (karfaya), from Hindi.
Dr. Ya'goob al-Ghaneem points at the increasing numbers of Arab expatriate and exposure to media in different Arabics as the reasons behind this change. Fatima Mahasin hypothesises that the words being replaced are not of English, French or Italian origins, and tend originate from "less-prestigious" languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Mahsain |first= Fatima |date= April 2007 |title= Motivations Behind Code-switching Among Kuwaiti Bilingual Schools‟ Students |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 1.2.4.1 Language |publisher=  University of Manchester |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/55661/1/U584180.pdf |access-date= 7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, police in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] linked Scott Gozenton, a self-professed Satanist, with organised child sexual abuse. His lawyer claimed 13 Satanic [[coven]]s existed in the area, holding bizarre orgies involving children, and that Gozenton had been followed and threatened by "coven" members throughout the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Humphries | title = Child Sex Abuse Linked With Satanism: Police | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 1991-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Melbourne diocese of the [[Catholic Church]] acknowledged as "substantially true" allegations that a Melbourne priest took part in Satanic ritual abuse in which a number of deaths occurred in the 1960s, and paid compensation to a surviving victim.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Hughes, Church pays victim of sex and death rituals: Priest's satanic life, Herald Sun, 26 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Coast, New South Wales===
In 1999, two journalists from the Sun-Herald claimed to have seen evidence of the ritual abuse of children. They interviewed six mothers whose children had disclosed experiences of SRA and organised abuse in New South Wales. The children's disclosures were corroborating, although they had never met one another, and they had been able to draw representations of "Satanic" ritual sites which were similar to ritual sites uncovered by police on the central coast of New South Wales. One mother stated that her sons remembered being drugged and hypnotised. "He said they dressed in black robes and had eye and mouth pieces cut out," she said. "I know they're  dangerous people. I have had warnings outside the house telling me to stop investigations. We're fearful for our lives. The boys never want me out of their sight."&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Wood and martin Chulov, Evil In The Woods, The Sun Herald, 8 August 1999, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Superior Universal Alignment, an Argentinian-based international cult, was implicated in the ritualistic murders of several children. One of the leaders of the group, Osvaldo Marcineiro, confessed to murdering a number of young children in Satanic rituals in which the children were tortured and their body parts cannibalised. A number of prominent citizens were arrested in relation to the murders, and it later emerged that they had paid the cult to conduct the murderous ceremonies. A search of cult member's houses turned up cult registers, guns, hooded cloaks, 100 videotapes of cult ceremonies and satanist publications, including a 200-page book by cult leader Valentina de Andrade called ''God, the Great Farce''. Brazilian authorities suggested that the cult was connected to Satanic groups internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Lewan, Satanic Cult Killings Spread Fear in Southern Brazil, ''The [[Associated Press]]'', 26 October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, five members of the Superior Universal Alignment cult in the Amazonian town of Altamira were convicted for the ritualistic murders of three children and the castration of two others. The victims were aged between eight and thirteen years, and they were kidnapped, tortured or killed between 1989 and 1993. Their genitals were removed and used in Satanic rituals by 75-year old village clairvoyant, Valentina de Andrade, the leader of the Superior Universal Alignment cult.&lt;ref&gt;Gamini, Gabriella, "Seer for trial in voodoo murders", ''[[The Times]]'', 9 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; De Andrade had previously been sought by police in Argentina and Uruguay prior to her arrest in Brazil on suspicion of involvement in other satanic ritual killings.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Cultic Studies Association|The Cult Observer]] (American Family Foundation), Vol. 10 No. 5, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the castration of victims, two doctors involved in the sect removed the victim's other organs for sale on the international black market. Other people sentenced in relation to the murders included a former police officer, a businessman and the son of an influential landowner. The charges related to the murders of three young children and the attempted murder of another, however, victim's families say that there were at least nineteen other murdered children. The cult is based in Argentina and has branches in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor gets 56 years for Brazil sect killings, 11 September 2003, [[Reuters]] News and Five&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 a group of parents published allegations in a conservative magazine that their children had witnessed SRA and had been ritually abused from May, 1987 until October 1988 in [[Oude Pekela]], a city in the north-eastern province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[the Netherlands]].  During the initial investigation, only the non-ritual aspects were reported in the press and investigated by the authorities and the allegations were unconfirmed.  In 1989 the [[Conservatism|conservative]] Christian news program ''Tijdsein'' reported allegations that included Satanic ritual abuse, to which there was no official response.  After attending a conference in which the concept of satanic ritual abuse was discussed, Oude Pekela [[general practitioner]]s Fred Jonker and Ietje Jonker-Bakker alleged that several children had been abused by unknown men in the context of Satanic rituals.

No evidence was found of Satanic apparatus, and charges were dismissed when a court ruled the allegations were untrue. The children who were removed from their homes sued the city council in 2006 for compensation and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul |last=Lewis |authorlink= |title= 'Satanic abuse' case families sue council for negligence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1684205,00.html |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-01-12 |accessdate = 2007-10-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orkney===
{{Main|South Ronaldsay child abuse scandal}}
In 1990-1991 nine children suspected of being sexually abused by their families and an alleged child abuse ring were removed by social services in [[Orkney]]. The abuse was also alleged to involve "ritualistic elements".&lt;ref name = Orkney&gt;{{cite news | title = Orkney abuse scandal victim to sue for lost youth | last = Thompson | first = Tanya | publisher = [[The Scotsman]] | date=  2006-09-11 | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=860&amp;id=1338842006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parents approached the media and made the case national and international news. In April 1991, a [[Sheriff Principal|sheriff]] ruled that the evidence was seriously flawed and the children were returned home.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

In June, social services appealed the sheriff's ruling&lt;ref name="BBC April 4"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = 1991: Orkney 'abuse' children go home | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = BBC News "On This Day" | date = 1991-04-04| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/4/newsid_2521000/2521067.stm | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the appeal was overturned and an official inquiry was established in August 1991, which after 9 months' investigation at a cost of £6 million, published its report in October 1992. It described the dismissal of the first judgment as "most unfortunate" and criticized all those involved, including the social workers, the police, and the Orkney Islands Council. Social workers' training, methods, and judgment were given special condemnation, and the report stated that the concept of "ritual abuse" was "not only unwarrantable at present but may affect the objectivity of practitioners and parents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = Gillian | authorlink = | title = Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 2005 | location = | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mp91ArpXcH0C&amp;pg=PA287 287] | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-57806-789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lord Clyde | year = 1992 | title = The Report of the Inquiry into the Removal of Children from Orkney in February 1991 | location = Edinburgh | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] | pages = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 government report based on three years of research found that there was no foundation to any of the Satanic abuse claims.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

===Broxtowe===
In October 1987 children were removed from their families in Nottingham, and in February 1989 a [[Broxtowe, Nottingham|Broxtowe]] family was charged with multigenerational child sexual abuse and neglect. A 600-page report on the incident concluded that there was no evidence of the SRA claims made by children or corroborating adults. Though the children may have been 'sadistically terrorized', allegations of organized Satanic abuse were found to be baseless and the indicators used by the Social Services department were without validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Thorpe | first = W. |author2=Gwatkin, J.B. |author3=Glenn, W.P. |author4=Gregory, M.F. | date=  1990-06-07 | title = Revised Joint Enquiry Report | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~dlheb/jetrepor.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | publisher = Nottinghamshire Social Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lewis===
In 2003 allegations by three children in [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Scotland]] resulted in the arrest of eight people for sexual abuse occurring between 1990 and 2000.

===Kidwelly===
In March 2011, four adults who lived in a cul-de-sac in the Welsh town of [[Kidwelly]] were convicted of multiple sex offences against children and young adults. The group led by Colin Batley was described by the media as a "Satanic sex cult", a "quasi-religious sex cult" and a "paedophile cult"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-12677043|title=Kidwelly sex cult: Town unaware of 'evil paedophile'|date=9 March 2011|work=BBC News South West Wales|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Colin Batley, leader of sex cult preying on children, could spend life in jail|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/11/sex-cult-leader-colin-batley-sentenced|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the group members were not followers of [[Satanism]].   The prosecution said they practised "[[promiscuity|free sex]]" and were influenced by [[Aleister Crowley]], a practitioner of [[ceremonial magic]] who founded the belief system of [[Thelema]]. They dressed in hoods and read from Crowley's ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the central text of [[Thelema]] and some victims were made to wear [[inverted cross]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/03/09/five-found-guilty-in-sex-cult-trial-91466-28307889/ |title=Five found guilty in sex cult trial |last=Turner |first=Robin |date=9 March 2011 |work=WalesOnline |accessdate=9 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707070344/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/03/09/five-found-guilty-in-sex-cult-trial-91466-28307889/ |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the cult were initiated in a ceremony involving sex with an adult, and they were threatened with being killed if they did not take part in the ceremony.

==United States==
{{Main|Kern County child abuse cases|McMartin preschool trial|Ricky Kasso|West Memphis 3|Little Rascals Day Care Center|Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial|Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool trial|Pace memorandum}}
In the [[United States]], major allegations of Satanic ritual abuse occurred in the [[Kern County child abuse cases]], [[McMartin preschool trial]] and the [[West Memphis 3]], which garnered world-wide media coverage. It was eventually determined that no satanic abuse ever took place in these cases due to false testimony and police misconduct. There have been countless, debunked allegations of SRA in the United States; of which the most recent allegation was [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory|Pizzagate]]; a speculated pedophile ring in the Washington D.C area at supposed ping pong themed restaurant, Comet Ping Pong. In the allegations, [[Hillary Clinton]] was an avid supporter and member in the pedophilia ring, with various sources of selected evidence pointing to her possible involvement and the possible involvement of Clinton's associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/pizzagate-a-deep-dish-slice-of-fake-news-delusion/article33282231/|title=Pizzagate: A deep-dish slice of fake news delusion|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Minnesota===
The first such case occurred in [[Jordan, Minnesota]], in 1983, where several children made allegations against an unrelated man and their parents. The man confessed and then identified a number of the children’s parents as perpetrators. Ultimately twenty-four adults were charged with child abuse though only three went to trial with two [[acquittal]]s and one [[conviction]].&lt;ref name = Scalia&gt;{{cite web | url = http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-478.ZD.html | title = Supreme Court Collection at Cornell University Law School | last = Scalia | first = Antonin | authorlink = Antonin Scalia |author-link2=William J.

Albuguergue, NM  | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, the children made [[allegation]]s regarding the manufacturing of [[child pornography]], ritualistic animal sacrifice, [[Coprophagia#Humans|coprophagia]], [[urophagia]] and [[infanticide]], at which point the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was alerted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hechler, David |title=The battle and the backlash: the child sexual abuse war |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-669-14097-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No criminal charges resulted from the FBI investigation, and in his review of the case, the [[Attorney General]] noted that the initial investigation by the local police and county attorney was so poor that it had destroyed the opportunity to fully investigate the children’s allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Humphrey | first = Herbert | year = 1985 | title = Report on Scott County investigations | location = Minneapolis, MN | publisher = Minnesota Attorney General's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Antonin Scalia]] referred to the Minnesota case in his summation on a later case, and stated, "[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged," and cited the repeated, well-intentioned but coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.&lt;ref name = Scalia/&gt;  The bizarre allegations of the children, the ambiguities of the investigation and the unsuccessful prosecutions were widely covered by the media. A number of accused parents confessed to sexually abusing their children, received immunity, and underwent treatment for sexual abuse, while parental rights for six other children in the case were terminated.&lt;ref name=Faller2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Faller, K.C. | year = 2004 | title = Sexual Abuse of Children: Contested Issues and Competing Interests | journal = Criminal Justice Review | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 358 | url = http://cjr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/29/2/358  | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | doi = 10.1177/073401680402900206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mbunda''' is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of [[Angola]] and [[Zambia]]. There are several dialects: Katavola, Yauma,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bantu-languages.com/fr/zonek.html Bantu-Languages.com], citing Maniacky 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Nkangala, Mbalango, Sango, Ciyengele ("Shamuka"), and Ndundu, all of which are closely related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bantu-languages.com/fr/zonek.html Bantu-Languages.com], citing Maniacky 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Mbunda was one of six languages selected by the ''Instituto de Línguas Nacionais'' (National Languages Institute) for an initial phase to establish spelling rules in 1980&lt;ref&gt;http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/mbun1249 For additional sources&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate teaching in schools and promoting its use.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embaixadadeangola.org/cultura/linguas/set_lnac.html Resolution adopted by Council of Ministers - Official Gazette No. 3/87 of May 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasaominuto.com/cultura/303519/harmonizacao-das-linguas-bantu-dificultada-pela-fonetica-e-grafia Angola Harmonização das línguas bantu dificultada pela fonética e grafia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; upon the migration of among others, the Ciyengele,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bantu-languages.com/fr/zonek.html Bantu-Languages.com], citing Maniacky 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
The Mbunda language in Zambia Angola is not spoken exactly the same way. In Zambia it has a strong upper teeth contact with the tongue, to pronounce words like: "Mundthzindthzime" (shadow), "chithzalo" (dress), "Kuthsa" (death) and many more. The difficult sounds represented by ''TH''.&lt;ref&gt;A.W, July 1, 1917, ''A Comparative Vocabulary of Sikololo-Silui-Simbunda, African Affairs'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Mbunda language in Angola and Namibia is spoken without the ''TH'' sounds, like in the [[Luchazi language]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.zm/books?id=6IiclcXvZNkC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=ngangela+mbunda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XZwfUvPELcm3hQfh4oC4Bg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA Tusona: Luchazi Ideographs : a Graphic Tradition of West-Central Africa By Gerhard Kubik, pages 291, 292]&lt;/ref&gt; the words above are pronounced as "Mutzitzime" (shadow), "chizalo" (cloth), "Kutsa" (death). Even within Zambia, the Mbunda language spoken by the Chiyengele group that migrated earlier is different from that spoken by the Mbunda group that fled into Zambia as a consequence of the Mbunda-Portuguese war of 1914. That is why the Mbunda language of the Chiyengele group, mainly found in [[Mongu]], is nicknamed "Shamuka"{{clarify|date=May 2015}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bantu-languages.com/fr/zonek.html Bantu-Languages.com], citing Maniacky 1997&lt;/ref&gt; heavily influenced by [[Lozi language]]. The same term can be attributed to the Mbunda language in Namibia, which is heavily influenced by the [[Nyemba]] and [[Luchazi language|Luchazi]] languages.

== Names and meanings ==
Mbunda names are many; listed are the ones commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;name="google4"&lt;/ref&gt; They can be given either to a male or female, except a very few that are for females only and have been indicated here by (f). Some Mbunda names are similar to those of other nationalities which also have their roots in the Luba Kingdom, such as Kaunda, Katongo, Kavanda, Mulenga, Muvanga, Mwila, Kavunda, Kalunga, Muti, Chiinga, Kavalata, Chiti, Nkonde and others. Also similar to Mbunda names are Chipoya, Chipango, Musole, Kayata, Ngambo, Kawengo, Kapisa and Musumali, found in other ethnic groups which trace their origins to Mwantiyavwa the king of the Ruund.

A '''''money note''''' is a [[music industry]] [[slang]] term which refers to a [[musical form|part]] of a live or recorded singing [[performance]] which is subjectively judged to be very dramatic or emotionally stirring. Created from a confluence of composition or improvisational and performance quality, this is usually at a climactic point of a song or aria, in which the singer's melody makes a large interval jump to the song's highest note (especially for female [[soprano]] singers or male [[tenor]] or [[countertenor]] singers) or falls to its lowest note (especially for male [[bass (voice type)|bass]] or [[baritone]] singers). In some cases, a section or phrase of a vocal melody may captivate the listener's interest because of the tone quality of the singing-either because of the strident emotionalism, or due to the quiet sensitivity of the voice. As well, a "money note" might be an impressive vocal display or a note which is held for a long time with clear pitch and expressive vibrato.  

==In classical music==
In classical music, the term is associated with [[opera]]. In opera, the star singers often have a much higher billing than any of the other participants in the performance, including the conductor of the orchestra. Some opera roles have high notes, such as high "C" notes for sopranos, that are hard to hit in a live performance. As such, the audience enjoys going to see the performance and find out if their favorite performer will be able to sing these high notes with accurate pitch, strong projection, and a clear tone. In this sense, the high notes sung by the opera singer are the "money notes" that the audience is paying to see, and for which the opera singer commands their high salary. 

While "money notes" are often high notes, in some cases, the hard-to-hit notes are low notes sung by a mezzo-soprano or alto female singer, or low notes sung by a bass-baritone singer. Many of the well-known "money notes" written for the tenor voice are from the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 "C"s above middle C during ''[[La fille du régiment]]''.  With [[Wagner]] came an emphasis on using the tenor for vocal heft for in protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''[[Heldentenor]]'', a heroic-sounding, bold male voice that listeners find to be very dramatic. 

Achieving "money notes" poses a particular obstacle for classical musicians, as compared to pop musicians, because opera singers do not usually sing with a microphone. While both pop and classical musicians aim at producing well-sung notes with a good tone (with the respective stylistic norms appropriate to each idiom), the pop musician does not have to sing loudly at high sound-pressure levels to be heard, because the amplification of the PA system speakers does this for them. In an opera hall, though, a classical singer has to project their voice over the accompaniment of a symphony orchestra without a microphone or [[PA system]]. In trying to project the voice with at such high volumes, a classical singer may find it harder to maintain an attractive tone quality and correct [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] than a mic-wielding pop singer. To ease the pressure on classical vocalists' voices, major opera halls of the 2000s are increasingly using electronic [[acoustic enhancement]], a subtle type of [[sound reinforcement system]].

As with pop singing styles, the attractiveness or exciting qualities of a live opera vocal performance or recording are subjective and vary between listeners, cultures, and time periods. A soprano singing in the 1930s would elicit praise and applause for hitting a high note in a way that would be deemed unacceptable in the 2000s, because of the use of [[performance practice]]s such as doing a long, drawn-out [[glissando]] up to reach the high note and then using a wide [[vibrato]], wavering on the pitch so much that it is hard to discern which note they are singing.

==In pop and rock music==
In pop music, the term is used because "money notes" on a CD help to 'sell' a song for a listener, and also because  singers capable of performing these emotionally stirring passages are able to make income from the performance.  

One of the most well-known examples of money note can be found in [[Whitney Houston]]'s version of the [[Dolly Parton]] song "[[I Will Always Love You]]", at the beginning of the third rendition of the chorus, there is a pause, a drum beat, a key change, and then Houston belts out the emphatic line  "''' And I''' will always love you." The [[Céline Dion]] song from ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' "[[My Heart Will Go On]]": the key change that begins the third verse — "You're here / There's '''noth'''ing I fear." In the realm of musicals, money notes can be common elements in songs, often becoming as well known as the song themselves. 

The attractiveness or exciting qualities of a singer or recording are subjective and vary between listeners, cultures, and time periods. Different vocal styles are considered to be desirable in different cultures. In Southeast Asia, for example, female pop singers sing with a very high-pitched, nasal tone; while this singing style would be unlikely to create positive responses for most Western listeners, for Asian audiences, the sound of the most popular singers hitting high notes creates a physiological response of emotional excitement. Even within a single culture, the singing styles vary widely from one style to another. Within the [[death metal]] fan subculture, the low, guttural sound of a well-performed "[[death grunt]]" is widely admired; for a typical Western pop or rock listener, though, this type of singing would elicit only puzzlement, not excitement.

==Related terms==

In film production, the slang term "money shot" is used to refer to the most expensive scene of a film, such as a special effects sequence, especially in films from before the era of pre-Computer Generated Imagery, when special effects were done with explosives and stuntpeople rather than computer software. In a 1950s action-adventure film about [[Pearl Harbor]], for example, a costly sequence which depicts the bombing and sinking of US destroyers by exploding and sinking actual, decommissioned vessels would be called the "money shot" of the film. The audiences would expect to see this sequence, given the title of the film, and the financial outcome of the movie would depend on whether the sequence was well done.

In 2008 the French singer [[Camille (singer)|Camille]] released the song "Money Note," which references [[Dolly Parton]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Celine Dion]], and [[Mariah Carey]]. In the chorus Camille swears that "I'll hit the money note," which she does at the end with a piercing, nearly inaudible shriek.

'''Negidal''' (also spelled Neghidal) is a language of the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic family]] spoken in the [[Russian Far East]], mostly in [[Khabarovsk Krai|Khabarovskij Kraj]], along the lower reaches of the [[Amur River]].&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=neg Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition]. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt; Negidal belongs to the Northern branch of Tungusic, together with [[Evenki language|Evenki]] and [[Even language|Even]]. It is particularly close to Evenki, to the extent that it is occasionally referred to as a dialect of Evenki.&lt;ref&gt;Janhunen, Juha (1996) Manchuria: An ethnic history. Helsinki: Finno-Ugrian Society, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language Status ==
According to the Russian Census of 2002, there were 567 [[Negidals]], 147 of which still spoke the language. The Russian Census of 2010 reported lower speaker numbers, with only 19 of 513 ethnic Negidals reported to still speak the language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pakendorf, Brigitte &amp; Natalia Aralova. 2018. The endangered state of Negidal: A field report. ''Language Documentation &amp; Conservation'' 12: 1-14. http://hdl.handle.net/10125/24760&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simons, G. F. &amp; C. D. Fennig (eds.). 2017. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Twentieth edition.'' Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Online version: [https://www-ethnologue-com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/language/neg https://www-ethnologue-com/language/neg]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent reports from the field reveal that the linguistic situation of Negidal is much worse than the census reports. According to Kalinina (2008),&lt;ref&gt;Калинина, Елена (2008) Этюд о гармонии гласных в негидальском языке, или негласные презумпции о гласных звуках. In: Архипов, А. В. et al. (eds.), Фонетика и нефонетика. К 70-летию Сандро В. Кодзасова, рр. 272-282. Москва: Языки славянских культур.&lt;/ref&gt; whose data stem from the fieldwork conducted in 2005-2007, there are only three full speakers left, and a handful of semi-speakers. Pakendorf &amp; Aralova (2018) report from fieldwork conducted in 2017 that there remain only six active speakers of Upper Negidal and there are no speakers of Lower Negidal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The language is thus classified as severely endangered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://endangeredlanguages.com/lang/2891|title=Negidal - The Endangered Languages Project|last=|first=|date=|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is predicted to become dormant within the next decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Dialects ==
There were formerly two dialects: the Upper Negidal dialect (''Verkhovskoj'' in Russian) along the [[Amgun River]] (village of Vladimirovka), still residually spoken, and the now extinct Lower dialect (''Nizovskoj'') in its lower reaches (villages of Tyr and Beloglinka, the town of [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur|Nikolaevsk-on-Amur]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Lower dialect was especially close to Evenki.

'''Olrat''' is a moribund [[Oceanic language]] spoken on [[Gaua|Gaua island]] in [[Vanuatu]]. 

==The language==
[[File:Alex-Maten-Gaua-2003.jpg|thumb|left|250px|upright|&lt;center&gt;A. François with †Maten Womal, the last storyteller of Olrat &lt;small&gt;([[Gaua]], [[Vanuatu]], 2003)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
The three remaining speakers of Olrat live on the middle-west coast of Gaua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.francois.free.fr/AF-field.htm List of Banks islands languages].&lt;/ref&gt; They merged into the larger village of Jōlap where [[Lakon language|Lakon]] is dominant, after they left their inland hamlet of Olrat in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="sociolg"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre François (linguist)|Alexandre François]] identifies Olrat as a distinct language from its immediate neighbor [[Lakon language|Lakon]], on phonological,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; grammatical,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lexical&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; grounds.
{{-}}
==Phonology==
Olrat has 14 [[phoneme|phonemic]] vowels. These include 7 short /i ɪ ɛ a ɔ ʊ u/ and 7 long vowels /iː ɪː ɛː aː ɔː ʊː uː/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2005|p=445}}, {{Harvcoltxt|François|2011|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Olrat vowels
|-
! &amp;nbsp; !! [[Front vowel|Front]]  !! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[near-close vowel|Near-close]]
| {{IPA link|i}} ∙ {{IPA link|iː}} || {{IPA link|u}} ∙ {{IPA link|uː}}

|-
! [[open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="2" | {{IPA link|a}} ∙ {{IPA link|aː}} 
|}

Historically, the phonologization of vowel length originates in the [[compensatory lengthening]] of short vowels when the [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|/ɣ/}} was lost syllable-finally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2005|p=461}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pangender''' is a non-binary [[gender]] defined as being more than one gender. A pangender person may consider themselves a member of all genders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dictionary. "Pangender." 2016. 16 Nov 2016. http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pangender&lt;/ref&gt; The prefix ''pan'' is Greek and means "all".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pangender is a kind of [[third gender]], much like [[bigender]], [[trigender]], or [[genderqueer]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Richards, C. "Third Genders."

== Contemporary problems ==
A current issue for individuals of non-binary genders is which bathroom to use in public; either the one matching society’s expectations (appearing/dressing masculine must use the male restroom; appearing/dressing feminine must use the female restroom) or the one matching their internal feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Herriott, Todd K. and Halcro, Casey M., "Safe Zone: 101 Training Manual" (2014).

'''Paroxytone''' ({{lang-el|παροξύτονος}}, ''{{transl|el|paroxýtonos}}'') is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] term for a word with stress on the [[penult]]imate syllable, that is, the second last syllable, such as the [[English language|English]] word ''potato''. In [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], most words are like that. In [[Polish language|Polish]], almost all words have paroxytonic stress, except for certain verb conjugations and a few words of foreign origin.

In medieval Latin lyric poetry, a ''paroxytonic'' line or half-line is one in which the penultimate syllable is stressed, as in the second half of the verse "Estuans intrinsecus || ira vehementi."

Related terms are [[proparoxytone]] (stress on the third last syllable) and [[oxytone]] (accented on the last syllable).

'''Pen tilt''' refers to the angle of the [[writing instrument]] during the [[handwriting]] process, which can vary over time. In a coordinate system which is determined by the writing surface plane &lt;math&gt;\{X,Y\}&lt;/math&gt; and the vertical pen-tip movement along the &lt;math&gt;\{Z\}&lt;/math&gt; axis, all three [[two-dimensional]] planes can be discerned, and the angular signals can be delivered by a [[digitizer]]:

The rotation of a pen along its longitudinal axis is seldom taken into consideration, as some writers have a habit of continuously rotating the pen as they write. This phenomenon became apparent via electronic pens tethered to the digitizer, whose cords became immensely curled.

In North American sports, '''realignment''' refers to a major change in the competitive structure of one or more existing leagues. The mechanics differ somewhat between amateur and professional sports.

==Professional sports==
In professional sports, this occurs when a league decides to change which teams are in which [[division (sport)|divisions]], usually by creating new divisions. In all of the four major [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American sports leagues]], all of the teams are grouped into one of two [[conference (sports)|conferences]] (or leagues in baseball) while each conference/league is further subdivided into divisions. Teams in the same division play each other more regularly than teams in the same conference, and much more often than teams in the other conference. Teams from the same division can form intense rivalries. The top team from a division is always guaranteed a playoff spot and guaranteed a higher seeding in the playoffs.  Divisions are usually based on geography, both to minimise travel costs and to encourage regional rivalries.

Divisions are not always static. Sometimes a team may relocate to a new city, and as a result the division may become geographically skewed. For instance, when the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] of the NHL became the [[Winnipeg Jets]] in 2011, they would have been a team from a northwestern city playing in the Southeast Division, but the NHL chose not to realign at this time, leading to lengthy road trips for the Jets and the other teams in their division.

Also, divisions need to be roughly equal in size to ensure that each team has an equal chance of becoming division champion. When a league introduces new teams in new markets, placing them in the division best suited to their geography may result in more teams in that division, so realignment is necessary. The 1969 baseball realignment coincided with the addition of four teams, whereas its 1994 realignment creating extra divisions in both the [[American League]] and the [[National League]] came a year after the league added the [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]]. The [[National Football League]] realigned to its current eight-division format after a series of team relocations had created geographically skewed divisions.

Sometimes a sport will favor old division rivalries over geographical consistency. The rivalries the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the NFL maintain with the teams of the eastern seaboard, especially the [[Washington Redskins]], meant they were kept in an eastern division after realignment, even though they are geographically dissimilar to their division rivals.

==College sports==
In [[college athletics|college sports]], the term "realignment" is used to refer to a situation in which large numbers of schools switch their [[List of college athletic conferences|conference]] affiliation in a short period of time. Especially in the top level of college sports, [[NCAA Division I]], several schools [[NCAA Division I conference realignment|change their affiliations]] in one or more sports every year. However, the term is usually reserved for situations which affect large numbers of conferences—most notably in [[1996 NCAA conference realignment|1996]], [[2005 NCAA conference realignment|2005]], and [[2010–2014 NCAA conference realignment|2010–2014]].

Each of the above three realignment periods was driven mainly by one or a few conferences:
*1996: Formation of [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] and [[Conference USA|C-USA]], expansion of [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] (which split up only three years later)
*2005: Expansion of [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]
*2010: Expansion of [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]], and [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], plus further expansion of the ACC, leading to a concurrent reduction in the number of Big 12 members and the [[2010–13 Big East Conference realignment|split of the Big East Conference]]
** A separate but related phase that involved only men's ice hockey was triggered by [[Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey|Penn State]] adding the sport, enabling the Big Ten to start a men's ice hockey league. This led to the demise of the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association|CCHA]], the creation of the [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference|NCHC]], and major membership turnover in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association|WCHA]].

A '''Reed pen''' ({{lang-grc-gre|κάλαμοι}} ''{{transl|grc|kalamoi}}''; singular {{lang|grc|κάλαμος}} ''{{transl|grc|[[kalamos]]}}'') is a [[writing implement]] made by cutting and shaping a single [[Phragmites|reed]] straw or length of [[bamboo]]. Reed pens with regular features such as a split [[nib (pen)|nib]] have been found in [[Ancient Egyptian]] sites dating from the 4th century BC. Reed pens were used for writing on [[papyrus]], and were the most common writing implement in antiquity. 

Reed pens are stiffer than [[quill]] pens cut from feathers and do not retain a sharp point for as long. This led to them being replaced by quills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Arts/drawings/Generalities/Glossary/R/Reedpen.htm Glossary definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215600/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Arts/drawings/Generalities/Glossary/R/Reedpen.htm |date=2007-09-26 }} from cartage.org&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless a reed pen can make bold strokes, and it remains an important tool in [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linotype.com/7-31-7-12676/bamboo8722reedpen.html Gottfried Pott – A Look into the World of Calligraphy] from Linotype.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To make a reed pen, scribes would take an undamaged piece of reed about 20 cm, and leave the end that would be cut into point in water for some time (so it would not splinter when it’s cut). They crafted a series of cuts that would cut the nib of the [[pen]] until it is flat enough and pointed. The pointed end is then cut off. It is not too far from the point so it can form a squared end suitable for writing. At the end they would start the split (which acts as a primitive ink barrel) from the tip of the nib and lengthen it until it is of the proper length (but not too much because the pen could break). Being skilled at making reed pens was important for scribes due to low durability of the pen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofpencils.com/writing-instruments-history/history-of-reed-pen/ History of Reed Pen] from historyofpencils.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]]''' of the '''[[Romanian language]]''' (or [[Daco-Romanian]]), a [[Romance language]], has changed over the centuries as the language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], to [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanian]], to medieval, modern and contemporary [[Romanian language|Romanian]].

==Proto-Romanian==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

Romanian has inherited a number of about 10.000 (on a study based on 49,649 words) lexical items from its ancestral language, [[Latin]]. These comprise most basic concepts of society, for example:
* ''om'' "human" (&lt; Latin ''homo'')
* ''muiere'' "wife" (&lt; Latin ''mulier'')
* ''fiu'' "son" (&lt; Latin ''filius'')
* ''popor'' "folk" (&lt; Latin ''populus'')

Many words have not only changed their shape, but also their meaning during their evolution from Latin to Romanian. Such are:
* ''bărbat'' "man" (&lt; Latin ''barbatus'' "bearded")
* ''femeie'' "woman" (&lt; Latin ''familia'' "people belonging to a household")
* ''inimă'' "heart" (&lt; Latin ''anima'' "soul")
* ''soț'' "husband" (&lt; Latin ''socius'' "fellow")

==Medieval Romanian==
By the later [[Middle Ages]], a great number of Slavic loanwords had already entered Romanian.

Among the basic Slavic loanwords are:
* ceas ''clock''
* citi ''to read''
* crai ''king''
* curvă ''whore''
* da ''yes'' (the word may be derived from the Latin word "ita" meaning "of course" or "thus")
* drag ''dear''
* dragoste ''love''
* duh ''spirit, ghost''
* haină ''shirt''
* iubi ''to love''
* izvor ''source''
* mândru ''proud''
* muncă ''work''
* noroc ''luck''
* opri ''stop''
* porni ''start''
* praf ''dust''
* prieten ''friend''
* prost ''stupid; simple''
* rând ''row; order''
* sărac ''poor''
* sfânt ''holy''
* sfert ''quarter''
* slanină ''bacon''
* smântână ''sour cream''
* sută ''hundred''
* târg ''market''
* tigaie ''pan''
* trup ''body''
* veac ''century''
* vreme ''weather; time''
* zid ''wall''

(see also [[Slavic influence on Romanian]])

==Modern Romanian==

In the 19th century, as the Romanian society transitioned from rural and agricultural towards urban and industrial, the lexis underwent a vigorous enrichment with loanwords from its Romance relatives, French and Italian. Many scholarly and technical terms were also imported from [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]]. Some words, especially of Greek (''arvună'', ''ipochimen'', ''simandicos'') and Turkish (''acadea'', ''beizadea'', ''hatâr'') origin, fell into relative disuse or acquired an ironic connotation. The Slavic part of the lexis, of earlier entry and more deeply anchored into the language, survived relatively unscathed.

Among the words which entered the language:
* ''deja'' "already" (from French ''déjà'')
* ''jena'' "disturb" (from French ''gener'')
* ''medic'' "physician" (from Latin ''medicus'')
* ''servi'' "serve" (from French or Italian)
* ''ziar'' "newspapers" (from Italian ''diario'')

==Turkish==

Large parts of modern-day Romania were under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule or suzerainty for several centuries. As a result, exchanges in language, food and culture occurred, and Romanian has absorbed several words of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] origin. A small ethnic Turkish minority still remains in some cities and towns.

* ''abanos'' "ebony" (&lt; Turkish ''abanoz'')
* ''arpagic'' "chive" (&lt; Turkish ''arpacık'')
* ''baclava'' "baclava" (&lt; Turkish ''baklava'')
* ''bacșiṣ'' "tip, gratuity" (&lt; Turkish ''bahșiș'')
* ''basma'' "handkerchief" (&lt; Turkish ''basma'')
* ''batal'' "wether" (&lt; Turkish ''batal'')
* ''belea'' "misfortune" (&lt; Turkish ''bela'')
* ''boi'' "appearance" (&lt; Turkish ''boy'')
* ''bre'' "hey" (&lt; Turkish ''bre'')
* ''briceag'' "pocket knife" (&lt; Turkish ''bıçak'')
* ''buluc'' "pile" (&lt; Turkish ''böluk'')
* ''burghiu'' "drill" (&lt; Turkish ''bürgu'')
* ''bursuc'' "badger" (&lt; Turkish ''porsuk'')
* ''caimac'' "cream" (&lt; Turkish ''[[kaymak]]'')
* ''caisă'' "apricot" (&lt; Turkish ''kayısı'')
* ''calcană'' "turbot" (&lt; Turkish ''kalkan balığı'')
* ''caldarâm'' "pavement" (&lt; Turkish ''kaldırım'')
* ''capcană'' "trap" (&lt; Turkish ''kapkan'')
* ''caraghios'' "funny" (&lt; Turkish ''Karagöz'')
* ''cat'' "storey" (&lt; Turkish ''kat'')

A '''snowclone''' is a [[cliché]] and [[phrasal template]] that can be used and recognized in multiple variants. The term was coined as a [[neologism]] in 2004, derived from [[Journalese|journalistic clichés]] that referred to the number of [[Eskimo words for snow]].&lt;ref name=Pullum2004 /&gt;

==History and derivation==
The linguistic phenomenon of "a multi-use, customizable, instantly recognizable, time-worn, quoted or misquoted phrase or sentence that can be used in an entirely open array of different variants" was originally described by linguist [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Pullum2003a /&gt; Pullum later described snowclones as "some-assembly-required adaptable cliché frames for lazy journalists."&lt;ref name=Pullum2004 /&gt;

In an October 2003 post on ''[[Language Log]]'', a collaborative [[blog]] by several linguistics professors, Pullum solicited ideas for what the then-unnamed phenomenon should be called.&lt;ref name=Pullum2003a /&gt; In response to the request, the word "snowclone" was coined by economics professor [[Glen Whitman]] on January 15, 2004, and Pullum endorsed it as a [[term of art]] the next day.&lt;ref name=Pullum2004 /&gt; The term was derived by Whitman from [[Journalese|journalistic clichés]] which referred to the number of [[Eskimo words for snow]],&lt;ref name=Pullum2004 /&gt; and incorporates a pun on the [[snow cone]] (a paper cone of shaved ice flavored with syrup).&lt;ref name=McFedriesIEEE /&gt;

The term "snowclone" has since been adopted by other linguists, journalists and authors.&lt;ref name=McFedriesIEEE /&gt;&lt;ref name=Abley /&gt;

Snowclones are related to both [[meme]]s and clichés, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s David Sarno: "Snowclones are memechés, if you will: meme-ified clichés with the operative words removed, leaving spaces for you or the masses to [[Mad Libs|Mad Lib]] their own versions."&lt;ref name=Sarno2008 /&gt;

==Notable examples==
&lt;!-- 
Please add only examples discussed and commented in scholarly sources, not just random witty utterances
--&gt;
===Eskimo words for snow===
Pullum, in his first discussion of what would later be called a snowclone, offered the following example of a template describing multiple variations of a journalistic cliché he had encountered: "If Eskimos have {{var|N}} words for snow, {{var|X}} surely have {{var|M}} words for {{var|Y}}."&lt;ref name=Pullum2003a /&gt;
Pullum cited this as a popular [[rhetoric]]al [[Trope (literature)|trope]] used by journalists to imply that cultural group {{var|X}} has reason to spend a great deal of time thinking about the specific idea {{var|Y}},&lt;ref name=Liberman2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pullum2003b /&gt; although the basic premise (that Eskimos have a larger number of [[Eskimo words for snow|words for snow]]) is often disputed by those who study "Eskimo" ([[Inuit]] and [[Aleut]]) languages.&lt;ref name=Cichoci2010 /&gt;

In 2003, an article in ''[[The Economist]]'' stated, "If Eskimos have dozens of words for snow, Germans have as many for bureaucracy."&lt;ref name=Economist2003 /&gt; A similar construction in the ''[[Edmonton Sun]]'' in 2007 claimed that "auto manufacturers have 100 words for beige".&lt;ref name=McFedries2008 /&gt;

===In space, no one can {{var|X}}===
The original request from Geoffrey Pullum, in addition to citing the Eskimos-and-snow namesake of the term snowclone, mentioned a poster slogan for the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', "In space, no one can hear you scream", which was cloned into numerous variations, such as "In space, no one can see your breasts".&lt;ref name=Pullum2003a /&gt;

==={{var|X}} is the new {{var|Y}}===
Frequently-seen snowclones include phrases in the form of the template "{{var|X}} is the new {{var|Y}}". The original (and still common) form is the template "{{var|X}} is the new black", apparently based on a misquotation of [[Diana Vreeland]]'s 1962 statement that pink is "the navy blue of India".&lt;ref name=Zimmer2006 /&gt; According to language columnist Nathan Bierma, this snowclone provides "a tidy and catchy way of conveying an increase, or change in nature, or change in function – or all three – of {{var|X}}."&lt;ref name=Peters2006 /&gt;

Examples include a 2001 album titled ''[[Quiet Is the New Loud]]'', a 2008 newspaper headline that stated "Comedy is the new rock 'n' roll",&lt;ref name=Jupitus2008 /&gt; and the title of [[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison|the 2010 book]] and 2013 [[Netflix original]] series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''.

===The mother of all {{var|X}}===
[[File:Saddam Hussein in 1996.png|thumb|Saddam Hussein, associated with the [[Gulf War]]-era phrase "the mother of all&amp;hellip;"]]
"The mother of all {{var|X}}", a [[hyperbole]] which has been used to refer to something as "great" or "the greatest of its kind", became a popular snowclone template in the 1990s. The phrase entered American popular culture in September 1990 at the outset of the [[Gulf War]], when [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)|Revolutionary Command Council]] warned the U.S.-led [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]] against [[Invasion of Kuwait|military action in Kuwait]] with the statement "Let everyone understand that this battle is going to become the mother of all battles."&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowell1990 /&gt; The phrase was repeated in a January 1991 speech by Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref name=Atkinson1991 /&gt; A [[calque]] from [[Arabic]], the snowclone gained popularity in the media and was adapted for phrases such as "the [[GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast|mother of all bombs]]" and New Zealand's "[[Mother of all Budgets]]". The [[American Dialect Society]] declared "the mother of all" the 1991 [[Word of the Year]].&lt;ref name=ADS2015 /&gt; The term "[[Father of All Bombs]]" was created by an analogy.

The Arabic phrase originated from an [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah|Arab victory over the Sassanian Persians]] in 636&amp;nbsp;[[AD]], described with the earliest known use of the phrase "mother of all battles" ([[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|ام المعارك|}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|umm al-ma‘ārik}}''). Although popularly used simply to mean "greatest" or "ultimate", the Arabic ''umm al-'' prefix creates a figurative phrase in which "mother" also suggests that the referent will give rise to many more of its kind.&lt;ref name=Safire /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickson /&gt; The phrase was used in the naming of a [[mosque]] in [[Baghdad]], the [[Umm al-Qura Mosque|Umm al-Ma'arik Mosque]].

=== {{var|X}} while {{var|Y}} ===
The template "{{var|X}} while black", and its original popular construction "[[driving while black]]", were derived from wordplay on [[driving while intoxicated]], and referred to black people being pulled over by police because of [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref name=Savan2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Balkisson /&gt; A prominent variant, "voting while black", surfaced during the U.S. presidential elections of 2000 and 2004, in reference to attempts to suppress black votes.&lt;ref name=Savan2006 /&gt; Snowclones of this form, highlighting unequal treatment of black people, have included "walking while black" for pedestrian offenses,&lt;ref name=Coolican2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mosedale2007 /&gt; "learning while black" for students in schools,&lt;ref name=Morse2002 /&gt; "drawing while black" for artists,&lt;ref name=Balkisson /&gt; and "[[shopping while black]]"&lt;ref name=Harris2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman2009 /&gt; or "eating while black"&lt;ref name=Coolican2003 /&gt; for customers in stores and restaurants.  A 2017 legal case prompted the variant "talking while black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Miranda and the Louisiana Lawyer Dog: A case of talking while black |date=November 4, 2017 |first=Dennis |last=Baron |work=The Web of Language |url= https://illinois.edu/blog/view/25/574827 |access-date=November 5, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171105162314/https://illinois.edu/blog/view/25/574827|archive-date=November 5, 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more generalized form of this snowclone, "{{var|X}} while {{var|Y}}", has been used for other groups that are purportedly targeted for unequal treatment, as in the examples "[[flying while Muslim]]"&lt;ref name=CBSNews /&gt; and "breathing while Republican".&lt;ref name=Savan2006 /&gt;

=== To {{var|X}} or not to {{var|X}} ===
"To {{var|X}} or not to {{var|X}}" is a template based on the line "[[To be, or not to be]]", spoken by the titular character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'' ({{circa}} 1600).&lt;ref name=zwicky /&gt; This template appears to have existed even prior to ''Hamlet'', and had previously been used specifically in a religious context to discuss "actions that are at once contradictory and indifferent—actions that, because they are neither commanded nor prohibited by Scripture, good nor evil in themselves, Christians are free to perform or omit."&lt;ref name=Shore2015 /&gt;

In general usage, "to {{var|X}} or not to {{var|X}}" simply conveys "[[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] between contradictory alternatives",&lt;ref name=Shore2015 /&gt; which linguist [[Arnold Zwicky]] described as an "utterly ordinary structure."&lt;ref name=zwicky /&gt; A Google search by Zwicky for snowclones of the form "to * or not to *" resulted in over 16 million hits, although some apparent occurrences may be cases of a natural [[Exclusive disjunction|contrastive disjunction]] unrelated to the Shakespearean snowclone template.&lt;ref name=zwicky /&gt;

===Have {{var|X}}, will travel ===
[[File:Richard Boone Patricia Medina Have Gun Will Travel 1959.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Have Gun – Will Travel'', 1959]]
The earliest known literary mention of the template "Have {{var|X}}, will travel" is the title of the book ''Have Tux, Will Travel'', a 1954 memoir by comedian [[Bob Hope]]. Hope explained that "Have [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]], will travel" was a stock phrase used in short advertisements placed by actors in ''[[Variety (magazine) |Variety]]'', indicating that the actor was "ready to go any place any time" and to be "dressed classy" upon arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=have |title= have |work= [[Online Etymology Dictionary]] | year = 2001  |accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bob |last= Hope |authorlink= Bob Hope |title= Have Tux, Will Travel: Bob Hope's Own Story as Told to Pete Martin |year=1954 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=0-7432-6103-8 |quote=[[Hoofer]]s, [[comedian]]s and [[singer]]s used to put ads in ''Variety''. Those ads read: 'Have tuxedo, will travel'. It meant they were ready to go any place any time...  It also meant that they would be dressed classy when they showed up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of variations of this template by job seekers goes back considerably earlier, dating to at least the 1920s, possibly {{circa|1900}}, in ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]].&lt;ref name="Partridge1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Partridge|title=A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eoQAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 |year=1992 |publisher=Scarborough House |isbn=978-1-4616-6040-8 |pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the snowclone were used in the titles of the 1957 [[Western (genre)|Western]] television show ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Have Space Suit—Will Travel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Robert A. Heinlein: a reader's companion |page=98 |author=J. Daniel Gifford |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jnreview&gt;[http://jamesdavisnicoll.com/review/a_boy_and_his_space_suit "A Boy and His Space Suit (Have Space Suit — Will Travel — Robert A. Heinlein)"], a review by [[James Nicoll]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]'s 1959 song ''[[Have Love, Will Travel]]'', [[Bo Diddley]]'s 1960 album ''[[Have Guitar Will Travel (Bo Diddley album)|Have Guitar Will Travel]]'', [[The Three Stooges]]' 1959 film ''[[Have Rocket, Will Travel]]'' and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]'s 2009 album ''[[Have Guitar, Will Travel (Joe Perry album)|Have Guitar, Will Travel]]''.

==Similar concepts==
In 1995, linguist [[David Crystal]] referred to this kind of trope as a "catch structure", citing as an example the phrase "to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before", as originally used in [[Douglas Adams]]'s ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' radio series (1978).&lt;ref name=Crystal1995 /&gt; The phrase references ''[[Star Trek]]'' ("[[Where no man has gone before|... to boldly go where no man has gone before]]"), humorously highlighting the use of a [[split infinitive]] as an intentional violation of a disputed traditional rule of grammar.&lt;ref name=Fowler1965 /&gt;

In the study of folklore, the related concept of a [[proverbial phrase]] has a long history of description and analysis. There are many kinds of such wordplay, as described in a variety of studies of written and oral sources.&lt;ref name=Loomis1964 /&gt;

{{anchor|X-gate}}
==={{var|X}}-gate and similar suffixes===
{{More|List of scandals with "-gate" suffix}}
The appending of the [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|''-gate'' suffix]] to words to denote a scandal (which originates from the [[Watergate scandal]] that brought down the U.S. [[presidency of Richard Nixon]]) has also been referred to as a snowclone.&lt;ref name=Marsh /&gt; However, [[Geoffrey Pullum]], the linguistics professor who originally defined the term ''snowclone'', states that "{{var|X}}-gate" is only a "lexical word-formation analog of it, an extension of the concept from syntax into [[derivational morphology]]".&lt;ref name=Pullum2010 /&gt;

Like the ''-gate'' suffix, the Italian ''{{lang|it|-poli}}'' suffix emerged in Italian media from investigations in the 1990s that uncovered a system known as ''{{lang|it|[[Mani pulite|Tangentopoli]]}}''. The term derives from ''{{lang|it|tangente}}'', which means [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]] (e.g., bribery given for [[public works]] contracts),&lt;ref name=Koff2002 /&gt; and ''{{lang|it|[[Polis|poli]]}}'', meaning city. Examples of snowclone-like use of ''{{lang|it|-poli}}'' include ''{{lang|it|[[Bancopoli]]}}'' (a financial scandal) and ''{{lang|it|[[2006 Italian football scandal|Calciopoli]]}}'' (a 2006 Italian football scandal).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1900">Sorani is a [[Central Kurdish dialects|Central Kurdish dialect]]. Sorani Kurdish is [[Kurdish alphabet#Sorani Alphabet|written with the Arabic alphabet]], it has 8 vowels:î[i], û[u], i[I], u[ʊ], e[e], o[o], a[æ], â[ɑ]. 

==Nouns==
A Kurdish noun in the absolute state, i.e. without any ending of any kind, gives a generic sense of the noun. It is also the “lexical” form of the noun, i.e. the form in which a noun is given in a vocabulary list or dictionary. The absolute state is normally used for the generic sense, as in "قاوه ڕەشه" ''qâwa rasha''(coffee is black).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Sorani/sorani_1_grammar.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Reference Grammar with Selected Readings |author=Sorani Kurdish |publisher=Fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verb==
===Tense===
The main tenses

:''{{lang|ckb-Latn|Min nan dexom}}'' (Present)
:"I am eating the meal"

:''{{lang|ckb-Latn|Min nanim xward}}'' (Past)
:"I ate the meal"

;Past Perfect Tense (Intransitive)
For intransitive verbs with past stems ending in a consonant (like hatin &gt; hat-), the past perfect tense,which is functionally equivalent to the English past perfect (‘I had come, you had gone’), is formed from the past stem + i + the past tense of bûn ‘to be.’ Verbs with past stems ending in a vowel (like bûn &gt; bû) form the past perfect tense from the simple stem + the past tense of bûn.

:hâtibûm ''You came for me''
:hâtibûyan '' You came for them''
:hâtibûy(t) ''You came for him/her''

[[Image:Sleeping england.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Wilfred Funk]])]]
'''''Why England Slept''''' is the published version of a [[thesis]] written by [[John F. Kennedy]] while in his senior year at [[Harvard College]]. Its title is an allusion to [[Winston Churchill]]'s 1938 book ''[[While England Slept]],'' which also examined the buildup of German power. Published in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPP-026-004.aspx|title=Typescript|publisher=Jfklibrary.org|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's book examines the failures of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] to take steps to prevent [[World War II]], and its initial lack of response to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s threats of war.

It is notable for its uncommon stance of suggesting instead that an earlier confrontation between the United Kingdom and [[Nazi Germany]] could well have been more disastrous in the long run, rather than castigating the [[appeasement policy]] which the British government pursued at the time.

==Publication==
The book was originally intended to be no more than a college thesis. It was rated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' by Professor Henry A. Yeomans and ''cum laude plus'' by Professor [[Carl J. Friedrich]]. However, Kennedy's father, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]], keen to elevate his son's reputation, encouraged Kennedy to convert the thesis into book form and publish it. He then enlisted [[Henry Luce]] to write the foreword,&lt;ref name="OBrien"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=O'Brien |title=John F. Kennedy: A Biography |publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-312-28129-8 |pages=106–109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFRzBSBmGaIC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his friend [[Arthur Krock]], former bureau chief of ''[[The New York Times]],'' to assist in redrafting the thesis, which had originally been titled "Appeasement At Munich".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alterman|first1=Eric|title=The journalist and the politician|url=http://www.cjr.org/critical_eye/krock_and_kennedy.php|website=Columbia Journalism Review|date=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Garry Wills]] claims that this assistance amounted to rewriting and retitling the manuscript, as well as finding an agent for its publication.&lt;ref name="wills"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wills|first1=Garry|title=The Kennedy imprisonment: A meditation on power|date=2002|publisher=Mariner|location=Boston|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KvetuRawGT8C&amp;pg=PA131|isbn=9780618134434|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[US ambassador to Britain|ambassador to Britain]], Kennedy, Sr. supported Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of appeasement during the late 1930s. John F. Kennedy lived with his father in Britain at that time and as such witnessed the Luftwaffe's bombings of Britain first-hand.

==Reception==
After publication in 1940, the book sold 80,000 copies in the United Kingdom and the United States, collecting US$40,000 in royalties for Kennedy. Those from the British sales were donated to [[Plymouth, England]], recently [[Plymouth Blitz|bombed by the Luftwaffe]], while Kennedy bought a [[Buick]] [[convertible]] with his income from the book's North-American sales.&lt;ref name="OBrien" /&gt;

Joseph Kennedy had initially approached [[Harold Laski]] to write the book's foreword, but Laski declined, feeling that it was "the book of an immature mind; that if it hadn't been written by the son of a very rich man, he wouldn't have found a publisher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19700820&amp;id=6JpQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NuEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6515,4271658&amp;hl=en|title=Recordings reveal JFK's lively debate with publisher|last1=Raymont|first1=Henry|date=August 20, 1970|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|accessdate=April 7, 2015|agency=New York Times News Service|location=Eugene, Oregon|page=9A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yazgulyam language''' (also Yazgulyami, Iazgulem, Yazgulam; {{lang-tg|yazgulomi}}) is a member of the Southeastern subgroup of the [[Iranian languages]], spoken by around 9,000 people along the [[Yazgulyam River]] in [[Gorno-Badakhshan]], [[Tajikistan]]. Together with [[Shughni language|Shugni]], it is classified in a Shugni-Yazgulami subgroup of the [[Language area|areal]] group of Pamir languages. Virtually all speakers are bilingual in the [[Tajik language]].

The Yazgulyam people are an exception among the speakers of Pamir languages in that they do not adhere to [[Ismailism]].

== Dialects ==
The Yazgulami language consists of two dialects: one of these is spoken higher in the mountains, the other lower. The differences are not significant and are limited to the vocabulary. Differences in the vocabulary are also detectable between the languages used in different villages in the lower mountains. The extinct [[Vanji language]] (also Vanži) is closely related to Yazgulami. Other languages spoken in the Pamirs differ greatly from the Yazgulami language. The disparities are the largest in the vocabulary.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

== History ==
The language was first recorded by Russian traveller G. Arandarenko in 1889, listing 34 Yazgulami words recorded in 1882. The language was described in greater detail by French linguist [[Robert Gauthiot]] in ''Notes sur le yazggoulami, dialecte iranien des Confins du Pamir'' (1916).

In 1954 the Yazgulami living on the mountain slopes were resettled, about 20% of them forcibly, to the [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] valley, where they live dispersed among the Tajiks, Uzbeks, Russians and other ethnic groups.

==Phonology==
The phonology of the Yazgulyam language differs from the basic "Shugni-Roshani" type in its system of [[dorsal consonant]]s: in addition to the velar and uvular stops ''g, k, q'' and fricatives ''x̌, γ̌, x, γ,'', Yazgulami has a palatalised and a labialised series, transcribed as ''ḱ, ǵ'' (palatalised velars), ''k° g° x̌°'' (labialised velars, there is no labialised velar voiced fricative) and ''q° x° γ°'' (labialised uvulars). A significant number of labialised consonants etymologically correspond to Proto-Iranian ''*Cv'' or ''*Cu'', e.g. ''x̌°arg'' &lt; ''*hvaharā-'' "sister", while others are unrelated to Proto-Iranian ''v'', e.g. ''sk°on'' &lt; ''skana-'' "puppy".

This threefold system of articulation of dorsals has been compared typologically to the three reconstructed rows of dorsals in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

==Morphology==
In the past tense, Yazgulyam has [[Tripartite language|tripartite]] marking—one of the very few languages in the world to have it at all. This means that the subject of an [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] sentence is treated differently from both the subject and the object of a [[transitive verb|transitive]] sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] (1994). ''Ergativity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
