'''AeTopus''' is a progressive [[Electronic music]] project performed and produced by [[composer]] '''Bryan Tewell Hughes'''. The music has received critical acclaim within the [[New-age music|new-age]] and electronic music genres, and the album ''Between Empires'' won the award of Best Electronic album in the 2012 Zone Music Reporter Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zonemusicreporter.com/admin/2012award_finalists.asp ZMR 2012 Music Award Winners ]&lt;/ref&gt; The album ''Tempula'' was nominated in the Best Electronic category in the 2006 NAR Lifestyle Music Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5thelementmusic.com/naminnated.html NAR 2006 nomination database ]&lt;/ref&gt; Other nominations for ZMR Best Electronic album include the 2013 EP ''Angels and Machines'' and the 2015 CD ''When''.

==Biography==
Bryan Tewell Hughes (May 19, 1966) was born in [[Quantico, Virginia]].  He began taking piano lessons at age 6, and took up playing [[bass guitar]] at age 17. He claims to have been introduced to Electronic and New Age music by his grandparents in the early 1980s, and cites [[Ray Lynch]] and [[Kitaro]] (notable pioneers in the genre) as two of his early influences.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://www.12ton.com/html/biography.html AeTopus official website biography page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1987 and 1997, he played [[bass guitar]] in local [[Blues]], [[Reggae]], [[Funk]], and [[Punk rock|Punk]] bands in [[Moscow, Idaho]] (where he earned a B.F.A. in Fine Arts/Painting at [[University of Idaho]] in 1989), [[Portland, Oregon]], and his current home of [[Bellingham, Washington]]. After releasing a solo [[industrial music|industrial]] CD, AnthroPile: ''Take'' (1999), he began an [[audio engineering]] internship at Binary Recording Studio in Bellingham.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

Hughes has dedicated his musical energy to AeTopus since the release of the full-length CD ''Memories of the Elder'' in 2002. He is also a visual artist, and is credited with the art and [[graphic design]] of his CD [[liner notes]].

==Musical Style==
AeTopus' sound combines both [[synthesizer|synthesized]] and recorded elements, and often features [[sound bites]] and spoken human vocalizations that are used to solidify each album's theme. The music is reminiscent of early Electronic New Age in that it contains many common synthesizer sounds (such as arpeggio beeps and bass pads), yet has an exotic presence due to the use of [[orchestra]]l and ethnic instruments (such as [[violins]], [[pipe organs]], and African [[percussion]]).

The music of AeTopus has generally been described as a blend of several Electronic music subgenres. Jim Brenholts of Ambient Visions refers to ''Memories of the Elder'' as a "hybrid", describing it as possessing "...elements of the [[Berlin School of electronic music|Berlin school]], pastoral new age, [[dark ambient|dark ambience]] and droning [[Minimal music|minimalism]]. At the same time, it is none of those styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambientvisions.com/1242002.htm Ambient Visions 2002 review database]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 review of ''Tempula'', Bill Binkelman of [http://www.zonemusicreporter.com/index.asp Zone Music Reporter] noted that "...Hughes has fashioned a type of music that belongs to no country and yet also [sic] all countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zonemusicreporter.com/recording/viewreviews.asp?rvwbrdcmmt=273 Binkelman's Corner, Zone Music Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhammad Iqbal Mauladad''' (1926–1970), nicknamed '''Bali''', was a [[big game hunter]] in Kenya.

He was born into a rich and influential family of [[Kenyan Asian]]s but, rather than joining the family engineering business, he became a professional guide, leading parties on [[safari]] to hunt large animals, especially elephant.  He was the first Muslim to be recognised as a [[white hunter]] and won the Shaw &amp; Hunter trophy for best professional guide in 1966.  He also competed in the [[Safari Rally]], placing fourth in 1961.  He died in 1970, following severe goring by a [[Cape buffalo]].

==Early life==
He came from a rich family as his father, Chaudry Mauladad, was a successful [[civil engineer]] in East Africa.&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;  He attended the [[Jamhuri High School|Government Indian School]] in Nairobi and his father then taught him construction and contracting.&lt;ref name=H&amp;S&gt;{{citation |journal=Hunting and Safari |number=10 |year=2012 |page=70 |title=Mohamed Iqbal Mauladad |url=http://www.huntingandsafaris.com/h&amp;smagazine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But, from the age of ten, he had learned to shoot a rifle and so, rather than join the family business like his brother [[Basheer Mauladad|Basheer]], he chose to be a professional hunter in Kenya where he was born and spent his life.&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;&lt;ref name=H&amp;S/&gt;&lt;ref name=EwL&gt;{{citation |title=Encounters With Lions |page=118 |author=Jan Hemsing |year=1994 |isbn=978-1882458059 |quote=Mohamed Iqbal Mauladad, 'Bali' as he was always called, was a huge man. Born in the mid-1920s he stood six foot one (two meters) in his socks, weighed 250 lbs (113 kilos) and sported a magnificent moustache.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He joined the well-established business, Safariland, after World War Two and was successful as a big game hunter, leading rich clients on [[safari]] and killing many [[game animal]]s, especially elephant.&lt;ref name=AH/&gt;&lt;ref name=WH/&gt;{{rp|179}} The hunters he guided included the [[Mahendra of Nepal|King and Queen of Nepal]] and the Governor of Colorado, [[Teller Ammons]].&lt;ref name=nepal&gt;{{cite news|title=Bali Mauladad, with the King and Queen of Nepal on their East African Safari|url=http://balimauladad.com/articlessafari-profileafrican-life/bali-mauladad-with-the-king-and-queen-of-nepal-on-their-east-african-safari/|accessdate=22 March 2015|work=African Life|date=1958|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235846/http://balimauladad.com/articlessafari-profileafrican-life/bali-mauladad-with-the-king-and-queen-of-nepal-on-their-east-african-safari/|archive-date=2015-02-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British [[shooting-brake]]s were converted into safari cars for these shooting parties and he designed a lightweight [[rifle rack]] for these which was made in Naroibi for him and most of the other hunters by the gunsmiths Wali Mohamed &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=WH/&gt;{{rp|175}}

Hunting was dangerous as he was once mauled by a leopard&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; and finally gored by a [[cape buffalo|buffalo]] in [[Kibwezi]].&lt;ref name=WH/&gt;{{rp|235}}  The buffalo inflicted injuries which ruptured his liver and, despite treatment and recuperation, complications subsequently led to his death in 1970.&lt;ref name=KG/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5026">'''Broderick Christopher Cormier''' (born August 19, 1967), known as '''Chris Cormier''', is a retired American bodybuilder who competed in the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cormier Bio|url=http://www.criticalbench.com/Chris-Cormier.htm|work=Critical Bench|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in  [[Palm Springs, California]] in 1967. In 1984, he placed 4th in the 167 pound weight group at the California Interscholastic Federation State High School Wrestling Championships for [[Palm Springs High School]]. Cormier's first [[Mr. Olympia]] came in 1994, where he placed 6th. The same year he also participated in his first [[Arnold Classic]] and the [[Ironman Pro Invitational]], where he placed 4th and 2nd respectively. In 1995 he competed in his first [[Night of Champions (bodybuilding)|Night of Champions]] tournament (now called the New York Pro), where he placed 6th. Cormier has been featured in many fitness and bodybuilding magazines, including being featured on the cover of ''[[Muscular Development]]'' magazine.

In mid-2006 Cormier was hospitalized with an infected spine resulting from a bodybuilding-related injury before he was due to train with veteran English bodybuilder and ex-Mr. Olympia, Dorian Yates. He has started his recovery, which includes extensive physiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/christina21.htm|title=Chris Cormier: Hospitalized For Two Months And Relearning To Walk!|date=1 August 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since then he has turned his efforts into working with athletes all over the world, sharing the knowledge and expertise he gained over his 30+ years in the sport, which included competing in over 72 IFBB competitions, with 12 professional wins and first runner-up a record 6 times at the prestigious Arnold Classic.  His website is www.thegrind.guru.

'''Edward Clark Gaudin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|oʊ|d|æ|n}}; born December 26, 1931) is a [[Baton Rouge]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] who served for twenty-one years in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] (1967–1968; 1972–1992) as the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member from [[East Baton Rouge Parish]] in the 20th century.

==Early years, education, family==
Gaudin was born in [[New Roads, Louisiana|New Roads]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish]] to Mr. and Mrs. Alton F. Gaudin. Gaudin's mother was reared in [[Ventress, Louisiana|Ventress]], also in Pointe Coupee Parish.

Gaudin graduated from the parochial St. Joseph's Academy in New Roads in 1948. He then received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Louisiana State University]] in Baton Rouge in 1952. He entered the [[United States Army]] Artillery as a [[second lieutenant]] on an [[ROTC]] commission in 1952. He left the service in 1954 as a [[first lieutenant]] but remained a [[major (United States)|major]] in the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] for another decade thereafter. Gaudin graduated from the [[Louisiana State University Law Center]] with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree in 1958.

==Gaudin wins six legislative elections==
Gaudin won a 1967 [[special election]] created by the resignation of Democratic lawmaker [[Luther F. Cole]], who became a [[judge]]. He defeated Democrat Richard E. Cheek, 9,856 votes (50.3 percent) to 9,730 (49.7 percent) in a [[special election]] for the one-year unexpired term. In his first year in the legislature, Gaudin served with three other Republicans, [[Morley A. Hudson]] and [[Taylor W. O'Hearn]] of [[Shreveport]] and [[Roderick Miller (politician)|Roderick Miller]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], all of whom are deceased. Gaudin was defeated for a four-year term in 1968, with Richard Cheek claiming victory after defeat the previous year. O'Hearn was also defeated; Hudson did not seek reelection, and Miller lost in a bid for the [[Louisiana State Senate]]. Gaudin rebounded in 1972 to win the first of five consecutive terms. From 1970 to 1972, there was only one Republican in the Louisiana House, the New Orleans attorney [[James Sutterfield]], who won a special election to fill the vacancy created by the election of [[Nat G. Kiefer]] to the state Senate.

In 1972, Gaudin benefited from the presence of Republican [[governor of Louisiana|gubernatorial]] candidate [[Dave Treen|David C. Treen]], a Baton Rouge native then residing in [[Jefferson Parish]]. Gaudin unseated the Democrat [[Lillian Walker (Louisiana politician)|Lillian W. Walker]], 6,949 (51 percent) to 6,645 (49 percent). Thereafter, Gaudin won comparatively easy victories to hold his seat. When Gaudin was reelected in the 1975 [[nonpartisan blanket primary]], he had only four incoming Republican colleagues, and one of those, [[A. J. McNamara]] of Jefferson Parish, had been elected as a Democrat but switched affiliation in 1977.

In his last election for the District 69 seat, which then encompassed the Jefferson Street area and Tara subdivision, in 1987, Gaudin polled 48 percent in the primary and was forced into a [[general election]] (often called the "runoff" in Louisiana) with the Democrat Marilyn Barfield. He then won by a comfortable margin, 7,370 (58 percent) to 5,441 (42 percent). He did not run again in the 1991 primary, but his seat remained in Republican hands with the general election victory of [[Chuck McMains]], who later left the legislature and ran unsuccessfully for the [[U.S. Senate]] in the 1996 jungle primary. District 69 was dismembered by the legislature after Gaudin announced that he would not seek reelection, and part of the base now lies in District 68.

Despite his success in legislative races, Gaudin narrowly failed in a bid for a judgeship of the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge. In an election held on December 8, 1990, Gaudin received 16,944 votes (48.7 percent) compared to his Democratic opponent, Linda Holliday, who finished successfully with 17,857 votes (51.3 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/12081990/12081990_17.html|title=Judicial election results|date=December 8, 1990|publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]]|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical marijuana bill==
In his last legislative session, Gaudin attempted to revive Louisiana's [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpp.org/LA/news_2000.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021125162636/http://www.mpp.org/LA/news_2000.html|archivedate=2002-11-25|title=The Best Medicine?|publisher=Gambit Weekly via Marijuana Policy Project|date=November 5, 2002|first=Eileen Loh|last=Harrist|quote=In 1991, another lawmaker took a stab at reviving Louisiana's medical-marijuana law. Rep. Clark Gaudin, R-Baton Rouge, introduced the bill after a young man rolled into Gaudin's office in his wheelchair to talk to the lawmaker about his reliance on pot.|accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}

==Right-to-work legislation==
Gaudin was among a virtual handful of Louisiana legislators who supported a state [[right-to-work law]] in his 1967-1968 term. By 1976, after his reelection, the legislature passed right-to-work on the theory that it would encourage economic growth by allowing workers the choice of whether they should join a union. Gaudin accused opponents of the legislation of taking cues from labor officials such as the [[AFL-CIO]] president [[Victor Bussie]] of Baton Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minden Press-Herald]], May 14, 1976, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana was the last traditional southern state to adopt such legislation. In gaining passage, Gaudin worked with Representative [[Bruce Lynn]], a fellow Republican and a banker from [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]]. Lynn was elected to succeed another right-to-work supporter, Democrat (later Republican) [[James H. "Jimmy" Wilson]] of [[Vivian, Louisiana|Vivian]]. Other leading right-to-work advocates were Representative [[R. Harmon Drew, Sr.]] of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] and [[John Hainkel]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].

Gaudin worked to eliminate the Louisiana Milk Commission, which lawmakers eventually concluded kept milk prices in the state artificially high and forbade out-of-state companies from selling within Louisiana.

Gaudin retained an interest in Republican politics after he left the legislature. He was a delegate to the [[1996 Republican National Convention]] held in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/san.diego/facts/delegate.profile/LA.shtml|title=GOP delegates for Louisiana|work=All Politics: 1996 convention|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which nominated the ticket of [[Robert Dole|Robert J. Dole]] and [[Jack Kemp|Jack French Kemp]]. The Dole-Kemp combination, however, lost Louisiana's then nine electoral votes in the fall campaign to [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Al Gore]].

'''Dan Tucker''', better known as "Dangerous Dan" Tucker, (1849 – unknown), is a little-known [[police officer|lawman]] and [[gunfighter]] of the [[Old West]]. [[Author]] Bob Alexander, who wrote the [[biography]] ''Dangerous Dan" Tucker, New Mexico's Deadly Lawman'', proclaimed Tucker was more dangerous and more effective than better known lawmen, including [[Wild Bill Hickock]] and [[Wyatt Earp]]. He was supported in this claim by [[historian]] Leon C. Metz. He was also a subject in the book ''Deadly Dozen'', by author Robert K. DeArment, who included Tucker as one of the twelve most underrated gunmen of the Old West.

==Arrival in New Mexico Territory and reputation==
Tucker first ventured into [[New Mexico Territory]] in the early 1870s. Born in [[Canada]], Tucker was said to have been soft-spoken and laconic, and with a slight accent often mistaken for being southern. Famed New Mexico [[sheriff]] [[Harvey Whitehill]] was, at the time, serving as the [[Grant County, New Mexico]] sheriff. Whitehill first met Tucker in 1875, when the latter drifted into [[Silver City, New Mexico]] from parts unknown. Although some were suspicious of Tucker, who initially introduced himself as David Tucker, Whitehill took a liking to him, and hired him as a deputy sheriff.

Tucker was rumored to have last been in [[Colorado]], but had fled after stabbing a man to death. He was also said to have killed men in [[El Paso, Texas]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], but these claims were never confirmed. The only known facts were that he had ridden with outlaw [[John Kinney]] and that he did, after arriving in New Mexico, take part in the [[San Elizario Salt War|El Paso Salt War]].

One of the first incidents of violence in which Tucker took part after accepting his new job occurred in 1876 and was witnessed by Sheriff Whitehill's son, Wayne Whitehill, who was then a child but able to give a full account of the incident during an interview in 1949. According to him, two [[Mexican people|Mexican]] men began fighting inside "Johnny Ward's Dance Hall", in Silver City. One of the men stabbed the other, wounding him, then ran out into the street to escape. Just as he rounded a corner on Broadway Street, Dan Tucker shot him in the neck in full view of many citizens, the young Whitehill being one. An account of this shooting was also taken from Dan Rose, who was 12 years old at the time but also on the street that night.

Another incident, occurring in 1877 and also witnessed by Wayne Whitehill, concerned  a report that a Mexican man was intoxicated and throwing rocks at people as they passed by, on a side street in Silver City. Tucker responded, with several young boys running a short distance behind, due to his being somewhat of a fascination to them and an enigma to the locals after the first shooting. According to witnesses, Tucker merely located the intoxicated man and, without ever muttering even one word to him, killed him with one shot. No charges were ever filed against Tucker for that shooting. In 1878, Tucker shot and killed a fleeing thief, as well as becoming engaged in a gunfight with three suspected horse thieves inside a Silver City [[Western saloon|saloon]], killing two of the thieves and wounding the third. By this time, Tucker was legendary in the area, and had acquired the nickname "Dangerous Dan" after the shooting of the rock throwing suspect.

In early May, 1880, Sheriff Whitehill dispatched Deputy Tucker to track down two suspects who had broken into a [[Prospecting|prospector]]'s cabin and stolen numerous goods and personal property. Tucker was gone for two days, then returned with all the stolen property, along with the horses, saddles, and weapons of the two suspects. He reported to Sheriff Whitehill that he had located the two on a [[ranch]] and killed them, with the owner of the ranch agreeing to bury them. Days later, Tucker responded to a domestic dispute, during which a man had clubbed his wife and child to near death. As Tucker entered the house, the man knocked Tucker's gun from his hand with the club. In the altercation that followed, Tucker was able recover his gun from the floor and shot the man, killing him.

In 1878, although remaining a deputy sheriff, Tucker had accepted the position of Silver City [[Marshal]], the town's first, and a position he would hold through several terms. By later accounts, Tucker brought the town's violent crime rate under control quickly, and was feared due to his lack of hesitation when he deemed violence was necessary to solve a problem. By [[newspaper]] accounts from the ''Grant City Herald'', in November 1878 Tucker was shot and wounded during a shootout with [[cowboy]] Caprio Rodriguez, when the latter resisted arrest following a disturbance in a saloon. Tucker killed Rodriguez in the exchange.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8VEeZamhvAC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=Dan+Tucker,+Deadly+Dozen&amp;source=web&amp;ots=y4BfWmBqp_&amp;sig=7foiQqXxCe3Nj9WNJLk0qi-BBlg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA80,M1 |title=Deadly Dozen: Twelve Forgotten Gunfighters of the Old West - Robert K. DeArment - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1881, Tucker assisted Sheriff Whitehill in a double hanging, had previously acted as the [[Executioner|hangman]] in several other hangings for Grant County, and later accepted the position of Marshal for [[Shakespeare, New Mexico]]; in September, he shot and killed rustler Jake Bond. In November, 1881, he arrested outlaw [[Sandy King]] after he shot and wounded a storekeeper. On November 9, 1881, he captured outlaw [[William Tattenbaum|"Russian Bill" Tattenbaum]] for [[cattle rustling]]. The two were hanged by the town's "Vigilance Committee" that same day.

Tucker was sent to [[Deming, New Mexico]] on November 27, 1881, due to several outlaws causing disturbances and basically taking over the town. He began patrolling the streets with a double-barrel shotgun and within three days, according to [[journalist]] C.M. Chase who was in the area doing a story on the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], Tucker shot and killed three men and wounded two more. In 1882, James H. Cook became the manager of the "WS Ranch" and later would comment Tucker was, to his personal knowledge, involved in several gunfights as a shotgun rider while working for [[Wells Fargo]].

==Controversial shooting==
During 1882, Tucker became involved in the most controversial shooting of his career. On August 24, James D. Burns, who worked as a deputy in the mining camp of Paschal, in Grant County, entered the "Walcott &amp; Mills Saloon". Burns became intoxicated, and began twirling and flaunting his pistol. Deputy Cornelius A. Mahoney attempted to disarm Burns, but he refused, saying that as a law officer he was entitled to retain his weapon. Town Marshal Glaudius W. Moore also threatened to arrest Burns, but he ignored him and continued on his drinking binge, going from saloon to saloon.

The following afternoon, Burns, whose binge had resulted in him staying up all night with no sleep, found himself in the "Sam Eckstein Saloon", where he goaded Bob Kerr into a fight, but when Burns produced his pistol, Kerr fled. Burns then left that saloon and walked down in front of the "Centennial Saloon", where he began firing his pistol in the air. He then entered the saloon and began gambling with Frank Thurmond, a professional [[gambler]]. Marshal Moore entered shortly thereafter, due to several people complaining about Burns.

He approached Burns as he was seated at the table, and demanded he come outside to speak with him. Burns refused, stating he had done nothing and would not leave until the game was finished. Marshal Moore again ordered him up, and again Burns refused. At this point, Marshal Moore produced his pistol and yet again ordered Burns outside. Also seated at the table were former deputy John W. Gilmo and Dan Tucker.

Gilmo convinced Marshal Moore to holster his pistol, but as soon as he did, Burns jumped to his feet, pulling his own pistol. Tucker then drew on Burns and ordered him to drop his gun, which he did. Marshal Moore departed to obtain an arrest warrant for Burns. After he departed, Burns began verbally confronting Tucker, stating Tucker was wrong for involving himself in the incident.

A while later, Marshal Moore returned with Deputy Bill McClellen, warrant in hand. The two lawmen then demanded Burns turn over his weapons, stating they had "papers" for him. What followed is confusing, and has never been cleared completely. Burns drew and fired, missing everyone and, despite both lawmen having their pistols unholstered, Tucker was the first to react, drawing and shooting Burns in the ribcage. The percussion of both the first two shots extinguished the lamps, thus leaving the men in the dark. Moore and McClellen then also fired on Burns, with McClellen firing one round and Moore firing four in quick succession, all hitting their mark. Burns died immediately.

A decision to file charges against McClellen and Moore was made, based mainly on the fact Burns had been extremely popular with the local miners, and there was a loud public outcry for justice, despite the shooting having been justified. Tucker was not to be charged. On September 3, 1882, an attempt by local authorities to arrest both men was made, but they refused and no one pressured them. Instead, they went to nearby Central City and surrendered to authorities there, to avoid a possible lynching in Silver City.

Tucker, although previously told he was cleared, was also arrested, and also jailed in Central City. McClellen was released on bail and, while riding after an all-night drunk, his horse threw him and he died of injuries from the fall, thus never coming to trial. Tucker and Moore were eventually cleared of the shooting, but Moore was dismissed as Marshal.

Tucker's reputation suffered as a result of the shooting but Tucker himself, as those who knew him later commented, seemed to not be bothered by this. On December 14, 1882, Tucker was ambushed by a Mexican man as he entered a [[brothel]] in Deming to investigate a complaint, which turned out to be false. He was shot in the shoulder, but he shot and killed one man and one of two prostitutes who were assisting in the assassination attempt. Several other Mexican men also attempted to involve themselves but backed away when several citizens entered, having heard the gunshots from the street.

==Gage train robbery, later life and disappearance==
On November 24, 1883, Tucker was part of a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]], led by Sheriff Whitehill, in pursuit of bandits who had robbed a train near Deming, killing the engineer and messenger near Gage Station. The posse captured the gang, but they later escaped from the jail. Again, Whitehill led a posse in pursuit of the gang and two other prisoners, engaging the escapees in a shootout near the mountains outside Silver City. Escapee Carlos Chavez and gang member George Washington Cleavland were killed, posse member Joe Le Fur was killed. Escapee Charles Spencer and gang members Mitch Lee and Frank Taggert surrendered, Lee having been badly wounded. Gang leader Kit Joy escaped, getting wounded in the process. The posse hanged all but Spencer on sight. Joy was later wounded again by rancher Erichus "Rackety" Smith, and captured near the [[Gila River]], resulting in Joy being sentenced to [[life in prison]]. In November of that year, Tucker arrested York Kelly, an outlaw who had killed three men and murdered a woman who was eight months pregnant during a bank robbery in [[Bisbee, Arizona]]. For a time after this, Tucker operated a saloon in Deming, but in 1885 he was appointed as a [[US Marshal|Deputy US Marshal]] for that region.

In November, 1885, he and friend William Graham were involved in a gun battle with marauding [[Apache]] warriors 11 miles west of Deming, but they were able to drive the warriors off. Tucker had resigned his position by 1888, and moved on to [[California]]. The last time anyone who knew him saw him was in 1892, when he made his last known visit to Grant County. Where he went following that, or when or where he died, remains unknown. Although little known today, Tucker is considered by some historians to have been one of the most dangerous, albeit underestimated, gunmen in the history of the Old West.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

{{Thatcher sidebar}}
On 8 April 2013, former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] died of a [[stroke]] in London at the age of 87. On 17 April, she was honoured with a [[ceremonial funeral]]. Due to polarised opinion about her achievements and legacy, reaction to her death was mixed throughout Britain and evoked contrasting praise and criticism. The funeral, including a formal procession through Central London, followed by a church service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], cost around £3.6&amp;nbsp;million including £3.1&amp;nbsp;million for security. The funeral was notable for the attendance of the reigning monarch, [[Elizabeth II]]; all four of her [[Living Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|successors as prime minister]] paid homage at the funeral. Her body was subsequently cremated at [[Mortlake Crematorium]].

Thatcher's ashes were buried at the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], London, in a private ceremony on 28 September 2013, alongside those of her husband [[Denis Thatcher|Denis]].

==Illness and death==
Thatcher suffered several small strokes in 2002 and was advised by her doctors not to engage in any more public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement from the Office of the Rt Hon Baroness Thatcher LG OM FRS|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=22 March 2002|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109305 |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March, she announced the cancellation of her planned speaking engagements and that she would accept no more.{{sfn|Campbell|2003|pp=796–798}} But despite her illness, she pre-recorded a eulogy for the [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|funeral of Ronald Reagan]] in June 2004, and attended her 80th birthday celebration in 2005 with the Queen and 650 other guests in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4329132.stm|title=Thatcher marks 80th with a speech|date=13 October 2005|accessdate=9 April 2013|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her health continued to decline as the decade went on; she was briefly hospitalised in 2008 after feeling unwell during a dinner, and again after falling and fracturing her arm in 2009.

==Funeral==

===Planning===
Planning for the funeral began in 2009. The committee was originally chaired by [[Malcolm Ross (courtier)|Sir Malcolm Ross]], the former Master of the Royal Household. Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] that brought the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] into power, Cabinet Office minister [[Francis Maude]] was made the new chairman of the committee; the codename given to the plans was changed to ''True Blue'' from ''Iron Bridge'' to give it "a more [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] feel".&lt;ref name="True Blue"&gt;{{cite web |title=Margaret Thatcher's funeral: A True Blue occasion that has been four years in the making |last=Wright |first=Oliver |date=9 April 2013 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/margaret-thatchers-funeral-a-true-blue-occasion-that-has-been-four-years-in-the-making-8566595.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oborne"&gt;{{cite news |title=Margaret Thatcher: This is a state funeral, and that's a mistake |first=Peter |last=Oborne |date=10 April 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9984619/Margaret-Thatcher-This-is-a-state-funeral-and-thats-a-mistake.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of Thatcher's funeral had been agreed with her in advance.&lt;ref name="Independent, 12 April 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Funeral will be a 'ceremonial' service in line with Baroness Thatcher's wishes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/funeral-will-be-a-ceremonial-service-in-line-with-baroness-thatchers-wishes-8565093.html|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 April 2013|location=London|first=Oliver|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Thatcher had chosen the hymns and stipulated that the prime minister of the day would deliver a reading from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9991504/Margaret-Thatcher-I-Vow-to-Thee-My-Country.html |title=Margaret Thatcher: I Vow to Thee, My Country |last1=Deacon |first1=Michael |authorlink=Michael Deacon (journalist) |date=12 April 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=17 April 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had previously vetoed a [[state funeral]]; reasons included cost, parliamentary deliberation,&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Margaret Thatcher 'feared divisive debate in parliament' over state funeral |first1=Nicholas|last1=Watt|first2=Caroline|last2=Davies|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 April 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-debate-state-funeral|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it suggested similar stature to [[Winston Churchill]] (with which she disagreed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thatcher to be given ceremonial funeral with military honours|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/thatcher-ceremonial-funeral-862606-Apr2013/|journal=[[TheJournal.ie]]|accessdate=17 April 2013|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead with her and her family's agreement, she received a ''ceremonial'' funeral,&lt;ref name="HM Government"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lady Thatcher's funeral |date=8 April 2013 |website=[[Gov.uk]] |publisher=10 Downing Street |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/lady-thatchers-funeral/ |accessdate=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[military honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodcock|first1=Andrew|title=Margaret Thatcher funeral: Military honours for the longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/margaret-thatcher-funeral-military-honours-for-the-longest-serving-prime-minister-of-the-20th-8576278.html|accessdate=16 February 2017|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[guard of honour]], and a service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London. The arrangements were similar to those for the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] in [[Funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|2002]] and for [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] in [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|1997]], except with greater military honours as she had been a former head of government. Thatcher's body was cremated after the funeral, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |title=No state funeral for Margaret Thatcher |date=8 April 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/no-state-funeral-margaret-thatcher |accessdate=8 April 2013 |location=London |first=Caroline |last=Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Thatcher's supporters expressed disappointment that she would not be given a full state funeral.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; However, [[Peter Oborne]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' argued that the scale of the ceremony amounted to a ''[[de facto]]'' state funeral and disagreed with the status of a ceremonial funeral. Oborne contended that the Queen's attendance might be seen as "partisan", since she had not attended Labour prime minister [[Clement Attlee]]'s funeral.&lt;ref name="Oborne" /&gt;

* From the Palace of Westminster, a motor hearse travelled down Whitehall, across [[Trafalgar Square]] and down [[Strand, London|the Strand]] and [[Aldwych]]
* At [[St Clement Danes]], the central church of the RAF, at the eastern end of the Strand the coffin was transferred to a [[gun carriage]] drawn by the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]]

* At St Paul's, the coffin was carried into the Cathedral by members of the [[British Armed Forces]] and borne down the nave preceded by her grandchildren, Michael and Amanda, who carried cushions bearing Thatcher's insignia of the [[Order of the Garter]] and the [[Order of Merit]]

It was expected that there would be about 2,300 mourners within St Paul's Cathedral for the funeral. Invitations were decided by the Thatcher family and their representatives, together with the government and the Conservative Party. The guest list included her family and friends; former colleagues including former British Cabinet members; and personal staff who worked closely with her. Invitations were also sent to representatives of some 200 countries, and to all five living presidents of the United States&lt;ref name=bbc22109759&gt;{{cite news|title=Thatcher funeral: Invitations and guest list|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22109759|publisher=BBC News|date=16 April 2013|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four British prime ministers.

Following the church service, the coffin was taken by motor hearse from St Paul's Cathedral to [[Mortlake Crematorium]], where Sir Denis Thatcher had been cremated nearly a decade before. The cremation service was only attended by the immediate family. On 28 September 2013, a private and unpublicised service for Thatcher was held in the All Saints Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]]'s Margaret Thatcher Infirmary. Afterwards Thatcher's ashes were interred in the grounds of the hospital, next to those of her husband.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20130913"&gt;{{cite news|title=Baroness Thatcher's ashes laid to rest|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/10341402/Baroness-Thatchers-ashes-laid-to-rest.html|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 September 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-intere"&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Thatcher's ashes laid to rest at Royal Hospital Chelsea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24316701|accessdate=28 September 2013|publisher=BBC News|date=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political reaction====
A Buckingham Palace spokesman reported the Queen's sadness on hearing the news of her death, and that she would be sending a private message to the family.&lt;ref name="BBC-reaction"&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Thatcher dies: Reaction in quotes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22071506|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 April 2013|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] cut short a visit abroad and ordered flags to be flown at [[half-mast]]. He issued a statement lamenting Britain's loss of "a great prime minister, a great leader, a great Briton".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faulconbridge|first1=Guy|last2=Holton|first2=Kate|agency=[[Reuters]]|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-margaret-thatcher-dead-20130408,0,6968713.story |title=Margaret Thatcher dead: 'Iron Lady' mourned but critics speak out |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=9 April 2013 |date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|DOsLYBq1g_8|David Cameron's Statement on Lady Thatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], eulogised Thatcher as having defined modern British politics and that, while she may have "divided opinion" during her time, there would be scant disagreement about "the strength of her personality and the radicalism of her politics".&lt;ref name="BBC-reaction" /&gt;

[[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] and Labour Party leader [[Ed Miliband]] said that she would be remembered for having "reshaped the politics of a whole generation [and moving] the centre ground of British politics" and for her stature in the world. He said that, although the Labour Party had disagreed with much of what she did, "we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength".&lt;ref name="BBC-reaction" /&gt;

[[Sir John Major]], her successor as prime minister, credited Thatcher's leadership with turning Britain around in large measure. "Her reforms of the economy, trades union law, and her recovery of the Falkland Islands elevated her above normal politics."&lt;ref name="BBC-reaction" /&gt; Former Labour prime ministers [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] said that even those who disagreed with her would admire her strength of character, her convictions, her view of Britain's place in the world and her contribution to British national life.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reaction to the death of Margaret Thatcher: as it happened|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9978844/Reaction-to-the-death-of-Margaret-Thatcher-as-it-happened.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 April 2013|location=London|first1=Barney|last1=Henderson|first2=Chris|last2=Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] leader [[Caroline Lucas]] voiced regret that, although Thatcher was the first female prime minister, "she did little for women either inside or outside the House of Commons".&lt;ref name="Lucas"/&gt; [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] expressed his sympathy in a tweet, paying homage to "a great patriotic lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=Nigel Farage|user=Nigel_Farage|number=321230333691445248|date=8 April 2013|title=Very sad to hear of the death of Margaret Thatcher, a great patriotic lady.|access-date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disney Legacy==
[[File:DisneyFamilySchiphol1951.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Disney family (1951)]]
Miller was a patron of the arts, as well as a lifelong classical music enthusiast and a generous philanthropist as well &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://waltdisney.org/about/diane-disney-miller|title=Diane Disney Miller|last=admin|date=2015-09-12|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Miller published a series of eight pieces for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1956 titled "My Dad, Walt Disney", co-written with Pete Martin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disney|first1=Walt|last2=Jackson|first2=Kathy Merlock|title=Walt Disney: Conversations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3gdXF7eiH14C&amp;pg=PR25|year=2006|publisher=UP of Mississippi|isbn=9781578067138|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 she published the book ''The Story of Walt Disney''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosley|first=Leonard|title=Disney's World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eaKoZtJqPc0C&amp;pg=PA15|year=1990|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=9781589796560|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her husband was removed from his executive position at [[Walt Disney Productions]] in 1984, Miller began to limit her involvement with the company.&lt;ref name="slotnik"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/business/diane-disney-miller-79-keeper-of-walts-flame-dies.html?_r=0|title=Diane Disney Miller, 79, Keeper of Walt’s Flame, Dies|last=Slotnik|first=Daniel E.|date=20 November 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Diane in 2005, she recalled that she and Sharon lived a typical life, as both parents were very protective, caring and loving&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/guest_writers1/b/leo_n_holzer/archive/2011/10/12/quot-he-was-always-grandpa-quot-the-miller-children-recall-walt-disney.aspx|title="He was always grandpa" : The Miller children recall Walt Disney|last=Holzer|first=Leo|website=jimhillmedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Miller was instrumental in pushing ahead with the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in downtown Los Angeles. The project was initiated with a $50 million gift from her mother in 1988, but was stalled for a time due to cost negotiations. She was an ardent supporter of architect [[Frank Gehry]] as its designer. The hall finally opened in 2004.

After devoting her earlier life to raising her seven children, Miller undertook an active advocacy to document the life and accomplishments of her father, who has been the subject of poorly researched biographies and inaccurate rumors. She was also concerned that his name had become more of a corporate identity than a reference to the man himself. In 2001, the Walt Disney Family Foundation released ''The Man Behind the Myth'', a documentary film about Walt Disney’s life featuring interviews with his colleagues, peers, and family. In 2009, Diane co-founded the Walt Disney Family Museum with her son Walter Elias Disney Miller, who is a movie producer, and Disney was also the President of the Board of Directors of the Walt Disney Family Foundation at the time of her death, which is a nonprofit organization that owns and operates the Walt Disney Family Museum, located in Presidio in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silveradovineyards.com/winery/diane|title=Silverado Vineyards|website=www.silveradovineyards.com|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the inaugural Diane Disney Miller Lifetime Achievement Award was created to honor the Museum's founder, to recognize those who have made an outstanding impact in the field of arts, education, community involvement, or technological advancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-disney-family-museum-2017-gala-honoring-john-lasseter|title=The Walt Disney Family Museum 2017 Gala Honoring John Lasseter|last=Brianne|date=2017-08-15|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Born in Los Angeles on December 18, 1933, Diane Disney Miller attended Los Feliz Grammar School, before moving to [[Immaculate Heart High School (Los Angeles)]] for junior high school and high school.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mouseplanet.com/10546/Remembering_Diane_Disney_Miller&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to study English at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/business/diane-disney-miller-79-keeper-of-walts-flame-dies.html|title=Diane Disney Miller, 79, Keeper of Walt’s Flame, Dies|last=Slotnik|first=Daniel E.|date=2013-11-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was 20 years old, Diane was introduced to 21-year-old University of Southern California student [[Ron W. Miller|Ron Miller]], a member of the [[USC Trojans]] football team, on a blind date after a [[University of California]]–USC game. They married in a small Episcopal church ceremony in Santa Barbara on May 9, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/ron-and-diane-get-married|title=Ron and Diane Get Married|last=Brianne|date=2017-05-08|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Diane and Ron had several children whom they were survived by: Tamara Scheer, Patrick D., Jennifer Miller-Goff, Christopher D., Walter Elias, Joanna. Ronald then served in the Army and played professional football before Walt convinced him to work the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], and ascended from film directing and production to president and CEO of what is now [[The Walt Disney Company]]. In 1988, Lillian Disney, her mother, announced plans to contribute $50 million to the Los Angeles Concert Hall in Downtown Los Angeles, which Diane would later come to support it throughout her life. More than 70 architectural firms submitted proposals to the head director, [[Frank Gehry]]. By 1996, the project was almost dead, but Diane persuaded Gehry to move forward with it, as it had run into problems with poor management and disagreements over the design, and Los Angeles County officials wanted to cancel it. It was supposed to be worth $10 million by 1997. Diane arranged for the Walt Disney Family Foundation to contribute about $25 million to keep Gehry in control, and the hall finally opened in 2003, at the cost of $247 million. Although Lillian Disney, never got a concert there (she died in 1997), Diane continued to support it. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/business/diane-disney-miller-79-keeper-of-walts-flame-dies.html|title=Diane Disney Miller, 79, Keeper of Walt’s Flame, Dies|last=Slotnik|first=Daniel E.|date=2013-11-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During that time, Diane traveled to Napa Valley with her mother, Lillian, to visit several wineries. The trip inspired Miller to start a vineyard, with the possibility of a winery. With the children grown, Ron left the company and the entertainment industry in 1984, and both he and Diane went on to develop the renowned [[Silverado Vineyards Winery]] in Napa, which became their home. In 1976, the family purchased a large property along the Silverado Trail in the Stags Leap District. They planted Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay and started making wine in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/49343|title=Silverado Vineyards Cofounder Diane Disney Miller Dies {{!}} News {{!}} News &amp; Features {{!}} Wine Spectator|work=WineSpectator.com|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expanded the winery to only using estate-grown grapes, and Diane helped create a home and a family-like atmosphere rather than just a business. 

The couple had seven children: Christopher (b. 1954), Joanna (b. 1956), Tamara (b. 1957), Jennifer (later Miller-Goff; b. 1960), Walter (b. 1961), Ronald (b. 1963), and Patrick (b. 1967).

==Death and dedication==

Diane Disney Miller died on November 19, 2013, at age 79 from medical complications that developed after a fall.

'''Female sex tourism''' is [[sex tourism]] by women who travel intending to engage in sexual activities with one or more locals, usually male [[sex worker]]s. Female sex tourists may seek aspects of the sexual relationship not shared by male sex tourists, such as perceived [[Romance (love)|romance]] and [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|intimacy]].&lt;ref name="Opperman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Opperman|first=Martin|title=Sex Tourism|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|year=1999|volume=26|issue=2|page=251|doi=10.1016/s0160-7383(98)00081-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who fit this profile – especially wealthy, single, older white women – plan their holidays to have romance and sex with a companion who knows how to make them feel special and give them attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0PXkzgcdRQC|title=Tourism in Southeast Asia: Challenges and New Directions|first=Michael|last=Hitchcock|year=2009|publisher=NIAS Press|isbn=9788776940348|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsctCgAAQBAJ|title=Tourists, Tourism and the Good Life|first1=Philip|last1=Pearce|first2=Sebastian|last2=Filep|first3=Glenn|last3=Ross|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136930270|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ladies, your holiday romance awaits|url= http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/ladies-your-holiday-romance-awaits-20130206-2dymx.html#ixzz2wVELsr7g|date=February 8, 2013 |author=Matty Silver|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of female sex tourism is significantly lower than male sex tourism.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Jacqueline|title=Tourism and 'embodied' Commodities: Sex Tourism in the Caribbean|year=2000|publisher=Pinter|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Female sex tourism occurs in diverse regions of the world.  The demographics of female sex tourism vary by destination, but in general female sex tourists are usually classified as women from a developed country, who travel to less developed countries in search of romance or sexual outlets.&lt;ref name= "Kenya"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reuters|title=Sex Tourism for Women|journal=Contemporary Sexuality|date=25 November 2008|volume=42|issue=1|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female sex tourists can be grouped into three types: 

* Traditional sex tourists, who have similar characteristics and motives as male sex tourists.&lt;ref name="Kenya" /&gt;
* Situational sex tourists, who do not intentionally put themselves in a sex tourist position, but find themselves involved in a sexual encounter with local men. Situational sex tourists may fall into the category of either being [[Businessperson|businesswomen]], [[student]]s, women in overseas conferences or other women who have different agendas that are non-sexual.&lt;ref name="Opperman" /&gt;
* Romance tourists, who plan to fulfil their travel with [[Romance (love)|romantic]] experiences that they cannot experience in their native country.&lt;ref name="Pruitt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pruitt|first=Deborah|author2=LaFont|title=For Love and Money Romance Tourism in Jamaica|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|year=1999|volume=22|issue=2|pages=422–440|doi=10.1016/0160-7383(94)00084-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the realm of female sex tourism, male sex workers are vital for the satisfaction of these women, whether physical or emotional. Without the employment of local sex workers, sex tourism for both men and women would not exist. Sex tourism is becoming a global phenomenon {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. With this movement of different populations to different countries, problems concerning health increase, especially ailments involving [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and [[HIV]]/[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Women involved with sex tourism do not find themselves using barrier contraceptives during the majority of their visit, leaving them unprotected against STIs.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ragsdale|first=Kathleen|author2=DifranceiscoI, Pinkerton|title=Where the boys are: Sexual expectations and behaviour among young women on holiday|journal=Culture, Health and Sexuality|date=April 2006|volume=8|issue=2|pages=86–98|doi=10.1080/13691050600569570|pmid=16641059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
There is an ongoing debate on terminology regarding female sex tourism. Pruitt and LaFont argue that the term ''female sex tourism'' is not representative of the relationship that female tourists have with local men.&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt; They argue that ''female sex tourism'' oversimplifies the motives of these women and that ''romance tourism'' explains the complex nature of what these women are engaging themselves in while involved in romance tours.&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt; They also propose that the expression ''female sex tourism'' "serves to perpetuate [[gender]] roles and reinforce power relations of [[Patriarchy|male dominance]] and female subordination, romance tourism in [[Jamaica]] provides an arena for change".&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt;

Scholars such as Klaus de Alburquerque counter that the term ''romance tourism'' overcomplicates what the motives of sex tourists are. de Albuquerque stated that concepts like "romance tourism" are only representative of small niches, like that of Jamaica and its cultural beliefs. Through his research, he concludes that the majority of female sex tourists are solely touring for physical encounters and not romance.&lt;ref name="Herold" /&gt; He also says that the "tourist and beach boys may define their relationships as one of romance, [but] in reality, the relationship is one of [[prostitution]]".&lt;ref name="Herold" /&gt;

Researcher Jacqueline Sanchez-Taylor argues that the term ''female sex tourism'' and even the term ''romance tourism'' undermine what is actually happening in these situations. She compares female and male sex tourism and shows how each relationship is based upon sexual-economic relationships. She also explores whether or not female sex tourism is based on romance and if there is some sort of sexual-economic relationship occurring between the two parties. She added, "The fact that parallels between male and female sex tourism are widely overlooked reflects and reproduces weaknesses in existing theoretical and commonsense understandings of gendered power...[and] sex tourism."&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Jacqueline|title=Female Sex Tourism: A Contradiction in Terms?|journal=Feminist Review|year=2006|volume=83|issue=1|pages=42–59|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Destinations ==
A number of countries have become destinations for female sex tourism, including Southern Europe (mainly in Greece, Italy, Spain and Croatia); the Caribbean (Barbados, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Jamaica); Ecuador, Costa-Rica, Morocco, Turkey, Nepal, Thailand, Indonesia and Fiji; and Gambia and Kenya in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/sex/29-06-2007/94318-sex_tourism-0 |title=Women going on sex tours look for big bamboos and Marlboro men |website=Pravda |date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OlderWhite"&gt;{{cite news

A survey from 2009 conducted by Wanjohi Kibicho in Malindi Kenya from the book Sex Tourism in Africa: Kenya's Booming Industry, found that out of the sex tourist surveyed 61% were between the ages of 46-50, 31-35(3%) being the youngest age bracket. Of the background of these women surveyed 22% were from Germany, 19% from Italy and 15% from Netherlands. In addition 71% of those surveyed were re-visting the destination. In gauging the reasoning for sex touring Kibicho summarizes that women who feel rejected by men in the developed countries for being "overweight and older" find that in Kenya this is suddenly reversed. There they are "romanced", appreciated and "loved" by men. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbLeCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sex Tourism in Africa: Kenya's Booming Industry|first=Wanjohi|last=Kibicho|date=1 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motives for travel ==

=== Traditional sex tourism ===
Traditional female sex tourists have the same intentions as their male counterparts, and travel to foreign countries that have lower wages, and take advantage of cheap prostitution at a level unaffordable in their own countries.

Examples of these sexual-economic relationships can be found in countries like [[Kenya]], [[Africa]], where women from the [[United Kingdom]] travel to Kenya to enjoy the sun and enjoy the “company of young men” in a sexual manner.&lt;ref name="Kenya" /&gt;

=== Situational sex tourism ===
Situational sex tourists differ from traditional sex tourists by considering their sexual activities with the [[sex worker]] as an added amenity to their original motive to travel.&lt;ref name="Opperman" /&gt;

The background of the situational sex tourist consists of first time tourists who do not plan on being involved intimately with local men. The majority of these first time tourist will become involved in relationships where the tourist becomes romantically involved with the local men rather than being exclusively physical with the sex workers.&lt;ref name="Herold"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herold |first1=Edward |last2=Garcia |first2=DeMoya |title=Female Tourist and Beach Boys |journal=Annals of Tourism |year=2001 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=978–997 |doi=10.1016/s0160-7383(01)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situational sex tourism occurs when foreign tourists are lured in by male sex workers, known as either ''beach boys'' in the [[Caribbean]], ''gringueros'' in [[Costa Rica]] or local men. According to the tourists, they are usually lured in due to the exotic appeal that these men emulate. The exotic appeal can come from the ethnic differences between the sex worker and the sex tourist or the foreign lifestyle that these men live&lt;ref name= "Herold" /&gt;

The sex workers will target women who they deem [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] for various reasons, such as weight or age.&lt;ref name= "Herold" /&gt;

=== Romance tourism ===
Romance tourism refers to a different relationship than female sex tourism.&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt;

The concept of romance tourism came from researchers' observations in [[Jamaica]]; it appeared to them that the female tourist and local males viewed their relationship with each other solely based on [[Romance (love)|romance]] and courtship rather than lust and monetary value.&lt;ref name ="Herold" /&gt; Romance tourism is an issue of [[gender]] identification: “gender identity is a relational construct, the [[Western culture|Western women]] who seek to break from conventional roles require a different kind of relationship with men in order to realize a new gender identity”.&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt; With increasing independence and financial self-reliance, women are able to travel, showing their independence from men of their culture, “female tourists have the opportunity to explore new gender behavior”.&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt; Like traditional sex tourists, romance tourists have a motive for travel, romance tourists travel to underdeveloped countries to find romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/01/11/japanese-women-find-love-bali.html-0 |title=Japanese women find love in Bali |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatjapanthinks.com/2006/01/06/japan-women-dream-of-the-usa/ |title=Japanese women dream of the USA |website=What Japan Thinks |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/ladies-your-holiday-romance-awaits-20130206-2dymx.html#ixzz2wVELsr7g |title=Ladies, your holiday romance awaits |first=Matty |last=Silver |date=8 February 2013 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1023604/Things-dont-know--gigolo.html |title=Things you don't know about... being a gigolo |newspaper=The Daily Mail |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/01/world/la-fg-indonesia-cowboys-20100702 |title=A cloud over Bali's beautiful beaches |first=John M. |last=Glionna |date=1 July 2010 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2010/05/11/japanese-gals-flock-to-balis-beach-boys-for-lots-of-fun-fun-fun/ |title=Japanese gals flock to Bali's Beach Boys for lots of Fun, Fun, Fun |first=Kazutaka |last=Shimanaka |date=11 May 2010 |website=Tokyo Reporter |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/01/25/japanese-women-paying-for-gigolos-but-staying-sex-free/ |title=Japanese Women Paying for Gigolos, but Staying Sex-Free |date=25 January 2007 |website=Fox News |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/story.html?id=a62567b9-2186-4f07-b2b9-d55f9fd39d61&amp;__federated=1 |title=Women seeking beach boys |website=canada.com |accessdate=4 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409225153/http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/story.html?id=a62567b9-2186-4f07-b2b9-d55f9fd39d61 |archivedate=9 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2014/11/26/films/film-reviews/yokudo-lingering-confused-gaze-indie-director/#.VIge2NxmUbJ |title=Yokudo: Lingering but confused gaze of indie director |newspaper=The Japan Times |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/women-who-travel-for-sex-sun-sea-and-gigolos-5329678.html |title=Women who travel for sex: Sun, sea and gigolos |date=9 July 2006 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africaspeaks.com/reasoning/index.php?topic=3617.0;wap2 |title=Women who travel for sex: Sun, sea and gigolos |website=Africa Speaks.com |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex workers ==

=== Background and intentions ===
Male sex workers have more freedom and security than female sex workers do because males are not confined to a [[brothel]] or a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] and are not generally physically abused by their clients.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

Similar to the sex tourists, sex workers have their own intentions. Just as some [[Western culture|Western women]] may consider the local men exotic, the local men may consider Western women to be exotic. Popular characteristics that appeal to a majority of sex workers are women with blonde hair and light colored eyes.&lt;ref name="Romero"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero-Daza|first=Nancy|author2=Freidus|title=Female Tourists, Casual Sex, and HIV Risk in Costa Rica.|journal=Qualitative Sociology|year=2008|volume=31|issue=2|pages=169–187|doi=10.1007/s11133-008-9096-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sex workers will specifically target this type of exotic woman for their own personal pleasure with no guarantee of monetary gain.&lt;ref name="Herold" /&gt;

On the other side of the spectrum, most sex workers have the intention of making some form of monetary gain. Such a sex worker typically profiles tourists, in hopes of increasing his monetary wealth the fastest. While profiling he will look for older women, over the age of forty or young, overweight women. The sex worker considers these women [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] and will play on their vulnerability to get the tourists to obtain feelings for the sex worker. Once the tourist and sex worker obtain a relationship, the sex worker finds it easier for them to engage in a  monetary exchange.&lt;ref name="Herold" /&gt;

=== Defined by the tourist ===
Romance tourists do not label their sex workers “prostitutes”. The local men and the tourists understand their roles in the relationship. The primary difference in definition of a local man to a romance tourist and a local man to a sex tourist is the emphasis the romance tourist places on passion instead of a transaction of goods or money for sexual favors.&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt;

== Health risks ==
The rate of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, including [[HIV/AIDS]], may be relatively high in some countries which are popular destinations for female sex tourism, particularly in comparison to the home countries of many sex tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate(%) 2013 country comparisons, ranks, By Rank |website=photius.com |url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/population/hiv_aids_adult_prevalence_rate_2013_0.html |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little or no research has been done into the transmission rates of HIV and other STDs pertaining to sex tourism. Neither has there been reliable research done into whether or not condom use is prevalent among female sex tourists. However, writer [[Julie Bindel]] speculates, in an article for the Guardian, that HIV infection figures for the region suggest that condom use by the "beach boys" in the Caribbean may be sporadic, yet female sex tourists do not appear especially preoccupied by the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/11/1057783358449.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Sex tourism as economic aid |date=July 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women seeking to experience sex with foreign men put themselves at a higher risk for STIs. [[Condom]] use during sex tours is relatively low. It is often cited that women have the intention to have safe sex with their casual sex partners while on vacation, but at some point during the initiation of the condom, the women do not follow through.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale" /&gt;

The sex workers usually will not initiate the use of a condom due to either the limited availability of condoms, cost, beliefs or previous experiences the sex worker has had with condoms.&lt;ref name="Romero" /&gt;

The lack of barrier contraceptives increases the risk of the tourist obtaining a sexually transmitted infection from their foreign partner especially when their partner has been with multiple women.

With sex tourism, women report that, given the atmosphere and the exoticness of their lover; condoms are rarely used or discussed prior to engaging in sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Romero" /&gt;

It has been found that in the [[Monteverde]] region of Costa Rica data researched by Nancy Romero Daza, has shown that female tourists in the region engage in some form of unprotected sexual activity with local men known as Gringueros. The women in the study were found to not be traditional sex tourists but situational sex tourists.&lt;ref name="Romero" /&gt;

'''James Floyd Soileau''' (born November 2, 1938) is an [[Americans|American]] [[record producer]].

==Biography==
Soileau was born in Faubourg, a small community between [[Ville Platte, Louisiana|Ville Platte]] and [[Washington, Louisiana|Washington]], [[Louisiana]]. He grew up speaking [[Cajun French]] and did not speak English until attending school at the age of 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p126811|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Floyd Soileau|last=Harris |first=Craig|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his junior year of high school, he did an afternoon [[Cajun]] music show as a part-time job with [[KVPI (AM)|KVPI]] radio in Ville Platte. After graduating from Ville Platte High in 1956, he opened a small [[Gramophone record|record]] store, [[Floyd's Record Shop]] and discovered that although people were still interested in them, [[Cajun French]] records were no longer being produced. With the financial help of a friend, [[Ed Manuel]] (a [[juke box]] operator from [[Mamou, Louisiana]]), who wanted new French records for his juke boxes, Floyd released his first record on the Big Mamou label by artists [[Austin Pitre]] and [[Milton Molitor]]. In 1957 [[Lawrence Walker]] and [[Aldus Roger]] helped Floyd launch his own label, Swallow Records.

Over the past 40 years, Swallow Records has released 265 [[single (music)|45rpm single records]] and 151 [[album]]s of Cajun French music, including recordings by [[Adam Hebert]], [[Belton Richard]], [[The Balfa Brothers|Dewey Balfa and the Balfa Brothers]], [[Nathan Abshire]], [[Jambalaya Cajun Band]], [[Paul Daigle &amp; Cajun Gold]], [[D.L. Menard]], and many more, plus recordings by the Cajun French story teller, [[Marion Marcotte]].  1958 saw the beginning of [[Jin Records]] with artists such as [[Clint West]], [[Tommy McLain]] &amp; [[the Boogie Kings]], [[Camille Bob|Lil' Bob &amp; The Lollipops]], [[Warren Storm]], [[Skip Stewart]], [[Rockin' Sidney]], [[Rod Bernard]], Johnny Allan and others making significant contributions to what was the, then, controversial [[swamp pop]] music. In 1975 he established his [[Maison de Soul]] record label, devoted to [[Creole music|Creole]] and [[Zydeco]] music, including artists such as [[Clifton Chenier]], [[Rockin' Dopsie]], [[Keith Frank]], [[Chris Ardoin]], [[Zydeco Force]], [[Jeffery Brousard]], and others. He has always encouraged his artists to compose new songs to record, and his Flat Town Music Company now publishes over 2800 songs, a majority of which are Cajun, swamp pop, and zydeco songs.

His Swallow Publications has published two books on the Cajun French language, ''Cajun Dictionary'' and ''Cajun Self-taught'', both by [[Rev. Jules Daigle]], and Jeff Hannusch's ''I Hear You Knockin''', the story of early [[New Orleans rhythm and blues]].  He operated Swallow Recording Studios in Ville Platte for over 15 years, and sold his last studio in 1975 to Ronnie Kole, who moved the studio to [[Slidell, Louisiana]]. That year he opened a vinyl record pressing plant and printing company for [[LP record]] jackets and labels, the only such facility in Louisiana. The plant closed in 1994.  Eventually, the store would close but the online mail order business still continues.

In 1959, he married his high school sweetheart Jinver Ortego. They have three daughters, Catherine, Connie and Cindy, and one son, Christopher.  Floyd was inducted into the Acadian Museum in Louisiana on October 19, 2002.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acadianmuseum.com/legends.php?viewID=139|title=Living Legends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6167">A '''government scientist''' is a [[scientist]] [[employment|employed]] by a country's [[government]], either in a research-driven job (for example [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] on the [[Manhattan Project]]), or for another role that requires scientific training and methods. In some countries other terms such Technical officers is also used for scientists.

==Australia==

In Australia, most government scientists are employed by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]. A Chief Scientist is appointed to advise the government through the [[Office of the Chief Scientist (Australia)|Office of the Chief Scientist]].

==Singapore==
In [[Singapore]], government scientists are classified according to the Departmental Titles (Alteration) (Amendment) Act 1996, which amended the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance of 1950.
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], government scientists are part of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Scientific Civil Service]]. However, that was not always the case. Before the Second World War, government scientists were recruited and employed by the Civil Service on an ad hoc basis, with grades, job titles, and organizations that varied between departments. In 1930, the Carpenter Committee was appointed to investigate the organization of civil service scientific and technical staff, and its report proposed a reorganization that covered the entire Service. This report was endorsed by the Tomlin Commission, however it was impossible to reach agreement with the relevant staff associations, who wanted other professional groups within the civil service to be similarly reorganized, and nothing ended up happening.&lt;ref name=Gladden&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Services of the United Kingdom|author=E. N. Gladden|pages=35–37|year=1967|publisher=Frank Cass and Company Ltd|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War Two changed this by causing a far greater number of scientific and technical staff to be employed by the government. The Barlow Committee on Scientific Staff in Government Departments reviewed the positions of government scientists during wartime, issuing a report on 1943-04-23. This report spurred the creation of a government [[white paper]], entitled ''The Scientific Civil Service'', which resulted in a reorganization of government scientisgts across the entire Service. This reorganization classified governmenvnt scientists across the entire Service into three major classes similar to those civil servants for the Treasury had already been classified in:&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;
;Scientific Officer class:Grades of scientific officer began with Scientific Officer, and progressed through Senior, Principal, Senior Principal, Deputy Chief, and Chief Scientific Officers.&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;
;Experimental Officer class:Grades of experimental officer began with Assistant Experimental Officer, and progressed through Experimental Officer to Senior and then Chief Experimental Officers. Experimental officers were either university graduates or people who had qualifications such as the [[Higher National Certificate]], and were support staff for Scientific Officers.&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;
;Scientific Assistant class:This class of civil servant undertook the routine work, and was largely equivalent to the Treasury's Clerical Class.&lt;ref name=Gladden /&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the employment of scientists by state and federal governments was, like in the U.K., affected by the Second World War. President Roosevelt first created the [[National Defense Research Committee]] under [[Vannevar Bush]]. This was then expanded to the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], also led by Bush. The OSRD employed scientists on a contract basis, with the OSRD as client and individual scientists as contractors. Scientists were contracted to research (through study and experiment) a specified subject, without constraints as to method, and to issue reports to the OSRD.&lt;ref name=UneasyAlliance&gt;{{cite book|title=An Uneasy Alliance|author=J. Chandra and Stephen M. Robinson|pages=6–7|publisher=SIAM|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89871-535-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, scientific research was continued by agencies such as the [[Office of Naval Research]] established in 1947, which again employed scientists as contractors. Scientific research was published in the normal way. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], established in 1946, and the [[National Institutes of Health]], established in 1930, also paid scientists for scientific research, and were major sources of government research funding.&lt;ref name=UneasyAlliance /&gt;

The [[National Science Foundation]] was eventually established in 1950. Defence research was explicitly excluded from its charter, even though Dr Bush had originally envisioned the NSF as including that as well. The armed forces established their own research departments, such as the [[Office of Ordnance Research]] for the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], established on the campus of [[Duke University]] in June 1951.&lt;ref name=UneasyAlliance /&gt;

U.S. local, state, and federal governments also employ scientists directly. The federal government employs them in departments such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], and the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]]. States and cities employ scientists in similar roles, including at fish and game commissions, parks, [[aquarium]]s, [[arboretum]]s, and [[museum]]s; and at agencies such as environmental inspection agencies, crime laboratories, and public health monitoring agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Opportunities in Biological Science Careers|author=Kathleen Belikoff and Charles A.

'''Grace Marguerite, Lady Hay Drummond-Hay''' (née Lethbridge, 12 September 1895 – 12 February 1946) was a British journalist, who was the first woman to travel around the world by air (in a [[zeppelin]]). Although she was not an aviator herself at first, she contributed to the glamour of aviation and general knowledge of it, by writing articles about her aerial adventures for US newspapers in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

== Early life ==
Grace Lethbridge was the eldest daughter of Sidney Thomas Lethbridge and his wife Grace Emily (née Willis). Her father was the managing director of the Spratt's dog and animal food company. She was married in 1920 to Sir Robert Hay Drummond-Hay (1846–1925) at the age of 25, her husband being nearly fifty years older.&lt;ref name="peerage"&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p34423.htm#i344223 Sir Robert Hay-Drummond-Hay], ThePeerage.com website, 28 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Robert was born in [[Tangiers]], [[Morocco]] and had been the British consul-general for years in [[Beirut]], Lebanon. Sir Robert was previously married to Euphemia Katrina Willis Flemming. Four children were produced in this marriage, Arnold Robert, Edward William, Cecil, and Florence Caroline. The children were all significantly older than their new stepmother, Florence Caroline being 15 years older. After six years of marriage, Sir Robert died.&lt;ref name="peerage"/&gt; Lady Drummond-Hay then was 31 years old. As a young aristocratic widow she lived in her apartment in Finchley Road London.

== Career ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-06551, Friedrichshafen, Journalisten vor Zeppelin-Start.jpg|thumb|right|Journalists being photographed before a launch of the ''Graf Zeppelin'', left to right: [[Karl von Wiegand]], Lady Drummond-Hay, Rolf Brand, and Robert Hartmann]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-08192, Lady Grace Drummond-Hay an Bord der "Graf_Zeppelin".jpg|thumb|right|Lady Drummond-Hay on board the Graf Zeppelin]]

Having contributed to British papers such as [[The Sphere (newspaper)|''The Sphere'']], she began to write for [[Hearst (media)|Hearst papers]] in the late 1920s. She wrote a series of articles for [[Chicago American|the Chicago ''Herald and Examiner'']], as one of the passengers aboard the first [[transatlantic flight]] of a civilian passenger zeppelin in 1928.

This airship, the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']], was also the first one to circumnavigate the world, in 1929. This trip around the world took place in August 1929, taking off at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey|Lakehurst]], New Jersey and arriving there again 21 days later, after stops in [[Friedrichshafen]], Germany, [[Tokyo]], and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737828,00.html Los Angeles to Lakehurst], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], 9 September 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Hugo Eckener]] commanded ''Graf Zeppelin'' on the flight. Lady Hay Drummond-Hay, or Lady Drummond-Hay, as she was often referred to, was the only female passenger. Among her 19 companion travellers were:
* Australian explorer Sir [[George Hubert Wilkins]]
* American multi-millionaire William B. Leeds
* Commander [[Charles Emery Rosendahl]] ([[United States Navy|USN]])
* Naval observer Jack C. Richardson
* Hearst correspondent [[Karl von Wiegand]]
* Hearst photographer Robert Hartman
* Spanish newspaper correspondent Joachim Rickard
* German correspondent Heinz von Eschwege-Lichbert
* Spanish physician Geronimo Megias, the personal doctor of Spanish King [[Alfonso XIII]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}&lt;!-- Megias not in the Time cite --&gt; 
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qpjpr "Around the World by Zeppelin"] (BBC documentary programme published 8 Jan 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Drummond-Hay gained fame after she arrived in New York, and her career as a journalist was secured for the next decade.

She went to war zones such as Abyssinia ([[Ethiopia]]) and was a foreign correspondent in [[Manchuria]] (China). She worked closely together for many years with her senior colleague Karl von Wiegand.  Lady Drummond-Hay was a well-known and respected journalist of the time, known for her extraordinary beauty and wit, and the intelligence and flair of her writing. Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] presented her with a precious jewel, which was displayed on her body at her funeral.

== Last years ==
During [[World War II]], Lady Drummond-Hay and von Wiegand were interned in a Japanese camp in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Time1946"/&gt; When they were set free in 1943, she was ill and Karl suffered poor eyesight after a bomb blast. They returned to the United States on the Swedish rescue ship the SS Gripsholm in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Life Magazine, 20 Dec 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Drummond-Hay died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in the Lexington Hotel 12 Feb 1946.&lt;ref name="Time1946"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852706,00.html Time], [[Time magazine]], 25 February 1946&lt;/ref&gt; At her funeral service, many notable people paid their last respects, including [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Marion Davies]]. After she was cremated, her ashes were brought to the United Kingdom by von Wiegand.

== Legacy ==
Though well known in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Lady Hay Drummond-Hay has been largely forgotten. Her name is mentioned in a number of books on the history of zeppelin flights, but no major biography or other significant document has been written about her life.

An Australian documentary, ''The Airships: Ship Of Dreams'' (2004), included footage of her.&lt;ref&gt;TV Documentary, ''The Airships: Ship Of Dreams'', Rob McAuley Production, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semidocumentary ''Farewell''===
[[File:Grace_Marguerite_Hay_Drummond-Hay_(crop;_restored).jpg|thumb|left|Grace Lethbridge as a young woman]]

Lady Drummond-Hay's 1929 experience was explored in ''Vaarwel'' ("Farewell"), an episode of the Dutch documentary series ''Het Uur van de Wolf'' ("The Hour of the Wolf"), released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.2doc.nl/documentaires/series/uur-van-de-wolf/2009/vaarwel.html ''Het Uur van de Wolf: Vaarwel''], HollandDoc.nl website.&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by Ditteke Mensink and researched by Gerard Nijssen, and told her story in [[semidocumentary]] form. The footage is of her and ''Graf Zeppelin''{{'}}s round-the-world flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmevona-z.de/filmsuche.cfm?wert=534511&amp;sucheNach=titel&amp;CT=1|Source ''1929: Im Zeppelin um die Welt''], ZweitAusendeins.de website (German).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww3.tvo.org/program/139234/farewell/ Farewell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203050116/http://ww3.tvo.org/program/139234/farewell/ |date=3 December 2013 }}, TVO.ca, (program viewable in Canada).&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive newsreel footage from the time showed in some detail how an airship operated. The narration consisted mainly of readings from Lady Drummond-Hay's articles and journal, and included discussion of her relationship with von Wiegand.

However, some parts of the film are fictitious; the airship's tail fin did not rip during the flight, but during a previous transatlantic flight in October 1928, nor did the airship have to land on water to do repairs.

[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] described the documentary as 'absorbing'.&lt;ref&gt;Felperin, Leslie. [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941735.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Review: "Farewell"], Variety.com website, 6 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vaarwel'' was later broadcast in the UK, on [[BBC Four]], as ''Around The World by Zeppelin'', on 7 February 2010.  The English-language narration was read by Poppy Elliott.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qpjpr "Around the World by Zeppelin"] (BBC documentary programme published 8 Jan 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Admiral]] '''Sir Hugh Francis Paget Sinclair''', {{post-nominals|size=100%|KCB}} (18 August 1873 – 4 November 1939), known as '''Quex Sinclair''', was a British intelligence officer. Between 1919 and 1921, after [[World War I]], he was [[Director of British Naval Intelligence]], and helped to set up the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS, commonly MI6) before the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Career==
Sinclair was educated at [[Stubbington House School]]; he joined the [[Royal Navy]] at 13 in 1886&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Christopher Andrew, "Sinclair, Sir Hugh Francis Paget (1873–1939)", rev. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] at the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]]. He became [[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of Naval Intelligence]] in February 1919 and [[Flag Officer Submarines|Chief of the Submarine Service]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Senior%20Royal%20Navy%20Appointments%201900-.pdf |title=Senior Royal Navy Appointments |accessdate=6 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315105247/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Senior%20Royal%20Navy%20Appointments%201900-.pdf |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the second director of [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] in 1923.

Beginning in 1919 he attempted to absorb the counter-intelligence service [[MI5]] into the SIS to strengthen Britain's efforts against [[Bolshevism]], an idea that was finally rejected in 1925. The SIS remained small and under-funded during the inter-war years.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; By 1936 Sinclair realized that the [[Gestapo]] had penetrated several SIS stations and [[Claude Dansey]], who had been removed from his station in [[Rome]], set up [[Z organization]], intended to work independently of the compromised SIS.&lt;ref&gt;M. R. D. Foot, "[[Dansey, Sir Claude Edward Marjoribanks]] (1876–1947)", rev. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, with a second war looming, Sinclair set up Section D, dedicated to [[sabotage]]. In spring of 1938, using £6,000 of his own money, he bought [[Bletchley Park]] to be a wartime intelligence station.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smith, ''Station X'', Channel 4 Books, 1998. {{ISBN|0-330-41929-3}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinclair was asked in December 1938 to prepare a dossier on [[Adolf Hitler]], for the attention of [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the Foreign Secretary, and [[Neville Chamberlain]], the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0f1ad7d4-a225-11d9-8483-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1zPGnvyOl|title=Spy secrets failed to win Whitehall's trust|date=31 March 2005|publisher=FT.com|accessdate=1 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dossier, which was received poorly by Sir George Mounsey, the Foreign Office assistant under-secretary—who believed that it did not gel with Britain's then contemporary policy of [[appeasement]]—Sinclair described Hitler as possessing the characteristics of "fanaticism, mysticism, ruthlessness, cunning, vanity, moods of exaltation and depression, fits of bitter and self-righteous resentment; and what can only be termed a streak of madness; but with it all there is a great tenacity of purpose, which has often been combined with extraordinary clarity of vision." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/TheRecordsofthePermanentUnderSecretarysDepartment_1.pdf Foreign Office files] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193354/http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/TheRecordsofthePermanentUnderSecretarysDepartment_1.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinclair became seriously ill with [[cancer]], causing [[Alexander Cadogan]] to note on 19 October 1939, that he was "going downhill". On 29 October, Sinclair underwent an operation for his cancer and died on 4 November 1939, aged 66, five days before the [[Venlo incident]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew. pp. 436–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ismail Akbay''' (October 17, 1930 – July 26, 2003) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] scientist. He is mostly remembered as the first Turk to work for [[NASA]].

== Biography ==

He was born in [[Mudanya]] (Tirilye-[[Zeytinbağı]]) near [[Bursa]], [[Turkey]] on October 17, 1930. Early on, Akbay was recognized as a gifted child with exceptional mental aptitude. He graduated from Bursa Erkek Lisesi and Haydarpaşa Lisesi before choosing to move to the [[United States]]. In 1956, he received a B.S. degree in Engineering Physics from the [[University of Tennessee]]. Akbay died in a fire at his home, apparently while trying to save the family dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/DA/20030730/news/606109240/TL/|title=Former NASA engineer killed in fire|last=|first=|date=2003-07-30|work=|newspaper=Tuscaloosa News|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akbay was personally selected by Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]], the famous astronautical engineer, to be the lead [[aerospace engineer]] for the F1 Engine Integration on the Apollo Saturn V-S1C Rocket. Mr. Akbay also spearheaded the Saturn 1B/H-1 Engine Integration for the Apollo-Soyuz Rendezvous Mission. Between 1963 and 1975, Akbay served in various managerial capacities during NASA’s [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Skylab]] and [[Apollo-Soyuz]] projects.

His 31-year career at NASA earned him recognition as one of American’s early space pioneers. In Turkey, at the end of the 1960s, newspaper headlines heralded him as the "Turkish Villager Who Helped Put Man on the Moon".

After his career with NASA, Akbay worked on the transfer of space technology to the U.S. private sector and the commercialization of other federally funded technologies.

During a meeting in 1996 about technology transfer, Akbay introduced Kaya Tuncer to the idea of building a Space Camp at the Aegean Free Zone. Until his death in July 2003, Akbay was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Space Camp Turkey]], attending its opening ceremony in June 2000 and following its progress and developments.

[[File:Jerome D'Souza 2 (1897-1977).jpg|thumb|Jerome D'Souza ]]

[[Father]] '''Jerome D'Souza''', [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] (6 August 1897, [[Mangalore]], [[South Canara]], [[British India]] – 12 August 1977, [[Madras]], India) was an Indian [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]], educationist, writer and member of the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Indian Constituent assembly]] (1946–50).&lt;ref name="Parliamentofindia.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol1p1.htm |title= CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY OF INDIA – Volume I |newspaper=Parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol1p1.htm |date=  |last= |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and formation==
Born in the [[Mulki, Karnataka|Moolki]] town of [[Mangalore]] in the erstwhile [[South Canara]] district of [[British India]], to a [[Catholic]] family cultivating intellectual interest, Jerome was soon at home in several local languages.  He did his secondary schooling at [[St. Aloysius College (Mangalore)]] and college studies in [[St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli|St. Joseph's College]] ([[Tiruchirapalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India). Completing finally the English Literature course at the [[University of Madras]] (Chennai) he first taught a year at St Joseph's College, Trichy, before deciding to enter the [[Society of Jesus]] (29 May 1921).  He then went through the usual Jesuit training, doing his theological studies with the French Jesuits in [[Belgium]] at the end of which he was ordained [[Catholic priest|priest]] on 30 August 1931 ([[Enghien]], Belgium). He hailed from the [[Mangalorean Catholic]] community.

==Educationist in Tamil Nadu==
Back in India in 1933, he was appointed professor in his alma mater, the [[St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli|St Joseph’s College]] of Trichy of which he became within a few years, rector and president. An able administrator, Jerome was also a convincing [[orator]].  He soon attracted the attention of Sir [[C. Rajagopalachari]] (known as Rajaji), the then president of the [[Indian National Congress]].  Transferred in 1942 to the [[Loyola College, Chennai|Loyola College]] of Chennai (formerly Madras), to be its rector and later its Principal, D’Souza soon became involved in the legal establishment of the [[University of Madras]] (Chennai). When the time came to form an assembly that would draw a constitution for the country—the independence of India was near—D’Souza’s name was proposed by Rajagopalachari to the Madras legislative assembly. He was elected to represent them at the constituent assembly of Delhi.

==Member of the Indian Constituent Assembly==
At the assembly (1946 to 1950), along with the Protestant leader [[Harendra Coomar Mookerjee|H.C. Mukherjee]], D’Souza ensured the rights of the minorities (especially of worship and education) were fully protected by the proposed text and the right to practice and propagate one’s religion were included in the constitution as fundamental rights of all citizens of India.

==Statesman and diplomat==
In Delhi he soon gained the trust and admiration of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first prime minister of independent India who often consulted him in educational matters and used his oratorical skill. At the instance of Nehru he was also involved in delicate diplomatic negotiations:
* He negotiated with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] the termination of the Portuguese [[Padroado]] system that was giving to [[Portugal]] an undue say in the appointment of [[bishops]] in India.
* He was involved in the negotiations with the [[French government]] leading ultimately to a peaceful transfer of the French colonial settlements ([[Chandannagar]], [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], etc.) to the new Independent India.
* On four occasions D’Souza was member of the Indian delegation to the [[United Nations|UNO]]’s yearly general session.
* His command of French, Spanish, Italian and German languages, besides English opened him many doors and he was often invited to give talks and lectures on Indian culture, history and politics, in various parts of the world.

==Indian Social Institute==
At the request of the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]], D’Souza founded in [[Pune]] (India) the [[Indian Social Institute]] (now in New-Delhi, 10, Institutional Area, Lodhi Road New Delhi), and started publishing a journal ''Social Action'' that has nowadays a large circulation in social and academic circles. That was in 1951.  He became its first Director (1951–1956). Later, in 1957, D’Souza was made the Assistant and adviser of the Superior General of the Jesuits ([[Jean-Baptiste Janssens]]) for Indian and Asian affairs. He returned to India in 1968 and spent his last years writing articles and books, giving lectures and courses.   Jerome D’Souza was one of the best known Jesuits of his times. Still many gratefully visit his tomb at Christ the King Church, in [[Loyola College, Chennai]] campus.

==Recognition==

In 1997, the Indian government issued a stamp to commemorate his birth centenary.

[[Image:John Cumming.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carte de visite]] depicting John Cumming, 1860s]]
'''John Cumming''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSE}} (10 November 1807&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Cumming, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 5 July 1881) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] clergyman.

==Life==

He was born in [[Fintray]] in [[Aberdeenshire]] and attended Aberdeen Grammar School and then stiudied Divinity at [[Aberdeen University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, Cumming was appointed to the [[Crown Court Church]] in [[Covent Garden]], London, a [[Church of Scotland]] congregation that catered for Scots living in London.  At the time, the congregation had approximately 80 members, but Cumming was able to grow his congregation to around 900, and he regularly preached to congregations of 500-600 on Sundays.

Cumming was a controversial figure in his day, [[George Eliot]] being the most prominent figure to criticize him for his anti-Catholicism, obsession with the [[End Times]], and perceived [[intellectual dishonesty]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 1853 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposer was Sir [[John Archibald Murray]].

Cumming retired in 1879.  In total, he published approximately 180 books during his lifetime.

He died on 5 July 1881 in [[Chiswick]] near [[London]] and was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He married Elizabeth Nicholson in 1833. She died in 1879.

==Views==
[[File:John Cumming Vanity Fair 13 April 1872.jpg|thumb|"The End of the World", as depicted by Adriano Cecioni in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'', 13 April 1872]]
Cumming was one of the most virulently [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] preachers of his day.  Several of his books attacked [[Catholicism]], including ''The Romish Church a Dumb Church'' (Arthur Hall, 1853) and ''Ritualism, the Highway to Rome'' (James Nisbet &amp; Co., 1867).  He gave public lectures denouncing [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] [[Nicholas Wiseman]] and [[John Henry Newman]].  ''[[The Times]]'' also frequently printed letters from Cumming in which he pointed to perceived misdeeds on the part of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Cumming also took a deep interest in [[Christian eschatology]], adhering to the [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]] school of Christian eschatology.  He believed that historical events such as the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] had fulfilled [[prophecies]] contained in the [[Bible|biblical]] Books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]].  He preached that the sixth [[Chronology of Revelation#The Seven Bowl Judgments|vial of judgment]] (discussed in Revelation 16) had been poured out in 1820.  Cumming therefore taught that [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]] would occur some time between 1848 and 1867.

'''Count Lajos Batthyány de Németújvár''' (10 February 1807 – 6 October 1849) was the first [[Prime Minister of Hungary]]. He was born in [[Pozsony]] (modern-day [[Bratislava]]) on 10 February 1807, and was executed by firing squad in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] on 6 October 1849, the same day as [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]].

==Career==
His father was Count [[Batthyány|József Sándor Batthyány]] (1777–1812), his mother Borbála Skerlecz (1779-1834). At an early age, he moved to [[Vienna]] with his mother and his brother after his parents' divorce. Batthyány had a private tutor, but his mother sent him to a boarding school and Battyhány rarely saw his mother again.

===Early years===
At the age of 16 Batthyány finished his studies at boarding school and attended the Academy in Zágráb (now [[University of Zagreb]], Croatia).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9526&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 he took a [[tour of duty]] in Italy for four years, where he was promoted to lieutenant and got his [[law degree]].

In 1830 he became a [[hereditary peer]]&lt;!-- this is UK specific, need better general term --&gt; in the [[Upper House]] in Hungary and took his seat in the Parliament, but at this time Battyhány was not a politician by nature.

In December 1834 he married [[Antónia Zichy]] (daughter of [[Károly Zichy]] and [[Antónia Batthyány]]). Their children were: [[Amália Batthyány]] (1837–1922), [[Ilona Batthyány]] (1842–1929) and [[Elemér Batthyány]] (1847–1932). Batthyány's friend said that Antónia (his wife) encouraged him to take on larger responsibilities in politics.

=== Batthyány, the Reform politician ===
Batthyány became more involved after the 1839–1840 [[diet (assembly)|diet]] in Pozsony and was the [[Leader of the Opposition]]. He drew up a reform plan for them. Batthyány advised employing [[stenographer]]s to record verbatim the proceedings of the Upper House starting in 1840.

Batthyány agreed with [[István Széchenyi]]'s views on economics and politics. At the beginning of the 1830s Batthyány was one of the people who promoted [[horse breeding]] in Hungary. Later they expanded into other animal breeding and established the [[Association of Hungarian Economy]]. Batthyány, following Széchenyi, supported breeding [[silkworm]]s: he planted more than 50,000 [[mulberry]] trees on his farm to cultivate them. The [[Vas County (former)|Vas shire county]] and the Economics Association of Szombathely were founded with Batthyány's help.

At the start he agreed with Széchenyi that the new noblemen and aristocrats had to lead the new reform movement, but Batthyány's views were much closer to that of the nobility. Because of this Batthyány tried to bite his tongue when dealing with Széchenyi and [[Lajos Kossuth]]. From 1843 onward he started to work with Kossuth.

In the 1843–1844 parliament Batthyány was the Leader of the Opposition for the entire parliament, and criticised the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s internal affairs and foreign policy.

After the [[dissolution of parliament]] Batthyány moved to Pest and in 1845 he was elected as the chairman of the Central Election Office. He had an important role in the other economic associations and set up the {{lang|hu|[[Védegylet society|Védegylet]]}} (roughly: "Defence society" ). On 15 March 1847 an amalgamation of the Hungarian Leftist movements (the Maverick Party) was founded and Batthyány became its first President.

Batthyány supported Kossuth both morally and financially. Kossuth became the representative for [[{{Hungarian county name|Pest}}]] in the 1847 diet. After this Batthyány was the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House while Kossuth had the same role in the [[Lower House]].

=== The Batthyány Government === &lt;!-- [[Batthyány Government]] links here --&gt;
[[File:Tyroler Batthyany kormany.jpg|left|thumb|Batthyány's government]]
{{main|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}

Batthyány was part of the delegation to the Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria]]. They insisted Hungary's government be supreme in its territory. On 17 March 1848 the Emperor assented and Batthyány created the first Hungarian Diet. On 23 March 1848, as [[head of government]], Batthyány commended his administration to the Diet.

The first task of the new government was to work out the revolution's policies. After these were agreed, the government began to take action on 11 April 1848. At that time the internal affairs and foreign policy of Hungary were unstable, and Batthyány faced many problems. His first and most important act was to organise the armed forces and the [[local government]]. He insisted that the Austrian army, when in Hungary, would come under Hungarian law, and this was conceded by the Austrian Empire. He tried to repatriate conscripted soldiers to Hungary. He established the [[Organisation of Militiamen]]&lt;!-- this is called other things in related articles, maybe worth searching for Home Guard or LDV but a long shot there --&gt;, whose job was to ensure internal security. In May 1848 he started to organise the independent [[Hungarian Revolutionary Army]] and recruited men into it. Batthyány took control of the Organisation of Militiamen until [[Lázár Mészáros]] returned. At the same time, he was [[Minister of War of Hungary|Minister of War]].

Batthyány was a very capable leader, but he was in the middle of a clash between the Austrian monarchy and the Hungarian separatists. He was devoted to the [[constitutional monarchy]] and aimed to uphold the constitution, but the Emperor was dissatisfied with his work. On 29 August, with the assent of parliament, Batthyány and [[Ferenc Deák]] went to the Emperor to ask him to order the Serbs to capitulate and to stop Jelačić, who was planning to attack Hungary. At the same time, Batthyány made Jelačić the offer that Croatia - as part of the [[lands of the Hungarian Crown]] -, could separate from it peacefully. Batthyány's efforts were unsuccessful: even though the Emperor formally relieved Jelačić of his duties, in practice Jelačić and his army invaded Hungary on 11 September 1848.

So Batthyány and his government resigned, except for Kossuth, Szemere, and Mészáros. Later, at the request of [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary]], Batthyány became Prime Minister again. On 13 September Batthyány announced a rebellion and requested that the Palatine lead it. However the Palatine, under orders from the Emperor, resigned his position and left Hungary.

[[File:BATTHY~1.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Plaque in Batthyány Street, [[Budapest]], Hungary]]

The Emperor did not recognise the new government on 25 September. He also invalidated Batthyány's leadership and nominated [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] as the leader of the Hungarian army. But Lamberg was assassinated by the rebels in Pest on 28 September. Meanwhile, Batthyány travelled to Vienna again to seek a compromise with the Emperor.

Batthyány was successful in his hurried efforts to organize the [[Hungarian Revolutionary Army]]: the new army defeated the Croatians on 29 September at the [[Battle of Pákozd]].

Batthyány realised that he could not compromise with the Emperor, so on 2 October he resigned again and nominated [[Miklós Vay]] as his successor. At the same time, Batthyány resigned his seat in parliament.

=== Resignation ===
As an ordinary soldier, Batthyány joined [[József Vidos]]' army, and fought against general [[Kuzman Todorović]], but on 11 October 1848 he fell off his horse and broke his arm.

After Batthyány recovered he was again elected as a politician. Batthyány didn't want the Parliament to move to [[Debrecen]]. Because of his proposal the Parliament sent a delegation (including Batthyány himself) to General [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] to meet with him as the Parliament wanted to know Windisch-Grätz's purpose. But the general didn't want to meet with Batthyány, only with the other members of the delegation.

On 8 January 1849 Batthyány went back to Pest, where he was captured at the [[Károly Palace]] and imprisoned in the Budai barracks. When the Hungarian army was nearer Pest, Batthyány was taken away to Pozsony, [[Ljubljana]] and Olmütz (now [[Olomouc]], Czech Republic). The Hungarians tried to rescue him many times, but Batthyány asked them not to. Batthyány insisted that his actions were legitimate and that the court had no jurisdiction.

==Execution==
[[File:Grof batthyany lajos elso miniszterelnokunk kivegzese.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Batthyány's execution]]
On 16 August 1849 in Olmütz the Military Court sent Batthyány to his fate. At first they wanted to confiscate his possessions and give him a prison sentence, but under pressure from [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] and the Austrian Empire they instead sentenced Batthyány to death.

The Hungarians carried Batthyány to Pest, because they hoped that Haynau (in the name of the Emperor) would give him mercy, but Haynau sentenced him to [[hanging|hang]]. In her last visit, Batthyány's wife smuggled a small sword into the prison. Batthyány tried to commit suicide by cutting his [[jugular veins]], but he failed in the attempt. Because of the scars on his neck, the court changed the sentence to [[execution by firing squad]].

On the evening of 6 October Batthyány was drugged and because of this he walked to the [[New Building]]. He had lost much blood because of his suicide attempt so that two people had to escort him. He was relieved to see that there were no [[gallows]]. [[Johan Kempen]], the commander of the military district in Pest and Buda&lt;ref&gt;later, in 1855, he was given the [[Freedom of the City]] of Pest.{{Citation

Batthyány knelt in front of the firing squad and shouted: {{lang|hu|"Éljen a haza! Rajta, vadászok!"}} ("Long live my country! Come on, huntsmen!").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Batthyány's funeral was in the city centre, in the vault of the Greyfriars Church. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], in 1870 his remains were moved to the newly built [[mausoleum]] in the [[Kerepesi Cemetery]].

Batthyány's parliamentary speeches are preserved in contemporary diaries and political newspapers. His essay on cultivating [[sugar beet]] was printed in the periodical {{lang|hu|Magyar Gazda}} in 1842.

He was the only child born to the [[Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol|6th Marquess of Bristol]] and his second wife, [[Lady Juliet Tadgell|Lady Juliet Wentworth-FitzWilliam]], and was [[heir presumptive]] to the Marquessate. At [[Yale University]], Hervey founded the [[Rockingham Club]], a society for the upper class royalty and aristocracy. He had [[clinical depression]] as an adult and committed suicide in 1998.

==Family==
Hervey's mother was the only child of the wealthy [[Peter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 8th Earl FitzWilliam|8th Earl Fitzwilliam]]; she was 13 years old when her father died in a [[light aircraft|small aircraft]] crash that also killed his intended second wife, [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington]], sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], in 1948. Lady Juliet was the sole heir to her father's estate, then estimated at £45 million. As an adult, she ran a family [[stud farm]].

Hervey's parents married in 1960, his father for the second time, his mother for the first. He was the only child of that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage edited by Peter Townend, 105th edition, London, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol]], who also had significant inherited wealth, some of which he invested into new enterprises.  He was once tagged "[[Mayfair]]'s No. 1 Playboy," in a series of "life story" articles he wrote after serving a gaol sentence for jewel robbery, a crime he claimed he had committed for a dare.

Hervey was the second heir to the title and estates of the [[Marquess of Bristol]] after his elder half-brother [[John Hervey, 7th Marquess of Bristol|John, the 7th Marquess]], the only child of his father's first marriage. Nicholas and John were fond of one another.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|p=228|title=The House of Hervey|first=Michael|last=De-la-Noy|publisher=Constable|isbn=1-84119-309-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nicholas was eleven years old, his mother divorced his father and married his 60-year-old friend, [[Somerset de Chair]] (d. 1996), with whom five years later she had a daughter, Helena de Chair.  In 1996, his mother married for a third time and is now known as Lady Juliet Tadgell.

Hervey's father's final marriage was to his private secretary, [[Yvonne Hervey, Marchioness of Bristol|Yvonne Sutton]], and with her had three further children, [[Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol]], at whose Roman Catholic christening Hervey stood godfather, and two daughters  [[Victoria Hervey|Lady Victoria]] and [[Isabella Hervey|Lady Isabella Hervey]].

==Education and clubs==
Nicholas was known as a keen traditionalist. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and the [[Royal Agricultural College]], [[Cirencester]]. At Eton he was "an industrious boy with plenty of initiative";&lt;ref&gt;p.227 THE HOUSE OF HERVEY by Michael De-la-Noy (Constable,  {{ISBN|1-84119-309-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; he took part in the House debate, and during his last two halves (terms) was in the House Library (i.e., a [[prefect]]). He founded and was president of the Burlington Society, a [[fine arts]] society with an emphasis on [[modern art]]. He was also a member of the Agricultural and Political Societies, leaving Eton at Christmas 1979 with [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] in French, Spanish and Economics. At Yale he took a degree in the [[Art history|History of Art]] and studied Economics in depth.

In 1981 he founded the [[Rockingham Club]], a Yale [[social club]] for descendants of royalty and aristocracy, which was later modified to allow membership to the children of the "super-wealthy".  The Club and Nicholas Hervey were profiled in [[Andy Warhol|Andy Warhol's]] ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine but was dissolved shortly thereafter in 1986.  (Nicholas' older half-brother John was posthumously reported to be a friend of Andy Warhol.) He was a member, through his mother, of the [[Turf Club (Gentlemen's Club)|Turf Club]], a [[gentlemen's club]] in [[Carlton House Terrace]] in [[central London]] connected to horse racing.
His sister Helena attended Bristol University.

==Monarchist League and politics==
[[File:NicholasH.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lord Nicholas, as he appeared in the Daily Telegraph's 1998 obituary]]

He was a leading member of the [[International Monarchist League]].  He was elected President of its International Youth Association (under 21s) in February 1979 and recruited numerous new members.&lt;ref&gt;''The Monarchist'' (July 1979, no. 55)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 he became a Vice-Chancellor of the League proper, and made the formal toast to the guests, [[Armin, Prince of Lippe|The Prince]]&lt;ref&gt;see [[Fürst]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Princess [[Principality of Lippe|
of Lippe]], at the League's Annual Dinner in the Cholmondeley Room, the [[House of Lords]], on 1 April 1986.&lt;ref&gt;''The Monarchist'', February 1987, no. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In later years he allowed his membership and vice-chancellorship to lapse.

Through the League, which his father had subsidised for many years, he became friendly with [[Gregory Lauder-Frost]], who introduced him to numerous right-wing conservative activities. One such event, on 25 September 1989, was the [[Western Goals Institute]] dinner at [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]], chaired by [[Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley|Lord Sudeley]], for the [[President of El Salvador]], [[Alfredo Cristiani]], and his inner cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph and Times, "Court &amp; Social" columns, 26 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness, bankruptcy, and death==
In 1983, Lord Nicholas was diagnosed as with mild [[schizophrenia]] which was treated with medication. In 1986, he graduated from [[Yale University]] and, in 1991, voluntarily underwent treatment in a clinic.

In 1991, he was forced to declare [[bankruptcy]] due to lawyers' debts of £38,000 (which his trustees refused to fund),&lt;ref name=bristol&gt;{{cite news|last=Utley |first=Tom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/01/29/nhan29.html |title=Marquess of Bristol's heir found hanged |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 January 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313090440/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1998%2F01%2F29%2Fnhan29.html |archivedate=13 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; following the failure of the lawsuit, he and his elder half-brother brought against the principal beneficiaries of the will of their father, i.e., his third wife and their young children. His own mother, while on the [[Sunday Times Rich List]] (in 2003 her wealth was estimated at £45,000,000), did not act to prevent the bankruptcy, which immediately preceded his entry into a clinic.  She subsequently declared that "he was never himself again" after the clinic stay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He had [[Clinical depression|severe depression]] and became increasingly reclusive. His landlady said that he "drew no shred of comfort from the high rank and great riches to which he was born" and that "he was a [[recluse]], in the sense that he was heavily sedated and slept all day – a typical schizophrenic. He was very quiet, very [[Old Etonian]]. He was a nice guy, but very 'out of it'. Nobody visited him here, except sometimes we would hear someone come and take him out to dinner."&lt;ref name=bristol/&gt;

Lord Nicholas Hervey was found dead in his [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] flat on 26 January 1998 at the age of 36, having hanged himself.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news|title=Heir found dead|newspaper=The Times|location=London|date=29 January 1998|p=5|accessdate=21 September 2016|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=kccl&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF501256822&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never married and had no children.

His half-brother, [[John Hervey, 7th Marquess of Bristol]], died less than a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Sarah. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/11/sarahhall Lord who blew £7m on heroin dies aged 44], ''The Guardian'', 11 January 1999. Accessed 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''Luis Jorge Mayser Ardaya''' (born July 21, 1928, San Ignacio de Velasco, [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]]) is a [[Bolivia]]n politician. He is the general secretary of the [[Bolivian Socialist Falange]] (FSB).&lt;ref name="par"/&gt; Mayser joined FSB at the age of twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldiario.net/noticias/2009/2009_02/nt090217/1_03opn.php|title=Noticias EL DIARIO - Primera página|work=eldiario.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayser was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1997, from the single-member constituency 58 in Santa Cruz (covering areas in the provinces Velasco, Chiquitos, Angel Sandoval and German Busch) on a [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] (ADN) ticket. At the time he was the sole FSB parliamentarian.&lt;ref name="par"&gt;''Directorio: 1997 - 2002''.

'''Mary Tyler Moore''' (December 29, 1936 – January 25, 2017) was an American actress, known for her roles in the television [[sitcom]]s ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' (1970–1977), in which she starred as [[Mary Richards]], a single woman working as a local news producer in [[Minneapolis]], and ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (1961–1966), in which she played [[The Dick Van Dyke Show#Characters|Laura Petrie]], a former dancer turned [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] homemaker, wife and mother.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen, Yael.

Due to her roles on both ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', in which her characters often broke from stereotypical images of women and pushed gender norms, Moore became a cultural icon and served as an inspiration for many younger actresses, professional women, and feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/25/how-mary-tyler-moore-changed-america-with-feminism-tv-and-comedy.html|title=How Mary Tyler Moore Changed America With Feminism, TV, and Comedy|first=Tim|last=Teeman|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/05/the-real-feminist-impact-of-i-the-mary-tyler-moore-show-i-was-behind-the-scenes/275875/|title=The Real Feminist Impact of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' Was Behind the Scenes|first=Hope|last=Reese|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/jan/25/mary-tyler-moore-appreciation-true-icon-feminism|title=Mary Tyler Moore: a true cultural icon who changed the face of television|first=John|last=Patterson|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later active in charity work and various political causes, particularly the issues of [[animal rights]], [[vegetarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[diabetes mellitus type 1|diabetes]].

====Early appearances====

Moore decided at age 17 that she wanted to be a dancer. Her television career began with Moore's first job as "Happy Hotpoint", a tiny elf dancing on [[Hotpoint]] [[home appliance|appliances]] in [[television commercial|TV commercials]] during the 1950s series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet|Ozzie and Harriet]]''.&lt;ref name="AA61-65" /&gt; After appearing in 39 Hotpoint commercials in five days, she received approximately $6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History|last=Weiner|first=Ed|author2=Editors of TV Guide|year=1992|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-096914-8|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became pregnant while still working as "Happy" and Hotpoint ended her work when it was too difficult to conceal her pregnancy with the elf costume.&lt;ref name=AA61-65&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore modeled anonymously on the covers of a number of record albums and auditioned for the role of the older daughter of [[Danny Thomas]] for his long-running TV show, but was turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mural of Album Cover Art: Narrative Guide|url=http://www.vinylrecordday.com/pdf/mural_narrativeguide.pdf|publisher=Vinyl Record Day|accessdate=26 January 2017|page=4|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Dyke"/&gt; Much later, Thomas explained that "she missed it by a nose... no daughter of mine could ever have a nose that small."&lt;ref name="Van Dyke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Dick|title=My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business: A Memoir|date=2011|publisher=Crown Archetype|isbn=9780307592262|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZRvfn1BCoHwC&amp;pg=PT79&amp;lpg=PT79&amp;dq=no+daughter+of+mine+could+have+that+nose+Mary+Moore#v=onepage&amp;q=no%20daughter%20of%20mine%20could%20have%20that%20nose%20Mary%20Moore&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's first regular television role was as a mysterious and glamorous telephone receptionist on ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''. On the show, Moore's voice was heard, but only her legs appeared on camera, adding to the character's mystique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/tyler-moore-dick-36447.aspx|title=Mary Tyler Moore's Big Break |publisher=Tvguide.com|date=May 6, 2004 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; About this time, she guest-starred on [[John Cassavetes]]'s [[NBC]] detective series ''[[Johnny Staccato]]''. She also guest-starred in ''[[Bachelor Father (U.S. TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' in the episode titled "Bentley and the Big Board". In 1960, she was featured in two episodes of the [[William Bendix]]-[[Doug McClure]] NBC [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Overland Trail (TV series)|Overland Trail]]'' and several months later in the first episode of NBC's one-season ''[[The Tab Hunter Show]]'', a [[sitcom]] starring the former teen idol as a bachelor cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tab Hunter Show|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/tab_hunter_show/|publisher=Television Obscurities|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Moore appeared in several big parts in movies and on television, including ''[[Bourbon Street Beat]]'', ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Wanted Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' and ''[[Lock-Up (TV series)|Lock-Up]]''.

====''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' (1961–1966)====

In 1961, [[Carl Reiner]] cast Moore in ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', a weekly series based on Reiner's own life and career as a writer for [[Sid Caesar]]'s television [[variety show]] ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', telling the cast from the outset that it would run for no more than five years. The show was produced by [[Danny Thomas]]' company, and Thomas himself recommended her. He remembered Moore as "the girl with three names" whom he had turned down earlier.&lt;ref name=paley&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070301201915/http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=43 Profile] the [[Paley Center for Media]]. Retrieved April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's energetic comic performances as Van Dyke's character's wife, begun at age 24 (11 years Van Dyke's junior), made both the actress and her signature tight capri pants extremely popular, and she became internationally known. When she won her first [[Emmy Award]] for her portrayal of Laura Petrie,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; she said, "I know this will never happen again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/mary-tyler-moore-star-mary-tyler-moore-show/story?id=44534207|title=Mary Tyler Moore, Star of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show,' Dies at 80|last=Fisher|first=Lucina|date=2017-01-25|website=ABC News|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' (1970–1977)====

In 1970, after having appeared earlier in a pivotal one-hour musical special called ''Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman'', Moore and husband [[Grant Tinker]] successfully pitched a sitcom centered on Moore to [[CBS]]. ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' is a half-hour newsroom sitcom featuring [[Ed Asner]] as her gruff boss [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]]. Moore's show proved so popular that three other regular characters, [[Valerie Harper]] as [[Rhoda (TV series)|Rhoda Morgenstern]], [[Cloris Leachman]] as [[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis Lindstrom]] and [[Ed Asner]] as [[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]] were also spun off into their own series. The premise of the single working woman's life, alternating during the program between work and home, became a television staple.&lt;ref name=paley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/mary-tyler-moore-9413674|title=Mary Tyler Moore Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During season six of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', Moore appeared in a musical/variety special for CBS titled ''Mary's Incredible Dream'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=190–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured [[Ben Vereen]]. In 1978, she starred in a second CBS special, ''How to Survive the '70s and Maybe Even Bump Into Happiness''. This time, she received significant support from a strong lineup of guest stars: [[Bill Bixby]], [[John Ritter]], [[Harvey Korman]] and Dick Van Dyke. In the 1978–79 season, Moore attempted to try the musical-variety genre by starring in two unsuccessful CBS variety series in a row: ''[[Mary (1978 TV series)|Mary]]'', which featured [[David Letterman]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]] and [[Dick Shawn]] in the supporting cast. CBS canceled the series. In March 1979, the network brought Moore back in a new, retooled show, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Hour]]'', which was described as a "sit-var" (part situation comedy/part variety series) with Moore portraying a TV star putting on a variety show.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; The program lasted just 11 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Virginia|title=Mary Tyler Moore, Who Incarnated the Modern Woman on TV, Dies at 80|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/television/mary-tyler-moore-dead.html|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=The New York Times|date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1985–86 season, she returned to CBS in a series titled ''[[Mary (1985 TV series)|Mary]]'', which suffered from poor reviews, sagging ratings, and internal strife within the production crew. According to Moore, she asked CBS to pull the show as she was unhappy with the direction of the program and the producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also starred in the short-lived ''[[Annie McGuire (TV series)|Annie McGuire]]'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1995|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, after another lengthy break from TV series work, Moore was cast as tough, unsympathetic newspaper owner Louise "the Dragon" Felcott on the CBS drama ''[[New York News]]'', her third series in which her character worked in the news industry. As with her previous series ''Mary'' (1985), Moore quickly became unhappy with the nature of her character and was negotiating with producers to get out of her contract for the series when it was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grady|first1=Constance|title=Watch Mary Tyler Moore play against type in this forgotten 1995 drama|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/25/14389972/mary-tyler-moore-new-york-news-madeline-kahn-fabio-1995-cbs|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=Vox|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Moore had a cameo and a guest-starring role as herself on two episodes of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. She also guest-starred on [[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s next TV show, ''[[The Ellen Show]]'', in 2001. In 2004, Moore reunited with her ''Dick Van Dyke Show'' castmates for a reunion "episode" called ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,634109,00.html|title=Review:The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited|publisher=Ew.com|date=May 14, 2004|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Moore guest-starred as Christine St. George, a high-strung host of a fictional TV show, on three episodes of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-01-23-mtm-70s-show_x.htm|title=Love is all around for Moore on '70s'|last=Keveney|first=Bill|date=January 23, 2006|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's scenes were shot on the same soundstage where ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' was filmed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moore made a guest appearance on the season two premiere of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', which starred her former co-star [[Betty White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Mary-Tyler-Moore-1024989.aspx|title=Mary Tyler Moore to Guest-Star on Hot in Cleveland Season Premiere|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the first time that White and Moore had worked together since ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' ended in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/tv/index.ssf/2010/11/mary_tyler_moore_to_guest_star.html "Mary Tyler Moore to guest star on 'Hot in Cleveland'"], November 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2013, Moore reprised her role on ''Hot in Cleveland'' in a season four episode which not only reunited Moore and White, but also former MTM cast members [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Valerie Harper]] and [[Georgia Engel]] as well. This reunion coincided with Harper's public announcement that she had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and was given only a few months to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valerie Harper, Mary Tyler Moore, Betty White &amp; More Reunite On ‘Hot In Cleveland' (Photos)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/01/valerie-harper-mary-tyler-moore-betty-white-hot-in-cleveland_n_3852277.html|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theater===
Moore appeared in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays. She starred in ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway]]'' with [[James Naughton]], which opened on Broadway at the [[Royale Theatre]] on February 24, 1980, and ran for 96 performances, and in ''[[Sweet Sue (play)|Sweet Sue]]'', which opened at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on January 8, 1987, later transferred to the Royale Theatre, and ran for 164 performances. She was the star of a new musical version of ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (musical)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' in December 1966, but the show, titled ''Holly Golightly'', was a flop that closed in previews before opening on Broadway. In reviews of performances in Philadelphia and Boston, critics "murdered" the play in which Moore claimed to be singing with bronchial pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UGAaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5CcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5182,1978228&amp;dq=holly-golightly+mary-tyler-moore&amp;hl=en |title=Boston and Philadelphia Critics Broke Mary Tyler Moore's Heart |publisher=News.google.com |date=December 4, 1966 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Tyler Moore 1988.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Moore at the [[40th Primetime Emmy Awards]] (1988)]]

Moore appeared in previews of the [[Neil Simon]] play ''[[Rose's Dilemma]]'' at the off-Broadway [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] in December 2003 but quit the production after receiving a critical letter from Simon instructing her to "learn your lines or get out of my play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|url=http://nymag.com/nymag/columns/culturebusiness/n_9651|title=Comedy of Manners|publisher=Nymag.com|date=December 22, 2003|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore had been using an earpiece on stage to feed her lines to the repeatedly rewritten play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83370-Dust-Settled-Neil-Simons-Roses-Dilemma-Opens-Dec-18-Off-Broadway|title=Dust Settled, Neil Simon's Rose's Dilemma Opens Dec. 18 Off-Broadway|publisher=Playbill.com|accessdate=August 14, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015230040/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83370-Dust-Settled-Neil-Simons-Roses-Dilemma-Opens-Dec-18-Off-Broadway|archivedate=October 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Moore and her production company produced five plays: ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[The Octette Bridge Club]]'', ''[[A Day in the Death of Joe Egg|Joe Egg]]'', ''[[Benefactors (play)|Benefactors]]'', and ''Safe Sex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=23123|title=Mary Tyler Moore – Broadway Cast &amp; Staff – IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
Moore made her film debut in 1961's ''[[X-15 (film)|X-15]]''. Following her success on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', she appeared in a string of films in the late 1960s (after signing an exclusive contract with [[Universal Pictures]]), including 1967's hit ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'', as a would-be actress in 1920s New York who is taken under the wing of [[Julie Andrews]]' title character, and the 1968 films ''[[What's So Bad About Feeling Good?]]'' with [[George Peppard]], and ''[[Don't Just Stand There!]]'' with [[Robert Wagner]].

In 1969, she starred opposite [[Elvis Presley]] as a nun in ''[[Change of Habit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Tim|title=No 'Ordinary' life: Highlights from the career of Mary Tyler Moore|url=http://m.startribune.com/no-ordinary-life-highlights-from-the-career-of-mary-tyler-moore/411802516/?section=variety|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's future television castmate [[Ed Asner]] also appeared in that film as a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daniel|first1=Douglass|title=Lou Grant: The Making of Tv's Top Newspaper Drama|date=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815626756|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--About them, Moore was asked which one was most her type?

Moore appeared in the [[television movie]] ''[[Run a Crooked Mile]]'' (1969), and after the conclusion of her series in 1977, she starred in several prominent movies for television, including ''[[First, You Cry]]'' (1978), which brought her an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie|Emmy]] nomination for portraying NBC correspondent [[Betty Rollin]]'s struggle with breast cancer.

==Philanthropy==
In addition to her acting work, Moore was the International Chairman of [[JDRF]] (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=100990 |title=Board of Directors, JDRF |publisher=Jdrf.org |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527213445/http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=100990 |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, she used her celebrity to help raise funds and awareness of [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes mellitus type 1]].

In 2007, in honor of Moore's dedication to the Foundation, JDRF created the "Forever Moore" research initiative which will support JDRF's Academic Research and Development and JDRF's Clinical Development Program. The program works on translating basic research advances into new treatments and technologies for those living with type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdrf.org/files/General_Files/forevermoore/index.html |title=Forevermoore |publisher=Jdrf.org |date=October 28, 2003 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911230539/http://www.jdrf.org/files/General_Files/forevermoore/index.html |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore appeared as herself in 1996 on an episode of the [[Ellen DeGeneres]] sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''.

In honor of her father, George Tyler Moore, a lifelong [[American Civil War]] enthusiast, in 1995 Moore donated funds to acquire an historic structure in [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]], for Shepherd College (now [[Shepherd University]]) to be used as a center for Civil War studies. The center, named the [[George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War]], is housed in the historic [[Conrad Shindler House]] (c. 1795), which is named in honor of her great-great-great-grandfather, who owned the structure from 1815 to 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherd.edu/gtmcweb/about_history.html |title=The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War |publisher=Shepherd.edu |date=November 16, 1993 |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615190233/http://www.shepherd.edu/gtmcweb/about_history.html |archivedate=June 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore also contributed to the renovation of the house used as headquarters during 1861–62 by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]]. Use of the house had been offered to Jackson by its owner, Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Tilghman Moore, commander of the [[4th Virginia Infantry]] and a great-grandfather of Mary Tyler Moore.&lt;ref name=genea/&gt;

==Politics==
During the 1960s and 1970s, Moore had a reputation as a liberal or moderate, although she endorsed President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When Hollywood Was Right|author=Chritchlow, Donald T.|page=205|year=2013|isbn=9780521199186|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; She endorsed President [[Jimmy Carter]] for re-election in a [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] campaign television ad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popscreen.com/v/6yHwS/Historic-Campaign-Ads-_-Mary-Tyler-Moore "Historic Campaign Ads 'Mary Tyler Moore' Carter, 1980"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232626/http://www.popscreen.com/v/6yHwS/Historic-Campaign-Ads-_-Mary-Tyler-Moore |date=May 25, 2014 }} ''Popscreen''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, friend and former co-star [[Ed Asner]] said during an interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' that Moore "has become much more conservative of late". [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of the aforementioned program, previously stated that Moore had been a viewer of his show and that her political views had leaned conservative in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2011/05/18/ed-asner-playing-warren-buffett-new-film-president-obama/|title=Ed Asner on Playing Warren Buffett in New Film, President Obama|author=|date=May 18, 2011|work=foxnews.com|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Parade'' magazine article from March 22, 2009, Moore identified herself as a libertarian centrist who watches [[Fox News]]. She stated, "...when one looks at what's happened to television, there are so few shows that interest me. I do watch a lot of Fox News. I like [[Charles Krauthammer]] and Bill O'Reilly... If [[John McCain|McCain]] had asked me to campaign for him, I would have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://parade.com/130517/kevinsessums/mary-tyler-moores-lifetime-of-challenges/|title=Mary Tyler Moore's Lifetime of Challenges|newspaper=Parade|date=March 22, 2009|first=Kevin|last= Sessums|accessdate= May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the 2013 PBS series ''Pioneers of Television,'' Moore said that she was recruited to join the feminist movement of the 1970s by [[Gloria Steinem]] but did not agree with Steinem's views. Moore said she believed that women have an important role in raising children and that she did not believe in Steinem's view that women owe it to themselves to have a career.&lt;ref name="pioneers-of-television"&gt;PBS, Television Series: Pioneers of Comedy, episode "Funny Ladies."

He worked for a time as a translator and scout{{sfn|Richens|1977}}{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1960|p=1}} and then managed a ranch where he provided supplies to the soldiers at the fort.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} Her mother was a full-blood Apache and the daughter of Nadischaay.{{sfn|U.S. Indian Census|1909|p=151}} Velasquez and her siblings grew up on their father's farm, helping with farm chores. She attended three years of school, but was forced to leave in the [[1918 flu pandemic]] to help with sick relatives.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}

Though she was unable to return to school, Velasquez became fluent in three languages: [[Apache language|Apache]], Spanish, and English. She read newspapers widely.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Adley-SantaMaria|1999|p=16}} Velasquez first married Kurt Johnson{{sfn|''The White Mountain Independent''|2012}} and then around 1936,{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}} married Peter Kessay Riley,{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1987|p=53}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1990|p=11}} with whom she raised her five children, all of whom were also trilingual, and to whom she stressed the importance of gaining an education.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}}{{sfn|Adley-SantaMaria|1999|p=16}} She farmed as her father had, raising corn, potatoes, pumpkin and squash, as well as turkey, goat and sheep.{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}}

==Tribal career==
In 1958, Riley became the first woman elected to serve on the White Mountain Apache Tribal Council.{{sfn|Arizona Women's Hall of Fame|1988}} She served on the health, education and welfare committee of the tribe and at various times, chaired the committee.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1960|p=15}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1963|p=8}} She made numerous trips to both the state capital, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and federal capital in [[Washington, D. C.]], lobbying on behalf of the tribe.{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1960|p=1}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=256}} In an effort to improve situations for tribal members, she evaluated many programs for both economic and socio-cultural gains, looking at federal programs such as [[Job Corps]]{{sfn|MacEarian|1965|p=40}} the [[Boy Scouts of America]],{{sfn|''The Arizona Daily Sun''|1959|p=8}} and [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] loan programs for economic development. Riley represented three districts of the reservation{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}} and was instrumental in projects, such as the Alchesay-Williams Creek National Fish Hatchery Complex, the Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO), and the [[Sunrise Park Resort|Sunrise Park Ski Resort and Hotel]], among others, to expand the tribal enterprises and provide economic stability for the tribe.{{sfn|White|1986|p=10}}{{sfn|McDowell|1967|p=132}}{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}}

Ground was broken for FATCO in 1962 and by 1963 had replaced the hiring of outside operators to manage the timber reserves of the tribe. By managing their own lumber harvests and operating three saw mills, the tribe was able to provide both jobs for tribal members and goods to sell to a wider clientele.{{sfn|Sheridan|Parezo|1996|p=89}}{{sfn|Cavanaugh|1962|p=12}} Around the same time, the Alchesay-Williams Hatchery was developed to stock the local lakes which had been created on the reservation and protect species listed as [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]]. Employment opportunities for tribal members were increased through jobs at the hatchery, related jobs in the tourism sector, and additional revenues were garnered through the sale of fishing licenses.{{sfn|Behnke|2010|p=129}} One of the largest projects was to convert 1.6 million acres of their lands into the Sunrise Park Resort. Constructing 20 recreational lakes, campsites, fishing and hunting venues, a ski resort, and hotels, the Tribal Council utilized their lands to generate a year-round tourist industry.{{sfn|Rolland|1972|p=26}}{{sfn|McDowell|1967|p=132}}

Riley was interviewed as part of an [[Oral history preservation|Oral History Project]] sponsored by the Arizona State Department of Libraries and Archives in 1977.{{sfn|Richens|1977|p=1-2}} After twenty years on the council, Riley retired in 1978.{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1985|p=256}} She was honored by the state in 1984 during the Statehood Day Celebrations for her leadership and development.{{sfn|''The Arizona Daily Star''|1984|p=14}} Profits from FATCO were used to build the Mary V. Riley Building, which houses the tribal educational department.{{sfn|Sheridan|Parezo|1996|p=89}}

==Death and legacy==
Riley died on October 5, 1987 at White Mountain River Indian Hospital in [[Whiteriver, Arizona]].{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|1987|p=53}} Posthumously, she was inducted into the [[Arizona Women's Hall of Fame]], in 1988.{{sfn|Conner|1988|p=43}}

Chalali was born in [[Montreuil-sous-Bois]], Paris, to Algerian parents. His family is originally from the village of Ighil Ouantar, in the [[Seddouk District]] of [[Béjaïa Province|Béjaïa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.competition.dz/Actualite/Chalali-:-%C2%ABLes-JO-de-Londres-j%E2%80%99y-crois-!%C2%BB Chalali: «Les JO de Londres, j’y crois !»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318020633/http://www.competition.dz/Actualite/Chalali-:-%C2%ABLes-JO-de-Londres-j%E2%80%99y-crois-!%C2%BB |date=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club career ==

=== France ===

Chalali began his career with [[CA Romainville]] before he was scouted in summer 2003 from [[Le Havre AC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hac.infoceane.com/equipe/mohamed-chalali.html Le Havre AC Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315094635/http://hac.infoceane.com/equipe/mohamed-chalali.html |date=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Ligue 2]] debut on 2 November 2007, coming on as a substitute against [[EA Guingamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071105094210/http://hac.infoceane.com/match/03-11-2007-hac-guingamp.html HAC 2 – 1 Guingamp – Ligue 2]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2009 he agreed a contract with [[LB Châteauroux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foot-national.com/flashes-9273.html Le Havre: Départ de Chalali (Chateauroux)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nigel R. Franks''' (born 21 August 1956) is an English emeritus professor of [[Animal Behaviour]] and [[Ecology]] at the [[University of Bristol]]. He obtained a BSc and PhD in biology at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/people/nigel-r-franks/index.html |title=Professor Nigel Franks |website=University of Bristol |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After receiving his BSc in 1977 he began his PhD, during which he spent two years doing field work in Panama on army ants with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. He was awarded the Thomas Henry Huxley Award in 1980 from the Zoological Society of London for the best British PhD in Zoology. He then received a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the [[1851_Research_Fellowship|Royal Commission for the Great Exhibition of 1851]] allowing him to undertake postdoctoral work under [[Edward O. Wilson]] at [[Harvard University]] before becoming a lecturer at the [[University of Bath]] in 1982, later being promoted to full professor in 1995. He moved to the [[University of Bristol]] in 2001. He is renowned for his studies of collective animal behaviour, particularly of [[ant]] colonies. His Ant Lab at Bristol pioneered the use of Temnothorax ([[Temnothorax albipennis]]) as a model ant species for the study of collective [[decision-making]] and [[complex systems]]. In a 2009 profile in [[Science Magazine|Science]] he discusses his pioneering use of radio-frequency identification tags (RFID) glued to the backs of each ant for tracking individuals in their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morell, Virginia|year=2009 |title=Watching as Ants Go Marching--and Deciding--One by One|journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5919 |pages=1284–1285 |doi=10.1126/science.323.5919.1284|pmid=19264998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His book ''Social evolution in ants'' with Andrew Bourke was an important contribution to the understanding of [[kin selection]] theory and sex ratio theory with respect to [[social evolution]] in insects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bourke |first1=F.G. |last2=Franks |first2=Nigel R. |date=1995 |title=Social evolution in ants  |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 9780691044262}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while his co-authored book ''Self-organization in biological systems'' has been cited well over 3000 times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Camazine |first1=Scott |last2=Deneubourg |first2=Jean-Louis |last3= Franks |first3=Nigel R. |last4 = Sneyd |first4 = James |last5 = Bonabeau |first5 = Eric |last6 = Theraulaz |first6 = Guy |date=2003 |title=Self-organization in biological systems |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 978-0691116242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Temnothorax albipennis]] ants have been observed teaching each other through a process known as [[tandem running]]. An experienced forager leads a naive nest-mate to a newly discovered resource such as food or an empty nest site. The follower obtains knowledge of the route by following in the footsteps of the tutor, maintaining contact with its [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Both leader and follower are aware of the progress made by the other with the leader slowing when the follower lags and speeding up when the follower gets too close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Franks NR, Richardson T| year=2006 |title=Teaching in tandem-running ants|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=439 |issue=7073 |page=153|pmid=16407943 |doi=10.1038/439153a| bibcode=2006Natur.439..153F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on how far away a new resource is, colonies will modulate the number of tandem runs that they perform, with a greater number of tandem runs occurring when the desired resource is more distant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Shea-Wheller TA, etal |year=2016 |title=Migration control: a distance compensation strategy in ants|journal=[[The Science of Nature]] |volume=103 |issue=66 |pages=66 |doi=10.1007/s00114-016-1386-8|pmid=27430995 |pmc=4949290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the relative contribution that workers make to this process differs widely among individuals, with certain ants attempting many more tandem runs than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Shea-Wheller TA, etal |year=2016 |title=A social mechanism facilitates ant colony emigrations over different distances|journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |doi=10.1242/jeb.145276 |pmid=27595848 |volume=219 |issue=21 |pages=3439–3446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In June 2018, Pandelela and six other divers were caught in controversy after a video showed them partying and drinking alcohol during a training camp in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]]. The video was allegedly recorded on the eve of [[Chinese New Year]] day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pandelela, 6 others punished for drinking, partying during training stint |date=21 June 2018|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/06/21/pandelela-6-others-punished-for-drinking-partying-during-training-stint/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |accessdate=29 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Shameful videos' divers promise never to do it again |date=20 June 2018|url=https://www.nst.com.my/sports/others/2018/06/382142/shameful-videos-divers-promise-never-do-it-again |work=The Star Online|author=NSTP Sport|accessdate=29 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, the [[Amateur Swimming Union of Malaysia]] (ASUM) suspended the allowances of the seven national divers with immediate effect with more disciplinary action set to follow. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pandelela and Co face the music for partying in China |date=21 June 2018|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/diving/2018/06/21/divers-in-hot-water-pandelela-and-co-face-the-music-for-partying-in-china/ |work=The Star Online|author=Lim Teik Huat|accessdate=29 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandelela and the six other divers apologised publicly and promised the incident will not be repeated. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Truly, deeply sorry|date=22 June 2018|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/diving/2018/06/22/truly-deeply-sorry-remorseful-divers-promise-not-to-repeat-acts-of-misconduct/ |work=The Star Online|author=Lim Teik Huat|accessdate=29 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASUM announced later that no further action will be taken to the seven divers as the divers have already expressed remorse for their actions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No further punishment for divers who broke drinking rule |date=25 July 2018|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/diving/2018/07/25/no-further-punishment-for-divers-who-broke-drinking-rule/ |work=The Star Online|accessdate=30 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip David Radford''' (born January 2, 1976) is an American environmental, clean energy and [[democracy]] leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url=http://15years.grist.org/|title=15 Years: Lessons Learned|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the youngest executive director of [[Greenpeace]] USA.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The National Journal]]|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/greenpeace-leader-moving-on-at-38-20140422 |title=Greenpeace Leader Moving On at 38; Phil Radford has been the youngest executive director in the environmental group's 43-year history, but he's looking for even greener pastures|accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder and President of Progressive Power Lab, an organization that incubates companies and non-profits that build capacity for progressive organizations, including the Progressive Multiplier Fund&lt;ref name="Progressive Multiplier Fund"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Progressive Multiplier Fund|url=https://progressivemultiplier.fund/|title=Progressive Multiplier Fund|accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Membership Drive.&lt;ref name="MembershipDrive"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MembershipDrive |url=http://www.membershipdrive.com/team/|title=Our Team|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford is a co-founder of the [[Democracy Initiative]], was founder and executive director of Power Shift, and is a board member of the Mertz Gilmore Foundation.&lt;ref name="Mertz Gilmore Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Mertz Gilmore Foundation|url= http://www.mertzgilmore.org/index.php/about/board|title=Board of Directors |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a background in grassroots organizing, [[corporate social responsibility]],&lt;ref name="SustMeme CSR &amp; Business"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=McClelland Media Ltd. |url= https://www.leaderboarded.com/csr-business|title= SustMeme CSR &amp; Business |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[climate change]], and [[clean energy]].&lt;ref name="SustMeme Climate Change and Energy"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=McClelland Media Ltd. |url= https://www.leaderboarded.com/climate-change-energy |title= SustMeme Climate Change and Energy|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife Eileen.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/fashion/weddings/eileen-simpson-philip-radford-weddings.html?_r=0 |title= Weddings, Celebrations |accessdate=2013-07-20 |date=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radford's [[theory of change]] shifted from viewing governments as arbitrators between public and private interests on environmental issues, to finding that most governments are captured by industry. Rather than fighting first for new laws, which could be blocked by industries, he has focused on pressuring large companies to change their practices and enlisted them as allies in pushing for strong environmental protections.&lt;ref name="CleanTechIQ"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= CleanTechIQ |url= http://cleantechiq.com/2013/01/activists-invade-the-boardroom/|title= What Greenpeace's New Strategy Means for Investors|accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Greenpeace]] campaigns that convinced [[Apple, Inc.]] and similar companies to shift to 100% clean energy and lobby utilities and regulators to make that possible,&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace USA]]|url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/Greenpeace-Executive-Director-Philip-Radford-to-Step-Down/|title=Greenpeace Executive Director Philip Radford to Step Down; Leaves legacy of corporate victories and organizational growth|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=[[Business Insider]]|url= http://www.businessinsider.com/greenpeace-fortune-500-deforestation-global-warming-2014-6 |title=How A 'Bunch Of Commies' Are Forcing The Fortune 500 To Stop Destroying Rain Forests, Killing Too Many Fish, And Burning Coal and Oil|accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as work to protect both the [[Indonesian rainforest]] and the [[Bering Sea Canyons]].&lt;ref name="Environmental Leader"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Environmental Leader|url= http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/05/31/whole-foods-safeway-trader-joes-top-sustainable-seafood-list/|title=Whole Foods, Safeway, Trader Joe's Top Sustainable Seafood List| accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Huffington Post]]|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-radford/a-breakthrough-in-how-we_b_3423516.html | title= A Breakthrough in How We Work to Protect Our Oceans | accessdate =2013-09-02 |first=Philip |last=Radford |date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford argues that the combination of creating industry champions and "outside pressure" focused on the government are the keys to passing new laws to protect the environment.&lt;ref name="CleanTechIQ"/&gt; However, Radford has also been a vocal leader calling for the United States to pass [[campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] and respect all Americans' voting rights to shift power in politics from corporations towards people and fulfill "the promise of American democracy." Radford is considered by many to be a modern-day transcendentalist, in that he is very focused on nature and the environment, and he is an advocate of democracy.&lt;ref name="C-SPAN"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[C-SPAN]] |url= http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/ProgressiveAgenda |title= Progressive Agenda |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Huffington Post]] |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-radford/if-you-want-to-breathe-cl_b_3600018.html|title= If You Want to Breathe Clean Air, Senate Reform and Democracy Matter |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Radford received his B.A. from [[Washington University]] in St. Louis in 1998.&lt;ref name="Washington University"/&gt;

== Early activism ==
Radford began his environmental activism as a high school student at [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], a Chicago suburb, volunteering for an [[environmental justice]] campaign to stop the building of trash incinerators in the West Side of Chicago near his family's Oak Park home.&lt;ref name="Oak Park and River Forest High School Tradition of Excellence Past Award Recipients"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] |url= http://www.oprfhs.org/alumni/Past-Award-Recipients-TOE.cfm|title=Oak Park and River Forest High School Tradition of Excellence Past Award Recipients |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first job as a grassroots organizer came as a canvasser for Illinois [[PIRG]]. While studying political science and business at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], he directed campaign and canvass offices during summers for the [[Fund for Public Interest Research]] for clients including the [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[PIRGIM]], and [[Ohio PIRG]] and worked part-time during school for the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Fund for the Public Interest]] |url=http://www.fundforthepublicinterest.org/jobs/alumni/profiles/phillip-d.-radford |title=Phillip D. Radford, Greenpeace, Executive Director |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601223141/http://fundforthepublicinterest.org/jobs/alumni/profiles/phillip-d.-radford |archivedate=June 1, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating college in 1998, Radford became a lead organizer at [[Green Corps]], the field school for environmental organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencorps.org/page/career-placement |title= Career Placement: Growing the Movement |publisher=[[Green Corps]] |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Field director of Ozone Action ===

From 1999 to 2001 Radford was field director for Ozone Action, an organization dedicated to working on the atmospheric threats of global warming and ozone depletion. As field director, Radford planned and executed a number of grassroots campaigns, including a campaign during the 2000 presidential primaries, which was the initial impetus for Senator John McCain sponsoring the Climate Stewardship Act.&lt;ref name="Canvassing Works"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Canvassing Works |url= http://www.canvassingworks.org/canvassingworks/2006/09/alumni_update_p.html |title= Canvassing Works |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Living on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Living on Earth]] |url= http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=07-P13-00049&amp;segmentID=3 |title= McCain on Climate Change |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radford also managed the grassroots mobilization for the Global Warming Divestiture Campaign, which resulted in [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[Texaco]], and other companies ending their funding the [[Global Climate Coalition]], which spread misinformation about global warming.&lt;ref name="Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=

=== Founder of Power Shift ===

In 2001, Radford founded Power Shift,&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"/&gt; a [[non-governmental organization]] dedicated to driving [[clean energy]] market breakthroughs and building the [[grassroots]] base to stop [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Power Shift"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Volunteermatch.org |url= http://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org22033.jsp|title=Power Shift|accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As executive director of Power Shift, Radford worked closely with the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista, and Berkeley, California, as well as nine other municipalities, to secure investments for installation of solar energy systems and implementation of energy efficiency measures in municipal buildings.&lt;ref name="Fund for the Public Interest"/&gt;  Radford also helped to convince [[Citigroup]] to adopt innovative new means of financing clean energy infrastructure for wind and solar installations that made them affordable to average Americans.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[Environmental News Service]|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2004/2004-01-23-09.asp|title= Citigroup Sets New Environmental Standards |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leading Greenpeace USA ==

In 2009, at the age of 33, Radford was selected as the youngest ever executive director of [[Greenpeace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url= http://grist.org/climate-energy/greenpeace-out-parting-shots-from-a-battle-hardened-climate-leader/#.Uuj53o8Zxb0.twitter|title= Greenpeace out: Parting shots from a battle hardened climate leader |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Guardian]] |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/29/interview-greenpeace-phil-radford|title= Greenpeace USA's Phil Radford|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford's tenure at Greenpeace USA is best known for convincing over 100 corporations to change their environmental practices;&lt;ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

In September 2013, Radford announced that he would step down on April 30, 2014, once he had completed five years of service as executive director.&lt;ref name="The National Journal"/&gt;

[[New York Times]] reporter [[Andrew Revkin]] referred to a Greenpeace campaign during Radford's tenure as "Activism at Its Best."&lt;ref name="dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/activism-at-its-best-greenpeaces-push-to-stop-the-pulping-of-rain-forests/|title= Activism at Its Best: Greenpeace's Push to Stop the Pulping of Rain Forests|accessdate=2013-07-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Andrew C.|last=Revkin|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/a-chat-with-greenpeaces-departing-u-s-chief-on-old-and-new-environmentalism/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=A Chat With Greenpeace's Departing U.S. Chief on Old and New Environmentalism |accessdate=2014-04-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Andrew C. |last=Revkin |date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Jealous]], former president and chief executive officer of the [[NAACP]] as well as co-founder of the [[Democracy Initiative]] with Radford, described Radford at the helm of Greenpeace as "a modern movement building giant.  He has built powerful diverse coalitions to bolster the fights for the environment and voting rights. In the process he has shown himself to be unmatched in mobilizing everyday people to fund their movements directly." Environmental leader [[Bill McKibben]] stated: "During Radford's tenure, Greenpeace has been helping the whole [[environmental movement]] shift back towards its roots: local, connected, tough."&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"/&gt;

Before becoming executive director of Greenpeace USA, Radford served as the director of the organization's [[Grassroots]] Program.&lt;ref name="Grist.org"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]]|url= 
http://grist.org/article/2009-04-14-greenpeaces-new-leader-talks/|title= Greenpeace's new leader talks up need for a green grassroots|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity, he directed and significantly grew the organization's street canvass and launched and directed the door-to-door canvasses, online-to-offline organizing team, social media team, the Greenpeace Student Network, and the Greenpeace Semester.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace USA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/about/our-staff/phil-radford/|title= Phil Radford|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Radford, the street and door-to-door canvassing programs grew to include nearly 400 canvassers in almost 20 cities across the country and was responsible for doubling the organization's budget.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace USA"/&gt;

==Changing corporate behavior==

===Global Climate Coalition===
Radford managed the grassroots efforts of a national [[divestment]]/[[disinvestment]] campaign,&lt;ref name="Meet Philip Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/conservationists/changemaker-phil-radford.htm|title=Meet Philip Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109143521/http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/conservationists/changemaker-phil-radford.htm|archivedate=November 9, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which forced [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[Texaco]], and other companies to stop funding the [[Global Climate Coalition]], which spread misinformation about global warming.&lt;ref name="Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate"/&gt; Soon thereafter, the GCC ended operations.&lt;ref name="RIP: Global Climate Coalition; Global Climate Coalition Ends Its Work; Voice for Industry Opposed Global Treaty"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Heat is Online|url=

===Citigroup===
In 2001, while running Power Shift, Radford launched a campaign to push Citibank to offer and promote Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs).&lt;ref name="Last Call"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[In These Times]] |url=http://iatp.org/news/last-call | title= Last Call: In Person with Ben Winters, Save the Ales|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citi was "missing the opportunity to help stop global warming by phasing out fossil fuel investments and promoting clean energy now," Radford said. "The irony is that if Citi financed solar for people's homes, solar energy could be made immediately affordable for millions of Americans today."&lt;ref name=" Multinational Monitor, April 2002 - VOLUME 23 - NUMBER 4"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Multinational Monitor]] |url=http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2002/02april/april02corp1.html | title= Citigroup: Bankrupting Democracy; The Cost of Living Richly Citigroup's Global Finance and Threats to the Environment |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Citigroup agreed to offer and promote EEMs for residential wind, energy efficiency, and solar installations that would make clean energy affordable for millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Environmental News Service]]|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2004/2004-01-23-09.asp| title= Citigroup Sets New Environmental Standards |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kimberly-Clark===
Radford oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the [[Kleercut]] Campaign in the United States and, later, the entire U.S. component of the global campaign when he became Greenpeace's executive director,&lt;ref name="Grist.org"/&gt; targeting Kimberly-Clark for sourcing 22% of its paper pulp from Canadian [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s containing 200-year-old trees. The campaign included intervening in Kleenex commercial shoots,&lt;ref name="Kleenex Gets Punk'd"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCym0DB7hA |title=Kleenex Gets Punk'd|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing twenty-two universities and colleges to take action such as cancelling contracts,&lt;ref name=" About the Student Network"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/getinvolved/get-involved/student-network/a-brief-history-of-the-greenpe/|title= 2005–2009 – Kleercut-Free Campuses and Victory!|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1718476/exclusive-how-kimberly-clark-ditched-its-forest-destroying-reputation-and-embraced-greenpeac|title= Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; recruiting 500 companies to boycott Kimberly-Clark,&lt;ref name="Forest Friendly 500"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://forestfriendly500.org |title= Forest Friendly 500 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 1,000 protests of the company, and more.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office |title=More Than Tissues in a Box of Kleenex |accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Ylan Q. |last=Mui |date=February 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203055353/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-02-16/business/36867371_1_kleenex-kimberly-clark-greenpeace-office |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The result: On August 5, 2009, Kimberly-Clark announced that it would source 40% of its paper fiber from recycled content or other sustainable sources – a 71% increase from 2007 levels. The demand created by Kimberly-Clark for sustainably logged fiber was greater than the supply, enabling the company to convince logging companies to change their practices.&lt;ref name=" Exclusive: How Kimberly-Clark Ditched its Forest-Destroying Reputation and Embraced Greenpeace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/greenpeace-and-kimberly-clark-settle-feud/?_r=0 |title=Greenpeace and Kimberly-Clark Settle Feud|accessdate=2013-08-23 |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |date=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia Pulp and Paper===
From 2010 to 2013, Radford managed Greenpeace US team that persuaded major U.S. companies to cancel their contracts with [[Asia Pulp and Paper]] (APP) – the world's third largest paper company&lt;ref name=" Paper Producer to Stop Clearing of Indonesian Forests"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/energy-environment/06iht-forest06.html?_r=0 |title=Paper Producer to Stop Clearing of Indonesian Forests |accessdate=2013-08-26 |first=Sara |last=Schonhardt |date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; – to push APP to stop destroying ancient forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[GreenBiz]] |url= http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/05/06/annie-leonard-story-stuff-will-direct-greenpeace |title='Story of Stuff' creator Annie Leonard will lead Greenpeace USA |accessdate=2014-05-06 |date=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace and its allies succeeded in convincing more than 100 corporate customers of APP to sever their ties with the company,&lt;ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

===Apple, Facebook, and cloud computing go 100% clean energy===
On April 21, 2011, Greenpeace released a report highlighting data centers, which consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase. Radford stated "we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today."&lt;ref name="Dirty Data Report Card"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/Cool%20IT/dirty-data-report-greenpeace.pdf|title=Dirty Data Report Card|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business Insider]] reported that after [[Greenpeace USA]] campaigns, "tech giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Salesforce have promised to power their data centers with renewable energy, a pledge that led Duke Energy, the nation's largest power utility and one of the most flagrant emitters of CO2, to begin providing clean energy to win their business."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;

===Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive, palm oil and Indonesian rainforests===

In 2014, deforestation in Indonesia, which accounts for .1% of the world's surface, caused 4% of global warming pollution. One of the major drivers of deforestation was clearing the forest to grow palm oil plantations.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; Under Radford, the Greenpeace USA team persuaded [[Procter &amp; Gamble]],&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; [[Colgate Palmolive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=Monga Bay | url= http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0606-greenpeace-tiger-challenge.html |title=Greenpeace rates companies' zero deforestation commitments |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mondelez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |publisher=Confectionery News | url= http://www.confectionerynews.com/Ingredients/Mondelez-announces-palm-oil-action-plan |title=Mondelez Announces Palm Oil Action Plan | accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other major companies to demand sustainably grown palm oil.

===Major U.S. supermarkets===
Under Radford, Greenpeace ran a campaign targeting supermarket chains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/campaign-blog/protecting-our-oceans-one-supermarket-at-a-ti/blog/34215/ | title= Protecting our oceans, one supermarket at a time | accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which sell 50% of all seafood in the U.S. – to convince them to stop selling threatened fish, adopt sustainable seafood policies, and lobby for policies such as [[marine reserve]]s to protect the oceans. Some retailers simply moved from being scored in a report;&lt;ref name="Carting Away the Oceans 7"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/PDFs/oceans/CATO%20VII.pdf |title= Carting Away the Oceans 7 |accessdate= 2013-09-02 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051042/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/PDFs/oceans/CATO%20VII.pdf |archivedate= October 21, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; others like [[Costco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[The New York Times]] |url= http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/costco-pulls-threatened-fish-from-stores/?_r=0 | title= Costco Pulls Threatened Fish from Stores| accessdate =2013-09-02 |date=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trader Joe's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Triple Pundit|url= http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/03/trader-joes-greenpeace/| title= Trader Joe's to Adopt Sustainable Seafood Policy After Greenpeace Campaign| accessdate =2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; required public campaigns to change them.

'''Philomène Belliveau''' (1854 &amp;ndash; 1940) was a Canadian artist of [[Acadian]] descent.

The daughter of Modeste Cormier and Joseph Belliveau, she was born in [[Memramcook]] and was educated at the convent of the Sisters of Sacré Cœur (known as Reed's Castle) in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]]. In 1889, she travelled to [[Boston]], where she took courses in painting and drawing. After she returned to New Brunswick, her portraits in [[pastel]] became very popular. The Acadian museum at the [[Université de Moncton]] has four of these portraits in their collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museevirtuel.ca/edu/ViewLoitDa.do;jsessionid=1CB244C5398A9C15054F5B0D455AA1EB?method=preview&amp;lang=EN&amp;id=5102 |title=Philomène Belliveau |work=Art and Culture |publisher=Canadian Heritage Information Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scvm/&gt;

In 1904, she married judge Alphonse Pierre Garon. The couple settled in [[Shediac]], later moving to [[Rimouski]].&lt;ref name=scvm/&gt;

She died in Rimouski at the age of 85.&lt;ref name=scvm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturememramcook.ca/index.php/fr/artistes/peintres/8-philomene-belliveau |title=Philomène Belliveau |publisher=Société Culturelle de la Vallée de Memramcook |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|third longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history]] (behind [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[John A. Macdonald]]), having served for 15 years, 164 days.

Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in [[Quebec]] politics. In the 1960s he entered federal politics by joining the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. He was appointed as [[Lester&amp;nbsp;B. Pearson|Lester&amp;nbsp;B. Pearson's]] [[Parliamentary Secretary]] and later became his [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]]. Trudeau became a media sensation, inspiring "[[Trudeaumania]]", and took charge of the Liberals in 1968. From the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, his personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. Despite his personal motto, "Reason before passion",{{sfn|Kaufman (2000-09-29)}} his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada.

Admirers praise what they consider to be the force of Trudeau's intellect{{sfn| Mallick (2000-09-30)|p=P04}} and his political acumen, maintaining national unity over the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], suppressing a Quebec [[October Crisis|terrorist crisis]], fostering a pan-Canadian identity, and in achieving sweeping institutional reform, including the implementation of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], and the establishment of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].{{sfn|The Globe and Mail (2000-09-29)|p=A20}} Critics accuse him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]].{{sfn|Fortin (2000-10-09)|p=A17}} He retired from politics in 1984, and [[John Turner]] succeeded him.

His eldest son, [[Justin Trudeau]], became the 23rd and current Prime Minister as a result of the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 federal election]] and is the first prime minister of Canada to be a descendant of a former prime minister.

==Early life==
The Trudeau family can be traced to [[Marcillac-Lanville]] in [[France]] in the 16th century and to a Robert Truteau (1544–1589).{{sfn|Généalogie du Québec (2012)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/robert-truteau_20306861?geo_a=r&amp;geo_s=us&amp;geo_t=us&amp;geo_v=2.0.0&amp;o_xid=62916&amp;o_lid=62916&amp;o_sch=Partners |title = Robert Truteau |publisher = Ancestry.com |accessdate = 2015-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1659 the first Trudeau to arrive in Canada was Étienne Trudeau or Truteau (1641–1712), a carpenter and home builder from [[La Rochelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nosorigines.qc.ca/GenealogieQuebec.aspx?genealogie=Etienne_Trudeau&amp;pid=6568&amp;lng=fr&amp;partID=6569 |title = Généalogie Etienne Trudeau |publisher = Nosorigines.qc.ca |date = 2007-01-14 |accessdate = 2014-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Trudeau was born at home at 5779 Durocher Avenue, [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont, Montreal]], on October 18, 1919,{{sfn|English (2006)|p=8}} to [[Charles Trudeau (businessman)|Charles-Émile "Charley" Trudeau]], a [[French-Canadian]] businessman and lawyer, and Grace Elliott, who was of mixed [[Scots-Quebecer|Scottish]] and French-Canadian descent. He had an older sister named Suzette and a younger brother named Charles Jr.; he remained close to both siblings for his entire life. The family had become quite wealthy by the time Trudeau was in his teens, as his father sold his prosperous gas station business to [[Imperial Oil]].{{sfn|Downey (2000-09-30)}} Trudeau attended the prestigious [[Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf]] (a private French [[Jesuit]] school), where he supported [[Quebec nationalism]]. Trudeau's father died when Pierre was 15 years old. This death hit him and the family very hard emotionally. Trudeau remained very close to his mother for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)}}

According to long-time friend and colleague [[Marc Lalonde]], the clerically influenced dictatorships of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in Portugal (the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]), [[Francisco Franco]] in Spain (the [[Spanish State]]), and Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] in [[Vichy France]] were seen as political role models by many youngsters educated at elite Jesuit schools in Quebec. Lalonde asserts that Trudeau's later intellectual development as an "intellectual rebel, anti-establishment fighter on behalf of unions and promoter of religious freedom" came from his experiences after leaving Quebec to study in the United States, France and England, and to travel to dozens of countries. His international experiences allowed him to break from Jesuit influence and study French progressive Catholic philosophers such as [[Jacques Maritain]] and [[Emmanuel Mounier]] as well as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]].{{sfn|Windsor (2006-04-08)|p=A6}}

==Education and the Second World War==
Trudeau earned his law degree at the [[Université de Montréal]] in 1943. During his studies, he was conscripted into the [[Canadian Army]] as part of the [[National Resources Mobilization Act]]. When conscripted, he decided to join the Canadian Officers' Training Corps, and he then served with the other conscripts in Canada, since they were not assigned to overseas military service until after the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] after the [[Invasion of Normandy]] that June. Before this, all Canadians serving overseas were volunteers, and not conscripts.

Trudeau said he was willing to fight during [[World War II]], but he believed that to do so would be to turn his back on the population of Quebec that he believed had been betrayed by the government of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. Trudeau reflected on his opposition to [[conscription]] and his doubts about the war in his ''Memoirs'' (1993): "So there was a war? Tough&amp;nbsp;... if you were a French Canadian in Montreal in the early 1940s, you did not automatically believe that this was a [[just war]]&amp;nbsp;... we tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the superpowers."{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p={{page needed|date=July 2016}} }}

In an [[Outremont (electoral district)|Outremont]] by-election in 1942 he campaigned for the anticonscription candidate [[Jean Drapeau]] (later the [[Mayor of Montreal]]). After the war Trudeau continued his studies, first taking a master's degree in [[political economy]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government). He then studied in Paris, France in 1947 at the [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]]. Finally, he enrolled for a doctorate at the [[London School of Economics]], but did not finish his dissertation.{{sfn|English (2006)|p={{page needed|date=July 2016}} }}

Trudeau was interested in [[Marxist]] ideas in the 1940s and his Harvard dissertation was on the topic of Communism and Christianity.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=145–146}} Thanks to the great intellectual migration away from Europe's fascism, Harvard had become a major intellectual centre in which he profoundly changed.{{sfn|English (2006)|p=124}} Despite this, Trudeau found himself an outsider&amp;nbsp;– a French Catholic living for the first time outside of [[Quebec]] in the predominantly Protestant American Harvard University.{{sfn|English (2006)|p=134}} This isolation deepened finally into despair,{{sfn|English (2006)|p=137}} and led to Trudeau's decision to continue his Harvard studies abroad.{{sfn|English (2006)|p=141}}

In 1947 Trudeau travelled to Paris to continue his dissertation work. Over a five-week period he attended many lectures and became a follower of [[personalism]] after being influenced most notably by [[Emmanuel Mounier]].{{sfn|English (2006)|p=147}} He also was influenced by [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], particularly his book ''Slavery and Freedom''.&lt;ref name="NemniNemni2011"/&gt; [[Max Nemni|Max]] and [[Monique Nemni]] argue that Berdyaev's book influenced Trudeau's rejection of nationalism and separatism.&lt;ref name="NemniNemni2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Max Nemni |author2 = Monique Nemni |title = Trudeau Transformed: The Shaping of a Statesman 1944-1965 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fd-nSGK8c1QC&amp;pg=PA70 |date = 17 October 2011 |publisher = McClelland &amp; Stewart |isbn = 978-0-7710-5126-5 |pages = 70–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard dissertation remained unfinished when Trudeau entered a doctoral program to study under the socialist economist [[Harold Laski]] at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|English (2006)|p=166}} This cemented Trudeau's belief that [[Keynesian economics]] and social science were essential to the creation of the "good life" in democratic society.{{sfn|English (2006)|p=296}}

==Early career==
From the late 1940s through the mid-1960s, Trudeau was primarily based in Montreal and was seen by many as an intellectual. In 1949 he was an active supporter of workers in the [[Asbestos Strike]]. In 1956 he edited an important book on the subject, ''La grève de l'amiante'', which argued that the strike was a seminal event in Quebec's history, marking the beginning of resistance to the conservative, [[Francophone]] clerical establishment and [[English language|Anglophone]] business class that had long ruled the province.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=289,292}} Throughout the 1950s,  Trudeau,  as the co-founder and editor of ''[[Cité Libre]]'', a dissident journal that helped provide the intellectual basis for the [[Quiet Revolution]], was a leading figure in the opposition to the repressive rule of [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Maurice Duplessis]].

From 1949 to 1951 Trudeau worked briefly in Ottawa, in the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] of the Liberal Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] as an economic policy advisor. He wrote in his memoirs that he found this period very useful later on, when he entered politics, and that senior civil servant [[Norman Robertson]] tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stay on.

His progressive values and his close ties with [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) intellectuals (including [[F. R. Scott]], [[Eugene Forsey]], [[Michael Kelway Oliver]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]) led to his support of and membership in that federal [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party throughout the 1950s.{{sfn|English (2006)|p=364}} Despite these connections, when Trudeau entered federal politics in the 1960s he decided to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] rather than the CCF's successor, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP). Trudeau felt the federal NDP could not achieve power, expressed doubts about the feasibility of the centralizing policies of the party, and felt that the party leadership tended toward a "''deux nations''" approach he could not support.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=364–365}}

In his memoirs, published in 1993, Trudeau wrote that during the 1950s he wanted to teach at the Université de Montréal, but was blacklisted three times from doing so by Premier Maurice Duplessis. He was offered a position at [[Queen's University]] teaching political science by [[James Corry (academic)|James Corry]], who later became principal of Queen's, but turned it down because he preferred to teach in Quebec.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=63–64}} During the 1950s he was [[blacklisted]] by the United States and prevented from entering that country because of a visit to a conference in Moscow, and because he subscribed to a number of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] publications. Trudeau later appealed the ban and it was rescinded.

==Law professor enters politics==
[[File:Trudeau Nomination.jpg|thumb|Trudeau after being nominated to represent the riding of Mount Royal, June 6, 1965]]

{{See also|Electoral history of Pierre Trudeau}}

An associate professor of law at the Université de Montréal from 1961 to 1965, Trudeau's views evolved towards a liberal position in favour of individual rights counter to the state and made him an opponent of [[Quebec nationalism]]. He admired the labour unions, which were tied to the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), and tried to infuse his Liberal party with some of their reformist zeal. By the late 1950s Trudeau began to reject social democratic and labour parties, arguing that they should put their narrow goals aside and join forces with Liberals to fight for democracy first.&lt;ref&gt;Christo Aivalis, "In the Name of Liberalism: Pierre Trudeau, Organized Labour, and the Canadian Social Democratic Left, 1949–1959," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (June 2013) 94#7 pp 263–288 {{DOI|10.3138/chr.1498}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economic theory he was influenced by professors [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] while he was at Harvard. Trudeau criticized the Liberal Party of [[Lester Pearson]] when it supported arming [[Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc|Bomarc missiles]] in Canada with [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]]s.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=183–185}} Nevertheless, he was persuaded to join the party in 1965, together with his friends [[Gérard Pelletier]] and [[Jean Marchand]]. These "three wise men" ran successfully for the Liberals in the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 election]]. Trudeau himself was elected in the safe Liberal riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]], in western Montreal. He would hold this seat until his retirement from politics in 1984, winning each election with large majorities.

Upon arrival in Ottawa, Trudeau was appointed as Prime Minister Lester Pearson's parliamentary secretary, and spent much of the next year travelling abroad, representing Canada at international meetings and bodies, including the [[United Nations]]. In 1967 he was appointed to Pearson's [[Canadian cabinet|cabinet]] as [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]].{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}}

[[File:Trudeau, Turner, Chretien, and Pearson.jpg|thumb|Prime Ministers all: (l-r) Trudeau, future leaders [[John Turner]] and [[Jean Chrétien]], and Trudeau's predecessor, [[Lester B. Pearson]]]]
As [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]], Trudeau was responsible for introducing the landmark [[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69|Criminal Law Amendment Act]], an [[omnibus bill]] whose provisions included, among other things, the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, the legalization of contraception, abortion and lotteries, new gun ownership restrictions as well as the authorization of breathalyzer tests on suspected drunk drivers. Trudeau famously defended the segment of the bill decriminalizing homosexual acts by telling reporters that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation", adding that "what's done in private between adults doesn't concern the Criminal Code".{{sfn|CBC News (1967-12-21)}} Trudeau paraphrased the term from Martin O'Malley's  editorial piece in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' on December 12, 1967.{{sfn|CBC News (1967-12-21)}}{{sfn|O'Malley (1967-12-12)|p=6}} Trudeau also liberalized divorce laws, and clashed with Quebec Premier [[Daniel Johnson, Sr.]] during constitutional negotiations.

[[File:Trudeau podium2.JPG|thumb|Trudeau at the Liberal convention after winning the leadership]]
At the end of Canada's centennial year in 1967, Prime Minister Pearson announced his intention to step down, and Trudeau entered the race for the Liberal leadership. His energetic campaign attracted massive media attention and mobilized many young people, who saw Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. Going into the leadership convention, Trudeau was the front-runner and a clear favourite with the Canadian public. However, many Liberals still had reservations given that he joined the Liberal Party in 1965 and that his views, particularly those on divorce, abortion, and homosexuality, were seen as radical and opposed by a substantial segment of the party. During the convention, prominent Cabinet Minister [[Judy LaMarsh]] was caught on television profanely stating that Trudeau wasn't a Liberal.&lt;ref name="Don't let the bastard win"&gt;
{{cite web |title = The Style is the Man Himself |url = http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/pierre-elliott-trudeau-philosopher-and-prime-minister/canada-must-be-a-just-society.html |work = Pierre Trudeau: 'Canada must be a just society' |publisher = CBC Archives |accessdate = 2013-12-21 |author = CBC News |location = Toronto |date = 1968-09-09 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6M2fSbqku?url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/pierre-elliott-trudeau-philosopher-and-prime-minister/canada-must-be-a-just-society.html |archivedate = 2013-12-21 |deadurl = no |ref = harv |df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, at the April [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1968|1968 Liberal leadership convention]], Trudeau was elected as the leader on the fourth ballot, with the support of 51% of the delegates. He defeated several prominent and long-serving Liberals including [[Paul Martin Sr.]], [[Robert Winters]] and [[Paul Hellyer]]. As the new leader of the governing Liberals, Trudeau was sworn in as Prime Minister two weeks later on April 20.

==Prime Minister, 1968–74==
Trudeau soon called an election, [[Canadian federal election, 1968|for June 25]]. His election campaign benefited from an unprecedented wave of personal popularity called "[[Trudeaumania]]",&lt;ref name="Collison"/&gt;{{sfn|Zink (1972)|p=Backcover}}{{sfn|Canada.com}} which saw Trudeau mobbed by throngs of youths. Trudeau's main national opponents were [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|PC]] leader [[Robert Stanfield]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] leader [[Tommy Douglas]], both popular figures who had been Premiers, respectively, of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. As a candidate Trudeau espoused [[participatory democracy]] as a means of making Canada a "[[Just Society]]". He defended vigorously the newly implemented [[universal health care]] and [[regional development]] programmes, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill.

On the eve of the election, during the annual [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] parade in Montreal, rioting [[Quebec separatism|Quebec sovereignists]] threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated, chanting "Trudeau au poteau!" (Trudeau – to the stake!). Rejecting the pleas of his aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the defiant Prime Minister impressed the public, and he handily won the election the next day.{{sfn|CBC News (1968-06-24)}}{{sfn|Maclean's Magazine (1998-04-06)}}

===Domestic affairs===
Trudeau's first government implemented many procedural reforms to make Parliament and the Liberal caucus meetings run more efficiently, significantly expanded the size and role of the Prime Minister's office,{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=22–24}} and substantially expanded the welfare state,{{sfn|Lyon &amp; Van Die|pp=137–144 }}{{sfn|Laxer (1977)|pp=22–24}} with the establishment of new programmes.{{sfn|Moscovitch (2012)}}&lt;ref&gt;Towards A Just Society: The Trudeau Years edited by Thomas S. Axworthy and Pierre Elliott Trudeau&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bilingualism and multiculturalism====
Trudeau's first major legislative push was implementing the majority of recommendations of Pearson's [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] via the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], which made French and English the co-equal official languages of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html |title = Official Languages Act – 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.) |work = Act current to July 11th, 2010 |publisher = Department of Justice |accessdate = 2010-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More controversial than the declaration (which was backed by the NDP and, with some opposition in caucus, the PCs) was the implementation of the Act's principles: between 1966 and 1976, the francophone proportion of the civil service and military doubled, causing alarm in some sections of anglophone Canada that they were being disadvantaged.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}

Trudeau's Cabinet fulfilled Part IV of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism's report by announcing a "[[Multiculturalism]] Policy" on October 8, 1971. This statement recognized that while Canada was a country of two official languages, it recognized a plurality of cultures – "a multicultural policy within a bilingual framework".{{sfn|English (2009)|p=145}} This annoyed public opinion in Quebec, which believed that it challenged Quebec's claim of Canada as a country of two nations.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=146}}

The first major policy failure of Trudeau's first term was the [[1969 White Paper|1969 White Paper on Indians]], which was promoted by new [[Department of Indian and Northern Affairs]] minister [[Jean Chrétien]] as part of Trudeau's push for [[classical liberal]] participatory democracy. The statement proposed the general assimilation of [[First Nations]] into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the [[Indian Act]] and [[Indian Register|Indian status]], the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=144}} The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.

====October Crisis====
Trudeau's first serious test came during the [[October Crisis]] of 1970, when a Marxist group, the ''[[Front de libération du Québec]]'' (FLQ) kidnapped British Trade Consul [[James Cross]] at his residence on October 5. Five days later Quebec Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]] was also kidnapped. Trudeau, with the acquiescence of [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Robert Bourassa]], responded by invoking the [[War Measures Act]] which gave the government sweeping powers of arrest and detention without trial. Trudeau presented a determined public stance during the crisis, answering the question of how far he would go to stop the violence by saying "[[Just watch me]]". Laporte was found dead on October 17 in the trunk of a car. The cause of his death is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independance-quebec.com/flq/octobre/laporte_mort.html|title=La mort de Pierre Laporte |first=|last=grovin@caramail.com|website= Site historique du Front de libération du Québec|accessdate=25 January 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of the FLQ members were flown to Cuba in 1970 as part of a deal in exchange for James Cross' life, although they eventually returned to Canada years later, where they served time in prison.{{sfn|Munroe (2012)}}

Although this response is still controversial and was opposed at the time as excessive by parliamentarians like [[Tommy Douglas]] and [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], it was met with only limited objections from the public.{{sfn|Janigan (1975-11-01)|p=3}}

====Constitutional affairs====
After consultations with the provincial premiers, Trudeau agreed to attend a conference called by [[Premier of British Columbia|British Columbia Premier]] [[W. A. C. Bennett]] to attempt to finally [[patriation|patriate]] the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].{{sfn|English (2009)|p=135}} Negotiations with the provinces by Minister of Justice [[John Turner]] created a draft agreement, known as the [[Victoria Charter]], that entrenched a charter of rights, bilingualism, and a guarantee of a veto of constitutional amendments for Ontario and Quebec, as well as regional vetoes for [[Western Canada]] and [[Atlantic Canada]], within the new constitution.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=135}} The agreement was acceptable to the nine predominantly-English speaking provinces, while Quebec's Premier Robert Bourassa requested two weeks to consult with his cabinet.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=135}} After a strong backlash of popular opinion against the agreement in Quebec, Bourassa stated Quebec would not accept it.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=136}}

===World affairs===
In foreign affairs, Trudeau kept Canada firmly in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]), but often pursued an independent path in international relations. He established Canadian diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, before the United States did, and went on an official visit to Beijing. He was known as a friend of [[Fidel Castro]], the leader of [[Cuba]].

Trudeau was the first world leader to meet [[John Lennon]] and his wife [[Yoko Ono]] on their "tour for [[world peace]]". Lennon said, after talking with Trudeau for 50 minutes, that Trudeau was "a beautiful person" and that "if all politicians were like Pierre Trudeau, there would be world peace".{{sfn|Canadian Press (1969-12-24)}}

Requiring NDP support to continue, the government would move to the political left, including the creation of [[Petro-Canada]].

===1974 election===
In May 1974 the House of Commons passed a [[motion of no confidence]] in the Trudeau government, defeating its budget bill after Trudeau intentionally antagonized Stanfield and Lewis.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=233}} The [[Canadian federal election, 1974|election of 1974]] focused mainly on the [[1973–75 recession|current economic recession]]. Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of [[wage and price controls]] to help end the increasing [[inflation]] Canada was currently facing.  Trudeau mocked the proposal, saying to a newspaper reporter that it was the equivalent of a magician saying "Zap! You're frozen", and instead promoted a variety of small tax cuts to curb inflation.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=237}} A campaign tour featuring Trudeau's wife and infant sons was popular, and NDP supporters scared of wage controls moved toward the Liberals.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=238}}

The Liberals were re-elected with a majority government with 141 of the 264 seats, prompting Stanfield's retirement. The Liberals won no seats in Alberta, though, where [[Peter Lougheed]] was a vociferous opponent of Trudeau's 1974 budget.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=240}}

==Prime Minister, 1974–79==
While popular with the electorate, Trudeau's promised minor reforms had little effect on the growing rate of inflation, and he struggled with conflicting advice on the crisis.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=246}} In September 1975 the popular Finance Minister [[John Turner]] resigned over a perceived lack of support in [[Countervailing duties|countervailing measures]].{{sfn|English (2009)|p=282}} In October 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister [[Donald Stovel Macdonald|Donald Macdonald]] introduced wage and price controls by passing the [[Anti-Inflation Act]]. The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted [[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act|a Supreme Court reference]] that only upheld the legislation as an [[Peace, Order, and Good Government|emergency requiring Federal intervention]] under the [[British North America Act]]. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] business leaders.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=290-94}}

Trudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada's international profile, including joining the [[G7]] group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}} On July 14, 1976, after long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the [[Capital punishment in Canada|death penalty]] completely and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.&lt;ref name="Radio Canada"&gt;{{cite web |title = Le grandes etapes de l'abolition |url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Dossiers/peinedemort/contenu_bas_03a.asp |publisher = [[Radio Canada]]|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trudeau faced increasing challenges in Quebec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government in Quebec. After a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Quebec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the Federal government on the constitution, [[Bill 22|French language laws]], and the language of [[air traffic control]] in Quebec.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}} Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against the Federal government's bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}}

Partially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a [[Quebec general election, 1976|surprise election in 1976]] that resulted in [[René Lévesque]] and the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a "good government" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and Lévesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with Lévesque's more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the "clarity" provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignist movement]] became, in his view, his biggest challenge.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=308}}

As the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged failure of his marriage, which was covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis by the English language press. Trudeau's reserve was seen as dignified by contemporaries and his poll numbers actually rose during the height of coverage,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=329}} but aides felt the personal tensions left him uncharacteristically emotional and prone to outbursts.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=327-8}}

In 1976, Trudeau, succumbing to pressure from the Communist Chinese, issued an order barring [[Sports in Taiwan|Taiwan]] from participating as China in the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]], although technically it was a matter for the [[IOC]].&lt;ref name="As It Happens"/&gt;  His action strained relations with the United States – from [[President Ford]], future [[President Carter]] and the press – and subjected Canada to international condemnation and shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Trudeau, Taiwan, and the 1976 Montreal Olympics | author=Donald Macintosh, Donna Greenhorn  &amp; Michael Hawes | journal= American Review of Canadian Studies | year=1991 | volume=21 | issue=4 | pages=423–448 | doi=10.1080/02722019109481098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="As It Happens"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/taiwan-controversy-at-the-1976-montreal-olympics | title=Montreal Olympics: The Taiwan controversy | publisher=[[CBC Radio One]] | work=[[CBC Archives]]: [[As It Happens]] | date=July 16, 1976 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1970s wore on, growing public exhaustion towards Trudeau's personality and the country's constitutional debates caused his poll numbers to fall rapidly in the late 1970s.{{sfn|Gwyn (1980)|p=325}} At the [[1978 G7 summit]], he discussed strategies for the upcoming election with West German Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]], who advised him to announce several spending cuts to quell criticism of the large deficits his government was running.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Martin (journalist)|Martin, Lawrence]]. ''Chrétien: The Will to Win'', Toronto: Lester Publishing, 1995 page 262-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a series of defeats in by-elections in 1978, Trudeau waited as long as he could to call [[Canadian federal election, 1979|a statutory general election]] in 1979. He finally did so in the 1979, only two months from the five-year limit provided under the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]].{{sfn|Kaufman (2000-09-29)}}

==Defeat and opposition, 1979–80==
In the [[Canadian federal election, 1979|election of 1979]], Trudeau and the Liberals faced declining poll numbers and the [[Joe Clark]]–led [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] focusing on "pocketbook" issues. Trudeau and his advisors, to contrast with the mild-mannered Clark, based their campaign on Trudeau's decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public's apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign "photo-ops" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark's struggles justifying his party's populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.{{sfn|English (2009)|loc=chpt. 13}}

Though winning the popular vote by four points, the Liberal vote was concentrated in Quebec and faltered in industrial Ontario, allowing the PCs to win the seat-count handily and form a minority government. Trudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured [[Donald Stovel Macdonald|Donald Macdonald]] to be his successor.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265}}

However, before a [[leadership convention]] could be held, with Trudeau's blessing and [[Allan MacEachen]]'s maneuvering in the house, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark's budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a [[Westminster system]], budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their [[loss of supply|failure]] automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139-133, thereby toppling Clark's government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisers persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau's main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Quebec sovereignty.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265–66}}

Trudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|February 1980 election]]: facetiously called the "low bridge", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau's role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate. On election day Ontario returned to the Liberal fold, and Trudeau and the Liberals defeated Clark and won a [[majority government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Stephen Clarkson |title = The Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rY64Ph2yjWoC&amp;pg=PA103 |year = 2011 |publisher = UBC Press |pages = 87–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to power, 1980–84==
[[File:Pierre Elliot Trudeau-2.jpg|right|thumb|Prime Minister Trudeau in 1980]]
The Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of [[Manitoba]]. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent's NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=446-7}} Trudeau then took the unusual step of appointing Liberal [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] from Western provinces to Cabinet, in the [[22nd Canadian Ministry]].

===Quebec referendum===
The first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the [[1980 Quebec referendum|referendum on Quebec sovereignty]], called by the [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[René Lévesque]], the date of which (May 20, 1980) was announced when Parliament re-opened after the election. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Quebec Liberals and [[Claude Ryan]]. He appointed [[Jean Chrétien]] as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the "Non" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau. Unlike Ryan and the Liberals, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the referendum question, and noted that the "association" required consent from the other provinces.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=454}}

As the campaign began to pick up steam, and the Quebec Liberals struggled in the legislative debate, Trudeau and Lévesque became heavily involved, with Lévesque mocking Trudeau's English middle name and aristocratic upbringing.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=450}} Trudeau dramatically intervened in the best-received speech of his career a week before the referendum, extolling the virtues of federalism, mocking the unclear nature of the referendum, and dramatically pointing out that his name was neither French nor English, but a ''Canadian'' name.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=455}} Trudeau noted that English Canada would have to listen to the various issues prompted by the referendum, and he promised a new constitutional agreement should it decide to stay in Canada.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}} The "No" side (that is, "No" to sovereignty) ended up receiving nearly 60% of the vote. Trudeau stated that night that he "had never been so proud to be a Quebecer and a Canadian".{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}}

===Patriation of the constitution===
Trudeau had attempted [[patriation]] of the constitution earlier in his tenure, most notably with the [[Victoria Charter]], but ran into the combined force of provincial premiers on the issues of an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. After the victory in the Quebec referendum, Chrétien was immediately tasked with creating a constitutional settlement.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}}

After chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the intention of the federal government to proceed with a request to the British parliament to patriate the constitution, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis]], and New Brunswick Premier [[Richard Hatfield]] and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their [[Reference question|reference power]], conflicting decisions prompted a [[Patriation Reference|Supreme Court decision]] that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.

After the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British parliament of accepting a unilateral request,&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal |first = Andrew |last = Heard |title = Canadian Independence |year = 1990 |place = Vancouver |publisher = Simon Fraser University |url = https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |accessdate = 2010-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At the meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the caveat that provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was Lévesque, who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Quebec government to the new constitution became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Quebec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau's reputation amongst nationalists in the province.

The [[Canada Act]], which included the [[Constitution Act, 1982]] and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on April 17, 1982.

===Economics/NEP===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
A series of difficult budgets by long-time loyalist [[Allan MacEachen]] in the early 1980s did not improve Trudeau's economic reputation. However, after tough bargaining on both sides, Trudeau did reach a revenue-sharing agreement on energy with Alberta Premier [[Peter Lougheed]] in 1982.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}}  Amongst the policies introduced by Trudeau's last term in office were an expansion in government support for Canada’s poorest citizens&lt;ref name="Penniman1988"&gt;{{cite book |last = Clarkson |first = Stephen |authorlink = Stephen Clarkson |editor-last = Penniman |editor-first = Howard Rae |title = Canada at the Polls, 1984: A Study of the Federal General Elections |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pC3wqzDBlCcC&amp;pg=PA98 |accessdate = 2014-11-28 |series = At the polls |year = 1988 |publisher = Duke University Press |location = Durham, NC |isbn = 978-0-8223-0821-8 |pages = 98–99 |chapter = The Dauphin and the Doomed: John Turner and the Liberal Party's Debacle |lccn = 87027252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of the [[National Energy Program]] (NEP), which created a firestorm of protest in the Western provinces and increased what many termed "[[Western alienation]]".

Trudeau's approval ratings slipped after the bounce from the 1982 patriation.  Meanwhile, the Progressive Conservatives raced out to a substantial lead in opinion polls under new leader [[Brian Mulroney]]. By the beginning of 1984, it was obvious that the Liberals would be heavily defeated if Trudeau remained in office. On February 29, after what he described as a "long walk in the snow", Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election. He formally retired on June 30, ending his 15-year tenure as Prime Minister. Trudeau was succeeded as Liberal leader and Prime Minister by former cabinet minister [[John Turner]], who had been out of politics for almost a decade.

Before handing power to Turner, Trudeau advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauvé]] to appoint over 200 Liberals to [[patronage]] positions.  He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="Mulroney 1991"&gt;''Mulroney: The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], Toronto 1991, McFarlane, Walter, and Ross publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call [[Canadian federal election, 1984|an election for September 1984]], almost a year before it was due. Turner's appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be canceled—advice that Sauvé would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that "I had no option" but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, "[[You had an option, sir]]--to say 'no'--and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party." The Liberals never recovered from this. Combined with anger in Quebec at being left out of patriation, the Liberals were heavily defeated at the 1984 election, losing 95 seats in what was then the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level.

==Retirement==
Trudeau joined the Montreal law firm [[Heenan Blaikie]] as counsel and settled in the historic [[Maison Cormier]] in Montreal following his retirement from politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Annmarie|last2=Macdonell|first2=Cameron|title=Making Himself at Home: Cormier, Trudeau, and the Architecture of Domestic Masculinity|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|date=2016|volume=50|issue=2/3|pages=151–189|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/689984?journalCode=wp|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]] proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition to both Accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.

He also continued to speak against the Parti Québécois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.

Trudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the [[Club of Rome]].  He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met President Ronald Reagan to discuss easing world tensions.

He published his memoirs in 1993; the book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.

In the [[Old age]] of his life, he was afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[prostate cancer]], and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80. He was devastated by the death of his youngest son, [[Michel Trudeau]], who was killed in an avalanche on November 13, 1998.

==Personal life==

===Religious beliefs===
Trudeau was a Roman Catholic and attended church throughout his life. While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the ''United Church Observer'' in 1971: "I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian." Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.{{sfn|Trudeau (1996)|pp=302–303}}

Michael W. Higgins, a former President of [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], has researched Trudeau's spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. According to Michel Gorges, Rector of the [[Dominican University College]], Trudeau "considered himself a lay Dominican".{{attribution needed|date=May 2016}} He studied philosophy under Dominican Father [[Louis-Marie Régis]] and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding Régis as "spiritual director and friend". Another skein in Trudeau's spirituality was a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] aspect acquired from his association with the [[Benedictine]] tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of [[Christian meditation|meditation]] in a life fully lived. He took retreats at [[Saint-Benoît-du-Lac, Quebec]] and regularly attended [[Liturgy of the Hours|Hours]] and the [[Eucharist]] at Montreal's Benedictine community.{{sfn|Higgins, M. (2004)|pp=26–30}}

Although never publicly theological in the way of [[Margaret Thatcher]] or [[Tony Blair]], nor evangelical, in the way of [[Jimmy Carter]] or [[George W. Bush]], Trudeau's spirituality, according to Michael W. Higgins, "suffused, anchored, and directed his inner life. In no small part, it defined him."{{sfn|Higgins, M. (2004)|pp=26–30}}

On March 4, 1971, while Prime Minister, he quietly married [[Margaret Trudeau|Margaret Sinclair]] at [https://ststephensnv.com/ St. Stephen's Roman Catholic parish church] in [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=2000-10-01|accessdate=2013-02-01|author=Christopher Guly|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/life/Archive+kept+Trudeau+biggest+secret/7781606/story.html|title=Archive: The man who kept Trudeau's biggest secret|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114180005/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/life/Archive+kept+Trudeau+biggest+secret/7781606/story.html|archivedate=2013-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to his publicized exploits, Trudeau was an intense intellectual with robust work habits and little time for family or fun. As a result, Margaret felt trapped and bored in the marriage, feelings that were exacerbated by her retroactively diagnosed bipolar depression.{{sfn|English (2009)|pp=242–43, 321, 389}}

The couple had three sons: the first two, [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|23rd and current]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Justin Trudeau|Justin]] (born 1971), and [[Alexandre Trudeau|Alexandre]] (born 1973), were both born on Christmas Day two years apart. Their third son, [[Michel Trudeau|Michel]] (1975–1998), died in an avalanche while skiing in [[Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park]]. They separated in 1977, and were finally divorced in 1984.{{sfn|Southam (2005)|pp=113, 234}}{{sfn|McCall (1982)|p=387}}

When his divorce was finalized in 1984, Trudeau became the first Canadian Prime Minister to become a single parent as the result of divorce. In 1984, Trudeau was romantically involved with [[Margot Kidder]] (a Canadian actress famous for her role as [[Lois Lane]] in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' and its sequels) in the last months of his prime-ministership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=1983-04-29|accessdate=2013-02-01|agency=Canadian Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=66MyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-u4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3107,4381909|title=Dating Superman's girl Trudeau's major impact|author=Carl Mollins}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after leaving office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Ottawa Citizen|agency=CP|title=Trudeau steals the spotlight at Montreal film premiere|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c6QyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Tu8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3476,799386&amp;dq=kidder|date=1984-08-03|accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Trudeau became a father again, with [[Deborah Coyne|Deborah Margaret Ryland Coyne]], to his only daughter, Sarah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/895866--pierre-trudeau-s-daughter-sarah-lives-under-the-radar|location=Toronto|work=The Toronto Star|first=Brett|last=Popplewell|title=Pierre Trudeau's daughter, Sarah, lives under the radar|date=November 24, 2010|accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coyne later stood for the leadership of the federal Liberal Party in [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2013|2013]],&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt; the same election that Trudeau's son Justin won, at which she came in fifth.

===Judo===
Trudeau began practising the Japanese martial art [[judo]] sometime in the mid-1950s when he was in his mid-thirties, and by the end of the decade he was [[Judo ranks and grades|ranked]] ''ikkyū'' (brown belt). Later, when he travelled to Japan as Prime Minister, he was promoted to ''shodan'' (first-degree black belt) by the [[Kodokan Judo Institute|Kodokan]], and then promoted to ''nidan'' (second-degree black belt) by [[Masao Takahashi]] in Ottawa before leaving office. Trudeau began the night of his famous "walk in the snow" before announcing his retirement in 1984 by going to judo with his sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Nurse |first = Paul |title = Pierre Trudeau and Judo? |url = http://www.judoontario.ca/download.php?file=newsletters/newsletter_2009_07_06.pdf |work = The Gentle Way (Volume 6, Issue 4) |publisher = Judo Ontario |accessdate = 2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Trudeau remains well regarded by many Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/torstar-16-02-2002b.html "Trudeau tops 'greatest Canadian' poll". ''Toronto Star'', February 16, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005551/http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/torstar-16-02-2002b.html |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the passage of time has only slightly softened the strong antipathy he inspired among his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;"The Worst Canadian?", ''[[The Beaver (magazine)|The Beaver]]'' '''87''' (4), Aug/Sep 2007. The article reports the results of a promotional, online survey by write-in vote for "the worst Canadian", which the magazine carried out in the preceding months, and in which Trudeau polled highest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Mulroney]], who was Prime Minister at the time of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords, and one of the chief forces behind them, sharply criticized Trudeau's opposition to them, in his 2007 autobiography, ''[[Memoirs: 1939–1993]]''.

Trudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to [[Canadian nationalism]], and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Quebec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced—and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.

Some consider Trudeau's economic policies to have been a weak point. Inflation and unemployment marred much of his tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18&amp;nbsp;billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200&amp;nbsp;billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csls.ca/data/ipt2006.pdf | title=GDP figures | publisher=Centre for the Study of Living Standards | date=2006 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these trends were present in most western countries at the time, including the United States.

Many politicians still use the term "taking a walk in the snow", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are "[[just watch me]]", the "[[Finger (gesture)|Trudeau Salute]]", and "[[Fuddle duddle|Fuddle Duddle]]".

[[Maclean's]] 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys [[Historical rankings of Canadian prime ministers|ranked him twice]] as the fifth best Canadian prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-best-prime-ministers/ |title = Canada's best prime ministers |publisher = [[Maclean's]] |date = 10 June 2011 |accessdate = 25 August 2015 |author = Hillmer. Norman and Stephen Azzi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional legacy===
One of Trudeau's most enduring legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, including a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is seen as advancing [[civil rights]] and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] all across Canada. [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of [[Metis (people)|Métis]]. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the charter has been infrequently used.

[[Canadian conservatism|Canadian conservatives]] claim the constitution has resulted in too much [[judicial activism]] on the part of the courts in Canada. It is also heavily criticized by [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any [[Politics of Quebec|Quebec government]] and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for [[Quebec]].

===Bilingualism===
{{See also|Bilingualism in Canada}}
Bilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.

However, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term "bilingualism", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which ''all'' cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Quebec to Canada.

===Multiculturalism===
On October 8, 1971, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Multiculturalism Policy in the House of Commons.  It was the first of its kind in the world,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=142}} and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern.  Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau's predecessor Lester B. Pearson.

===Cultural legacy===
In the last years of his tenure he ensured both the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] had proper homes in the national capital region. The Trudeau government also implemented programs which mandated [[Canadian content]] in film, and broadcasting, and gave substantial subsidies to develop the Canadian media and cultural industries. Though the policies remain controversial, Canadian media industries have become stronger since Trudeau's arrival.

===Legacy with respect to western Canada===
Trudeau's posthumous reputation in the Western Provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the "father of [[Western alienation]]".  To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially [[Ontario]] and Quebec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the [[National Energy Program]], which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich [[Alberta]] where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta/#h3_jump_3 Alberta's economy]. Thecanadianencyclopedia.com. Retrieved 2015-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates have placed Alberta's losses between $50&amp;nbsp;billion and $100&amp;nbsp;billion because of the NEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Mary Elizabeth |last = Vicente |title = The National Energy Program |work = Canada's Digital Collections |publisher = Heritage Community Foundation |year = 2005 |url = http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/issues_nep.html |accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Robert |last = Mansell |author2 = Schlenker, Ron |author3 = Anderson, John |title = Energy, Fiscal Balances and National Sharing |publisher = Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy/[[University of Calgary]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate = 2008-04-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626113516/http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the [[Canadian Wheat Board]]. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with  "Why should ''I'' sell your wheat?"&amp;nbsp;– however, he had asked the [[rhetorical question|question rhetorically]] and then proceeded to answer it himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/chretien-accused-of-lying/ "Chrétien Accused of Lying"], ''[[Maclean's]]'', December 23, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, on a train trip through [[Salmon Arm, British Columbia]], he "gave the [[Finger (gesture)|finger]]" to a group of protesters through the carriage window&amp;nbsp;– less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Westell, ''Paradox: Trudeau as Prime Minister''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy with respect to Quebec===
Trudeau's legacy in Quebec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the [[October Crisis]] as crucial in terminating the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) as a force in Quebec, and ensuring that the campaign for Quebec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his [[War Measures Act#The October Crisis|imposition of the War Measures Act]]—which received majority support at the time—is remembered by some in Quebec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the [[1980 Quebec referendum]].

At the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Quebec during his time as Prime Minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Quebec seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 federal election]]. Provincially, though, Québécois twice elected the pro-sovereignty [[Parti Québécois]]. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the [[Bloc Québécois]]. Since the signing of the [[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitutional Act of Canada]] in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Quebec. He was disliked by the Quebecois nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210244/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/trudeau.htm Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Quebec and the Constitution], marianopolis.edu; retrieved 2011-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual contributions===
Trudeau was a strong advocate for a [[federalism|federalist]] model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Quebec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during [[Maurice Duplessis]]' time in power.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

Federalism in this context can be defined as "a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples&amp;nbsp;... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples".&lt;ref&gt;Ignatieff, quoted in Balthazar (1995), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

As a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on [[social democracy]] with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}}}} In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:{{quote|[R]ather than water down&amp;nbsp;... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}}}

Trudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, "in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people."{{sfn|English (2009)|p=133}}

Trudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: "While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates—emotive and particularistic—to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict".&lt;ref name="Gagnon2000pp16-17"&gt;Gagnon (2000), 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

This position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Quebec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood.&lt;ref name="Gagnon2000pp16-17"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed [[1969 White Paper]], developed under Trudeau by [[Jean Chrétien]].

In 1999, CP also named Trudeau "Newsmaker of the 20th Century." Trudeau declined to give CP an interview on that occasion, but said in a letter that he was "surprised and pleased."

===Order of Canada Citation===
Trudeau was appointed a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]] on June 24, 1985. His citation reads:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=1688&amp;t=12&amp;ln=Trudeau Order of Canada]. Archive.gg.ca (April 30, 2009). Retrieved 2011-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lawyer, professor, author and defender of human rights this statesman served as Prime Minister of Canada for fifteen years. Lending substance to the phrase "the style is the man," he has imparted, both in his and on the world stage, his quintessentially personal philosophy of modern politics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In film==
Through hours of archival footage and interviews with Trudeau himself, the documentary ''Memoirs'' details the story of a man who used intelligence and charisma to bring together a country that was very nearly torn apart. Trudeau's life is depicted in two [[CBC Television]] mini-series. The first one, ''[[Trudeau (film)|Trudeau]]'' (with [[Colm Feore]] in the title role), depicts his years as Prime Minister. ''Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making'' with Stéphane Demers as the young Pierre, and Tobie Pelletier as him in later years) portrays his earlier life.

The 1999 documentary film ''[[Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the '70s Generation]]'' explores the impact of Trudeau's vision of Canadian bilingualism through interviews with eight young Canadians. He was the co-subject along with [[René Lévesque]] in the [[Donald Brittain]]-directed documentary mini-series ''[[The Champions (documentary miniseries)|The Champions]]''.

'''Preciado Bakish''' ([[Hebrew]]: פרסיאדו בקיש )&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;[[Bulgar]]: Пресиадо Бакиш. His surname is sometimes spelled Bakich or Baquiche (http://skachate.ru/jurnalistika/63296/index.html?page=12). The first name is sometimes written "Presiado". The first name Yakir ([[Hebrew]]: יקיר) is sometimes attributed to him. This name could match "expensive", "precious" which would mark a relationship with the Hebrew root Y.K.R. (yakar) and would be a translation of the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] name Preciado (or Presiado). See: http://www.sephardicstudies.org/pdf/prom_bulg_jews.pdf ; Arditti, Benjamin (Ed. 1969), Volume I, pp. 20-32.  Second first name : Yits'hak (http://skachate.ru/jurnalistika/63296/index.html?page=12).&lt;/ref&gt; was a rabbi and a Bulgar member of the Zionist Movement.

==Biographical elements==
Born in 1828 at [[Sofia]] ([[Bulgaria]]) to a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;On its Sephardic family, see: Hillel Bakis (1992), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Jerusalem]] at the age of 82 (1910). He was named Chief Rabbi of [[Bulgaria]] (1885–1889; 1895–1898&lt;ref&gt;Arditti Benjamin (1969), Vol. 1, p.: 20-32. See also n° 108 in Anon (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  or 1900)&lt;ref&gt;According to Ivanka Gezenko, he served as until 1900&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Av Beit Din]] (Chairman of the Rabbinical Court)&lt;ref&gt;http://skachate.ru/jurnalistika/63296/index.html?page=12 (page on Bulgar Jewish Union in Israel).&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in the [[First Zionist Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;Z. Loker, "The Sephardic Jews in Bulgaria", in H. Mechoulan (ed. 1992), ''Les Juifs d'Espagne histoire d'une diaspora. 1492-1992', p. 260. However, some sources do not mention its participation (http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/bulgaria.html)&lt;/ref&gt; held on 29, 30 and 31 August 1897 to [[Basel]] (Switzerland) along with three other delegates from Bulgaria (Zvi Belkovsky,&lt;ref&gt;(1865-1948). From Russian citizenship, he was Lecturer at Sofia University.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Herbst, Yehoshua Kalef) and some 200 other members from around the world. These activities have created difficulties and Rabbi Preciado Bakish was not maintained in his functions as Chief Rabbi of Bulgaria after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanka Gezenko (2014, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  A photograph of Rabbi Bakish was published on a genealogy website&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B8-%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE-%D0%98%D1%86%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%88/4977820646350132340 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince Pyotr Dmitrievich Svyatopolk-Mirsky''' ({{lang-ru|князь Пётр Дми́триевич Святопо́лк-Ми́рский}}) ({{OldStyleDate|30 August|1857|18 August}}, [[Vladikavkaz]] – {{OldStyleDate|29 May|1914|16 May}}, [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]]) was a Russian noble, politician and police official.

==Family==

Svyatopolk-Mirsky was born in Vladikavkaz into the prominent [[Svyatopolk-Mirsky]] family. He was the only son of the general [[Dmitry Ivanovich Svyatopolk-Mirsky]] and Princess Sofia [[Orbeliani]]. Pyotr was educated at [[Page Corps]], graduating in 1874 with first-class honours, and was appointed Page of the Chamber. In 1875, he became a [[cornet]] at ''Her Empress [[Russian Guards#Imperial Russia|Leib-Guards]] [[Hussar]]s''. He was father to literary historian [[D. S. Mirsky]].

==Military career==

Svyatopolk-Mirsky took part in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78]] and was decorated for valor in the [[Battle of Kars]]. Then he studied at the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|General Staff Academy]] and graduated in 1881. 

In 1884, he was made the acting commander of the staff of 31st Infantry division, and in 1887, he was appointed to commander of staff of 3d [[Grenadier]] division.

==Political career==

In 1895, he was appointed the [[governor of Penza]], and in 1897 the [[governor of Yekaterinoslav]].

In 1900, [[Dmitry Sergeyevich Sipyagin|Dmitry Sipyagin]] appointed Svyatopolk-Mirsky assistant [[Minister of the Interior]] and commander of the Imperial Corps of [[Gendarmerie|Gendarme]]s. After Sipyagin's assassination in 1902, Svyatopolk-Mirsky resigned as assistant minister but was persuaded to accept the position of [[Governor-General of Vilna]] (modern-day [[Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]]). As the Governor-General, Svyatopolk-Mirsky was credited with successful liberal reforms, defusing national tensions in the provence by allowing more rights to the national minorities, stopping [[pogrom]]s against the Jews.

In July 1904, he succeeded to the position of [[MVD|Minister of the Interior]] after [[Vyacheslav von Plehve|Plehve]]'s assassination. His appointment was seen as a victory of [[Liberalism|Liberals]] over the Conservatives and in the Court term as a victory of the party of widow Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]] (who supported the liberal reforms and was a patroness of Pyotr's sister Olga) over the party of [[Empress consort]] [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Alexandra Fyodorovna]].

Conservative Ministers [[Sergei Witte|Witte]] and Sipiagin credited Svyatopolk-Mirsky with being an honorable, intelligent man of the highest moral principles, which is notable due to his attempts at liberal reform in [[Imperial Russia]] while minister. These reforms began with permitting members of the local [[Zemstvo]]s to gather to discuss broader policy issues and coordination of Zemstvo programs, something that had not been permitted in Russia regularly. The remaining reforms were embodied in a decree that called for the inclusion of elected members to the State Council, removal of the restrictions on the [[Old Believer]]s, measures to strengthen legality, extend freedom of the press and religion, broaden the authority of local self-government, eliminate unnecessary restrictions on non-Russians, and do away with exceptional laws in general. Svyatopolk-Mirsky not only allowed the congress, but also participated in its work and personally delivered its decision to Tsar [[Nicholas II]] along with his own plan for constitutional reforms. 

Svyatopolk-Mirsky's plan included transferring more power to the [[State Council of Imperial Russia]]. The plan was much less radical than the reforms implemented by the [[October Manifesto]] 1905, but in December 1904 it was considered ultra-radical and was dismissed.

The massacre of a peaceful demonstration in [[Saint Petersburg]], known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], occurred on {{OldStyleDate|January 22|1905|January 9}}. According to Svyatopolk-Mirsky, he never had authorised the shooting of the demonstrators, but still fulfilled his final duty to the tsar, becoming the [[scapegoat]] for the massacre. According to Svyatopolk-Mirsky's opponents, he not only did authorise the shooting, but also actively encouraged the demonstration in order to push his own political agenda.

Svyatopolk-Mirsky was replaced as minister of the Interior by [[Alexander Bulygin]] in February 1905 and retired from government service. As a retired Minister of Interior, he was expected to be appointed a member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia]], but it was not the case. He retired from the political life until his death on 16 May 1914.

'''Cipriano Cermeño II''' (December 5, 1955 – July 25, 2010), known by his screen name '''Redford White''' was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] actor and comedian.

==Early life and career==
White first came to prominence in the late 1970s for his supporting role in the sitcom ''[[Iskul Bukol]]''.&lt;ref name=pep&gt;{{cite news |title=Comedian Redford White Has Passed Away |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/26283/Comedian-Redford-White-has-passed-away |author=Erwin Santiago |publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal |date=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a string of hits as the leading man in several 1980s comedies such as ''Bino and Klayd'', ''Darakula'' and ''Hee Man: Master of None'', his first major role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salanga|first=Elyas Isabelo|title=Comedy's dynamic duos|url=http://www.pep.ph/top/13502/Comedy's-dynamic-duos|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|accessdate=25 July 2010|date=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, he starred in the TV sitcom ''Buddy en Sol'' with [[Eric Quizon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dedace|first=Sophia|title=Redford White, actor-comedian, is dead|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/196933/redford-white-actor-comedian-is-dead|accessdate=25 July 2010|date=25 July 2010|agency=GMANews.TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of his career, White appeared in several films for [[Star Cinema]] such as ''Tar-San'', ''Ala eh... Con Bisoy! Hale-hale-hoy!: Laging panalo ang mga unggoy'', and ''Haba-baba-doo! Puti-puti-poo!'' paired with various comedians including [[Babalu (comedian)|Babalu]], Bonel Balingit, [[Carding Castro]] and [[Leo Martinez]].&lt;ref name=abs&gt;{{cite news |title=Comedian Redford White passes away |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/07/25/10/comedian-redford-white-passes-away |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=2010-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His last film and television appearances were in ''[[Iskul Bukol 20 Years After (Ungasis and Escaleras Adventure)|Iskul Bukol 20 Years After]]'' and ''[[Palos (TV series)|Palos]]'' on [[ABS-CBN]], respectively, in 2008.

==Personal life==
White was reportedly born with [[albinism]], which gave rise to his screen name. He was married to Elena Cermeño and they had a daughter, Jeruie. His closest friends were his fellow ''Buddy En Sol'' co-star [[Eric Quizon]], [[Vic Sotto]] who worked with him in the sitcom ''Daddy Di Do Du'', singer-songwriter [[Jim Paredes]] and comedians Gabe Mercado and Leo Martinez.

==Illness and death==
White died at the age of 54 from [[lung cancer]] and a brain tumor on July 25, 2010 at 06:47 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] ([[GMT+8]]). He had reportedly experienced dizziness and difficulty walking, and loss of balance as early as July 2008, which the actor initially mistook for symptoms of [[vertigo]]. His physician advised [[magnetic resonance imaging]], which White refused. He was later diagnosed with Stage 4 [[brain cancer]] in February 2010.&lt;ref name="Comedian Redford White passes away"&gt;{{cite web|first1=abs-cbnNEWS.com|title=Comedian Redford White passes away|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/07/25/10/comedian-redford-white-passes-away|website=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[wake]] took place at Santo Niño de Maligaya Shrine&lt;ref name="Comedian Redford White passes away"/&gt; in Maligaya Park Subdivision, [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]].&lt;ref name=abs/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7635">'''Robert "Bob" Boyer''' (July 20, 1948 &amp;ndash; August 30, 2004) was a Canadian visual artist and university professor of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] heritage. He was a [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] [[Cree]] artist known for his politically charged abstract paintings.

==Life and work==
Boyer grew up in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]] and earned a BEd from the Regina Campus of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=jjs&gt;Jacoby-Smith, Jennifer. [https://www.usask.ca/alumni/alumnisite/publications/green_white/issues/winter2005/feature01.php "The Painterly Life of Bob Boyer."] ''University of Saskatchewan: Green and White.'' (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Saskatchewan arts community in 1973 and worked on community programming at the [[Norman MacKenzie Art Gallery]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] until the mid-1970s. He was then a professor of Indian Fine Arts at the [[Saskatchewan Indian Federated College]] ("SIFC") (now [[First Nations University of Canada]]), a federated college of the [[University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus]], later the [[University of Regina]], until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/boyer_bob_1948-2004.html "Bob Boyer."] ''Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan.'' (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at the SIFC, Boyer acted as the Head of the Department of Indian Fine Arts.

Boyer's early paintings use material such as acrylics, paper, and canvas. The earliest paintings are realistic, but he soon embarked on an effort to incorporate an abstract style in his work. One of the earliest results of this is "Horses Can Fly, Too," a representation of a horse-figure streaking through the sky. Boyer is well known for his large-scale geometric paintings on felt blankets that he produced primarily in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This began after a trip to China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Newlands, 56&lt;/ref&gt;  He said, "There were paintings on silk or cloth and gradually this whole thing about art not having to be made on stretched canvas really began to get through to me."&lt;ref name=jjs/&gt; Boyer used oil paints applied thickly, using rough brush strokes in many of these works. The geometric designs on the blanket paintings come from the tradition motifs of [[Siouan]] and [[Cree]] groups in Western Canada. Boyer tended to use traditional colour combinations in early blanket paintings, but some later examples are painted in pastels.

At first Boyer painted about the wrong Europeans have done to Aboriginal peoples, but he later switched to things about the Aboriginal culture and the meaning of life.  Boyer called all of this 'Blanket Statements'.

Many of the pieces from the Boyer's 'Blanket Period' are in the permanent collections of major galleries such the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the Norman MacKenzie Gallery. Paintings bear unique and enigmatic titles that came to Boyer at poignant moments such as after [[sweat lodge]] ceremonies.

Boyer's influences from aboriginal art traditions are obvious, but he was also influenced by local Saskatchewan artists such as [[Ted Godwin]] and Art McKay of the ''[[Regina Five]]'', and to a lesser extent [[Joe Fafard]]. As a university professor and elder, Boyer mentored many young aboriginal and non-aboriginal artists.   

Boyer died in 2004 while [[powwow]] dancing.&lt;ref name=jjs/&gt;

== Murals in the Royal Saskatchewan Museum ==

Boyer painted large murals in the [http://www.royalsaskmuseum.ca/gallery/first_nations/first_nations.shtml First Nations Gallery] of the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]].  A large mural forms part of the display of the winter camp in the "Seasonal Round" section of the Gallery.

== The Carousel of Life Mural ==

One of Boyer's larger works is the Carousel of Life mural, painted on the exterior west wall of the building located at 2941-13th Avenue in the [[Neighbourhoods_in_Regina,_Saskatchewan#.22Cathedral_Area.22_.28the_West_End.29|Cathedral district of Regina]], which is adjacent to the 13th Avenue Canada Safeway grocery store.  It depicts four horses framed by one of Boyer's blankets.  It was commissioned by the Cathedral Area Community Association in 1996, as part of the annual arts festival.

On August 2, 2011, the [[Regina, Saskatchewan|City of Regina]] announced that Safeway had applied for zoning changes to allow it to expand its 13th Avenue store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regina.ca/Page5629.aspx Proposed Rezoning and Discretionary Use (11-Z-10/11-DU-16)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Sheet for the proposed re-zoning application states that "... most of the flanking on the existing site will be lost to the grocery store expansion..."&lt;ref&gt;City of Regina [http://www.regina.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=7204 Information Sheet].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Sheet does not state if the Boyer mural will be preserved in some fashion, or if [[Canada Safeway]] will destroy the mural as part of the expansion of its store.

The issue of the mural attracted some attention in a column in the local newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;Couture, "[https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/COUTURE+Pick+your+battles/5254985/story.html Pick Your Battles]", Regina Leader-Post, August 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and in letters to the editor.&lt;ref&gt;Pratchler, "[https://leaderpost.com/opinion/letters/Mural+important/5264942/story.html Mural is Important]", Regina Leader-Post, August 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, "[https://leaderpost.com/opinion/letters/Store+plan+insensitive/5264941/story.html Store Plan Insensitive]", Regina Leader-Post, August 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soper |accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – October 4, 2017), also known as '''Rufus the Stunt Bum''', was an American advocate for [[homeless]] rights who became known for his role in the early ''[[Bumfights]]'' videos: in 2000, while himself a homeless [[alcoholic]], he was paid $5 to be filmed running headfirst into a stack of milk crates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/magazine/06wwln_phenomenon.html | title = Degradation Inc. | work = Phenomenon | publisher = [[New York Times]] magazine | author = Aimee Molloy | date = August 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Hannah was raised in [[Swainsboro, Georgia]]. He started drinking at 14, despite having a "good family." He was a construction worker until the age of 27, when he joined the [[U.S. Army]]. He was soon discharged after injuring himself during basic training. After his injury, he started drinking heavily, leading to his homelessness and alcoholism. In the early 1990s, he moved to California, where he was approached by Ryan McPherson to produce ''[[Bumfights]]''.

==''Bumfights''==
He subsequently was filmed performing other "stunts" for the ''Bumfights'' videos, including riding a [[shopping cart]] down a flight of stairs, ramming his head into steel doors so hard that he suffered from [[epilepsy]], and beating up Donald "Donnie" Brennan, another homeless man, so badly that Brennan's leg was broken in two places and required surgical intervention. Brennan, an army [[veteran]], and Hannah (who was injured in basic training), were paid an average of $10 per stunt. Both men were also paid to get ''Bumfights'' [[tattoo]]s: Hannah's tattoo was across his knuckles and Brennan's was on his forehead. 

In 2002, Hannah and Brennan testified in the criminal trials of the producers of ''Bumfights'' on several charges, including the soliciting of felonies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/1912128/detail.html | title = 'Bumfights' Producers To Stand Trial | publisher = NBC San Diego | date = January 15, 2003 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060906220943/http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/1912128/detail.html | archivedate = September 6, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0209/26/lol.09.html | title = "Bumfights" Video Creators Charged With Felonies | format = Transcript of live interview with Hannah—misspelled "Hanna" | publisher = CNN.com | date = September 26, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the defendants were acquitted on the majority of charges and sentenced to [[community service]] for conspiring to stage an illegal fight (in 2005, they were sentenced to 6 months in prison for having failed to complete the community service).

Hannah and Brennan also filed a civil suit against the producers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/bumfights/bumfights100202cmp.pdf | title = Copy of Civil Complaint, Hannah and Brennan vs. McPherson, et al. | publisher = [[findlaw]] | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/03/1033538715422.html | title = Revenge of the homeless: 'Bumfight' video lawsuit | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = October 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the producers agreed to pay an unspecified amount in damages, and to no longer use Hannah and Brennan's images for promotional purposes.

==After ''Bumfights''==
Hannah remained sober from 2003 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040717/news_1m17fights.html | title = Former 'bum' beats the bottle - Army veteran was part of infamous underground video }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a property manager, and spent 40 hours a week performing such duties as painting apartments and constructing fences. He hoped to one day get the 'Bum Fights' tattoo removed from his knuckles. In 2010 he released a book co-written with Barry Soper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abumdeal.net/bum-deal-book/ | title = A Bum Deal - An Unlikely Journey from Hopeless to Humanitarian | date = December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''A Bum Deal: An Unlikely Journey from Hopeless to Humanitarian'' detailing his ordeal from becoming a homeless alcoholic, his time during the filming of ''Bumfights'', and his struggle to get sober.

==Death==
On October 4, 2017, Hannah was killed when the car he was riding in as a passenger was hit by a truck.&lt;ref name=NBCSanDiego&gt;[http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Rufus-Hannah-Star-of-La-Mesa-BumFights-Video-Dies-in-Georgia-Crash-449657543.html Rufus Hannah, 63, Star of San Diego 'BumFights' Videos Dies in Georgia Car Crash], by Monica Garske, at [[NBC San Diego]]; published October 6, 2017; retrieved October 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Rachal Verplank''' (born July 9, 1964) is an American [[professional golfer]], who has played on the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[PGA Tour Champions]].

==Early years and amateur career==
Born and raised in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], Verplank was a leading member of the [[W.T. White High School]] golf team and a regular at Brookhaven Country Club in Dallas. He graduated from high school in 1982 and attended [[Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls|Oklahoma State University]] in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]].  At OSU, he was a member of the 1983 [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA]] Championship team, finishing T3 alongside teammates [[Tommy Moore (golfer)|Tommy Moore]], [[Willie Wood (golfer)|Willie Wood]], [[Andy Dillard]], and [[Philip Walton]]. He went on later to win the 1984 [[U.S. Amateur]] at the [[Oak Tree Golf Club]], and in 1986, win the [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA]] individual title.

Prior to his senior year at Oklahoma State, Veplank won the [[Western Open]] outside [[Chicago]] in August [[1985 PGA Tour|1985]]; it was the first victory by an amateur on the PGA Tour in 29 years ([[Doug Sanders]], 1956 [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]]).&lt;ref name=tinovov&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6rMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U-8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2400%2C2564232 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Thorpe is not only victim of Verplank |date=August 5, 1985 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amotdpft&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4JFTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AIcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4098%2C2203782 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Amateur outduels pro for title |date=August 5, 1985 |page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated [[Jim Thorpe (golfer)|Jim Thorpe]] on the second extra hole of a playoff for the win at [[Butler National Golf Club]] in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=tinovov/&gt;&lt;ref name=amotdpft/&gt;

==Professional career==
Verplank graduated and turned professional in [[1986 PGA Tour|1986]], using his two-year exemption on the PGA Tour; his first event as a pro was the [[1986 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at [[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club|Shinnecock Hills]] in June, his sixth tour event {{nowrap|that year.&lt;ref name=vowopn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-dlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6842%2C3020897 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Verplank opens with Open |date=June 12, 1986 |page=4F}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He earned five wins on the PGA Tour, and two [[Ryder Cup]] appearances, in [[2002 Ryder Cup|2002]] and [[2006 Ryder Cup|2006]]. Verplank has [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1]] [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and uses an [[insulin pump]] during play.&lt;ref name=etr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/players/playerid=2642/bio/index.html |title=European Tour biography |publisher=PGA European Tour |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2002 [[Ben Hogan]] Award, given by the Golf Writers Association of America to an individual who has continued to be active in golf despite a physical handicap or serious illness.&lt;ref name=etr/&gt;  Verplank has been featured in the top 20 of the [[Official World Golf Rankings]], reaching as high as eleventh in [[2001 PGA Tour|2001]].

He hit a [[hole-in-one]] in the Ryder Cup, on the 14th hole during a singles match against [[Pádraig Harrington]] in [[2006 Ryder Cup|2006]]. The shot did not impact the overall result, however, as Europe had already won the trophy. Nonetheless, he was the first American player to card an ace during the Ryder Cup; his overall record in the competition is 4 wins and 1 loss.

Verplank's most recent win was the [[2007 PGA Tour|2007]] [[EDS Byron Nelson Championship]], in which he defeated [[Luke Donald]] by one stroke.  As a Dallas native, Verplank called the EDS Byron Nelson Championship "a fifth major," and also mentioned that "Byron was with me today" (the 2007 tournament was the first held after Nelson's death). His best finish in a [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]] was a tie for fourth at the [[PGA Championship]] in [[2011 PGA Championship|2011]].

In December 2010, Verplank was named a 2011 winner of the [[Silver Anniversary Awards (NCAA)|NCAA Silver Anniversary Award]], given annually to six former NCAA student-athletes for distinguished career accomplishment on the 25th anniversary of their college graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/NCAA/Media+and+Events/Press+Room/News+Release+Archive/2010/Awards+and+Scholarships/20101201+Silver+Award+Rls |title=NCAA Names Silver Anniversary Winners |publisher=NCAA |date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205115128/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fncaa%2FNCAA%2FMedia+and+Events%2FPress+Room%2FNews+Release+Archive%2F2010%2FAwards+and+Scholarships%2F20101201+Silver+Award+Rls |archivedate=December 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verplank competed in the 2011 [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] finishing T38 and then the following week at the [[Shell Houston Open]] in which Verplank finished T2 behind [[Phil Mickelson]]. Verplank had held a joint 54-hole lead with Mickelson and even held the lead on his own at a number of stages during the final round, however his lack of competitive golf proved costly throughout the final few holes and he was unable to close out the victory. This was his best finish on tour in 18 months since finishing T2 at the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]] in 2009. Verplank has amassed over $27 million in career earnings.

Verplank played the 2013 season on a Major Medical Extension after hip and wrist injuries in 2012. He started the 2014 season in a similar fashion, but was not able to satisfy the medical exemption and used his career money list exemption for the remainder of the season. Verplank turned 50 in July 2014 and made his [[Champions Tour]] debut at the {{nowrap|[[U.S. Senior Open]]}} at [[Oak Tree National]], near his residence in Edmond, Oklahoma.

'''The Kennedys''' are an American [[folk-rock]] band, consisting of husband and wife Pete and Maura Kennedy. They are recognized for their harmonies and instrumental prowess, blending elements of country music, bluegrass, Western swing and janglepop.

==Biography==
They met in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1992, when Pete Kennedy was playing in [[Nanci Griffith]]'s band. For their first date, they each drove 500 miles to meet at [[Buddy Holly]]'s grave in [[Lubbock, Texas]].&lt;ref name=TK-musicradar-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vinnicombe|first1=Chris|title=Pete Kennedy talks Teles, Chet and rare Gibsons|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/pete-kennedy-talks-teles-chet-and-rare-gibsons-610025|accessdate=2 May 2017|work=musicradar|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, Maura Kennedy (née Maura Boudreau) joined Griffith's band as a harmony singer, and the Maura and Pete began their career as a duo when they opened for Griffth during her Ireland tour.&lt;ref name=TK-northjersey-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Albrizio|first1=Lianna|title=A true rock ’n’ roll love story|url=http://archive.northjersey.com/arts-and-entertainment/music/a-true-rock-n-roll-love-story-1.675317|accessdate=2 May 2017|work=NorthJersey.com|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete is from the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. Maura grew up in Syracuse, New York. They lived for many years living in the East Village in New York City, and in 2006 they joined other folk musicians living in Northampton, Massachusetts. They then returned to the East Village in 2008.

===Recordings===
Their first album, ''River of Fallen Stars'', was released under the name "Pete and Maura Kennedy"; they released all subsequent albums as "The Kennedys".

Their 1998 album ''Angel Fire'' featured many songs with literary references, such as "A Letter To [[Emily Dickinson|Emily]]" and "Just Like [[Henry David Thoreau|Henry David]]".

===Performing and Touring===
When performing live, Pete plays the acoustic guitar, electric sitar, bass and ukulele, while Maura plays acoustic and electric guitars and uke.

They have performed in clubs and theatres throughout the United States, on a cruise, and at [[Bill Clinton]]'s first and second inaugurations.

===Other projects===
In late 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smoe.org/lists/jangle-poets/v08.n083 |title=The Kennedys' E-Newsletter Message |date=December 30, 2006 |publisher=Smoe.org |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete and Maura joined with [[Chris and Meredith Thompson]] to form [[The Strangelings]], a folk-rock band prominently featuring Pete's electric sitar. Their first performance was on January 12, 2007. The music includes songs by both the Kennedys and the Thompsons in addition to traditional songs and covers. The current full lineup of [[The Strangelings]] includes Pete, Maura, Chris Thompson, Eric Lee on [[fiddle]], Cheryl Prashker on percussion, and Ken Anderson and [[Rebecca Hall (musician)|Rebecca Hall]], also known as [[Hungrytown]].

Herzl formed the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] and promoted Jewish immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in an effort to form a Jewish state.

==Early life==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 6969 Herzl Family.jpg|thumb|Herzl and his family, c. 1866–1873]]
Theodor Herzl was born in the ''Tabakgasse'' (''Dohány utca'' in Hungarian), a street in the Jewish quarter of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] (now eastern part of [[Budapest]]), [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Hungary]]), to a [[secular Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/theodorherzlfoun00cohe/theodorherzlfoun00cohe_djvu.txt Theodor Herzl: Founder of Political Zionism, Israel Cohen]&lt;/ref&gt; His father's family were originally from Zimony (today [[Zemun]], [[Serbia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Theodor's father and grandfather were born in Zemun. See {{cite encyclopedia|title=Zemun|last=Loker |first=Zvi|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Judaica|editor-first=Michael|editor-last=Berenbaum|editor2-first=Fred|editor2-last=Skolnik|volume=1|edition= 2nd|location=Detroit|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2007|pages=507–508|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_21490.html|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second child of Jeanette and Jakob Herzl, who were German-speaking, assimilated Jews. It is believed Herzl was of both [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardic]] lineage predominately through his paternal line and to a lesser extent through the maternal line.{{sfn|Peres|1999|p=123}} He also claimed to be a direct descendent of the famous Greek Kabbalist [[Joseph Taitazak]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Jakob Herzl (1836–1902), Herzl's father, was a highly successful businessman. Herzl had one sister, Pauline, a year older than he was, who died suddenly on 7 February 1878, of [[typhus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutisrael.co.il/eng/site.php?site_id=281&amp;parent_id=279|title=Theodor Herzl&amp;nbsp;– Background|publisher=About Israel|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodor lived with his family in a house next to the [[Dohány Street Synagogue]] (formerly known as Tabakgasse Synagogue) located in [[Inner City (Budapest)|Belváros]], the inner city of the historical old town of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], in the eastern section of [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Herzl |first=Theodor |date=14 January 1898 |title=An Autobiography |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |issue=1 |p=20 |url-access=registration |url=https://www.thejc.com/archive/subscription-required-7.102?aId=1.152064 |accessdate=1 April 2017 |quote=I was born in 1860 in Budapest in a house next to the synagogue where lately the rabbi denounced me from the pulpit in very sharp terms (...)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herzl|first=Theodor|authorlink=Theodor Herzl|year=1960|title=Herzl Speaks: His Mind on Issues, Events and Men|url=http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1634 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119183728/http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1634 |archivedate=19 November 2005|quote=I went ... to the synagogue [in Paris] and found the services once again solemn and moving.

As a youth, Herzl aspired to follow in the footsteps of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]],&lt;ref&gt;Chouraqui, André. ''A Man Alone: The Life of Theodor Herzl''. Keter Books, 1970, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; builder of the [[Suez Canal]], but did not succeed in the sciences and instead developed a growing enthusiasm for poetry and the humanities. This passion later developed into a successful career in journalism and a less-celebrated pursuit of playwrighting.&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos (1975). ''Herzl'', pp. 21–22, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. {{ISBN|978-0-03-013126-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amos Elon,&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos (1975). ''Herzl'', p. 23, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. {{ISBN|978-0-03-013126-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a young man, Herzl was an ardent Germanophile who saw the Germans as the best ''Kulturvolk'' (cultured people) in Central Europe and embraced the German ideal of ''[[Bildung]]'', whereby reading great works of literature by Goethe and Shakespeare could allow one to appreciate the beautiful things in life, and thus become a morally better person (the ''Bildung'' theory tended to equate beauty with goodness).&lt;ref name="Buruma, Ian page 180"&gt;Buruma, Ian ''Anglomania: A European Love Affair'', New York: Vintage Books, 1998 page 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Through ''Bildung'', Herzl believed that Hungarian Jews such as himself could shake off their "shameful Jewish characteristics" caused by long centuries of impoverishment and oppression, and become civilized Central Europeans, a true ''Kulturvolk'' along the German lines.&lt;ref name="Buruma, Ian page 180"/&gt;

In 1878, after the death of his sister, Pauline, the family moved to [[Vienna]], Austria-Hungary, and lived in the 9th district, [[Alsergrund]]. At the University of Vienna, Herzl studied law. As a young law student, Herzl became a member of the German nationalist ''[[Burschenschaft]]'' (fraternity) Albia, which had the motto ''Ehre, Freiheit, Vaterland'' ("Honor, Freedom, Fatherland"). He later resigned in protest at the organisation's [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herzl.org/english/Article.aspx?Item=515&amp;Section=491 Herzl Museum: Herzl – A Man of His Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908102812/http://www.herzl.org/english/Article.aspx?Item=515&amp;Section=491 |date=8 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief legal career in the [[University of Vienna]] and [[Salzburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/PEOPLE/BIOS/herzl.html|title=Theodor Herzl (1860–1904)|accessdate=8 August 2009|publisher=[[Jewish Agency for Israel]]|quote=He received a doctorate in law in 1884 and worked for a short while in courts in Vienna and Salzburg.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930134611/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/BIOS/herzl.html|archivedate=30 September 2009|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; he devoted himself to [[journalism]] and [[literature]], working as a journalist for a Viennese newspaper and a correspondent for ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'', in Paris, occasionally making special trips to [[London]] and [[Istanbul]]. He later became literary editor of ''Neue Freie Presse'', and wrote several comedies and dramas for the Viennese stage. His early work did not focus on Jewish life. It was of the [[feuilleton]] order, descriptive rather than political.&lt;ref&gt;M. Reich-Ranicki, ''Mein Leben'', (München 2001, DTV GmbH &amp; C0. - {{ISBN|3-423-12830-5}}), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zionist intellectual and activist==
[[File:Herzl-balcony.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Theodor Herzl in Basel, 1897]]
[[File:Herzldohanyi.jpg|thumb|right|140px|A plaque marking the birthplace of Theodor Herzl, [[Dohány Street Synagogue]], [[Budapest]].]]
As the Paris correspondent for ''Neue Freie Presse'', Herzl followed the [[Dreyfus affair]], a political scandal that divided the Third French Republic from 1894 until its resolution in 1906. It was a notorious [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] incident in France in which a [[History of the Jews in France|Jewish French]] army captain was falsely convicted of spying for [[Germany]]. Herzl was witness to mass rallies in Paris following the Dreyfus trial. There has been some controversy surrounding the impact that this event had on Herzl and his conversion to Zionism. Herzl himself stated that the Dreyfus case turned him into a Zionist and that he was particularly affected by chants of "Death to the Jews!" from the crowds. This had been the widely held belief for some time. However, some modern scholars now believe that due to little mention of the Dreyfus affair in Herzl's earlier accounts and a seemingly contrary reference he made in them to shouts of "Death to the traitor!" that he may have exaggerated the influence it had on him in order to create further support for his goals.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Henry J., "Theodor Herzl's Conversion to Zionism," ''Jewish Social Studies'', Vol. 32, No. 2 (Apr. 1970), pp. 101-110, Indiana University Press, https://www.jstor.org/stable/4466575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Liam, "Did Dreyfus Affair Really Inspire Herzl?," 26 February 2014, 'The Forward', http://forward.com/the-assimilator/193316/did-dreyfus-affair-really-inspire-herzl/&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Kornberg claims that the Dreyfus influence was a myth that Herzl did not feel necessary to deflate and that he also believed that Dreyfus was guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Kornberg, "Theodor Herzl: A Reevaluation," ''Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 52, No. 2 (Jun. 1980), pp. 226–252 Published by the University of Chicago Press [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1878229 jstor.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Another modern claim is that, while upset by antisemitism evident in [[French people|French society]], Herzl, like most contemporary observers, initially believed in Dreyfus' guilt and only claimed to have been inspired by the affair years later when it had become an international [[cause célèbre]] and that, rather, it was the rise to power of the antisemitic demagogue [[Karl Lueger]] in Vienna in 1895 that seems to have had a greater effect on Herzl, before the pro-Dreyfus campaign had fully emerged. It was at this time that Herzl wrote his play "The New Ghetto," which shows the ambivalence and lack of real security and equality of emancipated, well-to-do Jews in Vienna. The protagonist is an assimilated Jewish lawyer who tries unsuccessfully to break through the social ghetto enforced on Western Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kedem-auctions.com/content/theodor-herzl-%E2%80%93-new-ghetto-unser-k%C3%A4thchen-%E2%80%93-first-editions Das neue Ghetto]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Wickham Steed|Henry Wickham Steed]], Herzl was initially "fanatically devoted to the propagation of Jewish-German 'Liberal' assimilationist doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;The Hapsburg Monarchy (London 1914), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; However, Herzl came to reject his early ideas regarding [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and to believe that the Jews must remove themselves from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, Richard L., and Roth, John K. (2003). ''Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy'', p. 94. Louisville. Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press. {{ISBN|0-664-22353-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl grew to believe that antisemitism could not be defeated or cured, only avoided, and that the only way to avoid it was the establishment of a Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Kornberg &lt;!--|authorlink=Jacques Kornberg --&gt;|title=Theodor Herzl: From Assimilation to Zionism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=31LMY9S8IBIC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22Karl+Lueger%22+herzl&amp;q=%22Karl%20Lueger%22%20herzl|series=Jewish Literature and Culture|date=1 December 1993|isbn=978-0-253-33203-5|pages=193–194|accessdate=8 August 2009|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=[[Bloomington, Indiana]]|quote="Thus, for the time being, antisemitism is alien to the French people, and they are unable to comprehend it ...&lt;br&gt;By contrast, several months later ... Herzl was to offer a far different assessment of antisemitism in Austria, as a power and mainline movement on an upward course. Moreover, his fury over Austrian antisemitism had no parallel in his reaction to French antisemitism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1895, he wrote in his diary: "In Paris, as I have said, I achieved a freer attitude toward anti-semitism&amp;nbsp;... Above all, I recognized the emptiness and futility of trying to 'combat' anti-semitism." Herzl's editors of Neue Freie Presse refused any publication of his Zionist political activities. A mental clash gripped Herzl, between the craving for literary success and a desire to act as a public figure.&lt;ref&gt;Vital, 'A People Apart,' vol. 2, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Herzl started writing pamphlets about 'A Jewish State'. Herzl claimed that these pamphlets resulted in the establishment of the Zionist Movement, and they did play a large role in the movement's rise and success.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Commission on Alien Immigration, 'Minutes of Evidence', 7 July 1902, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; His testimony before the British Royal Commission reflected his fundamental, romantic liberal view on life as the 'Problem of the Jews'.

Beginning in late 1895, Herzl wrote ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The State of the Jews''), which was published February 1896 to immediate acclaim and controversy. The book argued that the Jewish people should leave Europe if they wished to, either for Argentina or, preferably, for Palestine, their historic homeland. The Jews possessed a nationality; all they were missing was a nation and a state of their own.&lt;ref name="Cleveland, William L. 2004. p. 224"&gt;Cleveland, William L., A History of the Modern Middle East.

===A philosophy for a homeland===
In ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' he writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Jewish question persists wherever Jews live in appreciable numbers. Wherever it does not exist, it is brought in together with Jewish immigrants. We are naturally drawn into those places where we are not persecuted, and our appearance there gives rise to persecution. This is the case, and will inevitably be so, everywhere, even in highly civilised countries—see, for instance, France—so long as the Jewish question is not solved on the political level."&lt;ref&gt;Herzl, ''Der Judenstaat'', cited by C.D. Smith, ''Israel and the Arab-Israeli Conflict'', 2001, 4th ed., p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book concludes: {{quote|Therefore I believe that a wondrous generation of Jews will spring into existence. The Maccabeans will rise again.

Let me repeat once more my opening words: The Jews who wish for a State will have it.

We shall live at last as free men on our own soil, and die peacefully in our own homes.

The world will be freed by our liberty, enriched by our wealth, magnified by our greatness.

And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare, will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25282/25282-h/25282-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Jewish State, by Theodor Herzl.|work=gutenberg.org|date=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Diplomatic liaison with the Ottomans===
Herzl began to energetically promote his ideas, continually attracting supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish. According to Norman Rose, Herzl "mapped out for himself the role of martyr ... as the [[Charles Stuart Parnell|Parnell]] of the Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Rose, ''A Senseless, Squalid War: Voices from Israel, 1945–1948'', The Bodley Head, London, 2009, p. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 1896, Herzl was visited by Reverend [[William Hechler]], the [[Anglican]] minister to the British Embassy in Vienna. Hechler had read Herzl's ''Der Judenstaat'', and the meeting became central to the eventual legitimization of Herzl and Zionism.&lt;ref name="jewishmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jerry Klinger |url=http://jewishmag.com/145mag/herzl_hechler/herzl_hechler.htm |title=Reverend William H.

I said to him: (Theodor Herzl to Rev. William Hechler) I must put myself into direct and publicly known relations with a responsible or non responsible ruler&amp;nbsp;– that is, with a minister of state or a prince. Then the Jews will believe in me and follow me. The most suitable personage would be the German Kaiser."&lt;ref&gt;''The Diaries of Theodor Herzl'', edited by Marvin Lowenthal, Gloucester, Massachusetts, Peter Smith Pub., 1978 p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Hechler arranged an extended audience with [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden]], in April 1896. The Grand Duke was the uncle of the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II]]. Through the efforts of Hechler and the Grand Duke, Herzl publicly met Wilhelm II in 1898. The meeting significantly advanced Herzl's and Zionism's legitimacy in Jewish and world opinion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;London ''Daily Mail'' Friday 18 November 1898 "An Eastern Surprise: Important Result of the Kaiser's Tour: Sultan and Emperor Agreed in Palestine: Benevolent Sanction Given to the Zionist Movement One of the most important results, if not the most important, of the Kaiser's visit to Palestine is the immense impetus it has given to Zionism, the movement for the return of the Jews to Palestine. The gain to this cause is the greater since it is immediate, but perhaps more important still is the wide political influence which this Imperial action is like to have. It has not been generally reported that when the Kaiser visited Constantinople, Dr. Herzl, the head of the Zionist movement, was there; again when the Kaiser entered Jerusalem, he found Dr.Herzl there. These were no mere coincidences, but the visible signs of accomplished facts." Herzl had achieved political legitimacy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1896, the English translation of ''Der Judenstaat'' appeared in London as ''The Jewish State''. Herzl had earlier confessed to his friend [[Max Bodenheimer]] that he "wrote what I had to say without knowing my predecessors, and it can be assumed that I would not have written it [''Der Judenstaat''] had I been familiar with the literature".&lt;ref&gt;Reuben R Hecht, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rxZ2-86V6fEC&amp;pg=PA43 When the Shofar sounds]'', 2006, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, 15 June 1896, Herzl saw an opportunity. With the assistance of [[Count]] Filip Michał Newleński,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Michael Nevlenski&lt;/ref&gt; a sympathetic [[Poles|Polish]] émigré with political contacts in the Ottoman Court, Herzl attempted to meet Sultan [[Abdulhamid II]] in order to present his solution of a Jewish State to the Sultan directly. He failed to obtain an audience but did succeed in visiting a number of highly placed individuals, including the Grand Vizier, who received him as a journalist representing the ''Neue Freie Presse''. Herzl presented his proposal to the Grand Vizier: the Jews would pay the Turkish foreign debt and attempt to help regulate Turkish finances if they were given Palestine as a Jewish homeland under Turkish rule. Prior to leaving Istanbul, 29 June 1896, Newleński obtained for Herzl a symbolic medal of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herzl.org/english/timeline.aspx?s=7 |title=Time Line |publisher=Herzl.org |accessdate=26 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118225438/http://www.herzl.org/english/timeline.aspx?s=7 |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The medal, the "Commander's Cross of the [[Order of the Medjidie]]", was a public relations affirmation for Herzl and the Jewish world of the seriousness of the negotiations.

Five years later, 17 May 1901, Herzl did meet with Sultan [[Abdulhamid II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herzl.org/english/timeline.aspx?s=8 |title=Time Line |publisher=Herzl.org |accessdate=26 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118224857/http://www.herzl.org/english/timeline.aspx?s=8 |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Sultan refused Theodor Herzl's offer to consolidate the Ottoman debt in exchange for a charter allowing the Zionists access to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Isaiah. "Herzl, Theodor." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 9. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 63. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''. Web. 22 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning from Istanbul, Herzl traveled to London to report back to the [[Maccabaeans|Maccabeans]], a proto-Zionist group of established English Jews led by Colonel [[Albert Goldsmid]]. In November 1895 they received him with curiosity, indifference and coldness. [[Israel Zangwill]] bitterly opposed Herzl, but after Istanbul, Goldsmid agreed to support Herzl. In London's East End, a community of primarily Yiddish speaking recent Eastern European Jewish immigrants, Herzl addressed a mass rally of thousands on 12 July 1896 and was received with acclaim. They granted Herzl the mandate of leadership for Zionism. Within six months this mandate had been expanded throughout Zionist Jewry: the Zionist movement grew rapidly.

===A World Congress===
In 1897, at considerable personal expense, he founded the Zionist newspaper ''[[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'' in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, and planned the [[First Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]], Switzerland. He was elected president of the Congress (a position he held until his death in 1904), and in 1898 he began a series of diplomatic initiatives to build support for a Jewish country. He was received by Wilhelm II on several occasions, one of them in [[Jerusalem]], and attended the [[Hague Peace Conference]], enjoying a warm reception from many statesmen there.

His work on [[Autoemancipation]] was pre-figured by a similar conclusion drawn by Marx's friend [[Moses Hess]], in ''Rome and Jerusalem'' (1862). Pinkser had never yet read it, but was aware of the distant and far off [[Hovevei Zion|Hibbat Zion]]. Herzl's philosophical instruction highlighted the weaknesses and vulnerabilities. To Herzl each dictator or leader had a nationalistic identity, even down to the Irish from Wolfe Tone onwards. He was drawn to the mawkishness of Judaism rendered distinctively as German. But he remained convinced that Germany was the centre ''(Hauptsitz)'' of antisemitism rather than France. In a much quoted aside he noted "If there is one thing I should like to be, it is a member of old Prussian nobility".&lt;ref&gt;'Complete Diaries of Theodor Herzl' ed. Raphael Patai, transl. Harry Zohn, in 5 vols, (NY 1960), 5 July 1896 and 28 June 1895, i, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl appealed to the nobility of Jewish England - the Rothschilds, Sir Samuel Montagu, later cabinet minister, to the Chief Rabbis of France and Vienna, the railroad magnate, Baron Hirsch.

He fared best with [[Israel Zangwill]], and [[Max Nordau]]. They were both well-known writers or 'men of letters'—imagination that engenders understanding. Hirsch's correspondence led nowhere. [[Baron]] Albert Rothschild had little to do with the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Vital, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl was disliked by the bankers ''(Finanzjuden)'' and detested them. Herzl was defiant of their social authority. He also shared Pinkser's pessimistic opinion that the Jews had no future in Europe; that they were too antisemitic to tolerate because each country in Europe had tried antisemitic assimilation. In Berlin they said ''Juden raus'' in a well worn phrase. Herzl therefore advocated a mass exodus from Europe to the ''Judenstaat''. Pinkser's manifesto was a cry for help; a warning to others ''Mahnruf'', a call for attention to their plight. Herzl's vision was less about mental states of Jewry, and more about delivering prescriptive answers about land. "The idea that i have developed is a very old one; it is the restoration of the Jewish State"&lt;ref&gt;in ''Der Judenstaat: Versuch einer modernen Losung der Judenfrage'' (An Attempt at a Modern Solution to the Jewish Question)&lt;/ref&gt; was a follow-up of Pinkser's early weaker version ''Mahnruf an seine Stammesgenossen von einem nassichen Juden''.&lt;ref&gt;transl. A Russian Jew's urgent warning to his kinsfolk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herzl, Zionism and the Holy Land===
Herzl visited Jerusalem for the first time in October 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodor Herzl in Jerusalem, Just Prior to Meeting With German Emperor Wilhelm II...|url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?169209|work=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He deliberately coordinated his visit with that of Wilhelm II to secure what he thought had been prearranged with the aid of Rev. [[William Hechler]], public world power recognition of himself and Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;Herzl had written in his diary of the necessity for world power recognition. 11 March 1896"&lt;/ref&gt;
Herzl and Wilhelm II first met publicly on 29 October, at [[Mikveh Israel]], near present-day [[Holon]], Israel. It was a brief but historic meeting.&lt;ref name="jewishmag.com"/&gt; He had a second formal, public audience with the emperor at the latter's tent camp on [[Street of the Prophets]] in Jerusalem on 2 November 1898.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shattered Vessels: Memory, Identity, and Creation in the Work of David Shahar|last1=Ginsberg|first1=Michael Peled|last2=Ron|first2=Moshe|date=June 2004|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5919-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ju3K_gXrAF8C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=mahanayim+house+frutiger+jerusalem&amp;q=mahanayim%20house%20frutiger%20jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Wilhelm II had assured Herzl of his support for the Jewish protectorate under Germany when they had met privately in Istanbul a week earlier. By the time of their public meetings at Mikveh Israel and Jerusalem, the Kaiser had changed his mind. Herzl had thought he had failed. In the eyes of public opinion he had not.&lt;/ref&gt; The English Zionist Federation, the local branch of the World Zionist Organization was founded in 1899, that Herzl had established in Austria in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Schneer, The Balfour Declaration, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902–03, Herzl was invited to give evidence before the British [[Royal Commission]] on Alien Immigration. His appearance brought him into close contact with members of the British government, particularly with [[Joseph Chamberlain]], then secretary of state for the colonies, through whom he negotiated with the Egyptian government for a charter for the settlement of the Jews in [[Al 'Arish]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], adjoining southern Palestine.

In 1903, Herzl attempted to obtain support for the Jewish homeland from [[Pope Pius X]], an idea broached at 6th Zionist Congress. Palestine could offer a safe refuge for those fleeing persecution in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Schneer, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Rafael Merry del Val]] ordained that the Church's policy was explained [[non possumus]] on such matters, decreeing that as long as the Jews denied the divinity of Christ, the Catholics could not make a declaration in their favour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gainesjunction.tamu.edu/issues/vol4num1/dhadley/ Catholicism, France and Zionism: 1895-1904] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713042252/http://gainesjunction.tamu.edu/issues/vol4num1/dhadley/ |date=13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pogroms included 47 Jews murdered at [[Kishinev]], and hundreds more injured, their property looted and destroyed. The delegates to the Congress backed Herzl's line of argument. A vociferous minority of opposition came from those who thought adoption of a Ugandan Plan over Palestine was a sell-out. Still later the East African Scheme failed, dying with Herzl himself. It was taken off the agenda in 1905. Yet another nationalistic splinter group with Zionist aspirations, in England called the Jewish Territorial Association (JTO) was founded.

After the failure of that scheme, which took him to [[Cairo]], he received, through [[L. J. Greenberg|Leopold Greenberg]], an offer (August 1903) from the British government to facilitate a large Jewish settlement, with autonomous government and under British [[suzerainty]], in [[British East Africa]]. At the same time, the Zionist movement was threatened by the Russian government. Accordingly, Herzl visited [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and was received by [[Sergei Witte]], then finance minister, and [[Viacheslav Plehve]], minister of the interior, the latter placing on record the attitude of his government toward the Zionist movement. On that occasion Herzl submitted proposals for the amelioration of the Jewish position in Russia. He published the Russian statement, and brought the British offer, commonly known as the "[[British Uganda Program|Uganda Project]]", before the Sixth Zionist Congress (Basel, August 1903), carrying the majority (295:178, 98 abstentions) on the question of investigating this offer, after the Russian delegation stormed out.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter. The History of Zionism. London: Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2003. p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1905 the 6th Zionist Congress, after investigations, decided to decline the British offer and firmly committed itself to a Jewish homeland in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Schneer, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Heimstatte''—a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine secured by public law.&lt;ref&gt;David Vital, A People and a State (1999), p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==

[[File:Theodor Herzl Grab 20032005.JPG|thumb|left|160px|First grave of Theodor Herzl in the [[Döbling Cemetery|cemetery of Döbling]], [[Vienna]].]]
Herzl did not live to see the rejection of the Uganda plan. At 5 p.m. 3 July 1904, in Edlach, a village inside [[Reichenau an der Rax]], [[Lower Austria]], Theodor Herzl, having been diagnosed with a heart issue earlier in the year, died of cardiac [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]]. A day before his death, he told the [[Reverend William H. Hechler]]: "Greet Palestine for me. I gave my heart's blood for my people."&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos (1975). ''Herzl'', pp. 400–01, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. {{ISBN|978-0-03-013126-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His will stipulated that he should have the poorest-class funeral without speeches or flowers and he added, "I wish to be buried in the vault beside my father, and to lie there till the Jewish people shall take my remains to Israel".&lt;ref&gt;'Obituary', ''The Times'', Thursday, 7 July 1904; p. 10; Issue 37440; col B.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some six thousand followed Herzl's hearse, and the funeral was long and chaotic. Despite Herzl's request that no speeches be made, a brief eulogy was delivered by [[David Wolffsohn]]. Hans Herzl, then thirteen, read the ''[[kaddish]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos (1975). ''Herzl'', p. 402, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. {{ISBN|978-0-03-013126-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, his remains were moved from [[Vienna]] to be reburied on the top of [[Mount Herzl]] in [[Jerusalem]], named in his memory.

==Family==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 6697 Herzel In Childhood.jpg|right|thumb | Herzl as a child with his mother Janet and sister Pauline]]
Herzl's grandfathers, both of whom he knew, were more closely related to traditional Judaism than were his parents. In Zemun (Zemlin), his grandfather Simon Loeb Herzl "had his hands on" one of the first copies of [[Judah Alkalai]]'s 1857 work prescribing the "return of the Jews to the Holy Land and renewed glory of Jerusalem". Contemporary scholars conclude that Herzl's own implementation of modern Zionism was undoubtedly influenced by that relationship. Herzl's grandparents' graves in Semlin can still be visited. Alkalai himself witnessed the rebirth of Serbia from Ottoman rule in the early and mid-19th century and was inspired by the Serbian uprising and subsequent re-creation of Serbia.

In 25 June 1889, he married Julie Naschauer, daughter of a wealthy Jewish businessman in Vienna. The marriage was unhappy, although three children were born to it: Paulina, Hans and Margaritha (Trude). Herzl had a strong attachment to his mother, who was unable to get along with his wife. These difficulties were increased by the political activities of his later years, in which his wife took little interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowessays.com/dbase/ae4/smr275.shtml Theodor Herzl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812014411/http://www.wowessays.com/dbase/ae4/smr275.shtml |date=12 August 2007 }} on WowEssays.com&lt;/ref&gt;

His only son Hans was given a secular upbringing and Herzl notably refused to allow him to be circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf,''Female Circumcision: Multicultural Perspectives'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gender Of Desire: Essays On Male Sexuality'', By Michael S.

He sought a personal salvation for his own religious needs and a universal solution, as had his father, to Jewish suffering caused by antisemitism. Hanz Herzl voluntarily had himself circumcised 29 May 1905;&lt;ref&gt;''Princes Without a Home: Modern Zionism and the Strange Fate of Theodor Herzl's children'', Ilse Sternberger, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Hans shot himself to death on the day of his sister Paulina's funeral; he was 39 years old.&lt;ref name="aish63"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/literacy/jewishhistory/Crash_Course_in_Jewish_History_Part_63_-_Modern_Zionism.asp|title=Crash Course in Jewish History Part 63 - Modern Zionism|publisher=Aish HaTorah|date=2 February 2002|author=Rabbi Ken Spiro|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans left a suicide note explaining his reasons.

&lt;blockquote&gt; "A Jew remains a Jew, no matter how eagerly he may submit himself to the disciplines of his new religion, how humbly he may place the redeeming cross upon his shoulders for the sake of his former coreligionists, to save them from eternal damnation: a Jew remains a Jew ... I can't go on living. I have lost all trust in God. All my life I've tried to strive for the truth, and must admit today at the end of the road that there is nothing but disappointment. Tonight I have said Kaddish for my parents—and for myself, the last descendant of the family. There is nobody who will say Kaddish for me, who went out to find peace—and who may find peace soon ...

In 2006 the remains of Paulina and Hans were moved from [[Bordeaux]], France, and reburied not far from their father on Mt. Herzl.&lt;ref name="aish63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzl's children to be disinterred on Tuesday in Bordeaux, France [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/764120.html haaretz.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulfilling Historical Justice: Herzl's Children Come Home, [http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Home/About/Chairman/Archive/2006/sep25.htm jewishagency.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108092006/http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Home/About/Chairman/Archive/2006/sep25.htm |date=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulina and Hans had little contact with their young sister, "Trude" (Margarethe, 1893–1943). She married Richard Neumann, a man 17 years her elder. Neumann lost his fortune in the [[Great Depression]]. Burdened by the steep costs of hospitalizing Trude, who suffered from severe bouts of depressive illness that required repeated hospitalization, the Neumanns' financial life was precarious. The [[Nazis]] sent Trude and Richard to the [[Theresienstadt]] concentration camp where they died. Her body was [[cremated|burned]].&lt;ref name="aish63" /&gt; (Her mother, who died in 1907, was cremated. Her ashes were lost by accident.)

At the request of his father Richard Neumann, Trude's son (Herzl's only grandchild), Stephan Theodor Neumann, (1918–1946) was sent for his safety to England in 1935 to the Viennese Zionists and the Zionist Executive in Israel based there .&lt;ref&gt;Zionist Archives letters of Richard Neumann&lt;/ref&gt; The Neumanns deeply feared for the safety of their only child as violent Austrian antisemitism expanded. In England he read extensively about his grandfather. Zionism had not been a significant part of his background in Austria, but Stephan became an ardent Zionist, was the only descendant of Theodor Herzl to have become one. [[Anglicizing]] his name to Stephen Norman, during World War II, Norman enlisted in the [[British Army]] rising to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the [[Royal Artillery]]. In late 1945 and early 1946 he took the opportunity to visit the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] "to see what my grandfather had started." He wrote in his diary extensively about his trip. What most impressed him was the "look of freedom" on the faces of the children, which were not like the sallow look of those from the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] of Europe. He wrote upon leaving Israel, "My visit to Israel is over ... It is said that to go away is to die a little. And I know that when I went away from Erez Israel, I died a little. But sure, then, to return is somehow to be reborn. And I will return."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Norman, 'Airstop in Israel' [http://www.azure.org.il/article.php?id=40 azure.org.il]&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman planned to return to Israel following his military discharge. The Zionist Executive had worked for years through Dr. L. Lauterbach to get Norman to come to Israel as a symbol of Herzl's returning.&lt;ref&gt;Central Zionist Archives-extensive documentary exchange between Lauterbach and Norman 1936−1946&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Agatha]] of 29 June 1946, precluded that possibility: British military and police fanned out throughout Israel and arrested Jewish activists. About 2,700 individuals were arrested. On 2 July 1946, Norman wrote to Mrs.Stybovitz-Kahn in Haifa. Her father, Jacob Kahn, had been a good friend of Herzl and a well-known Dutch banker before the war. Norman wrote, "I intend to go to Israel on a long visit in the future, in fact as soon as passport &amp; permit regulations permit. But the dreadful news of the last two days have done nothing to make this easier."&lt;ref&gt;Central Zionist Archives, Jerusalem, Papers of Stephen Norman, 2 July 1946, letter to Mrs.Stybovitz-Kahn&lt;/ref&gt; He never did return to Israel.

[[File:Theodor-Herzl.svg|thumbnail|Portrait of Herzl]]

Demobilized from the British army in late spring 1946, without money or job and despondent about his future, Norman followed the advice of Dr.[[Selig Brodetsky]]. Dr. H. Rosenblum, the editor of ''Haboker'', a Tel Aviv daily that later became [[Yediot Aharonot]], noted in late 1945 that Dr. Weizmann deeply resented the sudden intrusion and reception of Norman when he arrived in Britain. Norman spoke to the Zionist conference in London. Haboker reported, "Something similar happened at the Zionist conference in London. The Chairman suddenly announced to the meeting that in the hall there was Herzl's grandson who wanted to say a few words. The introduction was made in an absolutely dry and official way. It was felt that the chairman looked for—and found—some stylistic formula which would satisfy the visitor without appearing too cordial to anybody among the audience. In spite of that there was a great thrill in the hall when Norman mounted on the platform of the praesidium. At that moment, Dr.Weizmann turned his back on the speaker and remained in this bodily and mental attitude until the guest had finished his speech."&lt;ref&gt;Haboker 26 Oct 1945. Document amongst the papers of Stephen Norman at the Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; The 1945 article went on to note that Norman was snubbed by Weizmann and by some in Israel during his visit because of ego, jealousy, vanity and their own personal ambitions. Brodetsky was Chaim Weizman's principal ally and supporter in Britain.

Chaim Weizmann secured for Norman a desirable but minor position with the British Economic and Scientific Mission in Washington, D.C. In late August 1946, shortly after arriving in Washington, he learned that his family had perished. Norman had re-established contact with his old nanny in Vienna, Wuth, who told him what happened.&lt;ref&gt;Central Zionist Archives, Jerusalem, August 1946,&lt;/ref&gt; Norman became deeply depressed over the fate of his family and his inability to help the Jewish people "languishing" in the European camps. Unable to endure his suffering any further, he jumped to his death from the [[Charles C. Glover Memorial Bridge|Massachusetts Avenue Bridge]] in Washington, D.C. on 26 November 1946.

Norman was buried by the [[Jewish Agency]] in Washington, D.C. His tombstone read simply, 'Stephen Theodore Norman, Captain Royal Artillery British Army, Grandson of Theodor Herzl, 21 April 1918 − 26 November 1946'.&lt;ref&gt;"These Children Bore the Mark of Freedom," by Jerry Klinger, Theodor Herzl Foundation, in ''Midstream'', a bi-monthly Jewish review, May/June 2007, pp. 21–24, {{ISSN|0026-332X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman was the only descendent of Herzl to have been a Zionist, been to Israel and openly stated his desire to return.

On 5 December 2007, sixty-one years after his death, he was reburied with his family on Mt. Herzl, in the Plot for Zionist Leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/931424.html|title=Theodor Herzl's only grandson reinterred in J'lem cemetery|author=Anshel Pfeffer and Haaretz Service|date=5 December 2007|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Greenberg, Washington Jewish Week, 27 June 2007, "Zionist set to come 'home': Herzl's grandson slated to be reburied in Israel"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Klinger,

==Writings==
[[File:DE Herzl Judenstaat 01.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Title page of ''Der Judenstaat''. 1896]]
[[File:Altneuland.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Title page of ''Altneuland''. 1902]]
Beginning in late 1895, Herzl wrote ''Der Judenstaat'' (''The State of the Jews''). The small book was initially published 14 February 1896, in Leipzig, Germany, and Vienna, Austria, by M. Breitenstein's Verlags-Buchhandlung. It is subtitled "''Versuch einer modernen Lösung der Judenfrage''", ("Proposal of a modern solution for the Jewish question"). ''Der Judenstaat'' proposed the structure and beliefs of what political Zionism was.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L. A History of the Modern Middle East. Boulder, CO: Westview, 2004. Print. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzl's solution was the creation of a Jewish state. In the book he outlined his reasoning for the need to reestablish the historic Jewish state.

"The idea I have developed in this pamphlet is an ancient one: It is the restoration of the Jewish State ..."

"The decisive factor is our propelling force. And what is that force? The plight of the Jews ... I am profoundly convinced that I am right, though I doubt whether I shall live to see myself proved so. Those who today inaugurate this movement are unlikely to live to see its glorious culmination. But the very inauguration is enough to inspire in them a high pride and the joy of an inner liberation of their existence ..."

"The plan would seem mad enough if a single individual were to undertake it; but if many Jews simultaneously agree on it, it is entirely reasonable, and its achievement presents no difficulties worth mentioning. The idea depends only on the number of its adherents. Perhaps our ambitious young men, to whom every road of advancement is now closed, and for whom the Jewish state throws open a bright prospect of freedom, happiness, and honor, perhaps they will see to it that this idea is spread ..."

"It depends on the Jews themselves whether this political document remains for the present a political romance. If this generation is too dull to understand it rightly, a future, finer, more advanced generation will arise to comprehend it. The Jews who will try it shall achieve their State; and they will deserve it ..."

"I consider the Jewish question neither a social nor a religious one, even though it sometimes takes these and other forms. It is a national question, and to solve it we must first of all establish it as an international political problem to be discussed and settled by the civilized nations of the world in council.

"We are a people—one people.

"We have sincerely tried everywhere to merge with the national communities in which we live, seeking only to preserve the faith of our fathers. It is not permitted us. In vain are we loyal patriots, sometimes superloyal; in vain do we make the same sacrifices of life and property as our fellow citizens; in vain do we strive to enhance the fame of our native lands in the arts and sciences, or her wealth by trade and commerce. In our native lands where we have lived for centuries we are still decried as aliens, often by men whose ancestors had not yet come at a time when Jewish sighs had long been heard in the country ..."

"Oppression and persecution cannot exterminate us. No nation on earth has endured such struggles and sufferings as we have. Jew-baiting has merely winnowed out our weaklings; the strong among us defiantly return to their own whenever persecution breaks out ..."

"Wherever we remain politically secure for any length of time, we assimilate. I think this is not praiseworthy ..."

"Israel is our unforgettable historic homeland ..."

"Let me repeat once more my opening words: The Jews who will it shall achieve their State. We shall live at last as free men on our own soil, and in our own homes peacefully die. The world will be liberated by our freedom, enriched by our wealth, magnified by our greatness. And whatever we attempt there for our own benefit will redound mightily and beneficially to the good of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/herzlex.html| title=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last literary work, ''Altneuland'' (in English: ''[[The Old New Land]]'', 1902), is a [[novel]] devoted to Zionism. Herzl occupied his free time for three years in writing what he believed might be accomplished by 1923. Though the form is that of a romance, It is less a novel than a serious forecast of what could be done within one generation. The keynotes of the story are love of [[Zion]] and insistence upon the fact that the suggested changes in life are not utopian but to be brought about simply by grouping all the best efforts and ideals of every race and nation. Each such effort is quoted and referred to in such a manner as to show that 
''Altneuland'', though blossoming through the skill of the Jew, will in reality be the product of the benevolent efforts of all the members of the human family.

Herzl envisioned a Jewish state that combined modern Jewish culture with the best of the European heritage. Thus a "Palace of Peace" would be built in Jerusalem to arbitrate international disputes, and at the same time the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] would be rebuilt on [[Contemporary history|modern]] principles. Herzl did not envision the Jewish inhabitants of the state as being [[religious]], but there was respect for religion in the public sphere. He also assumed that many languages would be spoken, and that [[Hebrew]] would not be the main tongue. Proponents of a Jewish cultural rebirth, such as ''[[Ahad Ha'am]]'', were critical of ''Altneuland''.

In ''Altneuland'', Herzl did not foresee any conflict between [[Jews]] and [[Arabs]]. One of the main characters in ''Altneuland'' is a Haifa engineer, Reshid Bey, who is one of the leaders of the "New Society". He is very grateful to his Jewish neighbors for improving the economic condition of Israel and sees no cause for conflict. All non-Jews have equal rights, and an attempt by a fanatical rabbi to disenfranchise the non-Jewish citizens of their rights fails in the election which is the center of the main political plot of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Herzl's vision of racism|first=Shlomo|last=Avineri|authorlink=Shlomo Avineri|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1062723.html|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=8 August 2009|date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzl also envisioned the future Jewish state to be a "third way" between capitalism and socialism, with a developed welfare program and public ownership of the main natural resources. Industry, agriculture and trade were organized on a cooperative basis. Along with many other progressive Jews of the day, such as [[Emma Lazarus]], [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Franz Oppenheimer]], Herzl desired to enact the land reforms proposed by the American political economist [[Henry George]]. Specifically, they called for a [[land value tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishcurrents.org/henry-george-zionism-32779|title=Henry George and Zionism|work=Jewish Currents}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called his mixed economic model "Mutualism", a term derived from French [[utopian socialist]] thinking. Women would have [[Women's suffrage|equal voting rights]]—as they had in the Zionist movement from the Second Zionist Congress onwards.

In ''Altneuland'', Herzl outlined his vision for a new Jewish state in the [[Land of Israel]]. He summed up his vision of an open society:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is founded on the ideas which are a common product of all civilized nations ... It would be immoral if we would exclude anyone, whatever his origin, his descent, or his religion, from participating in our achievements. For we stand on the shoulders of other civilized peoples ... What we own we owe to the preparatory work of other peoples. Therefore, we have to repay our debt. There is only one way to do it, the highest tolerance. Our motto must therefore be, now and ever: 'Man, you are my brother.'"&lt;ref name="Zion p.185"&gt;'Zion &amp; the Jewish National Idea', in ''Zionism Reconsidered'', Macmillan, 1970 PB, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''"If you will it, it is no dream."''&lt;/span&gt; a phrase from Herzl's book ''Old New Land'', became a popular [[slogan]] of the Zionist movement—the striving for a Jewish National Home in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/now/2010/may/orenaddress.html|title=Brandeis.edu|publisher=Brandeis.edu|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel, Herzl wrote about an electoral campaign in the new state. He directed his wrath against the nationalist party, which wished to make the Jews a privileged class in Israel. Herzl regarded that as a betrayal of Zion, for Zion was identical to him with humanitarianism and tolerance—and that this was true in politics as well as religion. Herzl wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Matters of faith were once and for all excluded from public influence ... Whether anyone sought religious devotion in the synagogue, in the church, in the mosque, in the art museum, or in a philharmonic concert, did not concern society. That was his [own] private affair."&lt;ref name="Zion p.185"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Altneuland'' was written both for Jews and non-Jews: Herzl wanted to win over non-Jewish opinion for Zionism.&lt;ref name=leonhard&gt;L.C.M. van der Hoeven Leonhard, 'Shlomo and David, Israel, 1907', in ''From Haven to Conquest'', 1971, W. Khalidi (ed.), pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was still thinking of [[Argentina]] as a possible venue for massive Jewish immigration, he wrote in his diary:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "When we occupy the land, we shall bring immediate benefits to the state that receives us. We must expropriate gently the private property on the estates assigned to us. We shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our country. The property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discretely and circumspectly ... It goes without saying that we shall respectfully tolerate persons of other faiths and protect their property, their honor, and their freedom with the harshest means of coercion. This is another area in which we shall set the entire world a wonderful example ... Should there be many such immovable owners in individual areas [who would not sell their property to us], we shall simply leave them there and develop our commerce in the direction of other areas which belong to us",&lt;ref&gt;'The Complete Diaries of Theodor Herzl', vol. 1 (New York: Herzl Press and Thomas Yoseloff, 1960), pp. 88, 90 hereafter Herzl diaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Herzl's draft of a charter for a Jewish-Ottoman Land Company (JOLC) gave the JOLC the right to obtain land in Israel by giving its owners comparable land elsewhere in the [[Ottoman empire]].

The name "Tel Aviv" was the title given to the Hebrew translation of ''Altneuland'' by the translator, [[Nahum Sokolow]]. This name comes from [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 3:15 and means [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]—an ancient mound formed when a town is built on its own debris for thousands of years—of spring. The name was later applied to the new town built outside [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]] that became [[Tel Aviv-Yafo]] the second-largest city in [[Israel]]. The nearby city to the north, [[Herzliya]], was named in honour of Herzl.

'''Lawrence Wayne '''"'''Wild Man'''"''' Fischer''' (November 6, 1944&amp;nbsp;– June 16, 2011) was an American [[street performer]] known for offering erratic, [[acapella]] performances of "new kinds of songs" for a nickel or a dime each on the [[Sunset Strip]] in [[West Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Most of his life was spent homeless or institutionalized, and he later became regarded as "the godfather of [[outsider music]]".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/arts/music/wild-man-fischer-outsider-musician-dies-at-66.html?_r=1 |title=Wild Man Fischer, Outsider Musician, Dies at 66 |first=Margalit |last=Fox |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I'm crazy for you... but not that crazy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/mar/19/42|work=[[The Observer]]|date=March 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Los Angeles, Fischer was repeatedly sent to mental institutions as a teenager, where he was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. In 1968, he recorded a double album, ''[[An Evening with Wild Man Fischer]]'', that was produced by [[Frank Zappa]] for the [[Bizarre Records|Bizarre]] label. At one point, Fischer was the opening act for [[the Byrds]], [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Solomon Burke]], and [[Bo Diddley]]. His relationship with Zappa came to an abrupt end after Fischer threw a bottle that nearly hit Zappa's daughter [[Moon Zappa|Moon]].

In 1975, Fischer helped jumpstart [[Rhino Records]] with the novelty single "Go to Rhino Records". The label put out a trilogy of albums that ultimately became his last: ''Wildmania'' (1977), ''Pronounced Normal'' (1981), and ''Nothing Scary'' (1983); the latter two were produced by the comedy music duo [[Barnes &amp; Barnes]]. A documentary about Fischer's life, ''[[Derailroaded: Inside the Mind of Wild Man Fischer]]'', premiered at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in 2005. In 2004, he consented to move into an assisted-living hospital. He died of heart failure several years later at the age of 66.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Laurence Wayne Fischer was born on November 6, 1944 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="latobit"&gt;{{Cite news |title = Larry 'Wild Man' Fischer dies at 66; vagabond singer made albums with Frank Zappa |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/18/local/la-me-larry-wild-man-fischer-20110618 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 18, 2011 |first=Richard |last=Cromelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telobit" /&gt; From an early age, he experienced major [[mood swing]]s, and developed a habit of singing [[Paul Anka]] songs at the top of his voice, which he called having "the pep". When his mood worsened, he experienced [[auditory hallucination]]s and acted violently toward his family.&lt;ref name="Perrone"/&gt; He attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles, California)|Fairfax High School]]&lt;ref name="latobit"/&gt; but was expelled in 1962 for singing in class.&lt;ref name="ambio" /&gt; In 1963, he was committed to [[Camarillo State Hospital]] for threatening his mother with a knife, and he was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenic]] and [[manic depression]].&lt;ref name="Perrone"&gt;{{cite news|first=Pierre|last=Perrone|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/wild-man-fischer-outsider-musician-who-was-discovered-by-frank-zappa-but-could-never-transcend-his-psychiatric-disorders-2318335.html |title=Wild Man Fischer: Outsider musician who was discovered by Frank Zappa but could never transcend his psychiatric disorders |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released one year later, he appeared at numerous talent shows and was discovered by R&amp;B singer [[Solomon Burke]], who gave him the nickname "Wild Man" and brought him along on a tour. Fischer was still living at home at this time, and in 1965, was once again institutionalized for his behavior. According to Fischer, the hospital stays only exacerbated his condition.&lt;ref name="ambio"&gt;{{cite web|author1=arwulf arwulf|title=Wild Man Fischer|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wild-man-fischer-mn0000581744/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has something to say to you, even though you might not want to hear it."&lt;ref name="Harperthesis"&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Harper|first=Adam |date=2014 |title=Lo-Fi Aesthetics in Popular Music Discourse |type=PDF |chapter= |publisher= [[Wadham College]]|docket= |oclc= |url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:cc84039c-3d30-484e-84b4-8535ba4a54f8/datastreams/THESIS01 |access-date=March 10, 2018|ref=harv|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

By 1967, Fischer was on medication and acting as a street performer in Hollywood. For a nickel or a dime, he would offer a "new kind of song" to passersby as an acapella performance. This led him to become an opening act for [[the Byrds]], [[Bo Diddley]], and [[Iron Butterfly]].&lt;ref name="latobit" /&gt; While performing onstage and outside at the Sunset Strip, he was noticed by [[Frank Zappa]], bandleader for [[the Mothers of Invention]].&lt;ref name="ambio" /&gt; Zappa later said: "I thought from the first day I met him that someone should make an album about Wild Man Fischer."&lt;ref name="telobit"/&gt; He invited Fischer into a studio and recorded him singing about topics such as his mother, mental hospitals, fame, circles, and how he could move faster than a cat could see him. The Mothers of Invention, record producer [[Kim Fowley]], and Zappa's girl group [[the GTOs]] made guest appearances on some of the tracks.&lt;ref name="SDR" /&gt;

Released as a [[double album]] in 1968, ''[[An Evening with Wild Man Fischer]]'' was given a positive review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, where it was described as "captur[ing] the total being of one strange member of the human community".&lt;ref name="SDR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/jam-session/2011/jun/17/rip-frank-zappa-discovery-larry-wild-man-fischer/ |title=R.I.P., Larry "Wild Man" Fischer, Frank Zappa's Discovery |publisher=San Diego Reader |date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=March 31, 2018|first= Jay Allen|last=Sanford}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 1968, thanks to his connections with Zappa, Fischer appeared on ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', singing "Leaves Are Falling" and "Merry-Go-Round".&lt;ref name="latobit" /&gt; In December, Zappa arranged for him to perform at a Christmas show involving the Mothers, the GTOs, and [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]]. Fischer sang "Circles".&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt;

Fischer was frustrated that the album failed to bring him the fame he expected.&lt;ref name="latobit" /&gt; One day, he visited Zappa and threw a bottle that nearly hit Zappa's infant daughter [[Moon Zappa|Moon]]. This ended their relationship.&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt; In a song Fischer later wrote ("Frank Zappa"), he alleged that Zappa subsequently withheld his recording income ("Frank's got my publishing rights / You could say he's on my mind / I think about him all the time"). After Frank's death in 1993, [[Gail Zappa]] inherited her husband's musical copyrights, and refused to reissue the album for as long as she lived.&lt;ref name="telobit" /&gt;

===Rhino Records albums===

In 1974 Larry appeared as a guest vocalist on noise band [[Smegma (band)|Smegma]]'s album ''Sing Popular Songs''.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In 1975, he recorded [[Rhino Records]]' first release, a novelty single entitled "Go to Rhino Records". At the time, Rhino Records was only a record shop in Los Angeles. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'': "Demand for [the single] proved so great that it catapulted the store's owners into the record-producing business." Two years later he recorded their very first LP, ''Wildmania''.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In the 1980s, Fischer worked with the comedy music duo [[Barnes and Barnes]] ([[Bill Mumy]] and [[Robert Haimer]]) to produce two more albums for Rhino, ''Pronounced Normal'' (1981) and ''Nothing Scary'' (1984). In 1986, Barnes and Barnes also wrote and produced "It's a Hard Business", a duet featuring Fischer and [[Rosemary Clooney]]. The song was the result of a telephone friendship they began due to mutual acquaintances.&lt;ref name="telobit" /&gt; In 1988, a judge awarded Fischer royalties on his song "Merry-Go-Round" (from the videocassette release of the movie ''[[Medium Cool]]''), but the attorney representing Fischer did not know how to contact him.&lt;ref name="latobit"/&gt; Fischer was still homeless, living in motels and on the streets while panhandling at places like [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Disneyland]].&lt;ref name="latobit" /&gt; He performed at the 1988 [[San Diego Comic Con]] with Bill Mumy's group as his backing band.&lt;ref name="SDR" /&gt;

In 1998, ''Date with the Devils Daughter'', an album by [[Robert Williams (drummer)|Robert Williams]] (a drummer formerly with [[Captain Beefheart]]) includes "Hello Robert", which consists of messages that Fischer left on Williams's phone.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In 1999, Rhino released ''The Fischer King'', a two-CD package comprising 100 tracks and a 20-page booklet, which sold out within weeks. The limited-edition album comprises his entire Rhino catalog, including all three of the Rhino albums plus singles, unreleased material, interviews done for this release, and his duet with Clooney. It releases almost everything Fischer ever recorded, except ''[[An Evening with Wild Man Fischer]]'', for which the Zappa family still held the rights.&lt;ref name="ambio" /&gt;

===Final years and death===
In the early 2000s, Fischer was filmed as the subject of a full-length [[documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Derailroaded: Inside the Mind of Wild Man Fischer]]'', which premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in March 2005.&lt;ref name="telobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perrone" /&gt; Co-director Josh Rubin called the four years making the film "the most arduous, trying time of my life" due to Fischer's erratic behavior. It included an appearance from [[Devo]]'s [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] who called him: "as pure a rock and roll icon as you can find. He's mainlined into the creative subconscious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gritten|first1=David|title=The really wild man of rock|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3650038/The-really-wild-man-of-rock.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=February 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Fischer was the subject of a [[comic book]] (''The Legend of Wild Man Fischer'' by [[Dennis Eichhorn]]),&lt;ref name="SDR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | writer = Eichhorn, Dennis P. | cowriters = J.R. Williams | title = The Legend of Wild Man Fischer | publisher = [[Top Shelf Productions]] | date = 2004 | ISBN = 1-891830-61-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October, appeared on ABC-TV's late-night talk/comedy show, ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.&lt;ref name="telobit"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/8626665/Larry-Wild-Man-Fischer.html |title=Larry 'Wild Man' Fischer |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Fischer suffered a six-month-long [[paranoia|paranoid]] episode, convinced somebody was trying to kill him, and he started living on the streets again.  He called Bill Mumy up to 20 times a day, hanging up each time, until Mumy finally had to change his phone number. Fischer eventually moved in with his aunt Josephine, but three weeks later she was diagnosed with terminal cancer (this happened during the filming of ''Derailroaded''). Fischer and his family consented to move him into an assisted-living mental institution in [[Van Nuys]]. The medications he was prescribed helped him control his behavior, but it also eliminated his creative drive, or "pep".&lt;ref name="latobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Fischer made his final performance on August 16, 2006, at the [[Trunk Space]] in Phoenix, Arizona.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The last seven years of Fischer's life were spent peacefully but uneventfully. On June 16, 2011, he died of heart failure at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, at the age of 66.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latobit" /&gt;

'''William John Charles Pitcher''' (21 March 1858 – 2 March 1925), known as '''Wilhelm''' or '''C. Wilhelm''', was an [[English people|English]] artist, costume and scenery designer, best known for his designs for ballets, [[pantomime]]s, [[comic operas]], and [[Edwardian musical comedies]].

==Life and career==
Wilhelm was born at [[Northfleet]], in [[Kent]], England, the son of a shipbuilder.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. Pitcher's Art" - Obituary ''[[The Times]]'', 3 March 1925&lt;/ref&gt;  

The young artist showed early promise, and [[J. R. Planché]] recommended him to design for the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].  There, Wilhelm created costumes, beginning in 1877, for numerous works, including the famous pantomimes of Sir [[Augustus Harris]] and for others until 1897, including the spectacular drama, ''Armada'' (1888).&lt;ref name=Times1920&gt;"Famous Ballet Designer - Identity of 'C. Wilhelm' Revealed", ''[[The Times]]'', 1 June 1920, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He also designed costumes for various [[music hall]] artists and for many London theatres, including [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], The Coliseum, [[The Crystal Palace]], and for three pantomimes at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].  For [[Robert Courtneidge]] in [[Manchester, England]], Wilhelm designed two [[Shakespeare]] plays: ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.com/asp/display_artist-asp/_/crid--45777/C_Wilhelm.htm Images of Wilhelm's Shakespeare designs]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilhelm also designed costumes for numerous pantomimes, including ''Cinderella'', ''[[Richard Whittington#Dick Wittington - Pantomime character|Dick Whittington]]'', and ''Blue Beard''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/wilhelm.html Information about, and drawings of, numerous Wilhelm designs]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the designer for some of the costumes in several of the original [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the 1880s, including ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''[[Princess Ida]]'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (revival), ''[[The Mikado]]'', and ''[[Ruddigore]]''.  He also designed costumes for ''[[Jane Annie]]'' at the Savoy (1893) and for the [[Olympia, London]] spectacles ''Nero'' (1889) and ''Venice'' (1891).&lt;ref name=Times1920/&gt;

[[Image:Rosalind-and-the-Old-Duke-As-You-Like-It.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A design for ''[[As You Like It]]'']]
Wilhelm was, perhaps, best known for his work for the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]], London, from 1887 to 1915, where he designed both scenery and costumes for (and sometimes produced) numerous ballets, many of which starred [[Adeline Genée]], and which established a fashion for stage design and were much imitated.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;  His later costume designs included ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' (1906); [[Edward German]]'s opera ''[[Tom Jones (Edward German)|Tom Jones]]'' (1907); ''Peter Pan'' (the famous mermaid costumes for the 1905 revival); and ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909) and ''The Mousmé'' (1911), among other musical comedies.  Wilhelm's costume designs were seen on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898–99), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1902), ''[[Three Little Maids]]'' (1903), ''The Babes and the Baron'' (1905–06), ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906–07), ''The Soul Kiss'' (1908), ''The Silver Star'' (1909–10), ''The Old Town'' (1910), ''The Arcadians''  (1910), ''[[The Girl in the Train]]'' (1910), ''The Lady of the Slipper''  (1912–13), ''Chin Chin'' (1914–15), ''The Yankee Princess'' (1922), ''Stepping Stones'' (scenic and costume design, 1923–24), ''[[Madame Pompadour]]'' (1924–25).&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|name=Information about Wilhelm designs for Broadway productions|id=25432}} accessed 5 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

London's ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Wilhelm excelled especially in rendering the spirit and detail of historical periods, but he had also an amusing skill in turning modern costumes to his fantastic purposes.... to his imaginative gifts he added remarkable precision and firmness in execution and great ingenuity in the treatment of colour."&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;  Wilhelm also contributed a number of articles on the art of the theatre to ''The Magazine of Art'', including "Art in Ballet" (1895).  In his last years, he focused on watercolour painting, especially of flowers and plant life, and illustrating children's books, including ''The Child of the Air'', and he was elected to the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

He died in London just short of his 67th birthday&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; and is buried in [[Brompton cemetery]].

== Biography ==

Young Perry Alsbury was born in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]] in 1814. He was the youngest son of ten children. His father, Thomas Alsbury, Jr., was a frontiersman and Indian spy in Virginia (now West Virginia) in the 1790s, and then an early settler and tavern/innkeeper in Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky in the early 1800s. His mother was Leah Catlett, born in Maryland.  In the early 1820s the Alsbury family moved from Kentucky to Texas.&lt;ref name="YPA"/&gt; [[Stephen F. Austin]] had written a letter to his father asking the Alsbury family, which included seven sons, to move to Texas and become part of the original Austin Colony.&lt;ref name="YPH"/&gt; They settled in [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]] on the [[Brazos River]]. Land was what had enticed the family to move to the area.&lt;ref name="DWG"&gt;"Diary of Willam Fairfax Grey, Virginia to Texas 1835-1837" William Fairfax Grey&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Alsbury was given two leagues and 1½ labors (between 9,000 and 10,000 acres) (36 and 40&amp;nbsp;km²).&lt;ref name="YPA"/&gt; (A league of land was {{convert|4428.4|acre|km2}}, a labor 177.136 acres). The property was located on the west bank of the Brazos River.&lt;ref name="YPA"/&gt; Three of the older sons of Thomas (Charles, Harvey, and Horace) were also given land. It was located in the Indian country, along the Gulf Coast, a bit west of where the Dow Chemical Company is now located.&lt;ref name="YPA"/&gt; Young Perry Alsbury was too young at that time to obtain his own land grant.

When he was 22, during the 1836 [[Texas Revolution]], Young Perry Alsbury fought on the [[Texian]] side in Captain [[Henry Wax Karnes]]’ Cavalry, better known as "[[Deaf Smith]]'s spy company".&lt;ref name="YPN"&gt;"Young Perry Alsbury, Hero of San Jacinto" San Antonio Express newspaper, July 15, 1934, Sunday.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the pivotal [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on April 21, 1836, he joined a small company in passing close to enemy lines to burn the strategic [[Vince's Bridge]] to prevent reinforcement and escape of [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]].&lt;ref name="YPA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YPH"/&gt; The others who were with him on that mission were [[Deaf Smith]], [[John Coker]], [[Denmore W. Reaves]], [[John T. Garner]], [[Moses Lapham]] and [[Edwin R. Rainwater]].

On May 28, 1838 he was issued Donation Certificate No. 247 for {{convert|640|acre|km2|1}} of land for having participated in the battle.&lt;ref name= "CCM"&gt;"Coker Community Church Facts" By J. William Roten, Bulletin of Coker Community Church 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Bounty Certificate No. 3599 for {{convert|320|acre|km2|1}} of land for having served in the army from March 1 to May 28, 1836. On March 5, 1839, he was issued a Headright Certificate for one-third of a league of land by the [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]] Board.&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;  Shortly after the Battle of San Jacinto, Young Perry Alsbury came to [[San Antonio, Texas]] and in 1845 during the [[U.S.-Mexican War]] he went into Mexico with General Scott.&lt;ref name="CCG"&gt;"Coker Community Has Experienced Scope of Area Development" By Susan Goodell&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war he returned to San Antonio, and was married there about 1847 to Mary Rodriguez, said to be a daughter of wealthy Spanish-Americans.&lt;ref name="CCG"/&gt; He purchased 200 acres of land from Maria de Jesus Olivarri, wife of Ambrosio Rodriguez, and in early spring of 1848 he moved to the East bank of the Salado Creek, just north of Dittmar Road (now Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.) and built a home. His mother Leah moved from Brazoria to live there with him.&lt;ref name="CCG"/&gt; He raised four children: Leah Jane, b. 1849 (married John R. Hester), Thomas Jefferson, b. 1851 (married Bertha Edwards), Young Perry Jr., b. 1855 (married Mary Elizabeth Jowers), and Mary Ann, b. 1860 (married Albert Moody). Y.P. served as a Texas Ranger and was involved in several Indian skirmishes. Young Perry Alsbury died November 19, 1877 in his early 60s, and was buried only a few yards from the home on the Salado that he loved. His wife Mary died 3 years later, in 1880. A huge [[pecan]] tree marked the head of his grave. To his right lies the body of his wife, and to his left is that of his mother.&lt;ref name="YPA"/&gt;  In 1936, centennial year of the Texas Revolution, the Texas Historical Commission placed a polished marble historical marker on his grave.
