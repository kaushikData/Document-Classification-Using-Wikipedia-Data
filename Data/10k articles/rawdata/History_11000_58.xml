'''''Afrancesado''''' ({{IPA-es|afɾanθeˈsaðo|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|ɐfɾɐ̃sɨˈzaðu|lang}}; "[[Francophile]]s" or "turned-[[French people|French]]", lit. "Frenchified" or "French-alike") were the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] partisans of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, [[Liberalism]], or the [[French Revolution]], who were supporters of the [[Peninsular War|French occupation of Iberia]] ([[History_of_Portugal_(1777–1834)#Napoleonic_invasions|Portugal]] and [[Napoleonic Spain|Spain]]) and of the [[First French Empire]].

==Spain==
===Origins===
In Spain, the term ''afrancesado'' surfaced during the reign of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], and had a neutral meaning, being used to designate those who followed French fashions and customs. Subsequently, it became popular as a [[pejorative]] reference to those members of the [[Spanish nobility]] and [[bureaucracy]] who swore allegiance to [[List of Spanish monarchs|King]] [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph I Bonaparte]], and extended to cover a predominantly [[middle-class]] [[intellectual]], merchant, and [[manufacturing]] environment who saw the French as agents of change in the rigid structure of Spanish society, and who reacted against the perceived corruption and incompetence of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] and the [[House of Bourbon]] in general (including Joseph's competitor [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]).

===Political program===
Appointed King by his brother [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], Joseph found himself at war with the majority of his subjects. He relied on the ''afrancesados'' to enforce a project that would gradually replace tradition and [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] with a system [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]] defined as based on ''razón, la justicia y el poder'' ("[[rationalism|reason]], justice, and power"). [[Progressivism|Progressive]] but not entirely liberal, this political creation was soon rejected by both [[Conservatism|conservatives]] and liberals (many liberals joined the ''[[Guerilla warfare|guerilla]]'' against the occupation). The ''afrancesados'' were also weary of French designs: more favorable to the Revolution than of the Empire, they aimed to withdraw Spain from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and tried in vain to prevent Napoleon's separate administration of Spanish provinces ([[Catalonia]], [[Aragon]], [[Navarre]], and [[Basque Autonomous Community|Biscay]]) after 1809. 

The [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] had a French viceroy at the time, [[Santiago de Liniers]]. However, his appointment took place before the Peninsular War, and France was not involved at all in it: it was instead a consequence of the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]], a conflict between Britain and the Spanish colonies. Napoleon and Joseph sent the Marquis of Sassenay to the zone, seeking support from Liniers to the new monarchy, but Liniers rejected it and confirmed his loyalty to the captive king Ferdinand VII. 

Later, they also attempted to negotiate with the anti-French [[Cádiz Cortes|Cortes]] reunited in [[Cádiz]] to maintain as much possible of Joseph's [[Bayonne Statute|Bayonne laws of 1808]] into Ferdinand's [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. Nonetheless, the Cortes voted to [[Confiscation|confiscate]] all assets of Joseph's court and of the ''afrancesados''.

===Exile===
[[Image:GoyaBordeaux.jpg|thumb|250px|Plaque commemorating [[Francisco Goya]]'s exile to [[Bordeaux]]]]
After [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s 1813 campaign and the [[battle of Vitoria]], all of Joseph's court and his collaborators (nobles, soldiers, jurists, writers, journalists, and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] clergy alike) took refuge to France with [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]'s armies. The total estimate of this [[exile]] is fluctuating between 4,000 and 12,000 persons at its peak.

Ferdinand broke the terms of his agreement with Napoleon after his return detention at the [[Château of Valençay]] (May 4, 1814), and began a campaign of persecution, defining as ''afrancesados'' most of those who had not risen in combat against the French: ''colaboracionistas'' (servants of French interests), receivers of honours and distinctions handed by king Joseph, co-operating bureaucrats (those who had not resigned their positions during the occupation), or even those who were sought by the French as collaborators but had denied offers.

The immense number of liberally-minded ''[[émigré]]s'' alarmed the authorities of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in France, and they began steps to convince the Spanish government to [[pardon]] them. This came during the [[Trienio Liberal|Liberal Triennium]], as an [[amnesty]] decreed by liberal [[List of Presidents of the Government (Spain)|Premier]] [[Evaristo Pérez de Castro]]; those that did return had to flee soon after the [[Quintuple Alliance]] intervention. On April 21, 1832, France ordered them to solve their highly problematic [[Stateless person|stateless]] condition by either settling in the country or leaving its territory.

==Portugal==
{{main|Revolution of Porto}}
The term ''afrancesado'' in [[Portugal]] is connected with liberal politicians who organized the [[Revolution of Porto]], begun on August 25, 1820. Demanding the [[rule of law]] as opposed to [[William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Carr Beresford]]'s arbitrary regime, calling for the return of [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] - who had preferred to remain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]), where he had [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred the Portuguese Court]] during the French invasion. 

French influence, already present during the [[War of the Oranges]], had familiarized the ''afrancesado'' elite with principles such as the [[separation of powers]] and [[parliamentarianism]], which they demanded to have enforced in Portugal.

'''''Alexander''''' is a 2004 [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical period drama|historical drama film]] based on the life of the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] general and king [[Alexander the Great]]. It was directed by [[Oliver Stone]], with [[Colin Farrell]] in the title role. The film was an original screenplay based in part on the book ''Alexander the Great'', written in the 1970s by the [[University of Oxford]] historian [[Robin Lane Fox]]. After release, while it performed well in Europe, the American critical reaction was negative. It grossed over $167 million worldwide against a $155 million budget.

Four versions of the film exist, the initial theatrical cut and three home video [[director's cut]]s: the "Director's Cut" in 2005, the "Final Cut" in 2007 and the "Ultimate Cut" in 2013. The two earlier DVD versions of ''Alexander'' ("director's cut" version and the theatrical version) sold over 3.5 million copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221143252/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6400409.html Videobusiness.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Oliver Stone's third version, ''Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut'' (2007), sold nearly a million copies {{as of|2012|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=247524742023620&amp;id=137199066350088 |title=Words from Oliver Stone: Thank you very... - Alexander: Revisited |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story begins 40 years after 323 BC, around 283 BC, with [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who narrates throughout the film. Alexander grows up with his mother Olympias and his tutor [[Aristotle]], where he finds interest in love, honor, music, exploration, poetry, and military [[combat]]. His relationship with his father is destroyed when Philip marries [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]]'s niece, [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Eurydice]]. Alexander insults Philip after disowning Attalus as his [[kinship|kinsman]], which results in Alexander's banishment from Philip's palace.

After Philip is [[assassination|assassinated]], Alexander becomes King of Macedonia. Ptolemy mentions Alexander's punitive campaign in which he razes [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and burns [[Persepolis]], then gives an overview of Alexander's west-Persian campaign, including his declaration as the son of [[Zeus]] by the [[Oracle]] of [[Amun]] at [[Siwa Oasis]], his great battle against the Persian Emperor [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], and his eight-year campaign across Asia.

Also shown are Alexander's private relationships with his childhood friend [[Hephaistion]], [[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]], and later his wife [[Roxana]]. Hephaistion compares Alexander to [[Achilles]], to which Alexander replies that Hephaistion must be his [[Patroclus]] (Achilles' best friend and lover). When Hephaistion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaistion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife. Hephaistion shows extensive jealousy when he sees Alexander with Roxana and deep sadness when he marries her, going so far as to attempt to keep her away from him after Alexander murders [[Cleitus the Black]] in India.

After initial objection from his soldiers, Alexander convinces them to join him into his final and bloodiest battle, the [[Battle of Hydaspes]]. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Later on, Hephaistion succumbs to an unknown illness either by chance or perhaps poison, speculated in the movie to be [[typhus]] carried with him from India. Alexander, full of grief and anger, distances himself from his wife, despite her pregnancy, believing that she has killed Hephaistion. [[Death of Alexander the Great|He dies]] less than three months after Hephaistion, in the same manner, keeping his promise that he would follow him. On his deathbed, Bagoas grieves as [[Diadochi|Alexander's generals]] begin to split up his kingdom and [[Wars of the Diadochi|fight over the ownership of his body]].

The story then returns to 283 BC, where Ptolemy admits to his scribe that he, along with all the other officers, had indeed poisoned Alexander just to spare themselves from any future conquests or consequences. However, he has it recorded that Alexander died due to illness compounding his overall weakened condition. He then goes on to end his memoirs with praise to Alexander.

The story then ends with the note that Ptolemy's memoirs of Alexander were eventually burned, [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|lost forever]] with the [[Library of Alexandria]].

''Alexander'' was released in 2,445 venues on 24 November 2004 and earned $13,687,087 in its opening weekend, ranking sixth in the North American box office and second among the week's new releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2004&amp;wknd=48&amp;p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for November 26-28, 2004 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=30 November 2004 | accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon closing on 1 February 2005, the film grossed $34,297,191 domestically and $133,001,001 overseas for a worldwide total of $167,298,192.&lt;ref name="bom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=alexander.htm | title=Alexander (2004) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=1 February 2005 | accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a $155 million budget, the film was a [[box office bomb]].&lt;ref name="Waxman (2004)"&gt;[[Sharon Waxman|Waxman, S.]], 2004.

===Controversies===
A group of 25 Greek lawyers initially threatened to file a [[lawsuit]] against both Stone and the [[Warner Bros]] film studio for what they claimed was an inaccurate portrayal of history. "We are not saying that we are against [[homosexuality|gays]]," said Yannis Varnakos, "but we are saying that the production company should make it clear to the audience that this film is pure fiction and not a true depiction of the life of Alexander”. After an advance screening of the film, the lawyers announced that they would not pursue such a course of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4064727.stm |title=Greek lawyers halt Alexander case |publisher=BBC News |date=3 December 2004 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the British premiere of the film, Stone blamed "raging [[fundamentalism]] in morality" for the film's US box-office failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1384483,00.html "Stone blames 'moral fundamentalism' for US box office flop"] (Thursday 6 January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that American critics and audiences had blown the issue of Alexander's sexuality out of proportion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1371013,00.html "Stone says Alexander is too complex for 'conventional minds{{'"}}] (Friday, 10 December 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The criticism prompted him to make significant changes to the film for its DVD release, whose cover characterizes them as making it "faster paced, more action-packed".

===Criticism by historians===
''Alexander'' attracted critical scrutiny from historians with regard to historical accuracy. Most academic criticism was concerned with the insufficient adherence to historical details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stfrancis.edu/historyinthemovies/alexander.htm "Alexander (opened 24 November 2004) Oliver Stone's Costly History Lesson"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107110507/http://www.stfrancis.edu/historyinthemovies/alexander.htm |date=7 January 2008 }} By Cathy Schultz, Ph.D. in ''Dayton Daily News'', 24 November 2004. (Also in ''Joliet Herald News'', 28 November 2004; ''Bend Bulletin'', 28 November 2004; ''Providence Journal'', 26 November 2004.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian historian Farrokh questioned the omission of the burning of [[Persepolis]] by Alexander and observed that, in the movie, "Greek forces are typically shown as very organised, disciplined, and so on, and what's very disturbing is, when the so-called Persians are shown confronting the Macedonians, you see them turbaned. Their armies are totally disorganized. What is not known is that the Persians actually had uniforms. They marched in discipline, and music was actually used..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esfandiari |first=Golnaz |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1057143.html |title=World: Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' Stirs Up Controversy |publisher=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver Stone has, in his various commentaries in the film's DVD, defended many of the most glaring historical issues in regard to Iranian history by claiming that he had no time or resources to portray accurately a multitude of battles at the expense of storytelling. He goes into great detail explaining how he merged all the major aspects of the [[Battle of the Granicus]] and the [[Battle of Issus]] into the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], as well as heavily simplifying the Battle of Hydaspes into a straightforward clash, while merging the near-death of Alexander from the siege of Malli.

===Criticism by film critics===
The film performed well in Europe, but, in North America, received mostly negative reviews from film critics, with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 16% rating based on 202 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The website's critical consensus states: "Even at nearly three hours long, this ponderous, talky, and emotionally distant biopic fails to illuminate Alexander's life."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|alexander|Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the principal complaints among US film critics was that ''Alexander'' resembled less an action-drama film than a history documentary. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote in his review, "[W]e welcome the scenes of battle, pomp and circumstance because at least for a time we are free of the endless narration of Ptolemy the historian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=23 November 2004|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Alexander|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alexander-2004 |website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faint praise came from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety Magazine]]'', published on 21 November 2004, for which [[Todd McCarthy]] wrote, "Oliver Stone's ''Alexander'' is at best an honorable failure, an intelligent and ambitious picture that crucially lacks dramatic flair and emotional involvement. Dry and academic where ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' (2004) was vulgar and willfully ahistorical".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925592.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |title=Alexander |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=21 November 2004|accessdate=22 August 2010 |first=Todd |last=McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominations===
The film was nominated in six categories at the [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] in 2005: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Colin Farrell), Worst Actress (Angelina Jolie) and Worst Director (Oliver Stone), Worst Supporting Actor (Val Kilmer) and Worst Screenplay, thereby becoming the second-most-nominated potential "Razzie" film of 2004; however, it won no awards.

==Versions==
{{trivia|date=June 2018}}

===Theatrical cut===
This is the film as it was originally released in theaters, with a running time of 175 minutes. It was released on DVD and is also available on Blu-ray in some territories.

===Director's cut===
Stone's [[director's cut]] was re-edited before the DVD release later in 2005. Stone removed seventeen minutes of footage and added nine back. This shortened the running time from 175 minutes to 167. The differences between the director's cut and the theatrical version are as follows:
* Dates in the flashbacks and flashforwards use normal historical figures, such as 323 BC and 356 BC, as opposed to referring to time lapses, like "30 years earlier". In his commentary, Stone explains that, for the theatrical release in the United States, he had to refrain from using regular "[[Ante Christum Natum|BC]]" dates, since (according to data collected from test screenings) there was a significant number of viewers who did not know that 356 BC represented an earlier historical period than 323 BC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* Ptolemy's backstory at the beginning is shortened.
* The two flashbacks with the arrival of Eurydice to the court and the wedding feast are shifted into the eastern campaign, enveloping the trial of [[Philotas]] and assassination of [[Parmenion]].
* The scene in which Aristotle gives a lesson to the young Alexander and his friends is re-edited and extended by a few seconds.
* Ptolemy's narration leading up to the Battle of Gaugamela gives no reference to the razing of Thebes and burning of Persepolis. He mentions the official Macedonian accusation, that Darius assisted the assassination of Philip&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in both versions, it is also mentioned when Alexander rallies the troops&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and the proclamation by the Oracle of Amun is moved to a later part of the narrative.
* There is no scene on the night before the Battle of Gaugamela or the omen reader looking into the intestine of the ox-sacrifice before the Battle of Gaugamela.
* In the commentary, it is explained that Kilmer and other cast members deliberately use an Irish accent as Farrell was unable to lose his, with Irish accents being used as a stand-in for a Macedonian Greek accent, and British English representing Greek.
* Directly after Alexander's mourning the dead after the Battle of Gaugamela, there is an additional flashback in which Philip explains the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s to the young Alexander.
* In the theatrical version, during Roxana's dance, [[Perdiccas]] can be seen breaking up a fight between Hephaistion and Cleitus. This is removed in the director's cut.
* The [[Sex in film|sex scene]] between Alexander and Roxana is shortened, and her attempt to kill him after her discovery of his relationship with Hephaistion is cut. More explicit footage of Alexander and Roxana having [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] is added.
* When Alexander uncovers the page's plot, the director's cut features a small scene in which Perdiccas goes to arrest Hermolaus, who falls on his sword with the words "Death to all tyrants".
* There is no narrative explanation by Ptolemy during the trial of Philotas.
* Alexander does not mourn Cleitus.
* The flashback of Alexander questioning Olympias does not appear immediately after the flashback of Philip's assassination; rather, it is moved to follow Alexander's grievous wounds in the Battle of the Hydaspes.
* The scene in which Roxana is prevented from entering Alexander's tent by Hephaistion is also removed. This is the last remnant of a Roxana-[[Cassander]] [[subplot]] that was filmed but not included.
* Between the scene in which Alexander smashes the "rebellion" within the ranks and the final battle, there is an additional scene in which Alexander reads a letter from Aristotle, who is featured dictating it to an unseen scribe.
* Ptolemy's narration of the march through the [[Gedrosia]]n desert additionally mentions the helplessness of Alexander watching his broken army die due to natural causes and harsh conditions. He does not mention either Alexander's new marriages in his final years or that the march across the Gedrosian desert was the "worst blunder of his life".
* The scene of the army returning to Babylon, together with that in which Olympias receives the omen of Alexander's death, is shortened.

===''Alexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut''===
Stone also made an extended version of ''Alexander''. "I'm doing a third version on DVD, not theatrical", he said, in an interview with Rope of Silicon. "I'm going to do a [[Cecil B. DeMille]] three-hour-45-minute thing; I'm going to go all out, put everything I like in the movie. He [Alexander] was a complicated man, it was a complicated story, and it doesn't hurt to make it longer and let people who loved the film [...] see it more and understand it more."

The extended version was released under the title of ''Alexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut'' on 27 February 2007. The two-disc set featured a new introduction by Stone. "Over the last two years," he said, "I have been able to sort out some of the unanswered questions about this highly complicated and passionate monarch&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; questions I failed to answer dramatically enough. This film represents my complete and last version, as it will contain all the essential footage we shot. I don't know how many film-makers have managed to make three versions of the same film, but I have been fortunate to have the opportunity because of the success of video and DVD sales in the world, and I felt, if I didn't do it now, with the energy and memory I still have for the subject, it would never quite be the same again. For me, this is the complete ''Alexander'', the clearest interpretation I can offer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/news.php?id=4906 "Oliver Stone's ''Alexander'' Gets Another DVD Release The final, final cut is now confirmed..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210001529/http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/news.php?id=4906 |date=10 February 2007 }} By Brad Brevet (Monday, 18 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is restructured into two acts with an intermission. ''Alexander: Revisited'' takes a more in-depth look at Alexander's life and his relationships with Olympias, Philip, Hephaestion, Roxana and Ptolemy. The film has a running time of three hours and 34 minutes (214 minutes, about 40 minutes longer than the theatrical cut and almost 50 minutes longer than the first director's cut) and is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen with English [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 Surround audio. Beyond the new introduction with Stone, there are no other extras on the DVD except for a free coupon to the movie ''[[300 (film)|300]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whv.warnerbros.com/WHVPORTAL/Portal/product.jsp?OID=18842 |title=Warner Bros.

For seven years, it was the only version of the film available on [[Blu-ray]], until the release of the Ultimate Cut, which also includes the Theatrical Cut.

===Ultimate cut===
In November 2012, Stone revealed that he was working on a fourth cut of the film, at Warner's request and that this time around he would remove material, as he felt he had added in too much in the "Final Cut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a436837/oliver-stone-plans-fourth-alexander-cut.html |title=Oliver Stone plans fourth 'Alexander' cut |publisher=Digital Spy |author=Hugh Armitage |date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version, which is 206 minutes long, premiered on 3 July 2013 at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kviff.com/en/films/film-detail/4076-alexander-the-ultimate-cut/ |title=Alexander: The Ultimate Cut |publisher=Karlovy Vary International Film |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710213903/http://www.kviff.com/en/films/film-detail/4076-alexander-the-ultimate-cut/ |archivedate=10 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stone swears that no more versions will follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/oliver-stone-insists-latest-cut-of-alexander-is-the-ultimate-version-1200502896/ |title=Oliver Stone Insists Latest Cut of 'Alexander' Is the 'Ultimate Version' |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |author=Iain Blair |date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Oliver Stone announced on Twitter that 'Alexander the Ultimate Cut (Tenth Anniversary Edition)' would be released in the United States on 3 June 2014. According to Amazon.com, some of its features include:

* "40-Page Art Book with Concept Drawings, Storyboards and Behind-the-Scenes Photos
* Collectible packaging
* Correspondence memos between Oliver Stone and the Cast and Crew
* New documentary: ''The Real Alexander and the World He Made''
* The Ultimate Cut commentary by Oliver Stone

[[File:S7300095.JPG|right|thumb|[[Stonehenge]] is one of the most famous [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] ancient monuments.]]
In British law, an '''ancient monument''' is an early [[history|historical]] structure or [[monument]] (e.g. an [[archaeological site]]) worthy of [[historic preservation|preservation]] and study due to [[Archaeology|archaeological]] or [[cultural heritage|heritage]] interest. The term differs from the American term "[[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]]" in that U.S. National Monuments are [[List of National Monuments of the United States|comparatively few in number]] and may include natural formations; British ancient monuments are by definition manmade.

Ancient monuments are defined by the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/46/section/61 |title=Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979   |date=4 April 1979 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as
*(a) any [[scheduled monument]] (of which there are currently more than 20,000&lt;ref name="DCMS Scheduled Monuments"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/ScheduledMonuments.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121204113822/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/ScheduledMonuments.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-04 |title= Scheduled Monuments |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |date=March 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and 
*(b) any other monument which in the opinion of the Secretary of State is of public interest by reason of the historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching to it.

Loginov was a member of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] starting in 1902 and had the party nickname "Anton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rosgenea.ru/?a=12&amp;p=15&amp;r=4&amp;s=%CB%EE%E3%E8%ED%EE%E2 Центр генеалогических исследований/ Логинов Михаил Осипович]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Tiflis City Party Committee and the Soviet of Soldiers' Deputies starting in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Ленин в "Правде".: Воспоминания, /  1970 -   /  С. 341&lt;/ref&gt; From 1902 to 1912 he led illegal party work in Moscow and participated in many revolutions such as the First Russian revolution in Moscow and the October Revolution of 1917 in [[Tiflis]].

Loginov was a born speaker and a witty polemist. [[Lenin]] learned of his ability to speak with the masses in a simple and understandable language, to attract interesting material and witty answers to questions. He advised Loginov to engage in anti-religious propaganda. From the beginning of the 1920s Loginov devoted himself entirely to atheistic work, and trained qualified personnel in the anti-religious campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Идеи Ленина живут и побеждают  / Ред. коллегия: доц.

Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of the Militant Godless/ Cornell University Press, 1998 / p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a member of the bureau of the district party committee, a member of the MK RCP (b), chairman of the Moscow and Central Soviet of Atheists, deputy People's Commissar of Communications, and editor of the newspaper and magazine "[[Bezbozhnik (newspaper)|Bezbozhnik]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rosgenea.ru/?a=12&amp;p=15&amp;r=4&amp;s=%CB%EE%E3%E8%ED%EE%E2 Центр генеалогических исследований/ Логинов Михаил Осипович]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s Loginov participated in disputes with representatives of the clergy. He focused on exposing the counter-revolutionary activity of churchmen, the antiscientific and reactionary essence of religion, and the class implications of religious morality. Loginov was the author of many articles and brochures on atheism and on religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Atheistic Dictionary]] / [http://вседуховное.рф/атеистический-словарь-2/ Логинов Михаил Осипович]&lt;/ref&gt; His book was published under the name "Anton Loginov". Typical of a pamphlet aimed at the countryside was Anton Loginov's "The Godless: the Best Friend of the Peasant" (1925). We do not want to take religion away from you, explained Loginov, we just want you to give it up. "And what do you replace it with", he has the peasant ask  (quite realistically)? His answer “Evil does not have to be replaced, but simply rooted out. That is our program".&lt;ref&gt;Stites R. Revolutionary Dreams: Utopian Vision and Experimental Life in the Russian Revolution.

[[File:Arab Leage HQ 977.PNG|thumb|Headquarters of the Arab League, [[Cairo]].]]
The '''Arab League boycott of Israel''' is a strategy adopted by the [[Arab League]] and its member states to [[Boycotts of Israel|boycott]] economic and other relations between Arabs and the Arab states and [[Israel]] and specifically stopping all trade with Israel which adds to that country's economic and military strength.&lt;ref name="turck"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/20039682|last=Turck|first=Nancy |date=April 1977 |title=The Arab Boycott of Israel|jstor=20039682|journal=Foreign Affairs|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|volume=55|issue=3|pages=472–493}}&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary boycott was later imposed, to boycott non-Israeli companies that do business with Israel, and later a tertiary boycott involved the blacklisting of firms that that do business with other companies that do business with Israel.

An official organized boycott of the [[Yishuv]] (pre-state Jewish community in Palestine) was adopted by the Arab League in December 1945, and persisted against Israel after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|its establishment in 1948]].&lt;ref&gt;http://lawin.org/arab-boycott/&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott was designed to weaken Jewish industry in Palestine and to deter [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration to the region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Civilization: Volume 2: Beyond Positivism and Historicism |first=Irving Louis|last=Horowitz|page=91|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the boycott undoubtedly hurt Israel to some extent, it failed to cripple the country economically. Israel managed to build one of the strongest economies in the region, and managed to evade the boycott and clandestinely trade with the Arab and Muslim world through a number of countermeasures. The implementation of the boycott has varied over time among member states, and has since waned, with some states no longer applying the boycott.

[[Egypt]] (1979), the [[Palestinian Authority]] (1993), and [[Jordan]] (1994) signed peace treaties or agreements that ended their participation in the boycott of Israel. [[Mauritania]], which never applied the boycott, established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1999. [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]] do not enforce the boycott.&lt;ref name="crs"/&gt; In 1994, following the [[Oslo Peace Accords]], the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC) states, ended their participation in the Arab boycott against Israel.&lt;ref name="shems"&gt;Joyce Shems Sharon. The Arab Boycott Against Israel and Its Unintended Impact on Arab Economic Walfare. May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The move prompted a surge of investment in Israel, and resulted in the initiation of joint cooperation projects between Israel and Arab countries.&lt;ref name="shems"/&gt; In 1996, the GCC states recognized that total elimination of the boycott is a necessary step for peace and economic development in the region.&lt;ref name="crs"/&gt;

While in its heyday, the Arab boycott had a moderate negative impact on Israel's economy and development, but also had significant negative effect on economic welfare in participating Arab countries, as the result of a deterioration in the foreign direct investment climate in the Arab world, and reduction in the volume of trade.&lt;ref name="shems"/&gt; In present days, the boycott is sporadically applied and ambiguously enforced, and therefore, no longer has significant effect on the Israeli or Arab economies.&lt;ref name="crs"&gt;{{CRS|article = Arab League Boycott of Israel. |url = http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33961.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott also negatively impacted other countries— particularly the United States during the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] in the 1970s.

Today, most Arab states, [[Syria]] being the exception, no longer attempt to enforce the secondary or tertiary boycotts. Syria, Lebanon, and Iran (though not an Arab state) are the only states which actively enforce the primary boycott. 

==History==

===Boycott attempts in Mandatory Palestine===
As part of the [[intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine]], some Arab leaders sought to orchestrate [[Antisemitic boycotts|anti-Jewish boycotts]] from 1922.&lt;ref name="Feiler" /&gt; The original boycott forswore with any Jewish-owned business operating in Mandatory Palestine.  Palestinian Arabs "who were found to have broken the boycott ... were physically attacked by their brethren and their merchandise damaged" when [[1929 Palestine riots|Palestinian Arabs rioted in Jerusalem]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, Gil.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=2tFnXdEuKgoC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Arab+boycott+1929&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=joqm6N5udK&amp;sig=hh6heqyRg3y0ndNgvv4_8iKWHiU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S6aeSvKfHYX6sQPp-5Eh&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Arab%20boycott%201929&amp;f=false "From boycott to economic cooperation ...."] ''[[Google Books]]''.  2 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another, stricter boycott was imposed on Jewish businesses in following the riots that called on all of the Arabs in the region to abide by its terms.  The Arab Executive Committee of the [[Syrian-Palestinian Congress]] called for a boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933 and in 1934, the Arab Labor Federation conducted a boycott as well as an organized picketing of Jewish businesses.  In 1936, the Palestinian Arab leadership called on another boycott and threatened those who did not respect the boycott with violence, however, this boycott was unsuccessful as Jewish lawyers, physicians, and hospitals were too heavily integrated into Palestinian society.&lt;ref name="Feiler"&gt;Feiler, Gil. "Arab Boycott." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. [[Avraham Sela]].  New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 54-57&lt;/ref&gt;

===First formal Arab League boycott and limited application===
The Arab League was formed on 22 March 1945 with five members, while a sixth member joined later that year. On 2 December 1945, it issued its first formal declaration of an economic boycott of the Jewish community of Palestine. The declaration urged both Arab United Nations member states and Arab states which had not yet obtained UN membership to prohibit the products and usage of the products of Jewish industry in Palestine, effective January 1, 1946. The declaration, contained in [[Arab League Resolution 16]], stated:
{{quote|Products of Palestinian Jews are to be considered undesirable in Arab countries. They should be prohibited and refused as long as their production in Palestine might lead to the realization of Zionist political aims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardozoaelj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Peled-32-3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Arab League began to create the apparatus for implementing the resolution in February the same year. The first body established for this purpose was the Permanent Boycott Committee, based in Cairo, Egypt. On 12 June the Boycott Committee adopted a recommendation in Arab League Resolution 70, which called upon the Arab states to set up national boycott offices. Later measures adopted by the Committee included requiring those selling goods to Arab states to provide a certificate of origin to prove the goods were not manufactured by Palestinian Jews, the allocation of 50% of the value of goods confiscated in this manner to customs officials, the prohibition by Arabs of the use of Jewish banks, insurance companies, contractors, and transport in Palestine. Member states of the Arab League began implementing these resolutions through legal and administrative measures. After the Partition Plan of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states was introduced at the United Nations on 29 November 1947, efforts to apply the boycott were intensified. However, the boycott was unsuccessful, as noted in the first annual report of the Boycott Committee, and trade between Palestine (the vast majority by Jews) and Arab States neighboring Palestine continued to thrive.

Following the [[Israeli declaration of independence]] on 14 May 1948, the Permanent Boycott Committee ceased to function upon the outbreak of war between Israel and surrounding Arab States on 15 May 1948, and the Arab League repeated its calls for a ban on all financial and commercial transactions with Palestinian Jews, boycotting the newly formed State of Israel. The Arab League cut off postal, telegraphic, and radio communications with Israel, and Arab States began to impose a land, sea, and air [[blockade]] on the fledgling state. Israeli goods, shipped through Alexandria, Port Suez and Port Said, were [[piracy|confiscated]] by Egyptian inspectors. A prize court established in Alexandria in 1949 authorized the seizure of cargo ships destined for Israel. In 1950, regulations were promulgated to allow the search of ships and aircraft and the seizure of Israeli-bound goods found within.

=== Establishment of the secondary boycott and uniform application ===

The Arab-Israeli war ended on 10 March 1949 with a decisive Israeli victory. On 6 February 1950, King Farouk of Egypt issued a decree under which manifests and cargoes of ships could be searched to ensure that no "war contraband" was present on vessels bound directly or indirectly for Israel. War contraband included arms, munitions, and war material. However, article 10 additionally stipulated that other goods were to be considered "contraband" and were to be treated as war material — ships, chemicals, motor vehicles, money, gold, and fuel of any kind. At the time 90% of Israeli oil was supplied by Iran and imported through the [[Straits of Tiran]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8YhNPNeBh8IC&amp;pg=PA224 The 1967 Arab-Israeli War: Origins and Consequences]&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent Iranian oil from entering Israel, Egypt blockaded the [[Straits of Tiran]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. Oil tankers proceeding through the Suez Canal were required to submit documentation to guarantee none of their cargo would arrive at an Israeli port. To enforce the policy of denying strategic goods to Israel, the decree authorized the use of force against any ship attempting to avoid search, including live gunfire, to make it submit to inspection. If a ship were to subsequently allow a search and reveal that they were not carrying any "contraband", the ship would be allowed to continue its voyage. However, if the ship resisted a search by force, it would be considered to have violated its neutrality. For this "hostile act", ships were to be seized and their cargo impounded even if they were not found to possess any "contraband". Ships found or suspected to transgress the Egyptian shipping practices delineated in this decree were blacklisted by Egypt and denied free use of the Suez Canal.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OL1dyqF4ZmIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq= The Canadian Yearbook of International Law, Vol. 30 ..., Volume 30; Volume 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; The decree of February 1950 signaled a shift in the policy of the Arab League. The boycott's immediate purpose had originally been to prevent direct Arab trade with Israel (called a primary boycott). With this decree the boycott was expanded to the interruption of international trade with Israel (a secondary boycott). On 8 April 1950, the Arab League Council embraced this shift, approving a decision by its political committee to the effect that all ships carrying goods or immigrants to Israel were to be blacklisted.

In the summer of 1950, the governments of Britain, Norway, and the United States lodged a complaint with Egypt about some of their tankers being blacklisted and barred from using the Suez Canal. On 1 September 1951, after ships destined for Eilat had been stopped at the entrance of the Gulf of Aqaba, Israel went to the United Nations, demanding Egypt terminate its restrictions on navigation through international waterways in adherence to the 1949 Armistice and to Security Council resolutions prohibiting further hostilities between the Arab states and Israel. The United Nations Security Council issued a resolution which condemned the Egyptian practice as an "abuse of the exercise of the right of visit, search and seizure." This resolution was ignored by Egypt.

On 19 May 1951, the Arab League Council passed [[Arab League Resolution 357|Resolution 357]], which established a successor to the defunct Permanent Boycott Committee, the [[Central Boycott Office]] (CBO), with its headquarters in Damascus. Branch offices of the Damascus CBO were established in each of the Arab League member states. To direct the CBO the resolution created the position of Boycott Commissioner and provided for the appointment of his deputies, who were to function as liaison officers accredited by each member state of the Arab League. The primary task of the Damascus CBO was to coordinate the boycott with its affiliated offices, and to report regularly to Arab League Council. Biannual meetings were to be held each year after 1951 to coordinate boycott policies and to compile blacklists of individuals and firms which had violated the boycott. Each member state of the Arab League would enforce the resolution through legal and administrative measures. Finally, the resolution stipulated that "participation in regional conferences organized on the initiative of one country or by an international organization could not be attended if Israel were also invited", expanding upon its 1950 decree that such a conference would not be organized by an Arab state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5EHJHVXmLeEC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq India's Israel Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boycotts were almost exclusively applied against specific individuals and firms in third countries, and very rarely against the countries themselves, excluding a few short-lived boycotts of countries in the early 1950s. A plan was made by the Arab League in 1952 to boycott the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] after it signed the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|Reparations Agreement]] with Israel, which would provide Israel with restitution for the [[slavery|slave labor]] of Jews during [[the Holocaust]] and compensate for losses in Jewish livelihood and property that was stolen due to Nazi persecution and genocide. The Arab League strongly opposed the agreement,&lt;ref&gt;[1952:Germany to Pay Reparations : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/12/opinion/12iht-edold_ed3__26.html]&lt;/ref&gt; but its threats to boycott West Germany were never carried out due to economic considerations—the Arab League would be impacted far more negatively by losing trade with West Germany than vice versa. Similarly, at its second meeting on the boycott in 1953, the Arab League proposed a wide range of restrictions on trade with [[Cyprus]], which had become a hub of illicit Arab-Israeli trade. The restrictions were greatly relaxed due to international criticism of the boycott of an entire state not involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, but they were not completely eliminated.

The boycott of third parties (secondary boycott) originally applied solely to funds and strategic commodities. However, on 28 November 1953, Egypt increased its disruption of Israeli maritime trade by expanding its list of "contraband" to include "foodstuffs and all other commodities likely to strengthen the potential of the Zionists in Palestine in any way whatsoever."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

By 1953 the Arab boycott was a well-established feature of international trade relations, and becoming more brazen. In early 1953 the first reports were released about Arab attempts to make American and European airlines boycott Israel by refusing to service Israelis or land in Israel, or at a minimum to not invest in Israel. This tertiary boycott marked another fundamental shift in boycott policy wherein Arab states would pressure third party states to agree to boycott Israel. However, these rudimentary efforts were unsuccessful and the airline boycotts remained isolated to the Arab world.

On 11 December 1954 the Arab League Council passed [[Arab League Resolution 849|Resolution 849]], approving the Unified Law on the Boycott of Israel. The provisions of this resolution, implemented in legislation by most member states over the following year, formalized the application of the boycott in the Arab States uniformly. The resolution contained new recommendations prohibiting Arab entities and individuals from dealing with agencies of persons working for Israel, and with foreign companies and organizations with interests, agencies, or branches in Israel. The export of Arab goods to countries to be re-exported to Israel was criminalized with a penalty of large fines and hard labor.

=== Further intensification of the boycott and international capitulation to tertiary boycotts ===
In the mid-1950s boycott activities intensified, and gained a new and highly powerful ally — the Soviet Union. During Israel's early years it was seen by the USSR as a potential ally due to the significant socialist aspirations advocated by its founders and applied in its conception. The Soviet Union was one of the first countries to recognize Israel ''de jure'' upon its establishment in 1948. However, as Israel's democratic nature became evident and its ties with Western states were solidified, the Soviet Union would view Israel as an enemy in the West vs. East dichotomy of the [[Cold War]]. Instead, the Soviet Union would form an alliance with the revolutionary Arab regimes, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and later in the decade Iraq, united in anti-American and anti-Israel political objectives. The clout of the Soviet Union gave the boycott new international legitimacy and guaranteed anti-boycott resolutions a veto at the UN Security Council. The tertiary boycott, formerly ignored as an affront to international trade relations, became enforceable through the sheer political and economic power of the Soviet Union. In 1958, Air France capitulated to Arab League demands after being denied overflight and landing rights in Arab states for eighteen months due to its alleged investment in Israeli development projects.

With the success of the first tertiary boycott the Arab League became increasingly demanding of uninvolved states to adhere to its boycott of Israel. In 1958 the boycott was expanded to prohibit all goods exported from a third state identical to goods imported by the state from Israel, including goods produced with Israeli raw materials or components. In the same year, ships visiting an Arab port and an Israeli port within the same trip were blacklisted.

=== Height of the boycott — the Oil Crisis ===
{{main|1973 oil crisis}}

The Arab boycott of Israel escalated with the 1973 oil crisis, when the members of the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OAPEC, consisting of nine [[Arab]] members of [[OPEC]] plus Egypt and Syria) announced an oil [[embargo]] in October 1973, following United States resupply of arms to Israel during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], the first time the United States directly supported Israel in a war. The OAPEC embargo targeted [[Canada]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nelson.wisc.edu/che/events/place-based-workshops/2010/project/energy-perspectives/crisis.php |title=Responding to Crisis |publisher=University of Wisconsin |date=April 26, 2010 |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OAPEC threatened to cut oil production 5% monthly "until the Israeli forces are completely evacuated from all the Arab territories occupied in the June 1967 war...." The embargo lasted for about five months before it was lifted in March 1974, though its aftereffects were to continue.

=== Weakening of the boycott ===
[[File:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Following the [[Oslo Peace Accords]], the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC) states, ended their participation in the Arab boycott against Israel, and declared that total elimination of the boycott is a necessary step for peace and economic development in the region.]]
A number of companies found ways of bypassing the boycott and managed to trade with both Israel and the Arab world. For example, some firms that did business with Arab countries officially complied with the boycott, but in practice subcontracted their trade with Israel to companies already blacklisted by the Arab states, while others did business with Israel through divisions or affiliates whose links to the company were disguised. Others strove to cultivate good personal relationships with Arab leaders, who would allow them to trade with Israel without economic repercussions in their own countries as a favor. Some firms placed on the blacklist managed to lobby or buy their way off it.&lt;ref name=Naylor&gt;Naylor, R. T.: ''Economic Warfare: Sanctions, Embargo Busting, and Their Human Cost''&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel responded to the boycott by creating its own blacklist of firms that respected the boycott, and circulated them around the world to encourage Jewish-owned businesses to avoid dealing with them. In addition, Israel supporters in some Western countries managed to get anti-boycott laws passed, but they typically went unenforced everywhere except the United States.&lt;ref name=Naylor/&gt; In 1977 the [[United States Congress]] passed a law that President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed, which made it a criminal offense to adhere to the boycott and imposed fines on American companies that were found to be complying with it. For the surveillance after the implementation of this law, an office called the "Office of Antiboycott Compliance" was opened in the US Department of Commerce. Despite the fines, there were some American companies (like [[McDonald's]]) which preferred to pay the fines and continue boycotting Israel rather than lose their business with the Arab world.

Israel also took a series of steps to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world. Front companies in third countries were set up, which imported goods, then re-exported them to Arab countries with false labels and certificates of origin. In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked out where the American companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly export goods to the Arab and Muslim world. [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and bank secrecy laws.&lt;ref name=Naylor/&gt;

[[Egypt]] was the first nation to abandon boycott, doing so in 1980 after signing a [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] with Israel the previous year. After more or less consistently adhering to the practice of seizing cargo bound for Israel since 1950, the Straights of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba were opened to Israeli trade and Israeli cargo went unmolested for the first time in decades. Afterwards, Egypt became a convenient destination to smuggle Israeli goods into the rest of the Arab world, as Israeli goods could be legally imported into Egypt and relabeled as Egyptian for trade with other Arab countries, although the treaty led to other Arab countries becoming more suspicious of Egyptian products.&lt;ref name=Naylor/&gt; By the late 1980s, Israel's counter-measures against the boycott were proving a success, and the Boycott Office estimated that between $750 million to $1 billion worth of Israeli goods, or about 10% of Israel's exports at the time, were reaching Arab markets per year.&lt;ref name=Naylor/&gt;

In 1995, a year after it signed a peace treaty with Israel, [[Jordan]] lifted its boycott. The [[Palestinian Authority]] likewise agreed not to abide by the boycott that same year. In 1994 several of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf abandoned the secondary and tertiary boycotts. The period also saw "low-level diplomatic relations" between Israel and [[Morocco]], [[Mauritania]], [[Oman]], and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref name="Feiler" /&gt; In 1994, following the [[Oslo Peace Accords]], the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC) states, ended their participation in the Arab boycott against Israel.&lt;ref name="shems"/&gt; The move prompted a surge of investment in Israel, and resulted in the initiation of joint cooperation projects between Israel and Arab countries.&lt;ref name="shems"/&gt; In 1996, the GCC states recognized that total elimination of the boycott is a necessary step for peace and economic development in the region.&lt;ref name="crs"/&gt; [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]] do not enforce the boycott. [[Mauritania]], which never applied the boycott, established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1999.&lt;ref name="crs"/&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]] had pledged to end its economic boycott as a condition for membership in the [[World Trade Organization]] but came back on the promise following its acceptance into the organization in December 11, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, Michael. "[http://www.jpost.com/International/Congress-to-Saudis-End-Israel-boycott Congress to Saudis: End Israel Boycott]". ''Jerusalem Post''. April 6, 2006; 22:08. Retrieved January 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the boycott was relaxed (or rather, not as stringently enforced) starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many companies which previously stayed out of the Israeli market had entered it, e.g. [[McDonald's]] and [[Nestlé]]. In 1985, the ban was lifted on Ford, which had been in place since the company had opened an assembly plant in Israel, and [[Colgate-Palmolive]], although five other companies were added to the blacklist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-19/news/mn-6529_1_arab-boycott Arabs End Boycott of 2 U.S. Firms but Blacklist 5 Others], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 19, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota]] began selling cars in Israel in 1991, although it claimed that it had never complied with the boycott, arguing that it did not have the resources to sell cars in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/11/business/toyota-to-sell-cars-in-israel-officials-say.html Toyota to Sell Cars in Israel, Officials Say], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 11, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military non-cooperation===
{{main|Gulf War}}
The Arab League boycott of Israel extends to military and security non-cooperation. For example, before the [[Gulf War]] (1990-91) the United States sought to form a military coalition that included Arab countries to confront [[Saddam Husein]]’s Iraq following his invasion of Kuwait. During the war, Iraq fired many [[Scud missile]]s potentially containing poison gas at Israel, which caused considerable distress and damage in Israel, hoping to provoke an Israeli military response. The Iraqi government hoped that Arab states would withdraw from the coalition, as they would be reluctant to fight alongside Israel.&lt;ref name=sam&gt;Waldman, Shmuel (2005).  ''Beyond a Reasonable Doubt''. Feldheim Publishers, p. 179. {{ISBN|1-58330-806-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; US President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] pressured Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] not to retaliate and withdraw Israeli jets, fearing that if Israel attacked Iraq, the other Arab countries would either desert the coalition or join Iraq. It was also feared that if Israel used Syrian or Jordanian airspace to attack Iraq, they would intervene in the war on Iraq's side or attack Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh, ''The Gulf Conflict: Diplomacy and War in the New World Order'', 1990–1991 (Princeton, 1993), 331–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Gordon, ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary boycott===
Today, most Arab states, [[Syria]] being the exception, no longer attempt to enforce the secondary or tertiary boycotts. Syria, Lebanon, and Iran (though not an Arab state) are the only states which actively enforce the primary boycott. The Central Boycott Office has become obsolete. With the vast majority of Arab states benefiting from trade with Israel, any "boycott" has become symbolic in nature, limited to bureaucratic slights such as passport restrictions.

[[File:Israel - Boycott, divest, sanction.jpg|thumb|right|275px|BDS protest in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 2010.]]
The [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) movement was founded in 2005 in an attempt to increase economic and political pressure on Israel and advocates a total, international boycott of Israeli products, divestment of investments in Israel and sanctions. Besides anti-Israel economic measures, the BDS movement also strives to disrupt cultural exchanges and business involving Israel, Israelis and businesses which deal with them. In addition, sporting teams from various Arab states continue to boycott international matches when they are drawn against an Israeli team, choosing instead to forfeit the match.

====Diplomatic non-recognition====
{{see also|International recognition of Israel}}
Today, 31 United Nations member states do not [[international recognition of Israel|recognise the State of Israel]]. These include 18 of the 22 Arab League members: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen; and a further 10 members of [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brunei, Chad, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mali, Niger, and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="usres"&gt;{{Cite web|author=United States Congress|title=H.

The passports of some countries are not valid for travel to Israel. These countries include Bangladesh, Brunei, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan. Sixteen [[Israeli passport#Countries that do not accept Israeli passports|countries do not accept Israeli passport]]s.&lt;ref name="algeria"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=DZ|accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brunei"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=BN|accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuwait"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=KW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lebanon"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=LB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="libya"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=LY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oman"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=OM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan K1 Fiancee Visa Processing Times |url=http://www.k1-fiancee-visa-law.com/k1-visa-processing-times/pakistan-k1-visa-processing-times/ |accessdate=27 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914044556/http://www.k1-fiancee-visa-law.com/k1-visa-processing-times/pakistan-k1-visa-processing-times/ |archivedate=14 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saudi"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=SA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sudan"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=SD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="syria"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=SY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yemen"&gt;{{Timatic|nationality=IL|destination=YE}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are Algeria, Bangladesh, Brunei, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Eight of these also do not accept passports of other countries whose holder has an Israeli visa endorsed in it.&lt;ref name="lebanon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saudi" /&gt; The stamp may be a visa stamp, or a stamp on entry or departure. It can also include a stamp of another country which indicates that the person has entered Israel. For example, if an Egyptian departure stamp is used in any passport at the [[Taba Crossing]], that is an indication that the person entered Israel.

==Effects of the boycott==

===Economic effects===
Although it cannot be estimated to what extent the boycott hurt [[Economy of Israel|Israel's economy]], the boycott cannot be said to have affected it to the extent the Arabs intended.&lt;ref name="Feiler" /&gt; Israel's economy has performed relatively well since 1948, achieving a higher [[gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita than that of all Arab countries except for the oil-rich gulf states of [[Kuwait]] and [[Qatar]]. The boycott nevertheless has undoubtedly harmed Israel to some extent. The Israeli Chamber of Commerce estimates that with the boycott Israeli exports are 10 percent less than they would be without the boycott and investment in Israel likewise 10 percent lower.

Arab states suffer economically from the boycott as well. In its report on the [[cost of conflict]] in the Middle East, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] estimates that Arab states lost an opportunity to export $10 billion worth of goods to Israel between 2000-2010. Moreover, the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] and [[Iran]] together stand to lose $30 billion as the [[opportunity cost]] of not exporting oil to Israel in the second half of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm#costofconflict |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128200530/http://strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }} Cost of Conflict in the Middle East report by Strategic Foresight Group, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the boycott, certain products which were ubiquitous elsewhere in the world, such as [[Pepsi]], [[McDonald's]] and most Japanese cars were not to be found in Israel until the boycott began waning in the late 1980s. A similar situation existed in the Arab world which boycotted the products of companies that were selling in Israel as in the case of [[Coca-Cola]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Revlon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19750224&amp;id=QAMqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8igEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7159,1936696 'Foreign Firms Yielding To Arab Boycott Of Israel'], ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'' - February 24, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the boycott, Israeli goods often do make it to Arab markets in boycott countries. The boycott evasion tactic of using a third country as a front to export Israeli goods to the Arab and Muslim world has still been used. In addition, Israeli products are not heavily boycotted in the [[Palestinian territories]] and often make it into the larger Arab world through the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Feiler" /&gt;

===Foreign reactions to the boycott===
The United States adopted two [[anti-boycott]] laws that seek to counteract the participation of U.S. citizens in other nation's economic boycotts or embargoes (although these laws do not restrict the ability to engage in [[disinvestment]] campaigns.) These laws are the 1977 amendments to the [[Export Administration Act]] (EAA) and the [[Ribicoff Amendment]] to the [[Tax Reform Act of 1976]] (TRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bracewell &amp; Giuliani LLP|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/boycotts-and-business-middle-east-reminder-us-anti-boycott-laws|title=Boycotts and Business in the Middle East: A Reminder of U.S. Anti-Boycott Laws |work=The [[National Law Review]] |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiboycott provisions of the [[Export Administration Regulations]] (EAR) apply to all "U.S. persons," defined to include individuals and companies located in the United States and their foreign affiliates, and prohibit them to participate in unsanctioned boycotts against other nations, punishable by fines of up to $50,000 or five times the value of the exports involved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.doc.gov/AntiboycottCompliance/oacrequirements.html#whatsprohibited |publisher=[[U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security]] |title=Office of Antiboycott Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; or jail term of up to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/View?docid=dfhmfk5p_1fh7gbx Impact of U.S. Policy on the Arab League Boycott of Israel] by Adam B. Cordover&lt;/ref&gt;

Conduct that may be penalized under the TRA and/or prohibited under the EAR includes:
*Agreements to refuse or actual refusal to do business with or in Israel or with blacklisted companies.
*Agreements to discriminate or actual discrimination against other persons based on race, religion, sex, national origin or nationality.
*Agreements to furnish or actual furnishing of information about business relationships with or in Israel or with blacklisted companies.
*Agreements to furnish or actual furnishing of information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of another person.

Of all the [[Western countries]], only the [[United Kingdom]] has not passed legislation against the Arab boycott.  Despite this, many companies in Western nations practice some degree of compliance with the boycott.&lt;ref name="Feiler" /&gt;

[[Japan]] was the industrialized nation that complied most with the boycott.  As a result, [[Israel–Japan relations]] have been limited until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Feiler" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8069">The '''Association for Preservation Technology International''' (APT) is a not-for-profit, multidisciplinary, membership organization dedicated to promoting the best technology for conserving and preserving historic structures and their settings. Founded in 1968 by preservationists from Canada and the United States, it now has 1,500 members from 30 countries, with headquarters in Springfield, Illinois. APT’s activities include conferences, training and education programs, and publications on the technical aspects of preservation.

APT members include architects, engineers, conservators, consultants, contractors, craftspeople, curators, administrators, program managers, developers, educators, historians, landscape architects, materials suppliers, students, technicians, and others involved in [[historic preservation]].

==History==
Professionals in the field of historic preservation from Canada and the United States met in Canada in 1968 to form an organization that would promote the exchange of information and ideas pertaining to work on the constructed manifestation of cultural heritage, including not only buildings and landscapes, but also objects and collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Waite |first1=Diana |last2=Shore |first2=Diana |date=1998 |title=Three Decades of Interdisciplinary Preservation Technology: APT Celebrates Its Thirtieth Anniversary |url=http://www.apti.org/clientuploads/pdf/apt-history.pdf |journal=[[APT Bulletin]] |volume=29 |issue=3-4 |pages=H21-H24 |jstor=1504610}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization’s first four aims and objectives, as published in the first ''Newsletter'' in April 1969, were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1969 |title=Aims and Objectives of the A.P.T. |journal=Newsletter of the Association for Preservation Technology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1 |jstor=1493345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#To provide a useful forum to promote the quality of professional practice in the field of historic preservation in Canada and the United States.
#To encourage the research, collection and publication of technical information in all aspects of historic preservation.
#To encourage the training of professionals in preservation and restoration technology.
#To encourage the training of craftsmen in the traditional techniques and skills required for historic preservation.

The founding members were Alice Allison, David Bartlett, Gerald Budner, Jacques Dalibard, Oliver Torrey Fuller, George MacBeath, Pierre Mayrand, Jeanne Minhinnick, Lee Nelson, William Patterson, [[Charles E. Peterson]], Jack Richardson, and Peter John Stokes.

The first president was Charles E. Peterson. Early members, including [[Martin E. Weaver]], the organization’s fifth president,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.apti.org/clientuploads/pdf/About%20APT/APT%20Presidents%201969_2017.pdf |title=APT Presidents |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morgan W. Phillips]], were instrumental in establishing the field of [[architectural conservation]].

==Mission==
APT’s mission is “to advance appropriate traditional and new technologies to care for, protect, and promote the longevity of the built environment and to cultivate the exchange of knowledge throughout the international community.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.apti.org/index.php?submenu=about_apt&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=what_is_apt&amp;category=About+APT&amp;link=what_is_apt |title=What Is APT? |accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
===Events===
The initial impetus of the founders to combine the dissemination of scholarly studies of the history of building with discussions about the application of the philosophy and practice of heritage conservation technology resulted in a conference at the Pine Brook Conference Center in [[Upper Saranac Lake]], New York, in 1969. The APT conference then became an annual event. Since 1975, training courses (now called workshops) were presented in conjunction with the conferences. From their inception, the conferences and training courses have been characterized by exchanges of ideas among practitioners, program managers and policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miller |first=Hugh C. |title=The Association for Preservation Technology: Profile of a North American Conservation Organization |journal= Journal of Architectural Conservation |volume=12 |issue=1 |date=2006 |pages=91-100 |doi= 10.1080/13556207.2006.10784962}}&lt;/ref&gt; APT has also presented training courses, workshops and symposia as stand-alone events, independent of annual conferences.

===Publications===
APT disseminates information through its website, electronic and print publications, and digital archives. The organization’s flagship publication is the ''[[APT Bulletin]],'' a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal published quarterly. The newsletter, the ''Communiqué,'' is published bimonthly and circulated through email.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.apti.org/index.php?submenu=publications&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=COMMUNIQU%C9&amp;category=Publications |title=Communiqué |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APT periodically publishes books in the field of heritage conservation. The most recent publications are the ''Preservation Technology Primer,'' a collection of articles from the ''APT Bulletin,'' and the second edition of ''Introduction to Early American Masonry,'' by Harley J. KcKee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Webb |first=Patrick |date=February 19, 2018 |title=Early American Masonry |url= https://www.traditionalbuilding.com/book-reviews/early-american-masonry |magazine=Traditional Building}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To disseminate information on historic building materials and systems, APT created the [https://archive.org/details/buildingtechnologyheritagelibrary Building Technology Heritage Library] (BTHL), a digital collection of historic building trade catalogs hosted by the [[Internet Archive]]. The collection is growing and had over 9,800 items in September 2018.

===Chapters===
There are 19 local APT chapters, which allow interaction among members throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.apti.org/index.php?submenu=chapters_overview&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=ChaptersOverview&amp;category=Chapters |title=Chapters Overview |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen chapters are in the United States, three are in Canada, with one in Australasia and one in Latin America. Chapters host local events including visits to sites of interest to members, workshops, and symposia.

===Technical Committees===
Development and dissemination of technical information is mainly carried out by technical committees with specific focus areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Koga |first=Dean |title=Emergence of the APT Technical Committees |journal=APT Bulletin |volume=49 |issue=3-4 |date=2018 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical committees are: Preservation Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Crowe |first1=Timothy M. |last2=Morrison |first2=Tom |last3= Dumsick |first3=John |title=Preservation Engineering Technical Committee |journal=APT Bulletin |volume=49 |issue=3-4 |date=2018 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable Preservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gotthelf |first1=Jill H. |last2=Brandt |first2=Mark Thompson |last3=Patrick |first3=Michael |title=Technical Committee on Sustainable Preservation |journal=APT Bulletin |volume=49 |issue=3-4 |date=2018 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Normandin |first1=Kyle |last2=Slaton |first2=Deborah |title=Technical Committee on Modern Heritage |journal=APT Bulletin |volume=49 |issue=3-4 |date=2018 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation, Materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.apti.org/index.php?submenu=Materials&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=Materials&amp;category=Technical_Committees |title=Materials |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Codes.

'''Bacallao''' (or '''Terra do Bacalhau''') was a [[phantom island]] depicted on several early 16th century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[map]]s and nautical charts. The name first appears on a chart in 1508, but there are earlier accounts of Bacalao.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} ''Bacallao'' literally means "[[cod]]" or "[[stockfish]]".

According to [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] in his work ''Saudades da Terra,'' written in the 1570s, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] in 1472 was granted lands in the [[Azores]] by the king of Portugal, because of his discovery of the ''Terras do Bacalhau''. Historians do not consider the work of Frutuoso as very reliable, as it contains a great deal of misinformation.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Shafer, Winius, 1977, pp. 446-449&lt;/ref&gt; But, [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] also wrote about Portuguese voyages of discovery to ''Tierra de los Bacallao''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} There has been speculation that Corte-Real reached [[the Americas]] a couple of decades before Columbus.

Off the northeast tip of Newfoundland's [[Avalon Peninsula]] is an island named [[Baccalieu Island|Baccalao]]. Its European name was originally in the French language.

'''Bacharach''' ({{pronunciation|Bacharach.ogg}}, also known as ''Bacharach am Rhein'') is a town in the [[Mainz-Bingen]] district in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Germany]]. It belongs to the [[Rhein-Nahe|''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Rhein-Nahe]], whose seat is in [[Bingen am Rhein]], although that town is not within its bounds.

The original name ''Baccaracus'' points to [[Celts|Celtic]] beginnings. Above the town looms [[Stahleck Castle]] (''Burg Stahleck''), nowadays a [[youth hostel]].

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies in the [[Rhine Gorge]], 48&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Koblenz]].

=== Constituent communities ===
Bacharach is divided into several ''[[Ortsteil]]e''. The outlying centre of Steeg lies in the Steeg Valley (''Steeger Tal'') off to the side, away from the [[Rhine]]. This glen lies between Medenscheid and Neurath to the south and Henschhausen to the north on the heights.

== History ==
In the early 11th century, Bacharach had its first documentary mention.&lt;ref&gt;Urkunde Nr. 658. In: Friedrich Wilhelm Oediger (Bearb.): ''Die Regesten der Erzbischöfe von Köln im Mittelalter''. Band 1: 313–1099. Hanstein, Bonn 1954–61.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been that as early as the 7th century, the kingly domain passed into Archbishop of Cologne Kunibert’s ownership; pointing to this is a ''Kunibertskapelle'' ([[chapel]]) on the spot where now stands the ''Wernerkapelle''. The ''[[Vogt|Vögte]]'' of the Cologne estate were the [[Elector of the Palatinate]], who over time pushed back Cologne’s influence. Count Palatine already had so much influence that he resided at Stahleck Castle. His successor Konrad von Staufen’s daughter secretly wed at Stahleck Castle a son of the Welfs, who were family foes, leading to Bacharach’s, and indeed the whole County Palatine’s, falling for a short time to [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Henry of Brunswick]]. In 1214 the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbachs]] became Bacharach’s new lords. Together with the ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Unteramt]]'' of Kaub they received here their most important toll and revenue source. In 1314 it was decided to choose [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]] as the German king. Furthermore, Bacharach was the most important transfer point for the wine trade, as barrels were offloaded here from the smaller ships that were needed to get by the ''Binger Loch'' (a [[quartzite]] reef in the Rhine upstream near Bingen) and loaded onto bigger ones. From then on, the wine bore the designation ''Bacharacher''. The timber trade from the [[Hunsrück]] also brought Bacharach importance, and in 1356, Bacharach was granted town rights.
[[File:Tombleson Bacharach Werner.jpg|thumb|left|''Wernerkapelle'' in an engraving by [[William Tombleson]]]]
Widely visible is the ''Wernerkapelle'', a ''Rheinromantik'' landmark of the town, lying on the way up to Stahleck Castle from the town. It is the expanded ''Kunibertkapelle'', and is still an unfinished [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ruin today. Its namesake is [[Werner of Oberwesel]], known in connection with pogroms triggered by his death. According to the Christian [[blood libel]], which was typical of the times, a 16-year-old Werner was murdered on [[Maundy Thursday]] 1287 by members of the local [[Judaism|Jewish]] community, who then used his blood for [[Passover]] observances. On the grounds of this alleged ritual murder, there arose an anti-Semitic mob who waged a [[pogrom]], wiping out Jewish communities in the Middle and Lower Rhine and [[Moselle River|Moselle]] regions. In folk Christianity arose the cult of Werner, which was only stricken from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Bishopric of Trier]] calendar in 1963.

In 1344, building work began on the town wall, and was already finished about 1400. In 1545, the town, along with the Palatinate, became [[Protestantism|Protestant]] under Count Palatine [[Frederick II, Elector Palatine|Friedrich II]]. Stahleck Castle and the town wall could not stop Bacharach from undergoing eight changes in military occupation in the [[Thirty Years' War]], nor the war’s attendant [[Looting|sackings]]. Moreover, further destruction was wrought by several town fires. Then, in 1689, [[France|French]] troops fighting in the [[Nine Years' War]] blew Stahleck Castle and four of the town wall’s towers up.
[[File:Tombleson Bacharach.jpg|thumb|left|Bacharach about 1832 in an engraving by William Tombleson]]
In 1794, [[French Revolution]]ary troops occupied the Rhine’s left bank and in 1802, Bacharach became temporarily French. During the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] the [[Prussia]]n [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Field Marshal Blücher]], after crossing the Rhine near Kaub, came through Bacharach and the Steeg Valley on New Year’s Night 1813-1814 with his troops on the way to France. Recalling this event is a monument stone somewhat downstream, across from Kaub. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], the town went, along with the Rhine’s left bank, up to and including [[Bingerbrück]], to [[Prussia]]. After the harbour silted up, Bacharach fell into a slumber from which it only awoke in the course of the ''Rheinromantik''. Among the first of the prominent visitors at this time was the French writer [[Victor Hugo]].
[[File:Max Liebermann Illustration Der Rabbi von Bacherach.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Max Liebermann]] for [[Heinrich Heine]]'s historical novel ''Der Rabbi von Bacherach'' (The Rabbi of Bacherach'']]
Caring for and maintaining Bacharach’s building monuments, spurred on in the early 20th century by the Rhenish Association for Monument Care and Landscape Preservation (''Rheinischer Verein für Denkmalpflege und Landschaftsschutz'') which took on the then highly endangered town wall and Stahleck Castle ruin jobs, and the great dedication of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to the ''Wernerkapelle'' have seen to it that Bacharach is still a jewel of the ''Rheinromantik'' and a multifaceted documentary site of [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] architecture on the Middle Rhine. The ''Wernerkapelle'' ruin is under monumental protection and before it a plaque has been placed recalling the inhuman crimes against Jewish residents and also containing a quotation from a prayer by [[Pope John XXIII]] for a change in Christians’ thinking in their relationship with the Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“We recognize today that many centuries of blindness have shrouded our eyes, so that we no longer saw the goodliness of Thy Chosen People and no longer recognized our firstborn brother’s traits. We discover now that a mark of Cain stands on our forehead. In the course of the centuries our brother Abel has lain in blood that we spilt, and he has wept tears that we brought forth, because we forgot Thy love. Forgive us the curse that we unrightfully affixed to the Jews’ name. Forgive us for nailing Thee in their flesh for a second time to the Cross. For we knew not what we did........."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today Bacharach thrives on tourism and wine from Bacharach is still enjoying international popularity. Not to be overlooked, however, are problems arising from a shrinking population, itself brought about by a lack of prospects.

=== Amalgamations ===
On 7 June 1969, the formerly self-administering municipality of Steeg was amalgamated with Bacharach.

=== Town partnerships ===

=== Coat of arms ===
The town’s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Per fess at the nombril point sable a lion rampant Or armed, langued and crowned gules, and bendy lozengy argent and azure.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
Bacharach lies on the Rhine’s left bank and can be reached by ''[[Bundesstraße]]'' 9 or the Rhine. Running regularly to and from Bacharach are the excursion ships of the ''Köln-Düsseldorfer-Rheinschiffahrt''&lt;!--Yes, I know. Under the new spelling rules there should be three Fs, but this is a company name, and I guess they chose not to change it.--&gt;, or KD for short.

Transport routes on the other side of the river can be reached by ferry from the ''Engelsburg'' (castle) over to Kaub.

The town belongs to the ''Rhein-Nahe-Nahverkehrsverbund'' – a local transport association. Bacharach lies on the [[West Rhine Railway]] and is served by [[Koblenz]]—[[Boppard]]—'''Bacharach'''—[[Bingen am Rhein]]—[[Mainz]] [[Regionalbahn]] trains (as of July 2004).

==Author==

Bevis Longstreth is a writer of [[historical novels]]. He has written three novels: ''Spindle and Bow'' (2005), ''Return of the Shade'' (2009), and ''Boats Against the Current'' (2016). Spindle and Bow is a story of love and adventure set in the 5th Century BC. The settings span some {{convert|3000|mi|km}}, from the ancient city of Sardis, at the western edge of the Persian Empire in Anatolia to the Scythian village of Pazyryk in the Altai Mountains of southwestern Siberia.  The story answers many mysteries surrounding the [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], a perfectly preserved [[pile carpet]] measuring about six feet square discovered in 1949 in a royal Scythian tomb with a man, a woman and nine horses cut down in the prime of life.  Scholars consider the Pazyryk a masterpiece of weaving technique and artistry dating from the [[Iron Age]], some 400 years before the birth of Christ. It remains today the world’s oldest pile carpet. Longstreth is meticulous in his use of facts about the period and the carpet itself, using the accredited available historical sources. The carpet is now on view in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]].

''Return of the Shade'' is the story of Queen [[Parysatis]] of [[Ancient Persia]].,&lt;ref&gt;http://bevislongstreth.com/author.htm&lt;/ref&gt; a Queen and Queen Mother of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] at its peak of power.  She lived for about 60 years from around 444 to 384 BC, one and a half millennia ago. She was the purist strain of Persian, a direct descendent of [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid]]  dynasty and of the Persian Empire, which lasted 220 years from 550 to 330 BC – a dynasty that brought stability, prosperity and a flourishing civilization to what we now call the Middle East and beyond.  In its day, the largest and most powerful Empire the world had ever seen.  It extended from the Indus River to [[North Africa]], from the Aral Sea to the Persian Gulf, all told one million square miles.The Persian Empire had everything under the sun.  Everything, that is, except a single historian to preserve for posterity its highs and lows.  As seen through the eyes Greek historians, the Persians were weak and effeminate:  a barbaric and despotic foil against which the courage, discipline, democracy, and culture of the Greek civilization could be set.

Longstreth says of Parysatis, "She was a forgotten Queen in a forgotten Empire, dismissed by the Greeks as hopelessly cruel.  By working with the few facts about her that had been recorded by Greek historians such as Plutarch and Ctesias, it was possible -- much as it would be to divine an entire puzzle from a few important pieces -- to fill in the empty spaces with imagined accounts of Parysatis’ life:  a life endowed with great power and the instinct to know how to use it; a life fraught with the drama of the Achaemenids,  a royal line beset with patricides, fratricides and other wicked episodes so typical of the ruling classes at all points of the compass. Here, too, was a chance to illuminate an Empire cast in darkness by Greek writers."

''Boats Against the Current'' charts the struggles of six lives braided together in the Great Depression, with FDR's New Deal and its Works Progress Administration serving as armature for the story. These fictional characters blend with many historical figures, including Hallie Flanagan, head of the WPA's famous Theatre Project, Huey Long, the tyrant from Louisiana, and William Allen White, the editor and owner of ''The Emporia Gazette'' in Kansas.

Longstreth is also the author of ''Modern Investment Management and the [[Prudent Man Rule]]'' (Oxford University Press, 1986), a book seeking to modernize the law governing investment management by fiduciaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1810">The '''Calcutta Theatre''' or The New Playhouse, was an historic theatre in [[Calcutta]] (now named Kolkata) in India, founded in 1775. It was the second theatre in the city of Calcutta. 

The first theatre in Calcutta, The Playhouse, was a modest local at the Lal Bazar, founded in 1756. It was replaced by the Calcutta Theatre, which was founded in 1775.  It was situated near the Northern section of Clive Street and to the north of Writers Buildings, and built funded by the subscriptions sharers of one hundred rupees each. [[David Garrick]] of London recommended a Bernard Massinck or Massing to travel to India to take charge of the theatre.  It became the leading theatre of Calcutta until the foundation of the [[Chowringhee Theatre]], after which the two theatres became main rivals to each other.  The theatre staged English plays in the English language by English actors. Initially , the theatre had an all male cast, with male actors doing the female roles, but after the foundation of the rival Chowringhee Theatre, which employed women, actresses where employed also at the Calcutta Theatre. In 1908, the building and the adjoining site was acquired by Gopi Mohan Tagore, who turned it into the New China Bazar.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5934">'''Carmen Guerrero-Nakpil''' ([[Née|née]] '''Carmen Francisco Guerrero'''; 19 July 1922 – 30 July 2018)&lt;ref name="carmen-death-inq"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] journalist, author, historian and public servant.

== Early life and education ==

Her paternal grandfather was [[León María Guerrero|Leon Maria Guerrero]], who was likewise born in Ermita, Manila. He was the younger brother of Lorenzo Guerrero, the painter and mentor to [[Juan Luna]]. Dr. Jose P. Bantug referred to Leon Ma. Guerrero as the "Father of Philippine Botany", having classified and described hundreds of Filipino medicinal plants.&lt;ref name="E.

Her maternal grandfather was Gabriel Beato Francisco (18 March 1850 – 19 December 1935), Tagalog writer, journalist, novelist, playwright, born in [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampalok]], then a town independent of [[Manila]]. Francisco's contribution to the development of Tagalog literature lies in the novel. Chronologically considered his ''Cababalaghan ni P. Bravo'' might be regarded as the first novel to be published in Tagalog literature. (This fact appears to be unknown to students and historians of Tagalog literature, not mentioned in [[Iñigo Ed. Regalado|Inigo Ed. Regalado]]'s ''Ang Pagkaunlad ng Nobelang Tagalog'' (1939). Secondly, Francisco was responsible for introducing the historical genre in the beginning and early development of the Tagalog novel.&lt;ref name="E. Arsenio Manuel 200"&gt;Dictionary of Philippine Biography, Volume Two, Pages 200-202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Volkstelling 1925 Census.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Census taker visits a [[Romani people|Romani]] family living in a [[mobile home|caravan]], [[Netherlands]] 1925]]
A '''census''' is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording [[information]] about the members of a given [[Statistical population|population]]. The term is used mostly in connection with [[Population and housing censuses by country|national population and housing censuses]]; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The [[United Nations]] defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as "individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (2008). [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/docs/P&amp;R_Rev2.pdf Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses]. Statistical Papers: Series M No. 67/Rev.2. p8. {{ISBN|978-92-1-161505-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/CES_2010_Census_Recommendations_English.pdf |title=CES 2010 Census Recommendations |website=Unece.org |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is of [[latin language|Latin]] origin: during the [[Roman Republic]], the census was a list that kept track of all adult males fit for military service. The modern census is essential to [[international comparisons]] of any kind of statistics, and censuses collect data on many attributes of a population, not just how many people there are. Censuses typically began as the only method of collecting national demographic data, and are now part of a larger system of different surveys. Although population estimates remain an important function of a census, including exactly the geographic distribution of the population, statistics can be produced about combinations of attributes e.g. education by age and sex in different regions. Current administrative data systems allow for other approaches to enumeration with the same level of detail but raise concerns about privacy and the possibility of biasing estimates.&lt;ref name="theforgottenfamily.wordpress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theforgottenfamily.wordpress.com/2017/01/19/history-and-development-of-the-census-in-england-and-wales/ |title=History and Development of the Census in England and Wales |website=theforgottenfamily.wordpress.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A census can be contrasted with [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] in which information is obtained only from a subset of a population; typically main population estimates are updated by such [[intercensal estimate]]s. Modern census data are commonly used for research, business [[marketing]], and planning, and as a baseline for designing sample surveys by providing a sampling frame such as an address register. Census counts are necessary to adjust samples to be representative of a population by weighting them as is common in [[opinion poll]]ing. Similarly, [[stratified sampling|stratification]] requires knowledge of the relative sizes of different population strata which can be derived from census enumerations. In some countries, the census provides the official counts used to apportion the number of elected representatives to regions (sometimes controversially – e.g., ''[[Utah v. Evans]]''). In many cases, a carefully chosen random sample can provide more accurate information than attempts to get a population census.&lt;ref&gt;Salant, Priscilla, and Don A. Dillman. "How to Conduct your own Survey: Leading professional give you proven techniques for getting reliable results." (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling==
A census is often construed as the opposite of a sample as its intent is to count everyone in a population rather than a fraction. However, population censuses rely on a [[sampling frame]] to count the population. This is the only way to be sure that everyone has been included as otherwise those not responding would not be followed up on and individuals could be missed. The fundamental premise of a census is that the population is not known and a new estimate is to be made by the analysis of primary data. 
The use of a sampling frame is counterintuitive as it suggests that the population size is already known. However, a census is also used to collect attribute data on the individuals in the nation. This process of sampling marks the difference between historical census, which was a house to house process or the product of an imperial decree, and the modern statistical project.
The sampling frame used by census is almost always an address register. Thus it is not known if there is anyone resident or how many people there are in each household. Depending on the mode of enumeration, a form is sent to the householder, an enumerator calls, or administrative records for the dwelling are accessed. As a preliminary to the dispatch of forms, census workers will check any address problems on the ground.
While it may seem straightforward to use the postal service file for this purpose, this can be out of date and some dwellings may contain a number of independent households. A particular problem is what are termed 'communal establishments' which category includes student residences, religious orders, homes for the elderly, people in prisons etc. As these are not easily enumerated by a single householder, they are often treated differently and visited by special teams of census workers to ensure they are classified appropriately.

==Residence definitions==
Individuals are normally counted within households and information is typically collected about the household structure and the housing. For this reason international documents refer to censuses of population and housing. Normally the census response is made by a household, indicating details of individuals resident there.
An important aspect of census enumerations is determining which individuals can be counted from which cannot be counted. Broadly, three definitions can be used: ''de facto'' residence; ''de jure'' residence; and, permanent residence. This is important to consider individuals who have multiple or temporary addresses. Every person should be identified uniquely as resident in one place but where they happen to be on [[Census Day]], their [[Home range|''de facto'' residence]], may not be the best place to count them. Where an individual uses services may be more useful and this is at their usual, or ''de jure'', residence. An individual may be represented at a permanent address, perhaps a family home for students or long term migrants.
It is necessary to have a precise definition of residence to decide whether visitors to a country should be included in the population count. This is becoming more important as students travel abroad for education for a period of several years. Other groups causing problems of enumeration are new born babies, refugees, people away on holiday, people moving home around census day, and people without a fixed address.
People having second homes because of working in another part of the country or retaining a holiday cottage are difficult to fix at a particular address sometimes causing double counting or houses being mistakenly identified as vacant. Another problem is where people use a different address at different times e.g. students living at their place of education in term time but returning to a family home during vacations or children whose parents have separated who effectively have two family homes. Census enumeration has always been based on finding people where they live as there is no systematic alternative - any list you could use to find people is derived from census activities in the first place. Recent UN guidelines provide recommendation on enumerating such complex households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/emerging_forms_families_households.html |title=Measurement of emerging forms of families and households |publisher=UNECE |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enumeration strategies==
Historical censuses used crude enumeration assuming absolute accuracy. Modern approaches take into account the problems of [[overcount]] and [[undercount]], and the coherence of census enumerations with other official sources of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb20/KnowledgebaseArticle10408.aspx |title=Census Quality Evaluation: considerations from an international perspective |publisher=Unstats.un.org |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects a realist approach to measurement, acknowledging that under any definition of residence there is a true value of the population but this can never be measured with complete accuracy. An important aspect of the census process is to evaluate the quality of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breiman | first1 = Leo | year = 1994 | title = The 1991 Census Adjustment: Undercount or Bad Data? | url = | journal = [[Statistical Science]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 458–475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries use a post-enumeration survey to adjust the raw census counts.&lt;ref&gt;World Population and Housing Census Programme (2010) [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/handbooks/Manual_PESen.pdf Post Enumeration Surveys: Operational guidelines], United Nations Secretariat, Dept of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division, Tech Report&lt;/ref&gt; This works in a similar manner to [[capture-recapture]] estimation for animal populations. In census circles this method is called dual system enumeration (DSE). A sample of households are visited by interviewers who record the details of the household as at census day. These data are then matched to census records and the number of people missed can be estimated by considering the number missed in the census or survey but counted in the other. This way counts can be adjusted for non-response varying between different [[demographic]] groups. An explanation using a fishing analogy can be found in "Trout, Catfish and Roach..."&lt;ref&gt;Benton, P. [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/census-coverage-survey/trout--catfish-and-roach.pdf Trout, Catfish and Roach: The beginner’s guide to census population estimates], [[Office for National Statistics]], UK&lt;/ref&gt; which won an award from the [[Royal Statistical Society]] for excellence in [[official statistics]] in 2011.
[[File:Enumerator.jpg|thumb|Enumerator conducting a survey using a mobile phone-based questionnaire in rural [[Zimbabwe]].]]
Triple system enumeration has been proposed as an improvement as it would allow evaluation of the statistical dependence of pairs of sources. However, as the matching process is the most difficult aspect of census estimation this has never been implemented for a national enumeration. It would also be difficult to identify three different sources that were sufficiently different to make the triple system effort worthwhile. The DSE approach has another weakness in that it assumes there is no person counted twice (over count). In ''de facto'' residence definitions this would not be a problem but in ''de jure'' definitions individuals risk being recorded on more than one form leading to double counting. A particular problem here are students who often have a term time and family address.

Several countries have used a system which is known as short form/long form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/what-is-a-census/other-methods-of-census-taking/index.html Other methods of census taking], [[Office for National Statistics]], UK&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] strategy which randomly chooses a proportion of people to send a more detailed questionnaire to (the long form). Everyone receives the short form questions. Thereby more data are collected but not imposing a burden on the whole population. This also reduces the burden on the statistical office. Indeed, in the UK all residents were required to fill in the whole form but only a 10% sample were coded and analysed in detail, until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/census-2001/about-census-2001/introduction/index.html |title=Introduction to Census 2001 |publisher=Ons.gov.uk |date=2001-04-29 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; New technology means that all data are now scanned and processed. Recently there has been [[Canada 2011 Census|controversy in Canada]] about the cessation of the long form with the head, [[Munir Sheikh]] resigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.680news.com/radio/680news/article/80353--text-of-munir-sheikh-s-resignation-statement |title=Text of Munir Sheikh's resignation statement |publisher=680News |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219103126/http://www.680news.com/radio/680news/article/80353--text-of-munir-sheikh-s-resignation-statement |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of alternative enumeration strategies is increasing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ined.fr/en/publications/pop_soc/bdd/publication/1506/ |title=[INED&amp;#93; Population and Societies |publisher=Ined.fr |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these are not so simple as many people assume and only occur in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12546-014-9139-z | volume=32 | title=Whither the census? Continuity and change in census methodologies worldwide, 1985–2014 | journal=Journal of Population Research | pages=3–22 | year=2014 | last1 = Kukutai | first1 = Tahu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands has been most advanced in adopting a census using administrative data. This allows a simulated census to be conducted by linking several different administrative databases at an agreed time. Data can be matched and an overall enumeration established accounting for where the different sources are discrepant. A validation survey is still conducted in a similar way to the post enumeration survey employed in a traditional census.
Other countries which have a population register use this as a basis for all the census statistics needed by users. This is most common among Nordic countries but requires a large number of different registers to be combined including population, housing, employment and education. These registers are then combined and brought up to the standard of a statistical register by comparing the data in different sources and ensuring the quality is sufficient for official statistics to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/Register_based_statistics_in_Nordic_countries.pdf |title=Register-based statistics in the Nordic countries |format=PDF|website=Unece.org |year=2007 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A recent innovation is the French instigation of a rolling census programme with different regions enumerated each year such that the whole country is completely enumerated every 5 to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.hk/wsc/STS017-P5-S.pdf|title=The French Rolling Census: a decade of experience|last=Durr|first=Jean-Michel and François Clanché|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, in connection with the 2010 census round, a large number of countries adopted alternative census methodologies, often based on the combination of data from registers, surveys and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/censuses/2010+Population+Census+Round |title=2010 Population Census Round - Confluence |publisher=.unece.org |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Censuses have evolved in their use of technology with the latest censuses, the 2010 round, using many new types of computing. In Brazil, handheld devices were used by enumerators to locate residences on the ground. In many countries, census returns could be made via the Internet as well as in paper form. DSE is facilitated by computer matching techniques which can be automated, such as [[propensity score matching]]. In the UK, all census formats are scanned and stored electronically before being destroyed, replacing the need for physical archives. The record linking to perform an administrative census would not be possible without large databases being stored on computer systems.

New technology is not without problems in its introduction. The US census had intended to use the handheld computers but cost escalated and this was abandoned, with the contract being sold to Brazil. Online response is a good idea but one of the functions of census is to make sure everyone is counted accurately. A system which allowed people to enter their address without verification would be open to abuse. Therefore, households have to be verified on the ground, typically by an enumerator visit or post out. Paper forms are still necessary for those without access to Internet connections. It is also possible that the hidden nature of an administrative census means that users are not engaged with the importance of contributing their data to official statistics.

Alternatively, population estimations may be carried out remotely with [[GIS]] and [[remote sensing]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;

==Census and development==
According to UNFPA, “The information generated by a population and housing census – numbers of people, their distribution, their living conditions and other key data – is critical for development.” &lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/census |title=Census &amp;#124; UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund |website=UNFPA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because this type of data is essential for policymakers so that they know where to invest. Unfortunately, many countries have outdated or inaccurate data about their populations and therefore, without accurate data are unable to address the needs of their population.

UNFPA stated that,&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

“The unique advantage of the census is that it represents the entire statistical universe, down to the smallest geographical units, of a country or region. Planners need this information for all kinds of development work, including: assessing demographic trends; analysing socio-economic conditions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.45.3 | issue=45 | title=Excavations and Watching Brief at the Corner of Wade Street and Little Anne Street, St Jude's, Bristol, 2014 | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Corcos | first1 = Nick }}&lt;/ref&gt; designing evidence-based poverty-reduction strategies; monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of policies; and tracking progress toward national and internationally agreed development goals.”

In addition to making policymakers aware about population issues, it is also an important tool for identifying forms of social, demographic or economic exclusions, such as inequalities relating to race, ethics and religion as well as disadvantaged groups such as those with disabilities and the poor.

An accurate census can empower local communities by providing them with the necessary information to participate in local decision-making and ensuring they are represented.

==Uses of census data==
In the nineteenth century, the first censuses collected paper enumerations that had to be collated by hand so the statistical uses were very basic. The government owned the data and were able to publish statistics themselves on the state of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Kathrin Levitan (auth.), ''A Cultural History of the British Census: Envisioning the Multitude in the Nineteenth Century'', 978-1-349-29824-2, 978-0-230-33760-2 	Palgrave Macmillan US 	2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Uses were to measure changes in the population and apportion representation. Population estimates could be compared to those of other countries.

By the beginning of the twentieth century, censuses were recording households and some indications of their employment. In some countries, census archives are released for public examination after many decades, allowing genealogists to track the ancestry of interested people. Archives provide a substantial historical record which may challenge established notions of tradition. It is also possible to understand the societal history through job titles and arrangements for the destitute and sick.

There are a lot of politics that surround the census in many countries. In Canada in 2010 for example, the government under the leadership of Stephen Harper abolished the mandatory long-form census. The decision to cut the long-form census was a response to protests from some Canadians who resented the personal questions.&lt;ref name="Ditchburn"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jennifer Ditchburn|title=Tories scrap mandatory long-form census|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tories-scrap-mandatory-long-form-census/article4323276/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=September 23, 2017|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-form census was reinstated by the Justin Trudeau government in 2016.

===Census data and research===
As governments assumed responsibility for schooling and welfare, large government [[research]] departments made extensive use of census data. Actuarial estimates could be made to project populations and plan for provision in local government and regions. It was also possible for central government to allocate funding on the basis of census data.
Even into the mid twentieth century, census data was only directly accessible to large government departments. However, computers meant that tabulations could be used directly by university [[research]]ers, large businesses and local government offices. They could use the detail of the data to answer new questions and add to local and specialist knowledge.

Now, census data are published in a wide variety of formats to be accessible to business, all levels of governance, media, students and teachers, charities and any citizen who is interested; researchers in particular have an interest in the role of ''Census Field Officers''  (CFO) and their assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morphy|first1=Frances|title=Agency, Contingency and Census Process: Observations of the 2006 Indigenous Enumeration Strategy in Remote Aboriginal Australia|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ydj3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR8f65tf7NAhWDGpQKHZxtDy0Q6AEINjAE&amp;q=researcher%20census%20field%20officer|publisher=ANU E Press, 2007|accessdate=19 July 2016|quote=One researcher spent time observing... the training of Census  Field Officers (CFO)  and their assistants....}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Data can be represented visually or analysed in complex statistical models, to show the difference between certain areas, or to understand the association between different personal characteristics. Census data offer a unique insight into small areas and small demographic groups which sample data would be unable to capture with precision.

==Privacy==
Although the census provides a useful way of obtaining statistical information about a population, such information can sometimes lead to abuses, political or otherwise, made possible by the linking of individuals' identities to anonymous census data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/census/ |title=The Census and Privacy |website=EPIC.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration is particularly important when individuals' census responses are made available in [[Microdata (statistics)|microdata]] form, but even aggregate-level data can result in privacy breaches when dealing with small areas and/or rare subpopulations.

For instance, when reporting data from a large city, it might be appropriate to give the average income for black males aged between 50 and 60. However, doing this for a town that only has two black males in this age group would be a breach of privacy because either of those persons, knowing his own income and the reported average, could determine the other man's income.

Typically, census data are processed to obscure such individual information. Some agencies do this by intentionally introducing small statistical errors to prevent the identification of individuals in marginal populations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3110129.NSF/f61552cc746715bcca256eb000015277/2878e9589dd56b53ca257153007fe1f5!OpenDocument |title=Managing Confidentiality and Learning about SEIFA |publisher=Abs.gov.au |date=2006-04-18 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; others swap variables for similar respondents. Whatever measures have been taken to reduce the privacy risk in census data, new technology in the form of better electronic analysis of data poses increasing challenges to the protection of sensitive individual information. This is known as [[Statistical Disclosure Control|statistical disclosure control]].

Another possibility is to present survey results by means of statistical models in the form of a multivariate distribution mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jos.nu/Articles/abstract.asp?article=264673 |title=Statistical Model of the 2001 Czech Census for Interactive Presentation |vauthors=Grim J, Hora J, Somol P, Boček P, Pudil, P |year=2010 |work=Journal of Official Statistics, vol. 26, no. 4 |pages=673–694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statistical information in the form of [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional distributions]] ([[histogram]]s) can be derived interactively from the estimated [[Mixture distribution|mixture model]] without any further access to the original database. As the final product does not contain any protected microdata, the  model based interactive software can be distributed without any confidentiality concerns.

Another method is simply to release no data at all, except very large scale data directly to the central government. Different release strategies between government have led to an international project ([[IPUMS]]) to co-ordinate access to microdata and corresponding metadata. Such projects also promote standardising metadata by projects such as [[SDMX]] so that best use can be made of the minimal data available.

==Historical censuses==

===Egypt===
[[Census in Egypt|Censuses in Egypt]] first appear in the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and develops in the [[New Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Valbelle. "Les recensements dans l'Egypte pharaonique des troisième et deuxième millénaires" CRIPEL 9 (1987)  37 - 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amasis I|Pharaoh Amasis]], according to [[Herodotus]], require every Egyptian to declare annually to the [[nomarch]], "whence he gained his living".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Histories II, 177, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ptolemies]] and the [[Roman Egypt|Romans]] several censuses were conducted in Egypt by governments officials &lt;ref&gt;Paul Cartledge,Peter Garnsey,Erich S. Gruen Hellenistic Constructs: Essays in Culture, History, and Historiography  242 ss.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
There are several accounts of ancient Greek city states carrying out censuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=

===Israel===
Censuses are mentioned in the [[Bible]]. God commands a [[Tax per head|per capita tax]] to be paid with the census in {{bibleref|Exodus|30:11-16}} for the upkeep of the [[Tabernacle]]. The [[Book of Numbers]] is named after the counting of the Israelite population (in {{bibleref|Numbers|1-4}}) according to the house of the Fathers after the exodus from Egypt. A second census was taken while the Israelites were camped in the plains of [[Moab]], in {{bibleref|Numbers|26}}.

King [[David]] performed a census that produced disastrous results (in {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|21}}). His son, King [[Solomon]], had all of the foreigners in Israel counted in {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|2:17}}.

When the Romans took over Judea in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}6, the legate Publius Sulpicius Quirinius organised a [[Census of Quirinius|census]] for tax purposes. The [[Gospel of Luke]] links the birth of [[Jesus]] to this event. {{bibleref|Luke|2}}.

===India===
The oldest recorded census in India is thought to have occurred around 300{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} during the reign of The Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]] under the leadership of  [[Kautilya]] or Chanakya and [[Ashoka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Data_Products/Library/Indian_perceptive_link/History_link/censushistory.htm| title=Census Commissioner of India - Historical Background | publisher=Govt. of India| quote=The records of census conducted appears from 300 BC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
{{see also|Roman censor|Indiction}}

The word "census" originated in [[ancient Rome]] from the [[Latin]] word ''{{linktext|censere}}'' ("to estimate"). The census played a crucial role in the administration of the Roman Empire, as it was used to determine taxes. With few interruptions, it was usually carried out every five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Scheidel|Scheidel, Walter]] (2009) ''Rome and China: comparative perspectives on ancient world empires''. Oxford University Press, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It provided a register of citizens and their property from which their duties and privileges could be listed. It is said to have been instituted by the Roman king [[Servius Tullius]] in the {{nowrap|6th century {{sc|bc}},&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.42&lt;/ref&gt;}} at which time the number of arms-bearing citizens was supposedly counted at around 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.42, citing [[Fabius Pictor]]&lt;/ref&gt; The 6{{nbsp}}{{sc|ad}} "[[census of Quirinius]]" undertaken following the imposition of direct Roman rule in [[Roman Judea|Judea]] was partially responsible for the development of the [[Zealot]] movement and several failed rebellions against Rome that ended in the [[Jewish Diaspora|Diaspora]]. The 15-year [[indiction]] cycle established by [[Diocletian]] in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}297 was based on quindecennial censuses and formed the basis for dating in late antiquity and under the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Empire]].

===Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Caliphate]] began conducting regular censuses soon after its formation, beginning with the one ordered by the second [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] [[caliph]], [[Umar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Population Census and Land Surveys under the Umayyads (41–132/661–750)|first=Wadād|last=al-Qādī1|journal=Der Islam|volume=83|issue=2|pages=341–416|doi=10.1515/ISLAM.2006.015|date=July 2008|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
The [[Domesday Book]] was undertaken in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}1086 by [[William I of England]] so that he could properly tax the land he had recently conquered in medieval Europe. In 1183, a census was taken of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], to ascertain the number of men and amount of money that could possibly be raised against an invasion by [[Saladin]], sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].

===Inca Empire===
In the 15th century, the [[Inca Empire]] had a unique way to record census information. The Incas did not have any written language but recorded information collected during censuses and other numeric information as well as non-numeric data on [[quipus]], strings from [[llama]] or [[alpaca]] hair or cotton cords with numeric and other values encoded by knots in a [[base-10]] positional system.

===Spanish Empire===
On May 25, 1577, [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]] ordered by royal cédula the preparation of a general description of Spain's holdings in the Indies. Instructions and a questionnaire, issued in 1577 by the Office of the Cronista Mayor, were distributed to local officials in the Viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru to direct the gathering of information. The questionnaire, composed of fifty items, was designed to elicit basic information about the nature of the land and the life of its peoples. The replies, known as "{{lang|es|relaciones geográficas}}," were written between 1579 and 1585 and were returned to the Cronista Mayor in Spain by the Council of the Indies.

== World population estimates ==
The earliest estimate of the world population was made by [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] in 1661; the next by [[Johann Peter Süssmilch]] in 1741, revised in 1762; the third by [[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Dieterici]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willcox|first=Walter|date=1931|title=International Migrations, Volume II: Interpretations|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c5103.pdf|journal=NBER|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Walter Willcox published a table in his book, ''International Migrations: Volume II Interpretations'', that estimated the 1929 world population to be roughly 1.8 billion.

'''Dejan Medaković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Дејан Медаковић}}; 7 July 1922 – 1 July 2008) was a [[Serbia]]n art historian, writer and academician. Medaković had served as President of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] from 1998 to 2003, as Dean of the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]] (1971–1973), and was a member of the [[Matica srpska]] as well as other scholarly associations.

==Life==
Dejan Medaković was born on 7 July 1922 in [[Zagreb]] (then the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (now [[Croatia]]) in an old and distinguished [[Serbs|ethnic Serb]] family. His father, Đorđe Medaković, was an economist; his mother, Anastazija, a housewife. His paternal grandfather, [[Bogdan Medaković]], had been a political leader of [[Serbs in Croatia]] during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian reign]], president of the [[Serb Independent Party]] and president of the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]], and Speaker of the Croatian [[Croatian Parliament|Sabor]] from 1908 to 1918. Dejan Medaković's great-grandfather Danilo had lived in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and held various positions in the administrations of princes [[Miloš Obrenović|Miloš]] and [[Mihailo Obrenović]]. On his mother's side he was a descendant of Austrian military nobility.

Medaković finished his lower gymnasium education on the island of [[Badija]] near [[Korčula]] on the southern Adriatic coast, before moving to [[Sremski Karlovci]], where he finished his higher gymnasium studies. During the [[Second World War]] he lived in [[Belgrade]] as a refugee. From 1942 to 1946 he worked as a volunteer-assistant in [[Prince Pavle]]'s Museum in Belgrade (today the [[National Museum of Serbia]]). He graduated in 1949 and later got his doctorate in 1954 at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]], in the Art History Department.

He became a member of the faculty at the [[University of Belgrade]] in 1954, where he would remain until his retirement in 1982. Between 1971 and 1973 he was also the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy. He was elected as a corresponding member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) in 1972 and was promoted to a full member in 1981. He was also a member of the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in based in [[Salzburg]], the Austrian Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies (ÖGE 18), the [[Leibniz Society]] in Berlin, member of the [[Matica srpska]] Council in [[Novi Sad]], and the president of the [[Vuk Karadžić Foundation]] Assembly.

He held various positions at SANU: he was the Secretary of the Department for Historical Sciences (1981–85), the Secretary General of the Academy (1985–94), and in 1999 Medaković was elected President of SANU, a post which he held until 2003. At Matica srpska he was in charge of the Department of Art History. He edited the ''Fine Arts Digest of Matica srpska'' journal ({{lang-sr|Zbornik za likovne umetnosti Matice srpske}}). His research interests included a wide scope of topics in art history and art criticism, from Serbian [[medieval art]] to [[modern painting]], but his main fields of expertise were Serbian [[Baroque painting]] and general cultural circumstances of the 18th century, as well as Serbian art of the 19th century.

Medaković was also a writer and a poet. He published many studies, essays, monographs, reviews and articles on various topics ranging from new developments in arts to current social and political issues. His studies have been collected and published in several books: ''Serbian Painters of the 18th Century'' (1968), ''The Paths of Serbian Baroque'', ''Testimonials'' (1984), ''Explorers of Serbian Antiquity'' (1985), and ''Baroque and Serbs'' (1988). He was also a major contributor to the six-volume ''History of the Serb People'' (1981–1993), and other important publications such as ''Serbian Art of the 18th Century'' (1980), and ''Serbian Art of the 19th Century'' (1981).

In addition, he authored several important art monographs and studies dealing with cultural heritage of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], writing about the monasteries of [[Hilandar]] and [[Savina Monastery, Montenegro|Savina]]. Other important works by Medaković include ''The Chronicles of Serbs in Trieste'' (1987), ''Serbs in Vienna'', ''Serbs in Zagreb'', ''Images of Belgrade in Old Etchings'', ''Selected Serbian themes'', and ''Letters''. Medaković also penned five books of poetry, and an autobiographical prose cycle titled ''Ephemeris''.

Medaković was the recipient of many distinguished awards and honours: the [[Herder Prize]]; the Anton Gindely Prize; the City of Belgrade October Award; the Prosveta Annual Award; the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Bundesverdienstkreuz''); the [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art|Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Arts]]; the Gold Medal of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, the Medal of Vuk Karadžić of the First Order, and many others.

He died from cancer on 1 July 2008, at the Oncological Institute of Belgrade Hospital.

'''Dugald Stewart''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]]}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dj|uː|g|əl|d}}; 22 November 1753{{snd}}11 June 1828) was a Scottish philosopher and mathematician.  He is best known for popularizing the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and his lectures at the [[University of Edinburgh]] were widely disseminated by his many influential students. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. In most contemporary documents he is referred to as Prof '''Dougal Stewart'''.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directories 1800 to 1828 etc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was the son of [[Matthew Stewart (mathematician)|Matthew Stewart]] (1715–1785), professor of mathematics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1747–1772), and was born in his father's quarters at [[Old College, University of Edinburgh|Old College]]. His mother was Marjory Stewart, his father's cousin.

He was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|High School]] and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied mathematics and [[moral philosophy]] under [[Adam Ferguson]]. In 1771, in the hope of gaining a [[Snell Exhibition]] Scholarship and proceeding to [[university of Oxford|Oxford]] to study for the English Church, he went to the [[University of Glasgow]] to attend the classes of [[Thomas Reid]]. To Reid he later owed his theory of [[morality]]. In [[Glasgow]], Stewart boarded in the same house as [[Archibald Alison (Scottish author)|Archibald Alison]], author of the ''Essay on Taste'', and a lasting friendship sprang up between them.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Stewart, Dugald|volume=25|pages=913-914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a single session in [[Glasgow University]], at the age of nineteen, Dugald was asked by his father, whose health was beginning to fail, to give his mathematical classes in the University of Edinburgh. After three years there, in 1775, Dugald was elected joint professor of mathematics in conjunction with his father. Three years later Ferguson was appointed secretary to the commissioners sent out to the [[13 colonies|American colonies]], and at his request Stewart lectured as his substitute during the session 1778–1779, delivering an original course of lectures on morals.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In his early years he was influenced by [[Lord Monboddo]], with whom he corresponded.

==Professor at Edinburgh==
In 1785 Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the chair of [[moral philosophy]], which he filled for twenty-five years, making it a centre of intellectual and moral influence. Young men were attracted by his reputation from England, Europe and America. Stewart's course on moral philosophy embraced, besides ethics proper, lectures on [[political philosophy]] or the theory of government.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Stewart spent the summers of 1788 and 1789 in France, where he met [[Jean Baptiste Antoine Suard|Suard]], [[Degérando]], and [[Guillaume Thomas François Raynal|Raynal]], and came to sympathise with the revolutionary movement.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; His political teaching, after the [[French Revolution]], drew suspicion on him.

From 1800 to 1801, Stewart gave lectures to undergraduate students on the subject of [[political economy]], the first person to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/economics/about-us/history/early-years The early years] at [[University of Edinburgh School of Economics]]'s official website. Accessed 24 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800 he appears as "Dougald Stewart, professor of moral philosophy" living at Lothian House near the bottom of the [[Canongate]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1800&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

[[File:The tomb of Dugald Stewart, Canongate Kirkyard.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Dugald Stewart, Canongate Kirkyard]]
In 1806 Stewart received in lieu of a pension the nominal office of the writership of the ''Edinburgh Gazette'', with a salary of £300. When he ceased lecturing during the session of 1809–1810, his place was taken, at his own request, by [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], who in 1810 was appointed conjoint professor. On the death of Brown in 1820 Stewart retired altogether from the professorship. His successor was [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]], known as "Christopher North".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

From 1809 onwards Stewart lived mainly at [[Kinneil House]], Bo'ness, which was placed at his disposal by the [[Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In June 1814 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=3&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27stewart%27%29|title= Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1817.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822 he was struck with [[paralysis]], but recovered a fair degree of health, sufficient to enable him to resume his studies. He died in Edinburgh on 11 June 1828, where he was buried in [[Canongate Churchyard]], close to his Edinburgh residence. He is buried in an enclosed vault in the lower section, on its west side.

==Memorials==

In 1831, and of great public note, a [[Dugald Stewart Monument|monument]] was erected by the city on [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; This is to a design by [[William Henry Playfair]] and holds a commanding position in the city skyline, forming one of the city's iconic landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, Mcwilliam and Walker&lt;/ref&gt;

His memory is also honoured by the "Dugald Stewart Building" (erected 2011) for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to house its Philosophy Department, on Charles Street, off [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]].

==Works==
Stewart as a student in Glasgow wrote an essay on ''Dreaming''. In 1792 he published the first volume of the ''Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind''; the second volume appeared in 1814, the third not till 1827. In 1793 he printed a textbook, ''Outlines of Moral Philosophy'', which went through many editions; and in the same year he read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh his ''Account of the Life and Writings of [[Adam Smith]]''. Similar memoirs of Robertson the historian and of Reid were afterwards read before the same body and appear in his published works.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1805 Stewart published pamphlets defending [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] against the charges of unorthodoxy made by the presbytery of Edinburgh. In 1810 appeared the ''Philosophical Essays'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Philosophical Essays'' by Dugald Stewart|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=October 1811|volume=6|pages=1–37|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c031993806;view=1up;seq=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1814 the second volume of the ''Elements'', in 1811 the first part and in 1821 the second part of the "Dissertation" written for the ''Encyclopædia Britannica Supplement'', entitled "A General View of the Progress of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy since the Revival of Letters." In 1827 he published the third volume of the ''Elements'', and in 1828, a few weeks before his death, ''The Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Stewart's works were edited in 11 vols. (1854–1858) by [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] and completed with a memoir by [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Influence==
Among Stewart's pupils were [[Lord Palmerston]], [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], [[Francis Jeffrey]], [[Henry Thomas Cockburn]], [[Francis Horner]], [[Sydney Smith]], [[John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|John William Ward]], [[Henry Peter Brougham|Lord Brougham]], [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Dr. Thomas Brown]], [[James Mill]], [[James Mackintosh|Sir James Mackintosh]] and [[Archibald Alison (author)|Sir Archibald Alison]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His reputation rested as much on his eloquence, populism, and style as on original work.&lt;ref name="scottishphilosophy.org"&gt;http://www.scottishphilosophy.org/dugaldstewart.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was principally responsible for making the "Scottish philosophy" predominant in early 19th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="scottishphilosophy.org"/&gt; In the second half of the century, Stewart's reputation fell to that of a follower of the work of Thomas Reid.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Stewart upheld Reid's psychological method and expounded the [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]],&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Scottish Philosophy of Common Sense'', ed. by G. A. Johnston (1915), essays by Thomas Reid, [[Adam Ferguson]], James Beattie, and Dugald Stewart ([http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2044&amp;Itemid=28 online version]).&lt;/ref&gt; which was attacked by [[James Mill]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Part of his originality lay in his incorporation of elements of moderate [[empiricism]] and the French ideologists [[Pierre Laromiguière|Laromiguière]], [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] and [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy|Destutt de Tracy]]. He opposed the argument of [[ontology]], and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]]'s sensationalism. [[Immanuel Kant]], he said, he could not understand.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Friday (2005): Dugald Stewart on Reid, Kant and the Refutation of Idealism, British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 13:2, 263–286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1783 Stewart married Helen Bannatyne (a distant cousin)&lt;ref&gt;http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Stewart.html&lt;/ref&gt;, who died in 1787, leaving him an only son, [[Matthew Stewart (soldier)|Matthew Stewart]] [[FRSE]] (1784-1851). In 1790 he married [[Helen D'Arcy Cranstoun]], sister of [[George Cranstoun, Lord Corehouse|George Cranstoun]].  His second wife was well-born and accomplished, and he was in the habit of submitting to her criticism whatever he wrote. They had a son and a daughter. The son's death in 1809 brought about his retirement from the active duties of his chair.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His sister, Janet Stewart, married Rev Thomas Miller of [[Cumnock]], and they were parents to Dr Patrick Miller [[FRSE]] (1782-1871).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rse.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fame in the 20th Century''''' is a 1993 [[BBC]] documentary television series and book by [[Clive James]]. The book and series examined the phenomenon of [[celebrity|fame]] and how it expanded to international mass media proportions throughout the 20th century. The 8 episodes were divided in roughly 8 decades, from the 1900s to the 1980s. Each episode highlighted world-famous people during that part of the century. James delivered interesting and amusing comments about the portrayed celebrities and the various ways they became famous.

In the United States, the series were broadcast on [[PBS]], though some footage was occasionally cut if the rights to it were too expensive. The series has never been repeated on television since, which James attributes to the fact that ''"every inch of footage in the gigantic compilation belonged to some agency legally equipped to charge the Earth."'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivejames.com/books/fame&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
James and his team developed the series as a study on the concept fame, and more specifically "world fame". They focused on over 250 people who are "undeniably world famous". Certain artists, musicians or sports figures became well known even for people who don't know much about their field. [[Louis Armstrong]] is for instance world-famous, even for non-[[jazz]] fans or experts. [[Pelé]] became the most famous [[association football]] player, even in the US: one of the few countries in the world where the sport isn't popular. People who know nothing about art have heard of the name [[Pablo Picasso]] and know his style. People who are not interested in tennis have heard of [[John McEnroe]], due to his bad behavior on the tennis court. More people know [[Luciano Pavarotti]] than [[Plácido Domingo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivejames.com/books/fame/intro&lt;/ref&gt;

Clive James focused on fame in the 20th century, because the arrival of mass media, film and television changed forever the ways people became famous. In previous centuries people could only become famous by doing something that was remembered ages later. [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] conquered countries, [[Jesus Christ]] developed a religion,&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="clivejames.com"&gt;http://www.clivejames.com/books/fame/prelude&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century people could become world-famous in less than no time and without doing anything, thanks to the arrival of mass media. Movie stars like [[Charlie Chaplin]], for instance, became global stars due to the nearly universal reach of film. James cites Chaplin as the first truly world-famous 20th century celebrity. The invention of the film close-up made people on film screens appear larger than life and thus increased the emotional involvement of the audience.&lt;ref name="clivejames1"/&gt; This often led to [[mass hysteria]] and confusion between an actor's stage persona and the roles he played on the screen (as in the case of [[Rudolph Valentino]]).&lt;ref name="clivejames1"/&gt; Certain politicians in the century have used the media to promote their own image to the public, for instance [[John F. Kennedy]], who looked like a movie star, and [[Ronald Reagan]] who was a former movie star.

People could become world-famous in a matter of a few days. [[Orson Welles]] became notorious after his radio play ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' caused mass hysteria in the United States. [[Salman Rushdie]], who was already known in literary circles, became a household name to the broader public due to the [[fatwa]] spoken out against him in 1989. Clive James sees the US as the place where this new type of mass media fame was born. According to him international fame is only possible if the celebrity becomes famous in the USA. Cricketer [[Jack Hobbs]] was world-famous throughout the [[British Empire]] in the interbellum, but unknown in countries where cricket was not popular, like the USA. [[Babe Ruth]] however became internationally famous even though baseball was played hardly anywhere else outside the US.&lt;ref name="clivejames2"/&gt;

Other celebrities have been around for so long that the reason they originally became famous has been almost forgotten. [[Elizabeth Taylor]] has been cited by James as an example of someone who originally achieved fame as an actress, but later became more famous for her weddings and lifestyle.&lt;ref name="clivejames.com"/&gt; As James observed, the fame of some celebrities fades away after a few years. Silent movie stars like [[Florence Lawrence]] and [[William S. Hart]], for instance, have nowadays sunk into obscurity. Other celebrities have become more famous over time. James cites [[T.E. Lawrence]] as an example. The British military officer became famous during [[World War One]], but only became truly world-famous with the general public thanks to the 1962 movie ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]].'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivejames.com/books/fame/chapter1&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[The Beatles]] on the other hand, have never remained out of [[publicity]] and are nowadays famous for simply being who they are. Some people became famous due to their association with other celebrities. Examples are [[Yoko Ono]] (the wife of [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[John Lennon]]), [[Lady Diana]] (who married [[Prince Charles]] in 1981) and [[Wallis Simpson]] (whose affair with King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]] caused his abdication). Another phenomenon examined in the series is the change of someone's fame during time and thanks to mass media coverage. [[Charles Lindbergh]], first famous as an aviation pioneer, became, to his horror, even more famous when his son was kidnapped and murdered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivejames.com/books/fame/chapter2&lt;/ref&gt;[[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s fame as a general in World War II helped him win the presidential election a decade later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.clivejames.com/books/fame/chapter5&lt;/ref&gt;[[Joseph McCarthy]] used the media in his hunt against communism, but in the end the media worked against him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Elvis Presley]]'s fame grew to legendary proportions after his death, when he sold more albums than during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivejames.com/books/fame/chapter7&lt;/ref&gt;

When Clive James was asked by [[Charlie Rose]] in 1993 to name the three most famous people of the century, he cited [[Elvis Presley]], [[Muhammad Ali|Mohammed Ali]], and [[Bruce Lee]]. He also mentioned [[Adolf Hitler]], saying, "but the fact is the young Neo-Nazis in Germany now don't really know much about Hitler. So that kind of fame not necessarily lasts."

==Famous moments==
The television series made use of seldom seen archive material and world-famous photographs, film and audio material where celebrities did or said famous things. Sometimes the footage wasn't that famous, but was used as a typical example of what the public associates with the celebrity or to show them during a more casual moment, instead of as an icon. Examples are:

The '''Fauba Archaeological Site''' is a prehistoric stoneworks on a mountain ridge on [[Tol (island)|Tol Island]] in [[Chuuk State]] of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].  The site consists of an area enclosed by a stone wall that is roughly triangular in shape.  The wall is between 1 and 1.5 meters in height, and is about 1 meter thick.  The enclosed area includes a number of stone platforms, and there is a refuse midden outside the enclosure that is believed to be associated with the site.  The exact purpose of the site is a subject of debate: although its siting has obvious military benefits (including commanding views of [[Chuuk Lagoon]] and other islands of the atoll, it is not clear that it actually saw military activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Place to Look Up To: A Review of Chuukese Hilltop Enclosures|last=Rainbird|first=Paul|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|issue=Volume 105, No. 4|date=December 1996|jstor=20706683|pages=461–478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was listed on the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978,&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; when the region was part of the US-administered [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2483">'''Ferdinando Castagnoli''' (born in [[Prato]] June 18, 1917; died in [[Marina di Pietrasanta]] July 28, 1988) was a Roman topographer who taught at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ferdinando-castagnoli_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Castagnoli's fieldwork accomplishments was the amazing discovery of the Latin sanctuary at [[Lavinium]] (modern [[Pratica di Mare]]) and its series of 13 altars, a find that was revealed to the world in 1959.  Also at the site is the so-called [[heroon]] of [[Aeneas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, Paul. "2,500-Year-Old Altars Found Near Rome; Believed to Be Part of Lost Sanctuary of Lavinium ITALY UNEARTHS ANCIENT ALTARS." The New York Times May 13, 1959. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Castagnoli was a student of [[Giuseppe Lugli]].  Among his students was [[Adriano La Regina]], a former archaeological superintendent of Rome.

He was a member of [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]].

'''Follins Pond''' is a [[brackish water|brackish]] [[lake]] located on [[Cape Cod]], separating the towns of [[Dennis, Massachusetts]], and [[Yarmouth, Massachusetts]].  The lake is connected to [[Nantucket Sound]] via the [[Bass River (Massachusetts)|Bass River]].

==Connection to Vinland==
Follins Pond is noteworthy primarily because there has been an attempt to connect it to the semi-legendary lost [[Viking|Norse]] [[colony]] of [[Vinland]].
In the 1950s, [[Frederick J. Pohl]] investigated Follins Pond and claimed that he had located shore rocks along the pond into which were drilled holes that strongly resembled Norse mooring stones. The Norse were known to drill holes into which iron pins were inserted for the purpose of mooring their ''[[knaar|knarrer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=  http://wickedyankee.blogspot.com/2012/05/leif-ericson-and-follins-pond-yamouth.html

|publisher=   Wicked Yankee       
|date=  May 24, 2012
|accessdate= January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Pohl claimed that he had uncovered the tops of posts about a foot underground, arranged in a pattern that might have been that of either a Norse [[shipyard]] or [[drydock]]. Further, at about the same time a claimed "Viking horse bone" may have been unearthed at Follins Pond.  Pohl was of the opinion that at least a few horses were brought from [[Greenland]] by the Norse on their further voyages of exploration. Pohl published a book entitled ''The lost discovery: Uncovering the track of the Vikings in America'' (New York: Norton. 1952) which detailed this claim.  It is not taken seriously by professional historians, as the evidence presented is rather scant and no archaeological finds of any significance have been made in the area since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Local notoriety===
Some of the road names around Follins Pond seem to reflect this theory. A ''Norsemans Beach Road'' can be found on the eastern shore of the lake, a ''Norse Road'' on the north shore of the lake, and a ''Valhalla Drive'' and ''Erik's Path'' close to the south shore.
Additionally, along the shore of a smaller body of water known as '''Kelleys Bay''' joined to Follins Pond by the [[Bass River (Massachusetts)|Bass River]] can be found ''[[Vinland]] Drive'', ''[[Skerry]] Road'', ''Saga Road'', ''[[Fjord|Fiord]] Drive'', ''[[Freydis]] Drive'', and ''[[Leif Ericsson|Lief Ericson]] Drive (sic)''.
Further south, along the shores of the Bass River, can be found ''Lief's Lane'', ''Legend Drive'', ''Old Saga Drive'', ''Rune Stone Road'', ''Viking Rock Road'', ''Keel Cape Drive'', ''Erickson Way'', and ''Mooring Lane''.

In addition, articles about the purported past of Follins Pond occasionally turn up in the ''[http://www.capecodtimes.com Cape Cod Times]'' and other local newspapers.

The [[genetic history]] of   [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] (also named '''Amerindians''' or '''Amerinds''' in physical anthropology) is divided into two sharply distinct episodes: 
the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|initial peopling of the Americas]] during about 20,000 to 14,000 years ago (20&amp;ndash;14 kya), and [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]], after about 500 years ago.&lt;ref name=Genebase/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |title=Prebiotic chemistry and the origin of the RNA world |journal=[[Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=99–123 | url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~pschoff/documents/OrgelRNAWorld.pdf |pmid=15217990 |doi=10.1080/10409230490460765 |year=2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.537.7679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the determinant factor for the number of genetic lineages, [[zygosity]] mutations and founding [[haplotype]]s present in today's [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Amerindian populations]].&lt;ref name="KleinmanMoore2014"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kim |last=Tallbear |chapter=The Emergence, Politics, and Marketplace of Native American DNA  |editor-first1=Daniel Lee |editor-last1=Kleinman |editor-first2=Kelly |editor-last2=Moore |title=Routledge Handbook of Science, Technology, and Society |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqDAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23 |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-23716-4 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Amerindians groups are derived from a basal '''Ancestral lineage''', which formed in [[Siberia]] prior to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], between about 36,000 and 25,000 years ago, from a combination of  [[Proto-Mongoloid]]  and [[Ancient North Eurasian]] ancestry and which dispersed throughout the Americas after about 16,000 years ago (an exception are the [[Na Dene]] and [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] speaking groups, which are partially derived from Siberian populations which entered the Americas at a later time).&lt;ref name="Moreno-Mayar2018"&gt;{{Citation| title = Terminal Pleistocene Alaskan genome reveals first founding population of Native Americans | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25173 | journal  = Nature | volume = 553 | issue = 7687 | pages = 203–207 | accessdate = January 3, 2018 | doi = 10.1038/nature25173 | pmid = 29323294 | year = 2018 | last1 = Moreno-Mayar | first1 = J.

Moreno-Mayar et al. (2018) have identified a basal '''Ancestral Native American''' (ANA) lineage.
This lineage formed by admixture of early [[East Asians|East Asian]] and [[Ancient North Eurasian]] lineages prior to the 
[[Last Glacial Maximum]], ca. 36&amp;ndash;25 kya. Basal ANA diverged into an "[[Ancient Beringian]]" (AB) lineage at ca. 20 kya. 
The non-AB lineage further diverged into  "Northern Native American" (NNA) and "Southern Native American" (SNA) lineages between about 17.5 and 14.6 kya. Most pre-Columbian lineages are derived from NNA and SNA, except for the American Arctic, where there is evidence of later (after 10kya) admixture from [[Paleo-Siberian]] lineages.&lt;ref name="Moreno-Mayar2018"/&gt;

Most of it is traced back to a single ancestral population, called 'First Americans'. However, those who speak [[Inuit languages]] from the [[Arctic]] inherited almost half of their ancestry from a second East Asian migrant wave. And those who speak [[Na-dene]], on the other hand, inherited a tenth of their ancestry from a third migrant wave. The initial settling of the Americas was followed by a rapid expansion southwards, by the coast, with little gene flow later, especially in [[South America]]. One exception to this are the [[Chibcha]] speakers, whose ancestry comes from both North and South America.

Another study, also focused on the mtDNA (that which is inherited through only the maternal line),&lt;ref name=Tammetal/&gt; revealed that the indigenous people of the Americas have their maternal ancestry traced back to a few founding lineages from East Asia, which would have arrived via the [[Bering strait]]. According to this study, it is probable that the ancestors of the Native Americans would have remained for a time in the region of the [[Bering Strait]], after which there would have been a rapid movement of settling of the Americas, taking the founding lineages to [[South America]].

According to a 2016 study, focused on mtDNA lineages, "a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka, following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for ~2.4 to 9 thousand years after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a marked phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages".&lt;ref name="LlamasFehren-Schmitz2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Llamas|first1=B.|last2=Fehren-Schmitz|first2=L.|last3=Valverde|first3=G.|last4=Soubrier|first4=J.|last5=Mallick|first5=S.|last6=Rohland|first6=N.|last7=Nordenfelt|first7=S.|last8=Valdiosera|first8=C.|last9=Richards|first9=S.

There is  genetic evidence for an early wave of migration to the Americas.
It is uncertain whether this "Paleoamerican" (also "Paleoamerind", not to confused with the term 
[[Paleo-Indian]] used of the early phase of Amerinds proper)  migration took place in the early Holocene, thus only shortly predating the main Amerind peopling of the Americas, or whether it may have reached the Americas substantially earlier, before the Last Glacial Maximum.&lt;ref&gt;González-José, R. et al., "Craniometric evidence for Palaeoamerican survival in Baja California", ''Nature'' vol. 425 (2003),  62–65.&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic evidence for "Paleoamerinds" consists of the presence of apparent admixture of archaic [[Sundadont]] lineages to the remote populations in the South American rain forest, and in the genetics and cranial morphology of [[Fuegians|Patagonians-Fuegians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fuegian and Patagonian Genetics and the settling of the Americas |first=George |last=Weber |url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter54/text-Fuego/Genetics/text-FuegianGenetics.htm |publisher=Andaman Association |year=2007 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505072339/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter54/text-Fuego/Genetics/text-FuegianGenetics.htm |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=García-Bour J, Pérez-Pérez A, Alvarez S, etal |title=Early population differentiation in extinct aborigines from Tierra del Fuego-Patagonia: ancient mtDNA sequences and Y-chromosome STR characterization |journal=Am.

Evidence of  people from [[Australia]] and [[Melanesia]] admixture in Amazonian populations was found  by Skoglund and Reich (2016).&lt;ref&gt;P. Skoglund, D. Reich,  "A genomic view of the peopling of the Americas", ''Curr Opin Genet Dev.'' 2016 Dec; 41: 27–35,  doi:  10.1016/j.gde.2016.06.016.
"Recently, we carried out a stringent test of the null hypothesis of a single founding population of Central and South Americans using genome-wide data from diverse Native Americans. We detected a statistically clear signal linking Native Americans in the Amazonian region of Brazil to present-day Australo-Melanesians and Andaman Islanders (‘Australasians’). Specifically, we found that Australasians share significantly more genetic variants with some Amazonian populations—including ones speaking Tupi languages—than they do with other Native Americans. We called this putative ancient Native American lineage "Population Y" after Ypykuéra, which means ‘ancestor’ in the Tupi language family."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America in particular, significant racial admixture took place between the indigenous Amerind population, the European-descended colonial population, and the Sub-Saharan African populations [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade|imported as slaves]].  From about 1700, a Latin American terminology developed to refer to the various combinations of mixed racial descent produced by this.&lt;ref&gt;Chasteen (2004:4): "between the White elite and the mass of Amerindians and Negroes there existed by 1700 a thin stratum of population subject neither to Negro slavery nor Amerindian tutelage, consisting of the products of racial interbreeding among Whites, Amerindians, and Negroes and defined as mestizos, mulattoes and zambos (mixture of Indian and Negro) and their many combinations."&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[North American fur trade]] during the 16th century brought many more European men, from [[France]], [[Ireland]], and [[Great Britain]], who took North Amerindian women as wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Red River Cart and Trails: The Fur Trade|first=Harry B|last=Brehaut|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/transactions/3/redrivercart.shtml|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|year=1998|accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their children became known as ''"[[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]"'' or ''"[[Bois-Brûlés]]"'' by the [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonist]]s and ''"[[mixed-blood]]s"'', ''"[[half-breed]]s"'' or ''"[[Anglo-Métis|country-born]]"'' by the [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonist]]s and [[Scottish colonization of the Americas|Scottish colonist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who are Métis ?|url=http://www.metisnation.ca/who/index.html|publisher=[[Métis National Council]]|year=2001|accessdate=2010-02-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226021520/http://www.metisnation.ca/who/index.html|archivedate=2010-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Americans in the [[United States]] are more likely than any other racial group to practice [[Interracial marriage in the United States|racial exogamy]], resulting in an ever-declining proportion of indigenous ancestry among those who claim a Native American identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-14089253|title=Blood affects US Indian identity|journal=BBC News|first=Paul|last=Adams|date=July 10, 2011|accessdate=October 22, 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Beringians ===
[[File:Early migrations mercator.svg|thumb|25 kya Beringia during the LGM
16-14 kya peopling of the Americas just after the LGM]]
Recent archaeological findings in Alaska have shed light on the existence of a previously unknown Native American population that has been academically named "[[Ancient Beringian|Ancient Beringians]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/direct-genetic-evidence-of-founding-population-reveals-story-of-first-native-americans|title=Direct genetic evidence of founding population reveals story of first Native Americans|date=2018-01-03|work=University of Cambridge|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is popularly agreed among archeologists that early settlers had crossed into Alaska from Russia through the [[Beringia|Bering Strait land bridge]], the issue of whether or not there was one founding group or several waves of migration is a controversial and prevalent debate among academics in the field today. In 2018, the sequenced DNA of a native girl, whose remains were found at the Sun River archaeological site in Alaska in 2013 (maybe add citation here), proved not to match the two recognized branches of Native Americans and instead belonged to the early population of Ancient Beringians.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-01-reveals-evidence-population-ancient-native.html|title=Direct genetic evidence of founding population reveals story of first Native Americans|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakthrough is said to be the first direct genomic evidence that there was potentially only one wave of migration in the Americas that occurred, with genetic branching and division transpiring after the fact. The migration wave is estimated to have emerged about 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/direct-genetic-evidence-of-founding-population-reveals-story-of-first-native-americans|title=Direct genetic evidence of founding population reveals story of first Native Americans|date=2018-01-03|work=University of Cambridge|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Beringians are said to be a common ancestral group among contemporary Native American populations today, which differs in results collected from previous research that suggests that modern populations were ancestors of either Northern and Southern branches.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/direct-genetic-evidence-of-founding-population-reveals-story-of-first-native-americans|title=Direct genetic evidence of founding population reveals story of first Native Americans|date=2018-01-03|work=University of Cambridge|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts were also able to use wider genetic evidence to establish that the split between the Northern and Southern American branches of civilization from the Ancient Beringians in Alaska only occurred about 17,000 and 14,000 years,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reich |first=David |last2=Patterson |first2=Nick |last3=Campbell |first3=Desmond |last4=Tandon |first4=Arti |last5=Mazieres |first5=Stéphane |last6=Ray |first6=Nicolas |last7=Parra |first7=Maria V. |last8=Rojas |first8=Winston |last9=Duque |first9=Constanza |date=2012-08-16 |title=Reconstructing Native American Population History |journal=Nature |volume=488 |issue=7411 |pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/nature11258 |pmc=3615710|pmid=22801491}}&lt;/ref&gt; further challenging the concept of multiple migration waves occurring during the very first stages of settlement.  

==Blood groups==
[[File:Map of Group O.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Frequency of O group in indigenous populations. Note the predominance of this group in Indigenous Americans.]]

{{Further|ABO blood group system}}
Prior to the 1952 confirmation of DNA as the hereditary material by [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]], scientists used [[blood proteins]] to study human genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hershey A, Chase M |title=Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage | url=http://www.jgp.org/cgi/reprint/36/1/39.pdf | journal=J Gen Physiol |volume=36 |issue=1 | pages=39–56 |year=1952 |pmid=12981234 |doi=10.1085/jgp.36.1.39|format=PDF |pmc=2147348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pleiades"/&gt; The [[ABO blood group system]] is widely credited to have been discovered by the Austrian [[Karl Landsteiner]], who found three different blood types in 1900.&lt;ref name=Landsteiner_1900&gt;{{cite journal | author = Landsteiner K | title = Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe | journal = [[Zentralblatt Bakteriologie]] | year = 1900 | volume = 27 | pages = 357–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single [[gene]] (the [[ABO (gene)|ABO gene]]) with three [[allele]]s: ''i'', ''I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''.&lt;ref name=Yazer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yazer M, Olsson M, Palcic M |title=The cis-AB blood group phenotype: fundamental lessons in glycobiology |journal=Transfus Med Rev |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=207–17 |year=2006 |pmid=16787828 |doi=10.1016/j.tmrv.2006.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by [[Ludwik and Hanka Herschfeld]] during [[World War I]] found that the frequencies of [[blood groups]] A, B and O differed greatly from region to region.&lt;ref name="pleiades"&gt;{{cite journal |author=LILLE-SZYSZKOWICZ I |title=Development of studies on pleiades of blood groups|journal=Postȩpy Higieny I Medycyny Doświadczalnej |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=229–33 |year=1957 |pmid=13505351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "O" blood type (usually resulting from the absence of both A and B alleles) is very common around the world, with a rate of 63% in all human populations.&lt;ref name=Blood/&gt; Type "O" is the primary blood type among the indigenous populations of the Americas, in-particular within Central and South America populations, with a frequency of nearly 100%.&lt;ref name=Blood&gt;{{cite web |title=Distribution of Blood Types |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_3.htm |publisher=Behavioral Sciences Department, Palomar College |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221171034/http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_3.htm |archivedate=2006-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In indigenous North American populations the frequency of type "A" ranges from 16% to 82%.&lt;ref name=Blood/&gt; This suggests again that the initial Amerindians evolved from an isolated population with a minimal number of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Estrada-Mena B, Estrada FJ, Ulloa-Arvizu R, etal |title=Blood group O alleles in Native Americans: implications in the peopling of the Americas |journal=Am. J. Phys.

The standard explanation for such a high population of Native Americans with blood type O comes from the idea of [[Genetic drift]], in which the small nature of Native American populations meant the almost complete absence of any other blood gene being passed down through generations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson|first=Melissa S.|last2=Bolnick|first2=Deborah A.|date=2008-11|title=An ancient DNA test of a founder effect in Native American ABO blood group frequencies|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.20887|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=137|issue=3|pages=342–347|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20887|issn=0002-9483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related explanations include the Bottleneck explanation which states that there were high frequencies of blood type A and B among Native Americans but severe population decline during the 1500s and 1600s caused by the introduction of disease from Europe resulted in the massive death toll of those with blood types A and B. Coincidentally, a large amount of the survivors were type O. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halverson|first=Melissa S.|last2=Bolnick|first2=Deborah A.|date=2008-11|title=An ancient DNA test of a founder effect in Native American ABO blood group frequencies|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.20887|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=137|issue=3|pages=342–347|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20887|issn=0002-9483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European diseases and genetic modification ==
A team led by Ripan Malhi, an anthropologist at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois in Urbana]], conducted a study where they used a scientific technique known as whole exam sequencing to test immune-related gene variants within native americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/european-diseases-left-genetic-mark-native-americans|title=European diseases left a genetic mark on Native Americans|date=2016-11-15|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through analyzing ancient and modern native DNA, it was found that [[Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 1|HLA-DQA1]], a variant gene that codes for protein in charge of differentiating between healthy cells from invading viruses and bacteria were present in nearly 100% of ancient remains but only 36% in modern Native Americans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/european-diseases-left-genetic-mark-native-americans|title=European diseases left a genetic mark on Native Americans|date=2016-11-15|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;These finding suggest that European-borne epidemics such as [[smallpox]] altered the disease landscape of the americas, leaving survivors of these outbreaks less likely to carry variants like HLA-DQA1. This made them less able to cope with new diseases. The change in genetic makeup is measured by scientists to have occurred around 175 years ago, during a time when the smallpox epidemic was ranging through the americas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1069">'''Gnaeus Lucretius Trio''' was a [[Roman Republican coinage|Roman]] [[moneyer]], who minted [[denarii]] in [[Rome]] c. 136 BCE. He may be an ancestor of [[Lucius Lucretius]] Trio.

One of his denarii shows a head of Roma facing right with "TRIO" behind and an "X" below the chin. The reverse shows the [[Dioscuri]] galloping right with "CN. LVCR" below the horses and "ROMA" in the [[exergue]]. It is cataloged in 
"Roman Silver Coins" as "Lucretia 1" and in "Roman Republican Coinage" as "237/1".

'''Haguenau''' ({{lang-fr|Haguenau}}, {{IPA-fr|aɡəno|pron}}; [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''Hàwenau'' {{IPA-gsw|ˈhaːvənaʊ|}} or ''Hàjenöi''; {{Lang-de|Hagenau}} and historically in English: ''Hagenaw'') is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Bas-Rhin]] [[Département in France|department]] of France, of which it is a [[sub-prefecture]].

It is second in size in the [[Bas-Rhin]] only to [[Strasbourg]], some {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south.  To the north of the town, the [[Forest of Haguenau]] ({{lang-fr|Forêt de Haguenau}}) is the largest undivided forest in France.

Haguenau was founded by German dukes and has swapped back and forth several times between Germany and France over the centuries, with its spelling altering between "Hagenau" and "Haguenau" by the turn. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Haguenau was ceded to the new German Empire. It was part of the German Empire for 48 years from 1871 to 1918, when at the end of [[World War I]] it was returned to France. This transfer was officially ratified in 1919 with the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

Haguenau is a rapidly growing town, its population having increased from 22,644 inhabitants in 1968 to 34,891 inhabitants in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recensement.insee.fr/chiffresCles.action?zoneSearchField=HAGUENAU&amp;codeZone=67180-COM&amp;idTheme=3 Commune : Haguenau (67180)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429030323/http://www.recensement.insee.fr/chiffresCles.action?zoneSearchField=HAGUENAU&amp;codeZone=67180-COM&amp;idTheme=3 |date=2012-04-29 }} on INSEE&lt;/ref&gt; Haguenau's [[Metropolitan Area (France)|metropolitan area]] has grown from 43,904 inhabitants in 1968 to 64,562 inhabitants in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recensement.insee.fr/chiffresCles.action?codeMessage=5&amp;zoneSearchField=HAGUENAU&amp;codeZone=121-AU1999&amp;idTheme=3&amp;rechercher=Rechercher Aire urbaine 1999 : Haguenau (121)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on INSEE&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Haguenau dates from the beginning of the 12th century, when '''Frederick II''' (1090 &amp;ndash; 6 April 1147), called '''the One-Eyed''', [[Duke of Swabia]] erected a hunting lodge on an island in the [[Moder River]]. The medieval King and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] fortified the settlement and gave it [[town privileges|town rights]], important for further development, in 1154. On the site of the hunting lodge he founded an imperial palace he regarded as his favourite residence. In this palace were preserved the "Crown Jewels of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]", i.e. the jewelled imperial crown, sceptre, imperial orb, and sword of [[Charlemagne]].

[[Richard, Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], King of the Romans, made it an [[free imperial city|imperial city]] in 1257. Subsequently, through [[Rudolph I of Germany]] ([[House of Habsburg]]) Haguenau became the seat of the ''[[Landvogt]]'' of Hagenau, the German imperial advocatus in [[Lower Alsace]]. In the 14th century, it housed the executive council of the [[Decapole]], a defensive and offensive association of ten Alsatians towns against exterior  aggression, economical expension and related political instability. In the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, the Alsace was ceded to France, which had, in the past, repeatedly invaded and looted the region. In 1673 King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had the fortifications as well as the remains of the king's palace razed in order to extinguish German traditions. Haguenau was recaptured by German troops in 1675, but was taken again by the French two years later, when it was nearly destroyed by fire set by looting French troops.

In 1793 Prussians and Austrians had occupied Lower Alsace from the Lauter to Moder to support the Royalists and before the year's end were driven back over the border by the [[French Revolutionary Army]], causing the “great flight”.

In 1871, Haguenau was ceded to the [[German Empire]] upon its victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]; the community was made part of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], with its Germanic spelling&amp;ndash;''Hagenau''&amp;ndash;restored.

The [[Haguenau Airport]] was built in 1916 by the German military to train fighter and bomber pilots to fight in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeroclub-haguenau.com/historique.html History]. - Haguenau Aeroclub.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagenau was part of the briefly independent [[Republic of Alsace-Lorraine]] after [[World War I]], before being returned to France in 1919.

===Second World War===
In the [[World War II|Second World War]], Germany retook the town in 1940. In November 1944 the area surrounding Haguenau was under the control of the [[256th Volksgrenadier Division]] under the command of General [[Gerhard Franz]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Jeffrey J., and Robert Ross Smith (1993). - ''Riviera to the Rhine''. - Washington, D.C.: Center of Military History. U.S. Army. - p.478. - {{ISBN|978-0-16-025966-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 1944, the [[314th Infantry Regiment (United States)|314th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Division]], XV Corps, 7th U.S. Army, moved into the area near Haguenau, and on 7 December the regiment was given the assignment to take it and the [[Forest of Hagenau|town forest]] just north that included German ammunition dumps. The attack began at 0645, 9 December, and sometime during the night of 10 December and the early morning of 11 December the Germans withdrew under the cover of darkness leaving the town proper largely under American control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lorwings.net/314/outline10.shtml The 314th Infantry Regiment - Haguenau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818205826/http://www.lorwings.net/314/outline10.shtml |date=2007-08-18 }}. - The 314th Infantry Regiment - 79th Division, U.S. Army, World War II.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before they withdrew, the Germans demolished bridges, useful buildings, and even the town park. However, as experienced by Haguenau throughout its history, the Germans came back and retook the town in late January.  Most of the inhabitants fled with the assistance of the U.S. Army. The Americans launched an immediate counterattack to retake the town.&lt;ref&gt;''Stars and Stripes'', Nancy, ed., Jan. 25 and 26, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; The 313th Infantry Regiment of the 79th Division was relieved by the [[101st Airborne Division]] on 5 February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, p.225&lt;/ref&gt; The [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] would relieve the 101st on 23 February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15 the Allied [[Operation Undertone]], a combined effort of the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh]] and [[First Army (France)|French 1st]] Armies of the U.S. [[Sixth United States Army Group|Sixth Army Group]] was launched to drive the Germans back along a 75&amp;nbsp;km line from [[Saarbrücken]] to Haguenau.  The last German soldier was not cleared out of the town until March 19, 1945, after house-to-house fighting.

Much of the town had been destroyed despite the Allied reluctance to use artillery to clear out the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;''Stars and Stripes'', Nice, ed., Mar. 20, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technical sergeant|Technical Sergeant]] [[Morris E. Crain]], Company E, [[141st Infantry Regiment (United States)|141st Infantry Regiment]], [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for providing covering fire for his men on 13 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Crain, Morris E. |title=Medal of Honor recipients: World War II (A-F) |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-a-f.html |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The town has a well balanced economy. Centuries of troubled history in the buffer lands between France and Germany have given Haguenau a rich historical and cultural heritage which supports a lively [[tourism|tourist trade]]. There is also a thriving light [[manufacturing sector]] centred on the industrial zone to the west of the town. Here the presence nearby of significant retail developments testifies to Haguenau's importance as a regional commercial centre. The recent extension of the [[beltway|ring road]] has improved access to the commercial and industrial zones and reduced the traffic congestion which used to be a frequent challenge for vehicle drivers using the road which follows the line of the old town walls on the western side of town.

===Architecture===
In spite of the extensive destruction Haguenau suffered during the many wars experienced by Alsace, especially the [[Thirty Years War]], the French conquest in 1677 and the Second World War, it still possesses monuments from nine centuries, even if nothing is left of arguably the most prestigious of them, Frederick I Barbarossa's imperial palace (''Kaiserpfalz'').

Medieval Haguenau retains three gates from its former fortification, the ''Tour des Chevaliers'' (Tower of the knights), the ''Tour des Pêcheurs'' (Tower of the fishermen) and the ''Porte de Wissembourg'' ([[Wissembourg]] gate), two fairly large Gothic churches, Saint-Georges and Saint-Nicolas, an ancient water-mill and the [[Ancienne Douane (Haguenau)|old custom-house (''Ancienne Douane'')]]. Both [[St. George's Church, Haguenau|Saint-Georges]] and Saint-Nicolas Church have lost many of their artistic treasures over the centuries, especially their medieval stained glass windows and outside sculptures. Still, both display to this day some fine liturgical furniture (altars, choir stalls, organ cases, [[church tabernacle]]s, calvaries...). Saint-Nicolas has become the receptacle for the baroque wooden decoration of the church of the destroyed [[Neubourg Abbey]] nearby.

French [[baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[classicism]] has bequeathed the town several buildings, among which the former hospital and the current town hall. The Synagogue (1820) is a fine example of French [[Neo-classicism]], as is the theatre (''Théâtre municipal'') (1846). The large [[Hops|Hop]] hall (''Halle au houblon'') is a good example of historicism in architecture. It was built by the French in 1867 and extended twice by the Germans, in 1881 and 1908.

Haguenau's streets are adorned by attractive fountains, the medieval Saint-Georges fountain, the 18th-century Bee fountain (''Fontaine aux abeilles'') and the 1825 Dolphin fountain (''Fontaine aux dauphins'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Hendrik Jan Maarten''' "'''Henk'''" '''Bos''' (born 17 July 1940, [[Enschede]]) is a Dutch historian of mathematics.

==Career==
Hendrik was a student of [[Hans Freudenthal]] and [[Jerome Ravetz]] at [[Utrecht University]] and in 1973 wrote a thesis "Differentials, higher order differentials, and the derivative in Liebnitzian calculus" for his doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://profs.library.uu.nl/index.php/profrec/getprofdata/253/9/108/0 Prof.dr. H.J.M. Bos (1940 - )] at the ''Catalogus Professorum Academiæ Rheno-Traiectinæ''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bos worked at Utrecht University for most of his career. In 1985 he became [[professor]] of [[history of mathematics]].

He took an interest in the [[tractrix]] as a mathematical stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. M. Bos (1988) "Tractional motion and the Legitimation of Transcendental Curves", [[Centaurus (journal)|Centaurus]] 31(1): 9–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bos|first1=H.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;M.|title=Recognition and Wonder – Huygens, Tractional Motion and Some Thoughts on the History of Mathematics|url=http://www.gewina.nl/journals/tractrix/bos89.pdf|journal= Euclides|volume= 63 |date=1989 |page=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bos retired in 2005.&lt;ref name=UA&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Aarhus Henk Bos appointed honorary professor at the University of Aarhus|url=http://www.au.dk/en/about/news/oldnews/2006/080107/|publisher=University of Aarhus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since his retirement he has been honorary professor of the history of mathematics at the Faculty of Science at the [[University of Aarhus]]. He is married to [[Kirsti Andersen]].

At his Valedictory Symposium&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unizar.es/ichm/reports/henkvale.html Valedictory Symposium] from [[International Commission on the History of Mathematics]]&lt;/ref&gt; when he retired, Henk spoke on fluid concepts in mathematics in a talk titled "Loose Ends". He was awarded the [[Kenneth O. May Medal]] for 2005.

'''Jean Bodin''' (1530–1596) was a [[French people|French]] [[jurist]] and [[political philosophy|political philosopher]], member of the [[Parlement]] of [[Paris]] and professor of law in [[Toulouse]]. He is best known for his theory of [[sovereignty]]; he was also an influential writer on [[demonology]].

Bodin lived during the aftermath of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and wrote against the background of religious conflict in France. He remained a nominal [[Catholic]] throughout his life but was critical of [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal authority]] over governments, favouring the strong central control of a national [[monarchy]] as an antidote to factional strife. Toward the end of his life he wrote, but did not publish, a dialogue among different religions, including representatives of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] and [[natural theology]], in which all agreed to coexist in concord.

==Life==
Bodin was successively a friar, academic, professional lawyer, and political adviser. An excursion as a politician having proved a failure, he lived out his life as a provincial [[magistrate]].

Bodin was born near [[Angers]], possibly the son of a master tailor,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} into a modestly prosperous middle-class background. He received a decent education, apparently in the [[Carmelite]] monastery of Angers, where he became a [[novice]] friar. Some claims made about his early life remain obscure. There is some evidence of a visit to Geneva in 1547/48 in which he became involved in a [[heresy]] trial. The records of this episode, however, are murky and may refer to another person.

===Paris and Toulouse===
He obtained release from his vows in 1549 and went to Paris. He studied at the [[University of Paris|university]], but also at the [[humanism|humanist]]-oriented ''Collège des Quatre Langues'' (now the [[Collège de France]]); he was for two years a student under Guillaume Prévost, a little-known ''magister'' in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{Google books|NPlesawx63AC|Jacobsen, p. 55|page=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His education was not only influenced by an orthodox [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] approach but was also apparently in contact with [[Ramism|Ramist]] philosophy.

Later in the 1550s he studied [[Roman law]] at the [[University of Toulouse]], under [[Arnaud du Ferrier]], and taught there. His special subject at that time seems to have been comparative jurisprudence. Subsequently he worked on a Latin translation of [[Oppian of Apamea]], under the continuing patronage of [[Gabriel Bouvery]], [[Bishop of Angers]]. Bodin had a plan for a school on humanist principles in Toulouse, but failed to raise local support. He left in 1560.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=bodin |title=Jean Bodin |last=Turchetti  |first=Mario|date=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Schneider, ''Public life in Toulouse, 1463-1789: from municipal republic to cosmopolitan city'' (1989), pp. 56–7; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mSz9euEaX-oC&amp;pg=PA56 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wars of Religion and the ''politiques''===
From 1561 he was licensed as an attorney of the ''[[Parlement]]'' of Paris. His religious convictions on the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in 1562 cannot be determined, but he affirmed formally his Catholic faith, taking an oath that year along with other members of the Parlement.&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, p. xxi; [https://books.google.com/books?id=fpkvrr-qyoMC&amp;pg=PR21 Google Books.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to pursue his interests in legal and political theory in Paris, publishing significant works on [[historiography]] and economics.

Bodin became a member of the discussion circles around the [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Prince François d'Alençon]] (or d'Anjou from 1576). He was the intelligent and ambitious youngest son of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], and was in line for the throne in 1574, with the death of his brother [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]]. He withdrew his claim, however, in favor of his older brother [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] who had recently returned from his abortive effort to reign as the [[King of Poland]]. Alençon was a leader of the ''[[politiques]]'' faction of political pragmatists.&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Introduction p. xxii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fpkvrr-qyoMC&amp;pg=PR22 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Henry III===
After the failure of Prince François' hopes to ascend the throne, Bodin transferred his allegiance to the new king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. In practical politics, however, he lost the king's favor in 1576–7, as delegate of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] at the [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General]] at [[Blois]], and leader in his Estate of the February 1577 moves to prevent a new war against the Huguenots.&lt;ref&gt;Mack P. Holt, ''The Duke of Anjou and the Politique Struggle During the Wars of Religion'' (2005), p. 85; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mt5sraGYbWcC&amp;q=Bodin#v=snippet&amp;q=Bodin&amp;f=false Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to exert a moderating influence on the Catholic party, and also tried restrict the passage of supplemental taxation for the king.  Bodin then retired from political life; he had married in February 1576. His wife, Françoise Trouillart, was the widow of Claude Bayard, and sister of Nicolas Trouillart who died in 1587; both were royal attorneys in the [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] of [[Laon]] and attorneys in the [[Bailiwick]] of [[Vermandois]], and Bodin took over the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{Google books|NPlesawx63AC|Jacobsen, p. 47|page=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin was in touch with [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] in Paris, [[Lord Burghley]]'s contact, at the time (1576) of publication of the ''Six livres''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Waad, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later accompanied Prince François, by then Duke of Anjou, to England in 1581, in his second attempt to woo [[Elizabeth I of England]]. On this visit Bodin saw the English Parliament.&lt;ref name=Purkiss196&gt;Purkiss, p. 196 note 14; [https://books.google.com/books?id=18c4MQO5MyIC&amp;pg=PA196 Google Books ]&lt;/ref&gt; He brushed off a request to secure better treatment for English Catholics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. McCoog, ''The Society of Jesus in Ireland, Scotland, and England 1541-1588: "our way of proceeding?"'' (1996), p. 156; [https://books.google.com/books?id=BB4u8Lg9-lwC&amp;pg=PA156 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; to the dismay of [[Robert Persons]], given that [[Edmund Campion]] was in prison at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dutton, Alison Findlay, Richard Wilson, ''Theatre and Religion: Lancastrian Shakespeare'' (2003), p. 120; [https://books.google.com/books?id=IDHZmFCFqXwC&amp;pg=PA120 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin saw some of Campion's trial,&lt;ref name=Purkiss196/&gt; he is said also to have witnessed Campion's execution in December 1581,&lt;ref&gt;Leonard F. Dean, ''Bodin's "Methodus" in England before 1625'', Studies in Philology Vol. 39, No. 2 (Apr., 1942), pp. 160-166; note on p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; making the hanging the occasion for a public letter against the use of force in matters of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, pp.xxiii–xxiv; [https://books.google.com/books?id=fpkvrr-qyoMC&amp;pg=PR23 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin became a correspondent of [[Francis Walsingham]]; and [[Michel de Castelnau]] passed on to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] a prophecy supposed to be Bodin's, on the death of Elizabeth, at the time of the [[Babington Plot]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bossy, ''Under the Molehill: An Elizabethan Spy Story'' (2001), p. 110 and note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince François became [[Duke of Brabant]] in 1582, however, and embarked on an adventurer's campaign to expand his territory. The disapproving Bodin accompanied him, and was trapped in the Prince's disastrous raid on [[Antwerp]] that ended the attempt, followed shortly by the Prince's death in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{Google books|NPlesawx63AC|Jacobsen, p. 49|page=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
In the wars that followed the death of Henry III (1589), the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] attempted to prevent the succession of the Protestant [[Henry of Navarre]] by placing another king on the throne. Bodin initially gave support to the powerful League; he felt it inevitable that they would score a quick victory.

He died, in Laon, during one of the many [[bubonic plague|plague]] epidemics of the time.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

==Books==
Bodin generally wrote in French, with later Latin translations.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the works have been seen as influenced by [[Ramism]], at least in terms of structure.

Bodin wrote in turn books on history, economics, politics, demonology, and natural philosophy;&lt;ref&gt;http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3403055/blair_natural.pdf?sequence=2&lt;/ref&gt; and also left a (later notorious) work in manuscript on religion (see under "Religious tolerance"). A modern edition of Bodin's works was begun in 1951 as ''Oeuvres philosophiques de Jean Bodin'' by {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Mesnard|fr}}, but only one volume appeared.

===''Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem''===
In France, Bodin was noted as a historian for his ''Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem'' (1566) (''Method for the easy knowledge of history''). He wrote, "Of history, that is, the true narration of things, there are three kinds: human, natural and divine". This book was one of the most significant contributions to the ''[[ars historica]]'' of the period, and distinctively put an emphasis on the role of political knowledge in interpreting historical writings.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; He pointed out that the knowledge of historical legal systems could be useful for contemporary legislation.

The ''Methodus'' was a successful and influential manual on the writing of technical history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denys Hay]], ''Annalists and Historians'', pp. 129-31.&lt;/ref&gt; It answered by means of detailed historiographical advice the skeptical line on the possibility of historical knowledge advanced by [[Francesco Patrizzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hay, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It also expanded the view of historical "data" found in earlier [[Humanism|humanists]], with the immediacy of its concerns for the social side of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Manley, ''Convention, 1500-1750'' (1980), p. 214; [https://books.google.com/books?id=7MJDLSD2OhkC&amp;pg=PA214 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin rejected the biblical [[Four Monarchies]] model, taking an unpopular position at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the classical theory of a [[Golden Age]] for its naiveté.&lt;ref&gt;Breisach, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He also dropped much of the rhetorical apparatus of the humanists.

===Economic thought: the ''Reply to Malestroit''===
The ''Réponse de J. Bodin aux paradoxes de M. de Malestroit'' (1568) was a tract, provoked by theories of Jean de Malestroit, in which Bodin offered one of the earliest scholarly analyses of the phenomenon of [[inflation]], unknown prior to the 16th century. The background to discussion in the 1560s was that by 1550 an increase in the [[money supply]] in Western Europe had brought general benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; But there had also been appreciable inflation. Silver arriving via Spain from the South American mine of [[Potosí]], together with other sources of silver and gold, from other new sources, was causing monetary change.

Bodin was after [[Martín de Azpilicueta]], who had alluded to the issue in 1556 (something noticed also by Gomara in his unpublished ''Annals''),&lt;ref&gt;Davies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; an early observer that the rise in prices was due in large part to the influx of precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;Bodin J., ''La Response de Joan Bodin a M. De Malestroit'', 1568. Cited in ''European Economic History: Documents and Reading'', p. 22. (1965). Editors: Clough SB, Moiide CG.&lt;/ref&gt; Analysing the phenomenon, amongst other factors he pointed to the relationship between the amount of goods and the amount of money in circulation. The debates of the time laid the foundation for the "[[quantity theory of money]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Mediterranean'', p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin mentioned other factors: population increase, trade, the possibility of [[economic migration]], and consumption that he saw as profligate.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, pp. 65-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Theatrum''===
The ''Theatrum Universae Naturae'' is Bodin's statement of natural philosophy. It contains many particular and even idiosyncratic personal views, for instance that [[eclipse]]s are related to political events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'', p. 386 note.&lt;/ref&gt; It argued against the certainty of the astronomical theory of [[stellar parallax]], and the terrestrial origin of the "comet of 1573" (i.e. the supernova [[SN 1572]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; This work shows major [[Ramism|Ramist]] influences. Consideration of the orderly majesty of God leads to encyclopedism about the [[universe]] and an analogue of a [[memory system]].&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Rossi, ''Logic and the Art of Memory: The Quest for a Universal Language'', (English translation, 2000), p. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems of Bodin became attached to some Renaissance editions of Aristotelian ''[[problemata]]'' in natural philosophy. Further, Damian Siffert compiled a ''Problemata Bodini'', which was based on the ''Theatrum''.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Blair, ''The Problemata as a Natural Philosophical Genre'', in Grafton and Siraisi (ed.) ''Natural Particulars'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Les Six livres de la République (The Six Books of the Republic)''===
Bodin's best-known work was written in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Les six liures de la republique de I. Bodin |publisher= Chez Iacques du Puys, libraire iuré, à la Samaritaine |year= 1577 |place= Paris |url=  https://archive.org/details/lessixliuresdela00bodi |accessdate= February 10, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion regarding the best form of government which took place in those years around the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (1572) gave the inspiration; Bodin attempted to embark on a middle path. [[Machiavelli]] would have granted the sovereign the right to act for the benefit of his state without moral consideration, and Protestant theorists advocated a popular government, or at least an [[elective monarchy]]. Bodin's classical definition of sovereignty is: "{{lang|fr|la puissance absolue et perpetuelle d'une République}}" (the absolute and perpetual power of a Republic). His main ideas about sovereignty are found in chapter VIII and X of Book I, including his statement "The sovereign Prince is accountable only to God".

The ''Six livres'' were an immediate success and were frequently reprinted. A revised and expanded Latin translation by the author appeared in 1586. With this work, Bodin became one of the founders of the pragmatic inter-confessional group known as the ''[[politique]]s'', who ultimately succeeded in ending the Wars of Religion under King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], with the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598). Against the [[monarchomach]]s who were assailing kingship in his time, such as [[Theodore Beza]] and [[François Hotman]] Bodin succeeded in writing a fundamental and influential treatise of social and political theory. In its reasoning against all types of [[mixed constitution]] and [[resistance theory]], it was an effective counter-attack against the monarchomach position invoking "popular sovereignty".&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the earlier books has been described as Ramist in structure. Book VI contains astrological and numerological reasoning.&lt;ref name="Rose, p. 277"&gt;Rose, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin invoked [[Pythagoras]] in discussing [[justice]] and in Book IV used ideas related to the [[Utopia]] of [[Thomas More]]&lt;ref&gt;Mazzotta, p. 177-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of language derived from or replacing [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''città'' (Latin ''civitas'') as political unit (French ''cité'' or ''ville'') is thoughtful; Bodin introduced republic (French ''république'', Latin ''respublica'') as a term for matters of [[public law]] (the contemporary English rendering was ''commonweal(th)'').&lt;ref&gt;Bock, Skinner and Viroli eds, ''Machiavelli and Republicanism'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin, although he referenced [[Tacitus]], was not writing here in the tradition of [[classical republicanism]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] is analysed as a "seigneurial monarchy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], ''European Renaissance'' p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Venice]] is not accepted in the terms of [[Gasparo Contarini]]: it is called an aristocratic constitution, not a mixed one, with a concentric structure, and its apparent stability was not attributable to the form of government.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Muir, ''Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice'' (1986), p. 50; [https://books.google.com/books?id=bM-ky1XgGWcC&amp;pg=PA50 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas in the ''Six livres'' on the importance of climate in the shaping of a people's character were also influential, finding a prominent place in the work of [[Giovanni Botero]] (1544–1617) and later in [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]'s (1689–1755) [[climatic determinism]]. Based on the assumption that a country's climate shapes the character of its population, and hence to a large extent the most suitable form of government, Bodin postulated that a [[hereditary monarchy]] would be the ideal regime for a temperate nation such as France. This power should be "sovereign", i.e., not be subject to any other branch, though to some extent limited by institutions like the high courts (''Parlement'') and representative assemblies (''États'').  Above all, the monarch is "responsible only to God", that is, must stand above confessional factions.

The work soon became widely known. Gaspar de Anastro made a Spanish translation in 1590.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Elliott, ''The Count-Duke of Olivares'' (1986), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Knolles]] put together an English translation (1606); this was based on the 1586 Latin version, but in places follows other versions. It appeared under the title ''The Six Bookes of a Common-weale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Six Bookes of a Commonweale Written by I.

[[File:Démonomanie des sorciers Bodin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Title page of ''De la démonomanie des sorciers'' (1580)]]

===''De la démonomanie des sorciers'' (''Of the Demon-mania of the Sorcerers'')===
Bodin's major work on [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and the [[witchcraft]] persecutions was first issued in 1580, ten editions being published by 1604.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvh.univ-tours.fr/Consult/index.asp?numfiche=221 1580 ed. of ''De la Demonomanie des Sorciers'']&lt;/ref&gt; In it he elaborates the influential concept of "pact witchcraft" based on a [[deal with the Devil]]&lt;ref&gt;Purkiss, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and the belief that the evil spirit would utilize a strategy to impose doubt on judges to look upon magicians as madmen and hypochondriacs deserving of compassion rather than chastisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustine|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. Translated by Rev Henry Christmas &amp; Brett R Warren. 2016|date=1751|isbn=1-5331-4568-7|page=45|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book relates histories of sorcerers,&lt;ref&gt;[[E. M. Butler]], ''The Fortunes of Faust'' (1998), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; but does not mention [[Faust]] and his pact.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Butler, ''Myth of the Magus'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; It gave a report of a 1552 public [[exorcism]] in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Ferber, ''Demonic Possession and Exorcism in Early Modern France'' (2004), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the case of [[Magdalena de la Cruz]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]], an abbess who had confessed to sexual relations with the Devil over three decades.&lt;ref&gt;Ferber, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin cited Pierre Marner on [[werewolf]] accounts from [[Savoie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Book of Were-Wolves/Chapter V]]&lt;/ref&gt; He denounced the works of [[Cornelius Agrippa]], and the perceived traffic in "sorceries" carried out along the [[Spanish Road]], running along eastern France for much of its length.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Davies, ''Grimoires: A History of Magic Books'' (2009), p. 68 and p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in extreme terms about procedures in sorcery trials, opposing the normal safeguards of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Pennethorne Hughes, ''Witchcraft'' (1969), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; This advocacy of relaxation was aimed directly at the existing standards laid down by the Parlement of Paris (physical or written evidence, confessions not obtained by [[torture]], unimpeachable witnesses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&amp;context=wmjowl&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22Jean%20Bodin%20%2BParlement%22 Barbara L. Bernier, ''The Praxis of Church and State in the (Under)Development of Women's Religion from France to the New World'' (PDF)] p. 676–7 of article.&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that not even one witch could be erroneously condemned if the correct procedures were followed, because rumours concerning sorcerers were almost always true. Bodin's attitude has been called a populationist strategy typical of [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heinsohn |first=Gunnar |authorlink= |author2=Steiger, Otto |year=1999 |title=Birth Control: The Political-Economic Rationale behind Jean Bodin's Démonomanie |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=31 |issue=3 |pmid=21275210 |pages=423–448 |id= |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/history_of_political_economy/v031/31.3heinsohn.html |doi=10.1215/00182702-31-3-423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=October 2011}}

The book was influential in the debate over witchcraft; it was translated into German by [[Johann Fischart]] (1581),&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], ''European Renaissance'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/resolve/display/bsb10192455.html online text].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year into Latin by [[François Du Jon]] as ''De magorum dæmonomania libri IV''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bvh.univ-tours.fr/Consult/index.asp?numfiche=201 BVH page]&lt;/ref&gt; It was quoted by [[Jean de Léry]], writing about the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]] people of what is now [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Purkiss, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and politics===
Bodin became well known for his analysis of sovereignty, which he took to be indivisible, and to involve full legislative powers (though with qualifications and caveats). With [[François Hotman]] (1524-1590) and [[François Baudouin]] (1520-1573), on the other hand, Bodin also supported the force of [[customary law]], seeing [[Roman law]] alone as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;''General Crisis'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

He hedged the absolutist nature of his theory of sovereignty, which was an analytical concept; if later his ideas were used in a different, normative fashion, that was not overtly the reason in Bodin.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Burgess, ''Ancient Constitution'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Sovereignty could be looked at as a "bundle of attributes";&lt;ref&gt;Holt, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; in that light the legislative role took centre stage, and other "marks of sovereignty" could be discussed further, as separate issues. He was a ''politique'' in theory, which was the moderate position of the period in French politics; but drew the conclusion that only [[passive resistance]] to authority was justified.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin's work on political theory saw the introduction of the modern concept of "state" but was in the fact on the cusp of usage (with that of [[Corasius]]), with the older meaning of a monarch "maintaining his state" not having dropped away.&lt;ref&gt;Ball etc ''Political Innovation'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Public office]] belonged to the commonwealth, and its holders had a personal responsibility for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Wernham, p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt; Politics is autonomous, and the sovereign is subject to divine and natural law, but not to any church; the obligation is to secure justice and religious worship in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Wernham, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin studied the balance of liberty and authority.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''Freedom and Betrayal'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; He had no doctrine of [[separation of powers]] and argued in a traditional way about [[royal prerogative]] and its proper, limited sphere. His doctrine was one of balance as harmony, with numerous qualifications; as such it could be used in different manners, and was. The key was that the central point of power should be above faction.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Henshall, ''The Myth of Absolutism'' (1992), pp. 126-127, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Rose sees Bodin's politics as ultimately [[theocratic]],&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; and misunderstood by the absolutists who followed him.&lt;ref name="Rose, p. 277"/&gt;

Where Aristotle argued for six types of state, Bodin allowed only [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[democracy]]. He advocated, however, distinguishing the form of state (constitution) from the form of government (administration).&lt;ref&gt;Wernham, p. 503-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin had a low opinion of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheldon Wolin]] (2003), ''Tocqueville, Between Two Worlds'' pp.59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Families were the basic unit and model for the state;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand [[John Milton]] found in Bodin an ally on the topic of [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, ''Milton and the English Revolution, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Respect for individual liberty and possessions were the hallmark of the orderly state, a view Bodin shared with Hotman and [[George Buchanan]].&lt;ref&gt;Wernham, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gay]], ''The Enlightenment 2: The Science of Freedom'' (1996), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

In matters of law and politics, Bodin saw religion as a social prop, encouraging respect for law and governance.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = In the ''Republique'', at least, religion captures Bodin's attention because of its influence on the sovereign's capacity to keep the peace. A false religion is nevertheless useful because it 'doth yet hold men in fear and awe, both of the laws and of the magistrates [...]' (IV, 7, 539). If fear of hellfire lends credibility to the law, then religion is a welcome ally [...] In other words, Bodin advances a social-prop theory of religion. The utility of religion does not hinge upon its truth.

===On change and progress===
He praised printing as outshining any achievement of the ancients.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the [[Protestant Reformation]] was driven by economic and political forces is attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, ''Economic Problems of the Church'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; He is identified as the first person to realize the rapid rate of change of early modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, he is credited as the first modern writer to use the concept of [[physical law]]s to define change,&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 273, citing d'Entrèves.&lt;/ref&gt; but his idea of nature included the action of spirits. In politics, he adhered to the ideas of his time in considering a political revolution in the nature of an astronomical cycle: a ''changement'' (French) or simply a change (as translated 1606) in English;&lt;ref&gt;[[Perez Zagorin]], ''Court &amp; Country'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; from Polybius Bodin took the idea of ''anacyclosis'', or cyclic change of constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin's theory was that governments had begun as monarchical, had then been democratic, before becoming aristocratic.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzotta, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious tolerance===

====Public position====
In 1576 Bodin was engaged in French politics, and then argued against the use of compulsion in matters of religion, if unsuccessfully. Wars, he considered, should be subject to statecraft, and matters of religion did not touch the state.

Bodin argued that a state might contain several religions; this was a very unusual position for his time, if shared by [[Michel de l'Hôpital]] and [[William the Silent]]. It was attacked by [[Pedro de Rivadeneira]] and [[Juan de Mariana]], from the conventional opposing position of a state obligation to root out religious dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 134 note and p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in the ''Six livres'' that the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]] was an example of unjustified persecution, similar to that of the Jews and medieval fraternities.&lt;ref&gt;Marsha Keith Schuchard, ''Restoring the Temple of Vision: cabalistic freemasonry and Stuart culture'' (2002), p. 212; [https://books.google.com/books?id=YvBynNte54YC&amp;pg=PA212 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private position in the ''Colloquium''====
In 1588 Bodin completed in manuscript a Latin work ''Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis'' (Colloquium of the Seven). It is a conversation about the nature of truth between seven educated men, each with a distinct religious or philosophical orientation - a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic.&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this work, Bodin is often identified as one of the first proponents of [[religious tolerance]] in the western world. Truth, in Bodin's view, commanded universal agreement; and the [[Abrahamic religions]] agreed on the [[Old Testament]] (Tanakh).&lt;ref&gt;Wernham, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vera religio'' (true religion) would command loyalty to the point of death; his conception of it was influenced by [[Philo]] and [[Maimonides]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 281-2.&lt;/ref&gt; His views on [[free will]] are also bound up with his studies in Jewish philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars have contested his authorship of the text. The "Colloquium of the Seven regarding the hidden secrets of the sublime things" offers a peaceful discussion with seven representatives of various religions and worldviews, who in the end agree on the fundamental underlying similarity of their beliefs.

Bodin's theory, as based in considerations of harmony, resembles that of [[Sebastian Castellio]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been seen as a scriptural relativist, and [[deist]], with [[Montaigne]] and [[Pierre Charron]];&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; also in the group of learned [[Christian Hebraist]]s with [[John Selden]], [[Carlo Giuseppe Imbonati]], and [[Gerhard Vossius]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazzotta, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By reputation, at least, Bodin was cited as an unbeliever, [[deist]] or [[atheist]] by Christian writers who associated him with perceived free-thinking and sceptical tradition of Machiavelli and [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], [[Lucilio Vanini]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]]: [[Pierre-Daniel Huet]],&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 454 .&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel Falck]],&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude-François Houtteville]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bayle]] attributed to Bodin a maxim about the intellectual consequences of the non-existence of God (a precursor of [[Voltaire]]'s, but based on a traditional commonplace of French thinkers).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Israel]], Enlightenment Contested (2006), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] later wrote that the protagonists in the Colloquium anticipate those of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''[[Nathan der Weise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gay]], ''The Enlightenment I: The Rise of Modern Paganism'' (1973) p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colloquium was one of the major and most popular manuscripts in clandestine circulation in the early modern period, with more than 100 copies catalogued.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 690&lt;/ref&gt; it had an extensive covert circulation, after coming into intellectual fashion. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states "It is curious that [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], who originally regarded the ''Colloquium'' as the work of a professed enemy of Christianity, subsequently described it as a most valuable production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bodin, Jean|volume=4|pages=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its dissemination increased after 1700, even if its content was by then dated.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt; It was interpreted in the 18th century as containing arguments for [[Natural theology|natural religion]], as if the views expressed by Toralba (the proponent of natural religion) were Bodin's; wrongly, according to Rose, whose reconstruction of Bodin's religious views is a long way from belief in a detached deity.&lt;ref&gt;Rose.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grotius]] had a manuscript. [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who criticized the Colloquium to [[Jacob Thomasius]] and [[Hermann Conring]], some years later did editorial work on the manuscript. [[Henry Oldenburg]] wanted to copy it, for transmission to [[John Milton]] and possibly [[John Dury]],&lt;ref&gt;Garber and Ayers I, pp. 415-6&lt;/ref&gt; or for some other connection in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski, p. 670 note 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1662 Conring was seeking a copy for a princely library.&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not to be published in full until 1857, by Ludwig Noack, from manuscripts collected by [[Heinrich Christian von Seckenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz p. lxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal religious convictions====
Bodin was influenced by philosophic Judaism to believe in the annihilation of the wicked 'post exacta supplicia'.&lt;ref&gt;D. P. Walker ''The decline of hell Seventeenth-Century Discussions of Eternal Torment'' (9780226871066)  Page 74 footnoted 1857 [[Megaloburgiensium]] p341-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and universal history and geography===
Bodin was a polymath, concerned with [[universal history]] which he approached as a jurist. He belonged to an identifiable French school of antiquarian and  [[cultural history]], with [[Lancelot Voisin de La Popelinière]], [[Louis Le Caron]], [[Louis Le Roy]], [[Étienne Pasquier]] and [[Nicolas Vignier]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah Berlin]],  ''Proper Study'', p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical disciples included [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] and [[William Camden]]. The genre thus founded, drawing social conclusions, identified itself as "civil history", and was influenced particularly by [[Polybius]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Methodus'' has been called the first book to advance "a theory of universal history based on a purely secular study of the growth of civilisation".&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. L. Avis, ''Foundations of modern historical thought: from Machiavelli to Vico'' (1986), p. 56; [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin's secular attitude to history therefore goes some way to explain his perceived relationship to Machiavelli. While Bodin's common ground with Machiavelli is not so large, and indeed Bodin opposed the Godless vision of the world in Machiavelli,&lt;ref&gt;Mazzotta, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; they are often enough paired, for example by [[A. C. Crombie]] as philosophical historians with contemporary concerns; Crombie also links Bodin with [[Francis Bacon]], as rational and critical historians.&lt;ref&gt;Crombie, p. 35 and p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bodin and Machiavelli treat religion as situated historically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shlomo Avineri]], 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin drew largely on [[Johann Boemus]], and also classical authors, as well as accounts from [[Leo Africanus]] and [[Francisco Álvares]]. He showed little interest, however, in the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 133 and pp. 113-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of theories of [[cultural diffusion]] he influenced [[Nathanael Carpenter]], and many subsequently, with his "south-eastern origin" theory of the transmission from peoples of the Middle East to Greece and Rome (and hence to Northern Europe).&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 256)&lt;/ref&gt; Another follower was [[Peter Heylyn]] in his ''Microcosmus'' (1621).&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, pp. 284-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In anthropology Bodin showed indications of [[polygenism]] as theory of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; In clearer terms, on the other hand, he believed that mankind was unifying, the drivers being trade, and the indications of the ''respublica mundana'' (world commonwealth) and international law as developing. This was within a scheme of ''[[Vaticinium Eliae]]'' or three periods of 2000 years for universal history, to which he had little commitment, though indicating its connection with the three climate regions and their predominance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Breisach]], ''Historiography: ancient, medieval, and modern'' (2007), p. 183–4; [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Juypp-VVg4C&amp;pg=PA183 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

The "south-eastern" theory depended for its explanation on Bodin's climate theory and astrology: it was given in the ''Methodus'', and developed in Book VI of the ''Six Livres''. He made an identification of peoples and geographical sectors with planetary influences, in Book V of the ''Six Livres''.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, ''The Mirrors of the Gods'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His astrological theory is combined with the [[Hippocratic]] tradition; but not in the conventional way of [[Ptolemy]]. It has been suggested that he took them from a follower of [[Cardano]], [[Auger Ferrier]].&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, p. 435 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Bodin's conception of [[sovereignty]] was widely adopted in Europe. In a form simplified and adapted by others, such as the French jurists [[Charles Loyseau]] (1564–1627) and [[Cardin Le Bret]] (1558–1655), it played an important role in the development of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/theory-of-sovereignty&lt;/ref&gt;

===In France===
Influentially, Bodin defended an orderly  [[Gallican]] monarchy against [[Huguenot]]s, and any external interference.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, pp. 341-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These general ideas became political orthodoxy, in the reign of [[Henry IV of France]], tending to the beginnings of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]]. Bodin had numerous followers as political theorist, including [[Pierre Grégoire (jurist)|Pierre Grégoire]], in whom with [[François Grimaudet]] legislative authority starts to become closer to the [[divine right of kings]], and [[William Barclay (jurist)|William Barclay]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tuck (1993), ''Philosophy and Government (1572–1651)'', p. 28; [https://books.google.com/books?id=oOTtZO3TVSIC&amp;pg=PA28 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M. Johnston, ''The Historical Foundations of World Order: the tower and the arena'' (2008), p. 413; [https://books.google.com/books?id=99H_tpN_iVkC&amp;pg=PA413 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Charron]] in ''La Sagesse'' of 1601 uses the idea of state from Bodin but with fewer limitations on royal power;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. H. Elliott]], ''Richelieu and Olivares'' (1991), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Charron in this work argued for a secular [[neo-stoicism]], putting together ideas of [[Montaigne]] and Lipsius with those of Bodin.&lt;ref&gt;McCrea, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Loyseau in the years 1608-10 published absolutist works with the emphasis on orderliness in society, going much beyond Bodin's writing of thirty years earlier, a trend that continued into the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mack P. Holt, ''The French Wars of Religion'', 1562-1629 (1995), pp. 215-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a demonologist, his work was taken to be authoritative and based on experience as witch-hunting practitioner. As historian, he was prominently cited by [[Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy]] in his 1713 ''Methode pour etudier l'Histoire''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Butterfield]], ''Man and his Past'' (1969), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montesquieu]] read Bodin closely; the modern sociology hinted at in Bodin, arising from the relationship between the state apparatus on the one hand, and society on the other, is developed in Montesquieu.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Runciman (1963), ''Social Science and Political Theory'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Germany===
Bodin's rejection of the Four Monarchies model was unpopular, given the German investment in the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as fourth monarch,&lt;ref&gt;Breisach, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; the attitude of [[Johannes Sleidanus]]. The need to accommodate the existing structure of the Empire with Bodin as theorist of sovereignty led to a controversy running over nearly half a century; starting with [[Henning Arnisaeus]], it continued unresolved to 1626 and the time of [[Christopher Besoldus]]. He drew a line under it, by adopting the concept of [[composite polyarchy]], which held sway subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Franklin, ''Sovereignty and the Mixed Constitution: Bodin and his critics'', Chapter 10 in Burns.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz rejected Bodin's view of sovereignty, stating that it might amount only to territorial control, and the consequence drawn by writers in Bodin's tradition that [[federalism]] was chimeric.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riley, ''The Political Writings of Leibniz'' (1981), p. 27 and p. 117 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In England===
Generally the English took great interest in the French Wars of Religion; their literature came into commonplace use in English political debate,&lt;ref&gt;Wernham, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amyas Paulet]] made immediate efforts to find the ''Six livres'' for [[Edward Dyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=8346|title=Dyer, Sir Edward|first=Steven W.|last=May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly Bodin's works were known in England: to [[Philip Sidney]], [[Walter Ralegh]], and to [[Gabriel Harvey]] who reported they were fashionable in Oxford. His ideas on inflation were familiar by 1581.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Somerville makes the point that not all those who discussed sovereignty in England at this period necessarily took their views from Bodin: the ideas were in the air at the time, and some such as [[Hadrian à Saravia]] and [[Christopher Lever]] had their own reasoning to similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Somerville, ''Politics and Ideology in England 1603–1640'' (1986), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hooker]] had access to the works, but doesn't reference them.&lt;ref&gt;Secor, ''Richard Hooker'', p. 246 and p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]] cited Bodin in his ''Biathanatos''.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Somerville in Colclough (editor), ''John Donne's Professional Life'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin's view of parallelism of French and English monarchies was accepted by Ralegh.&lt;ref name="Cooper, p. 100"&gt;Cooper, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Twysden]] dissented: in his view, the English monarchy had never fitted Bodin's definition of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Beacon]] in ''Solon His Follie'' (1594), directed towards English colonisation in Ireland, used text derived from the ''Six livres'', as well as much theory from Machiavelli; he also argued, against Bodin, that France was a [[mixed monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Anglo, ''A Machiavellian Solution to the Irish Problem: Richard Beacon's Solon His Follie (1594)'', pp. 154–5 and note, in Edward Chaney and Peter Mack (editors), ''England and the Continental Renaissance'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Bodin influenced the controversial definitions of [[John Cowell (jurist)|John Cowell]], in his 1607 book ''The Interpreter'', that caused a furore in Parliament during 1610.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Elton]], ''Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government I'' (1974), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Coke]] took from Bodin on sovereignty; and like him opposed the concept of mixed monarchy.&lt;ref name="Cooper, p. 98-102"&gt;Cooper, p. 98-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bodin's ideas on authority fitted with the theory of [[divine right of kings]], his main concern was not with the choice of the sovereign. But that meant they could cut both ways, being cited by parliamentarians as well as royalists. [[Henry Parker (writer)|Henry Parker]] in 1642 asserted the sovereignty of Parliament by Bodinian reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hirst, ''England in Conflict 1603-1660'' (1999), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Whitelocke]] used Bodin's thought in discussing the [[King-in-Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, p. 98-102"/&gt; The royalist [[Robert Filmer]] borrowed largely from Bodin for the argument of his ''[[Patriarcha]]''. [[John Locke]] in arguing decades later against Filmer in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' didn't go behind his work to attack Bodin; but his ally [[James Tyrrell]] did, as did [[Algernon Sidney]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]], editor [[Peter Laslett]], ''Two Treatises of Government'' (1990), p. 181 note.&lt;/ref&gt; Another royalist user of Bodin was [[Michael Hudson (chaplain)|Michael Hudson]]. [[John Milton]] used Bodin's theory in defending his anti-democratic plan for a Grand Council, after [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir John Eliot]] summarized work of Arnisaeus as critic of Bodin,&lt;ref name="Cooper, p. 100"/&gt; and wrote in the [[Tower of London]] following Bodin that a lawful king, as opposed to a [[tyrant]], "will not do what he may do", in his ''De iure majestatis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Morrill]], ''The Nature of the English Revolution'', pp/ 288-9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bruce Cotton]] quoted Bodin on the value of money;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Oldham Appleby, ''Economic Thought and Ideology in Seventeenth-Century England'' (1978) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] on politics in the ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Knolles in the introduction to his 1606 translation commended the book as written by a man experienced in public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Charlton, ''Education in Renaissance England'' (1965) pp. 250-1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Loe]] complained, in preaching to Parliament in 1621, that Bodin with Lipsius and Machiavelli was too much studied, to the neglect of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;McCrea, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Baxter]] on the other hand regarded the reading of Bodin, [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Francisco Suárez]] as a suitable training in politics, for lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;William Lamont, ''Richard Baxter and the Millennium'' (1979), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin's views on witchcraft were taken up in England by the witch-hunter [[Brian Darcy]] in the early 1580s, who argued for burning rather than hanging as a method of execution, and followed some of Bodin's suggestions in interrogating [[Ursula Kemp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=68939|title=Darcy, Brian|first=Marion|last=Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Rosen, ''Witchcraft in England, 1558-1618'' (1969), p. 121–2 note; [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ij_8vgoKPgC&amp;pg=PA121 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; They were also radically opposed by [[Reginald Scott]] in his sceptical work  ''[[Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' (1584).&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=24905|title=Scott, Reginald|first=David|last=Wootton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Francis Hutchinson]] was his detractor, criticising his methodology.

===In Italy===
In Italy Bodin was seen as a secular historian like Machiavelli. At the time of the [[Venetian Interdict]], Venetians agreed with the legislative definition of sovereignty. In particular [[Paolo Sarpi]] argued that Venice's limited size in territorial terms was not the relevant point for the actions it could undertake on its own authority.&lt;ref&gt;Bouwsma, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Giambattista Vico]] was to take Bodin's cultural history approach noticeably further.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah Berlin]], Against the Current p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Papacy===
Works of Bodin were soon placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' for various reasons, including discussion of Fortune (against [[free will]]), and [[reason of state]]. The ''Methodus'' went on the Index in 1590;&lt;ref&gt;Bouwsma, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bellarmine]] as censor found it of some merit in its learning, but the author to be a heretic or atheist, critical of the papacy and much too sympathetic to [[Charles Du Moulin]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godman, ''The Saint as Censor: Robert Bellarmine between inquisition and index'' (2000), pp. 123–4; [https://books.google.com/books?id=7t74llzmoi4C&amp;pg=PA123 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Other works followed in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;Bouwsma, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; All his work was placed on the Index in 1628; the prohibition on the ''Theatrum'' continued into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Jean Bodin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venetian theologians were described as followers of Machiavelli and Bodin by Giovanni Amato.&lt;ref&gt;Bouwsma, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albergati Discorsi politici.jpg|thumb|Bodin mentioned on the title page of [[Fabio Albergati]]'s ''Discorsi politici'', in 1602. Albergati wrote against Bodin from 1595, comparing his political theories unfavourably with those of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouwsma, p. 300 and p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bellarmine's ''Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in temporalibus'' reiterated, against Bodin's sovereignty theory, an indirect form of the traditional [[papal deposing power]] to release subjects from the duty of obedience to tyrants.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Mousnier, ''The Assassination of Henry IV'', (English translation 1973), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jakob Keller]], in an apologetical work on behalf of limited justifications for [[tyrannicide]], treated Bodin as a serious opponent on the argument that subjects can only resist a tyrant passively, with views on the Empire that were offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Harro Höpfl, ''Jesuit Political Thought: the Society of Jesus and the state, c. 1540-1630'' (2004), p. 332; [https://books.google.com/books?id=HvRzWf1cWDMC&amp;pg=PA332 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Spain===
On 1583 Bodin was placed on the Quiroga Index.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Kamen]], Inquisition and Society in Spain, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Against tyrannicide, Bodin's thought was out of step of conventional thinking in Spain at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was recognized, in an unpublished dialogue imagined between Bodin and a jurist of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], that the government of Spain was harder than that of France, the other major European power, because of the more complex structure of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Elliott, ''Richelieu and Olivares'' (1991), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodin's view of witchcraft was hardly known in Spain until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ankarloo and Henningsen (editors), ''Early Modern European Witchcraft'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The oldest writing in the world - The Sumerian Stone Tablet.jpg|thumb|An example of writing from [[Sumer]]; partially deciphered stone tablet ]]

The '''Kish tablet''' is a [[limestone]] tablet found at '''Tell al-Uhaymir''', [[Babil Governorate]], [[Iraq]] – the site of the ancient [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]]. A plaster-cast of the artifact is today in the collection of the [[Ashmolean Museum]].

The Kish tablet is inscribed with [[cuneiform script|proto-cuneiform]] signs. It has been dated to ca. [[35th century BC|3500 BC]] (middle [[Uruk period]]), although some scholars believe it may be from somewhat later – Uruk IV period (ca. 3350–3200 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, John L., 1990 ''A Manual of Sumerian Grammar and Texts'', Undena Publications, p.266&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousands of proto-cuneiform documents dating to Uruk IV and III periods (ca. 3350–3000 BC) have been found in [[Uruk]].

The writing is still purely [[pictographic]], and represents a transitional stage between [[proto-writing]] and the emergence of the partly syllabic writing of the cuneiform script proper. The "proto-literate period" of Egypt and Mesopotamia is taken to span about 3500 to 2900 BC. The administrative texts of the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] (3100–2900 BC), found among other places at [[Jemdet Nasr]] and [[Tell Uqair]] represent a further stage in the development from proto-cuneiform to cuneiform, but can still not be identified with certainty as being written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], although it is likely.&lt;ref name="Woods 2010" /&gt;

The '''Llibre del Repartiment''' is a record book in which the king's scribes recorded the pledges of properties at the completion of a conquest.

Of course, the properties had been expropriated from the Muslims who had previously inhabited the island of Majorca.

===Bahá'í Faith===
Moshe Sharon is interviewed in the 2007 Israeli documentary film, "Bahais in My Backyard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2007 |title=Bahais in My Backyard, A Belfilms Production|language=Hebrew, English |url=https://vimeo.com/22467795#t=730s |access-date= September 28, 2016 |time=12 minutes, 10 seconds |location=Israel |publisher= firsthandfilms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Schory | first = Noemi | title = Producer's Statement | work = Bahais in My Backyard, A Belfilms Production | publisher = firsthandfilms.com | date = April 17, 2010 | url = http://www.firsthandfilms.com/index.php?film=1000184 | accessdate = September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the interview he states that the only Bahá'í academic chair in the world is in Israel due to his efforts in convincing Hebrew University to establish one and his efforts in finding a benefactor to fund the position. He also says that there are no descendants of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2007 |title=Bahais in My Backyard, A Belfilms Production|language=Hebrew, English |url=https://vimeo.com/22467795#t=730s |access-date= September 28, 2016 |time=12 minutes, 10 seconds |location=Israel |publisher= firsthandfilms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Sharon's denial of the existence of such relatives, there are, in fact, dozens, and one of Bahá'u'lláh's great-granddaughters is featured in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2007 |title=Bahais in My Backyard, A Belfilms Production|language=Hebrew, English |url=

===Islam===
Moshe Sharon believes that [[Western world|Western]] leaders fail to understand [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Lappin  |first= Yaakov |date= September 6, 2014 |title= Expert: No peace with Muslims, ever |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3304024,00.html |newspaper= Yedioth Ahronoth |location= |access-date= September 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "There is no fundamental Islam. There is only Islam full stop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Sharon |first= Moshe |date= December 24, 2003 |title= The Agenda of Islam - A War Between Civilizations |url= http://www.betar.org.uk/articles/betar1072264293.php | website= Betar UK |location= |access-date= September 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing the conflict in [[Bosnian War|Yugoslavia]], Sharon continues that "Wherever you have Islam, you will have war. It grows out of the attitude of Islamic civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Sharon |first= Moshe |date= December 24, 2003 |title= The Agenda of Islam - A War Between Civilizations |url= http://www.betar.org.uk/articles/betar1072264293.php | website= Betar UK |location= |access-date= September 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He furthermore argues that not only is there "open war, but there's also war by infiltration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Sharon |first= Moshe |date= December 24, 2003 |title= The Agenda of Islam - A War Between Civilizations |url= http://www.betar.org.uk/articles/betar1072264293.php | website= Betar UK |location= |access-date= September 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
Regarding the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], Moshe Sharon has said that there is "no possibility of peace between Israel and the [[Palestinians]] whatsoever, for ever" and that peace agreements with [[Arabs]] are "pieces of paper, parts of tactics, strategies... with no meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Lappin  |first= Yaakov |date= September 6, 2014 |title= Expert: No peace with Muslims, ever |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3304024,00.html |newspaper= [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |location= |access-date= September 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= HaLevi |first= Ezra |date= September 6, 2015 |title= Islamic History Expert: Muslim Peace with Israel?

===Iran===
Moshe Sharon said in an interview that "The only way to avoid military confrontation with [[Iran]] is to leave this military confrontation to powers bigger than Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Lappin  |first= Yaakov |date= September 6, 2014 |title= Expert: No peace with Muslims, ever |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3304024,00.html |newspaper= Yedioth Ahronoth |location= |access-date= September 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Calvocoressi.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Peter John Ambrose Calvocoressi''' (17 November 1912 &amp;ndash; 5 February 2010){{sfn|Anonymous|2010}} was a [[British people|British]] lawyer, Liberal politician, historian, and publisher. He served as an intelligence officer at [[Bletchley Park]] during [[World War II]].

==Early years==
Calvocoressi was born in [[Karachi]], now in [[Pakistan]], to a family of [[Greeks|Greek]] origins from the island of [[Chios]].{{sfn|Calvocoressi|2001|p=14}} His mother, Irene ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Ralli), was descended from one of the founders of [[Ralli Brothers]], who were prominent Greek families of Chios who came to London at the time of the [[Greek Diaspora#Modern times|Greek Diaspora]]. When he was three months old, the family moved to [[Liverpool]], [[England]].{{sfn|Anonymous|2010}}

Calvocoressi's father Pandia had spent the first seven years of his life in Manchester and the next ten at San Stefano (on the outskirts of [[Istanbul]]). He attended the [[Sorbonne]] from the age of 17 for three years and then joined the family firm in New York.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Pandia Calvocoressi and Irene Ralli  married in London in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Family Genealogy Pages: Pantias John (John) Calvocoressi |url = http://www.agelastos.com/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=i2028&amp;tree=agelasto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards Pandia was posted to India where Calvocoressi was born. His mother and maternal grandmother were both born in India but spent most of their lives in England.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

In 1926 he was elected a scholar of [[Eton College|Eton]] in second place, a position which he retained for the greater part of the next five years. Switching from the standard Classical curriculum to History, he was taught by, among others, the young [[Robert Birley]]. At [[Balliol College, Oxford]], in 1931–1934, he was tutored in Modern History mainly by B. H. Sumner and [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|V. H. Galbraith]], obtaining a First.{{sfn|Irvine|Tusa|2010}} 

==Career==
He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] in 1935 and worked in Chancery Chambers until the outbreak of World War II. He spent most of the war as an [[RAF Intelligence]] officer at GC&amp;CS [[Bletchley Park]].{{sfn|Calvocoressi|2001}} He worked in '[[Hut 3]]', where decrypted [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages were translated and analysed, and [[Ultra]] intelligence was prepared for dispatch to commanders in the field. Calvocoressi rose to be head of the Air Section, which dealt with [[Luftwaffe]] intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Calvocoressi | first = Peter  | year = 1980 | title = Top Secret ULTRA | publication-place = London | publisher = Cassell | isbn = 9780304305469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1945, he was accredited by British Intelligence to obtain evidence for all four Chief Prosecutors at the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg]].{{sfn|Irvine|Tusa|2010}} As a member of the British prosecution team, he cross-examined former German Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] during the trial.  Calvocoressi later advised the US Chief Prosecutor (General [[Telford Taylor]]), who had been his Bletchley colleague, in some of the American follow-up trials (1946–1949).{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

In 1945, he contested the General Election, as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate for [[Nuneaton (UK Parliament constituency)|Nuneaton]],{{sfn|Irvine|Tusa|2010}} finishing third.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}
 
In 1950&amp;ndash;1955 he worked at the Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs ([[Chatham House]]), writing five volumes in the series of ''Annual Surveys of International Affairs'', which had previously been written by [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Arnold Toynbee]]. From 1955 to 1966, he was a partner in the publishing firms of [[Chatto and Windus]] and the [[Hogarth Press]]. From 1966 to 1973, he was Reader in International Relations at the [[University of Sussex]], a post which was created for him.{{sfn|Irvine|Tusa|2010}}

In 1973 he was enticed back to publishing by the offer of the newly created post of Editor-in-Chief of [[Penguin Books]]. He was appointed Publisher and Chief Executive of Penguin in the following year. But he fell into disagreements with Penguin's parent company [[Longman|Pearson Longman]], and was removed in 1976.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

During this period (1955-1976) he was for ten years a part-time member of the [[United Nations]] [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]], and was Chairman of the Africa Bureau, the [[London Library]], Chios Charities, and [[Open University]] Enterprises Ltd. He also served on the governing bodies of Chatham House, the [[Institute of Strategic Studies]], and [[Amnesty International]].{{sfn|Irvine|Tusa|2010}}

He wrote twenty books, mostly on contemporary history; one of these – ''World Politics Since 1945'' – passed through nine editions. ''Threading My Way'', an autobiography, appeared in 1994. He set private life before and above his career and never had cause to question this priority.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

In 1990, he was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by the Open University.

[[Benjamin Disraeli]] was the Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] on two separate occasions, first in 1868 and then between 1874 and 1880.

==First government (1868)==
{{further|Conservative government 1866–68}}
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Benjamin Disraeli]], [[First prime ministership of Benjamin Disraeli]] --&gt;
In February 1868 the Prime Minister, [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]], received medical advice which told him that he could not fully recover from his illness whilst Premier. He therefore asked Benjamin Disraeli (who was [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the time) if he was ready to be Premier. Disraeli said yes, telling his friends, "I have climbed to the top of the [[greasy pole]]".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake, ''Disraeli'' (1966), pp. 485–87.&lt;/ref&gt; However his political position was weak—a caretaker in the minority.

Disraeli inherited a minority Conservative administration but was able to pass some notable Acts of Parliament. The [[Public Schools Act 1868]] established a board of governors for nine English public schools. The [[Telegraph Act 1868]] gave the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|Post Office]] power to nationalise all telegraph companies. The [[Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868]] abolished public executions.  Disraeli also appointed a Royal Commission on the Sanitary Laws chaired by Sir [[Charles Adderley, 1st Baron Norton|Charles Adderley]].
&lt;ref&gt;Blake, ''Disraeli'' (1966), p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliamentary Elections Act 1868]] transferred the power to try to punish electoral irregularities from the partisan Committee of the House of Commons to the impartial tribunal of judges. The judges objected to these new responsibilities imposed on them but their opposition was overcome and electoral irregularities were then tried in a legal tribunal rather than a committee of party politicians.&lt;ref&gt;William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, ''The Life of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume II. 1860–1881'' (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main domestic issue was the status of the Anglican Church in Ireland, where it was officially established although enrolling a small minority. It became the main election issue as well.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, ''Disraeli'' (1966), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:King Tewodros II.png|thumb|left|A [[John Tenniel]] cartoon that appeared in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' which showed [[Britannia]] threatening the jailer of the British prisoners, King Theodore II of Abyssinia]]

On 26 April news came of the result of Sir [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Robert Napier]]'s [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|expedition to Abyssinia]]. Napier had defeated the forces of [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Theodore II of Abyssinia]] and released the British prisoners: the British envoy and the British consul.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; In moving a motion in Parliament thanking Napier and his forces, Disraeli paid to tribute to Napier, who led his army with "the elephants of Asia, bearing the artillery of Europe, over African passes which might have startled the trapper and appalled the hunter of the Alps". He went on to say that Napier's troops "had to scale a mountain fortress, of which the intrinsic strength was such that it may be fairly said it would have been impregnable to the whole world had it been defended by the man by whom it was assailed". Disraeli famously said that "the standard of St. George was hoisted on the mountains of Rasselas".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the expedition was originally estimated by Disraeli's Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[George Ward Hunt]], to be £5m, raising the income tax from four pence to six pence to fund it. However, in 1869 the Liberal Chancellor had to meet a total of £9m. However Disraeli still defended the expedition, writing to a friend in 1875: "I do not look back to the Abyssinian [war] with regret: quite the reverse. It was a noble feat of arms, and highly raised our prestige in the East...Money is not to be considered in such matters: success alone is to be thought of".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second government (1874–1880)==
{{further|Second Disraeli ministry}}
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield]], [[Premiership of Lord Beaconsfield]], [[Premiership of the Earl of Beaconsfield]], [[Prime ministership of Lord Beaconsfield]], [[Prime ministership of the Earl of Beaconsfield]], [[Second premiership of Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Second prime ministership of Benjamin Disraeli]] --&gt;
The beginning of Disraeli's second premiership coincided with a growing demand for the [[Ritualism|Ritualistic]] controversy in the [[Church of England]] to be settled by legislation. The [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874|Public Worship Regulation Bill]] passed its first and second readings without a division in the House of Lords and, with amendment, passed its third reading without division.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 653-63.&lt;/ref&gt; After Gladstone came out against the Bill, Disraeli came out for it, accusing Gladstone of challenging the whole Reformation settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli urged the Bill to be passed in order "to put down Ritualism" and that he was prepared to respect Roman Catholicism practised by Roman Catholics but that he objected to the "Mass]in masquerade".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt; The second reading in the House of Commons was passed without division and most clauses of the Bill passed with massive majorities. However the Bill nearly failed to become law when there was a major dispute over the clause which the Archbishops in the Lords had given the Bill: that Bishops should have a veto to prevent "frivolous and irresponsible prosecutions of devoted clergyman".  There was in the Commons inserted a clause which gave the right to appeal against this veto to the Archbishop of the [[Ecclesiastical province#Anglican Communion|Province]], which passed with a majority of 23. The High Church party took up the right of a Bishop to uncontrolled rule in his diocese and the Lords dropped their insistence on the appeal to the Archbishop of the Province. Disraeli was worried that the Commons would not pass the Bill without the Archbishop's veto but he managed to persuade the Commons to pass it without the clause by appealing to the need to put down a "small but pernicious sect".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 665–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|A cartoon that appeared in ''Punch'' with the caption: "New crowns for old ones!", showing Queen Victoria exchanging with Disraeli the British Crown for the imperial diadem]]

Disraeli and the Queen were close, and she wanted an imperial title (her daughter had one in Germany). The [[Royal Titles Act 1876|Royal Titles Bill]], added the title Empress of India to the British monarch's official title. Despite Liberal opposition it passed into law with the assurance that the monarch would only use the Indian title externally; within the United Kingdom the monarch would still be King or Queen rather than Emperor or Empress in ordinary and official usage except when using the "I" after "R" in signature, "Emperor of India" in public proclamations and "Ind. Imp." on the coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 811.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli wanted the measure passed to let the world know that Britain would hold onto India: "It is only by the amplification of titles that you can often touch and satisfy the imagination of nations; and that is an element which Governments must not despise".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 805.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social reform===
The Disraeli government's programme of social reform began in the second session of parliament, 1874–75. This government, chiefly under the influence of the [[Home Secretary]] [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|Richard Cross]] and with the encouragement of Disraeli, addressed "the condition of the people" through major reforms in three areas: housing, savings and labour relations.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 703–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's watchword was "''Sanitas sanitatum, omnia sanitas''", which the Liberals decried as "a policy of sewage". Disraeli responded that sanitary reform included "most of the civilising influences of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 702-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The housing of the working classes was dealt with by the [[Artisan's and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875]] which for the first time gave local councils in large towns power to destroy slum buildings for sanitary reasons and replace them with new ones for [[artisan]]s. Councils would compensate previous owners for this expropriation and when six years later it was seen that claims for compensation were impeding councils from embarking on housing reform an [[Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Act (1868) Amendment Act 1879|Amending Act]] was passed which provided that if overcrowding had created a nuisance, compensation should be given only at the value of the house after the nuisance had been remedied, so that "grasping and callous owners should not profit by their misdeeds".&lt;ref name="Monypenny and Buckle, p. 704"&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Act was criticised by the [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] who believed in laissez-faire: [[Henry Fawcett]] MP scoffed at the Act and asked why Parliament should secure working-class housing and not that of dukes.&lt;ref name="Monypenny and Buckle, p. 704"/&gt;

The savings of the working classes were secured with the passing of the [[Friendly Societies Act 1875]]. This Act allowed [[friendly societies]] considerable self-management "but insured the adoption of sound rules, effective audit, and rates of payment sufficient to maintain solvency. It established the friendly societies, and with them the people's savings on a satisfactory basis".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 704–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli's government also passed two Acts which dealt with labour relations: the [[Employers and Workmen Act 1875]] and the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]]. Previously, a breach of contract by a worker was punished as a criminal act whilst an employer who breached a contract was only liable in a civil court. The Employers and Workmen Act made breaches of contract by a worker a civil offence and therefore made workers and employers equal before the law regarding labour contracts.&lt;ref name="Monypenny and Buckle, p. 705"&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 705.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act amended the law of conspiracy in favour of trade unions and legalised peaceful [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]].&lt;ref name="Blake, p. 555"&gt;Blake, p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli wrote to a friend that these Acts "will gain and retain for the Conservatives the lasting affection of the working classes".&lt;ref name="Blake, p. 555"/&gt; The Trade Union Manual of Labour Laws called these two Acts "the charter of the social and industrial freedom of the working classes" and in autumn 1875 the Labour Congress and one of the few labour members of Parliament, Alexander Macdonald, formally thanked the government for passing these measures.&lt;ref name="Monypenny and Buckle, p. 705"/&gt; Macdonald told his constituents in 1879: "The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 709.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Public Health Act 1875]] consolidated previous measures of public health and the [[Factory Acts#Factory Act 1878|Factory Act 1878]] consolidated all previous Factory Acts, of which the veteran campaigner for Factory Acts, [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], spoke strongly in favour of in the House of Lords.&lt;ref name="Monypenny and Buckle, p. 706"&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 706.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's government had previously passed a Factory Act in 1874 which reduced the working day for women and children to ten hours on a weekday and six hours on a Saturday. This was opposed by those Radicals such as Fawcett and 79 Liberals voted against it.&lt;ref name="Monypenny and Buckle, p. 706"/&gt; The [[Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876]] outlawed the flow of solid matter into rivers and compelled manufacturers to make sure the liquid flowing from their factories into rivers was harmless. This was again opposed by the Radicals such as Sir [[Charles Dilke]].&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 707.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Disraeli and his foreign minister [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] scored a number of achievements. In 1875 came the purchase of the controlling shares in the Suez Canal company. By negotiations, Russia gave up substantial gains in the Balkans and a foothold in the Mediterranean. Britain gains control of Cyprus from the Ottomans as a naval base covering the Eastern Mediterranean. In exchange, Britain guaranteed the Asiatic territories of the Ottoman Empire. Britain did not do well in conflicts in Afghanistan and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. K. Ensor,  ''England, 1870–1914'' (1936), pp 37-65. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.49856 online]&lt;/ref&gt;
====Suez Canal====
In 1875, the [[Khedive]] of Egypt had gone bankrupt and needed to sell shares in the [[Suez Canal]] (of whose traffic four-fifths was British) to gain money. Disraeli purchased 176,602 shares, or 44% of the Canal's total. This did not give Britain ownership, but it did give a strong voice and protection against adverse policies. The investment, financed by the Rothschilds, was financially profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, ''The House of Rothschild: Volume 2: The World's Banker: 1849-1999'' (1999) pp 297-304&lt;/ref&gt;  The market value of the shares rose from £4m in 1875 to £24m in 1898; by 1914 they were worth over £40m.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli acted alone in a matter of hours, without consulting Parliament.  The Liberals were opposed but largely kept quiet because the purchase was immensely popular. European governments were highly impressed, and saw it as evidence that Britain had finally abandoned her passivity and was embarking upon a "spirited foreign policy".&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Seton-Watson, ''Disraeli, Gladstone, and the Eastern Question: A Study In Diplomacy and Party Politics'' (1935) p 27&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Atkins, "The conservatives and Egypt, 1875–1880." ''The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 2#2 (1974): 190-205.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that ownership of the canal marked a new policy, that of an extended British commitment in Egypt, together with ensuring the imperial lifeline to India and Australia would not be controlled by France. Geoffrey Hicks replies that the commitment to Egypt was the unintended consequence of a pragmatic policy. Instead, the government's goal for the purchase was quite the opposite: to control the French risk and to otherwise minimize British entanglements in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hicks, "Disraeli, Derby and the Suez Canal, 1875: Some Myths Reassessed." ''History'' 97.326 (2012): 182-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Question====
{{main|Eastern Question}}
The "Eastern Question" was how the major powers would deal with the military and economic decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially in the face of Russian efforts to break it up and seize the best parts, such as the Straits.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Millman, ''Britain and the Eastern question, 1875–1878 (1979)''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, ''Disraeli, Gladstone, and the Eastern Question'' (1935) pp 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Like British leaders before him, Disraeli believed that an integral [[Ottoman Empire]] would be barrier to Russian advance in the Mediterranean, a move that was feared as a threat to the British Empire in India. Disraeli wanted to halt possible Russian advance in the Balkans whilst avoiding war. Gladstone and the Liberals were rallying public support by denouncing Turkish atrocities against Christian communities in the Balkans, most notably in Bulgaria in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Seán Lang, "Bulgarian horrors," ''Modern History Review'' (2005) 16#4 pp 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, ''Disraeli, Gladstone, and the Eastern Question'' (1935) pp 51-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rathbone, "Gladstone, Disraeli and the Bulgarian Horrors." ''History Review'' 50 (2004): 3-7. [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-128205771/gladstone-disraeli-and-the-bulgarian-horrors-mark online]&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli realized that his defense of the Ottomans was politically risky.  Nevertheless, in public he robustly declared (in November 1875) that British interests in the East were as important as any other power's. He said in November 1876 that if war were forced on Britain by Russia, Britain "would not terminate till right was done".&lt;ref&gt;R. C. K. Ensor, ''England, 1870–1914'' (1936), p. 42, quote p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] broke out in 1877 Disraeli's government declared Britain neutral as long as Britain's national interests were respected. These were the security of free communication with the East through the Suez Canal; Egyptian neutrality; and for Russia not to invade [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, pp. 46–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian foreign minister, [[Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov]], agreed to these proposals. The Ottoman victories under [[Osman Nuri Pasha|Osman Pasha]] and [[Suleiman Pasha (Ottoman general)|Suleiman Pasha]] roused traditional anti-Russian feeling in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Russia recovered from these setbacks and advanced into [[Adrianople]], Disraeli's government (on 23 January 1878) ordered the Mediterranean fleet of the [[Royal Navy]] into the [[Dardanelles]] to Constantinople and Parliament voted to raise £6m for military purposes. One week later Russia granted the Ottomans an armistice. However the Foreign Secretary, [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], and the Colonial Secretary, [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], resigned in protest (Derby returned when the order to send the fleet was rescinded).&lt;ref name="Ensor, p. 48"&gt;Ensor, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was rumoured a week later that the Russians were in Constantinople the government sent part of the fleet to the city "for the protection of life and property" and Parliament assented to the £6m without debate.&lt;ref name="Ensor, p. 48"/&gt; In response the Russians advanced their army and an outbreak of war fever occurred in Britain and a popular [[music hall]] song gave rise to the word "[[jingoism]]" to describe bellicose patriotism. On 19 February Russia agreed not to occupy [[Gallipoli]] and Britain agreed not to land any soldiers in Turkey.&lt;ref name="Ensor, p. 48"/&gt;

However, when the Russians and the Ottomans signed the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on 3 March, Disraeli's government viewed it as unacceptable due to its [[Pan-Slavism]].&lt;ref name="Ensor, p. 48"/&gt; Disraeli insisted that any European conference between the great powers must include the possible revision of the treaty. On 27 March Disraeli got the Cabinet's assent to call up the reserves and send to the Mediterranean a large number of Indian soldiers. Lord Derby resigned in reaction to this and was replaced by [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. Salisbury's Circular Note convinced Bismarck to a conference which could discuss the treaty and the [[Congress of Berlin]] met from 13 June to 13 July 1878. It included the heads of government of the great powers of Europe to discuss the "[[Eastern Question]]". The British plenipotentiaries were Disraeli, Salisbury and [[Lord Odo Russell]].

From the start Disraeli was "the lion of the Congress" and the centre of attention.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his opening address to the Congress in English rather than French, which caused a sensation and offended the Russians.&lt;ref name="Blake, p. 648"&gt;Blake, p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli achieved his goals regarding [[Bulgaria]] by intimating that he would leave the Congress if his demands were not met, and Russia gave way.&lt;ref name="Blake, p. 648"/&gt; During the Congress the [[Cyprus Convention]] (which ceded [[Cyprus]] to Britain from the Ottoman Empire in return for a defensive alliance) was announced: "a sensational stroke" which brought the plenipotentiaries attention back to Disraeli.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end the plenipotentiaries signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]].

When the British plenipotentiaries arrived back in England on 16 July they were met with popular acclaim. From [[Charing Cross]] to [[Downing Street]] there was an immense crowd singing patriotic songs. After arriving at Downing Street, Disraeli appeared at the window and declared that they had brought back from Berlin "Peace with Honour".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 1217–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech to the House of Lords, Disraeli asserted that through the Congress and the Cyprus Convention the threat to the British Empire was averted and that the threat to European independence in the Treaty of San Stefano had been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 1221.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyprus Convention was necessary to protect Britain's route to India: "In taking Cyprus the movement is not Mediterranean, it is Indian".&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 1226.&lt;/ref&gt; After Gladstone had denounced the Convention as adding to Britain's responsibilities and that it was an "insane convent" Disraeli, in a speech given on 27 July, defended it by claiming that a renewed Russia in "ten, fifteen, it might be twenty years" could invade the Ottoman Empire and march towards Constantinople. Disraeli claimed any party in power in Britain at that moment would wish to prevent Russian conquest of Asia Minor and that therefore the Convention was not adding to Britain's responsibilities but that the responsibility was already there.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 1227–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli then asked who would enter an insane convention: English gentlemen "honoured by the favour of their Sovereign and the confidence of their fellow-subjects" or "a sophistical rhetorician, inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity, and gifted with an egotistical imagination that can at all times command an interminable and inconsistent series of arguments to malign an opponent and to glorify himself?"&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, pp. 1228–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Commons endorsed the Treaty with a majority of 143; it passed without division in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Monypenny and Buckle, p. 1230.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli's biographer Robert Blake has consluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judged by the criteria of tactical skill and achievement of objectives, Disraeli's foreign policy was an undoubted success. As for the Berlin settlement, of course it was not perfect. No treaty ever is. But it was followed by almost as long a period of peace between the European great powers as the interval separating the [[Crimean War]] from the [[Congress of Vienna]]. As one of the two principal plenipotentiaries at Berlin Disraeli must share with Bismarck some part of the credit.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, pp. 652–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Landslide loss in the election of 1880==
Disraeli's preoccupation with foreign affairs and his long neglect of domestic issues cost him his prime ministership in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|election in 1880]]. Gladstone vehemently attacked the foreign policy of Disraeli (now known as Lord Beaconsfield) as utterly immoral. Historian Paul Smith paraphrases the rhetorical tone which focused on attacking "Beaconsfieldism" as a:
:Sinister system of policy, which not merely involved the country in immoral, vainglorious and expensive external adventures, inimical to peace and to the rights of small peoples, but aimed at nothing less than the subversion of parliamentary government in favour of some simulacrum of the oriental despotism its creator was alleged to admire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Smith|title=Disraeli: A Brief Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2yt0pm7FQsC&amp;pg=PA199|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith notes that there was indeed some substance to the allegations, but, "Most of this was partisan extravaganza, worthy of its target's own excursions against the Whigs."&lt;ref&gt;Smith p 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli himself was now the Earl of Beaconsfield in the House of Lords, and custom did not allow peers to campaign. His party was unable to deal effectively with the rhetorical onslaught. Although he had improved the organization of the Conservative Party, Disraeli was firmly based in the rural gentry,  and had little contact with or understanding of the urban middle class that was increasingly dominating his party. Besides issues of foreign policy, even more important thing Conservatives were unable to effectively defend their economic record on the home front.  The 1870s coincided with a long term global depression caused by the collapse of the worldwide railway boom of the 1870s which previously had been so profitable to Britain. The stress was growing by the late 1870s: prices fell, profits fell, employment fell, and there was downward pressure on wage rates that cause much hardship among the industrial working class. The free trade system supported by both parties made Britain defenseless against the flood of cheap wheat from North America, which was exacerbated by the worst harvest of the century in Britain in 1879. The party in power, of course, got the blame, and Liberals repeatedly emphasized the growing budget deficit as a measure of bad stewardship. In the election itself, Disraeli's party lost heavily up and down the line, especially in Scotland and Ireland, and in the urban boroughs. His Conservative strength fell from 351 to 238, while the Liberals jump from 250 to 353. Disraeli resigned on 21 April 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp 202-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 707-13, 717&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rufus L. Perry''' (March 11, 1834 - June 18, 1895) was an educator, journalist, and Baptist minister from Brooklyn, New York. He was a prominent member of the [[African Civilization Society]] and was a co-founder of the [[Howard Colored Orphan Asylum]], which developed from it. He was the editor of numerous newspapers and journals, most notably the ''National Monitor''. He was a prominent Baptist, and in 1886 he founded the Messiah Baptist Church, where he was pastor until his death. He was also a classical scholar.

==Early life==
Rufus L. Perry was born a slave on a plantation in Smith County, Tennessee on March 11, 1834&lt;ref name="Cathcart1881"&gt;Cathcart, William, ed. The Baptist Encyclopædia: A Dictionary of the Doctrines, Ordinances, Usages, Confessions of Faith, Sufferings, Labors, and Successes, and of the General History of the Baptist Denomination in All Lands: with Numerous Biographical Sketches of Distinguished American and Foreign Baptists, and a Supplement. Vol. 2. LH Everts, 1881. p907&lt;/ref&gt; to Lewis Perry and Maria. The family was owned by Archibald W. Overton. Lewis was a talented mechanic, carpenter, and cabinet maker, and secured the means to bring his family to Nashville where the Rufus was able to attend the school for free blacks taught by Sally Porter. Lewis escaped to Canada when Rufus was seven years old, and Rufus was brought back to the plantation where his education gave him the reputation of being "dangerous".&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p620-625&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1852 he was sold to a trader to be taken to Mississippi. However, Perry was able to forge a pass and after three weeks himself fled to [[Windsor, Ontario, Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Onofrio, Jan. Tennessee Biographical Dictionary. Somerset Publishers, Inc., Jan 1, 2000 p134-135&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Perry converted to the Baptist religion and soon after enrolled in the Kalamazoo Seminary in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] where he graduated in 1861. On or about October 9, 1861 he was ordained pastor of the Second Baptist Church at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. He later became a pastor in [[St. Catherine's, Ontario]], and [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

==African Civilization Society==
In 1862, Perry and Rev [[Henry M. Wilson]] formed the Colored Orphan Asylum of the African Civilization Society for the education and development of African Americans. The organization promoted schools throughout the country and founded the Asylum at Weeksville, Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7369815// |title=Colored Orphan Asylum at Weeksville|work= The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, New York) |date=April 28, 1868| page= 2|accessdate= November 8, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members included [[Daniel Payne]], [[Henry Highland Garnet]], Rev [[J. Sella Martin]], and [[Amos N. Freeman]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"/&gt; In 1869, Perry was general agent, superintendent of schools, and editor of the newspaper, and chairman of the building committee of the Society. The group fractured, and that year three officers, president Amos Freeman, director [[John Flamer]], and Perry brought a lawsuit against corresponding secretary Rev. Henry M. Wilson, which was not successful.&lt;ref name="Wellman2014"&gt;Wellman, Judith. Brooklyn's Promised Land: The Free Black Community of Weeksville, New York. NYU Press, 2014. p127-131&lt;/ref&gt; The Society closed in 1871, but the orphan asylum, later known as the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum, persisted and Perry served as its president into the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colored Waifs|publisher= The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, (Brooklyn, New York)|date= December 21, 1888| page= 1| accessdate= November 8, 2016|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7370305/colored_waifs_the_brooklyn_daily/|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalist and community leader==
Perry was a prominent member of the [[Weeksville, Brooklyn|Weeksville]] neighborhood&lt;ref name="Wellman2014"/&gt; and became a leader in the Baptist church and a well known journalist. In his career, he was editor of the ''Sunbeam''&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; an illustrated children's paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Headline|newspaper= The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, New York) |date=April 2, 1869| page= 4 |accessdate= November 8, 2016 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7369899/no_headline_the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinate editor of the ''American Baptist'', editor of the ''People's Journal'', and publisher of the ''National Monitor''. From about 1877 to 1887 he was corresponding secretary of the Consolidated American Baptist Missionary Convention and in 1887 was corresponding secretary of the American Educational Association and of the American Baptist Free Mission Society.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; In 1891 he was elected president of the New England Baptist Missionary Convention.&lt;ref name="Wellman2014"/&gt;

In 1883, when the Brooklyn Public Schools Board of Education contemplated closing the schools for African American children, Perry, [[Charles A. Dorsey]], and Rev. [[William T. Dixon]] led the fight to keep the schools open.&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"&gt;Taylor, Clarence. The black churches of Brooklyn. Columbia University Press, 1994. p19, 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, he organized the Messiah Baptist Church in Brooklyn. His congregation included a number of prominent Brooklynites, including [[Phillip A. White]], [[T. McCants Stewart]], Charles A. Dorsey, [[John Q. Allen]], [[Charles H. Lansing Jr.]] and W. H. Johnson.&lt;ref name="Eagle1888"/&gt;

He was also a scholar of classical ethnology and read Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. In 1887 he wrote a text, ''The Cushite, or the Children of Ham as seen by the Ancient Historians and Poets'',&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; which he published as a book in 1893 under the title, ''The Cushite, Or, The Descendants of Ham: As Found in the Sacred Scriptures and in the Writings of Ancient Historians and Poets from Noah to the Christian Era''.&lt;ref name="Wellman2014"/&gt; This work traces the history of black people to a "glorious past". In that way, his work fits in a literature which attempts to disassociate nobility or goodness with whiteness.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, Rodney S. Jr. Exegesis in Black and White, in Lange, Armin, Eric M. Meyers, and Randall Styers, eds. Light against darkness: dualism in ancient Mediterranean religion and the contemporary world. Vol. 2. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2010. p288-289&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction for the book was written by T. McCants Stewart.

In 1888, Perry was elected president of a national meeting of Baptists, which came to be a union meeting of the General Association of Western States and Territories, the Foreign Mission Convention of the United States and the American Baptist Missionary Union, with [[Charles H. Parrish]] Secretary. A major theme of the conventions was unity of African American Baptists and the consolidation of a number of bodies such as the Colored Missionary Associations and the Co-operation of the American Baptist Missionary Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Baptists in Council|work= The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee) |date=September 22, 1888| page= 4| accessdate= November 8, 2016|url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7315694/the_baptists_in_council_the_tennessean/|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Perry was among a delegation of African Americans to visit president [[Benjamin Harrison]], who was campaigning for reelection against [[Grover Cleveland]] (Cleveland would win the [[United States presidential election, 1892|election]]). After the meeting, Perry declared himself unsatisfied with Harrison, who was a fellow Republican, because Harrison was not satisfactorily active in putting an end to [[Lynching in the United States|violence against blacks in the South]]. Perry noted he was a lifelong Republican and would support other Republicans on the ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Says Harrison is No Good|work= The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, New York) |date=July 20, 1892|page= 10|accessdate= November 8, 2016|url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7370403/says_harrison_is_no_good_the/|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational honors==
Perry was awarded a PhD in theology from Kalamazoo Seminary,&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"/&gt; and received two honorary degrees. He was granted an honorary Doctor of Philosophy on May 17, 1887 by Simmons College of Kentucky, the day after delivering a commencement lecture&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Headline|work= Washington Bee (Washington, DC) |date=June 4, 1887| page= 3| accessdate= November 8, 2016 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7370010/no_headline_washington_bee/|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a doctorate of divinity by Wilberforce University in 1888.&lt;ref name="Eagle1888"&gt;{{cite news|title=No Headline|work= The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (Brooklyn, New York)|date=July 29, 1888| page= 11| accessdate= November 8, 2016|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7370126/no_headline_the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Perry married Charlott Perry. They had eight children, Edity, Rufus L. Jr, Arthur, Latha, Eudha, Minnie, David, and Hattie B.&lt;ref name="Wellman2014"/&gt; Perry's son, Rufus Perry, was legal partner of J. Douglas Wetmore.&lt;ref&gt;Sandweiss, Martha A.

On Sunday, June 16, 1895, Perry fell into a coma from complication of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rev Rufus L.

A '''sceat''' ({{IPA-ang|ʃæt|lang}}; {{abbr|pl.|plural}} ''sceattas'') was a small, thick [[silver]] [[coin]] minted in [[England]], [[Friesland|Frisia]] and [[Jutland]] during the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period.

==History==
[[Image:Thames sceatta 710 722430.jpg|thumb|Series U sceat]]
{{See also|History of the English penny (c. 600 – 1066)|label 1=Anglo-Saxon penny}}
Its name derives from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|sceatt}}'', meaning "wealth", "money", and "coin", which has been applied to these coins since the 17th century based on interpretations of the legal codes of [[Mercia]] and of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] under its [[kings of Kent|king]] [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]].{{sfn|Bosworth &amp; al}}  It is likely, however, that the coins were more often known to contemporaries as "[[Penny#Etymology|pennies]]" ({{lang-ang|peningas}}), much like [[penny (English coin)|their successor silver coins]]. They are very diverse, organized into over a hundred numbered types derived from the British Museum Catalogue of the 1890s and by broader alphabetical classifications laid out by British numismatist Stuart Rigold in the 1970s.{{sfnp|Rigold|1977}}

The huge volume of finds made in the last thirty years using [[metal detector]]s has radically altered understanding of this coinage and, while it is now clear that these coins were in everyday use across eastern and southern England in the early 8th century, it is also apparent that the current organization is in considerable need of adjustment.

==Legends==
{{Coin image box 1 double

| caption_left = '''[[Obverse and reverse|O:]]''' +{{sc|aldfridvs}} around central annulet.

}}
Sceattas rarely carry legends of any kind, though a small number do name the mint of [[London]] and others carry short [[Runic alphabet|runic]] legends such as 'Aethiliraed' and 'Efe', which probably refer to moneyers rather than kings.

==Imagery==
Although sceattas present many problems of organization, attribution, and dating, they also carry a breathtaking variety of designs bespeaking extensive [[Celtic art|Celtic]], [[Roman art|classical]], and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influences. These designs include human figures, animals, birds, crosses, plants, and monsters, all of which have been recently elucidated by Anna Gannon.{{sfnp|Gannon|2003}} Tony Abramson has published an illustrated guide for nonexperts.{{sfnp|Abramson|2006}} One series (U), has been linked to [[kings of Mercia|King]] [[Æthelbald of Mercia|Aethelbald]] of [[Mercia]] (716-57) on the basis of its iconography, though this attribution is tenuous and recent research suggests it is very unlikely. It has also been suggested on the basis of the iconography of certain sceattas that they were issued by ecclesiastical authorities, such as bishops or abbots. Minting may not have been a strictly urban or secular prerogative, and coins were used for many payments and purposes beyond pure commercial buying and selling.

==Minting==
{{Coin image box 2 singles

| image_right = Image:SeriesXrev.jpg
| caption_left = '''[[Obverse and reverse|O:]]''' Facing bust with beard and cross on either side.

| width_right = 150

| footer = Silver sceat of series X, [[Ribe]], [[Denmark]], {{circa|lk=no|710-}}20.
}}
Associating sceattas with particular mints or kingdoms is very difficult and must be based primarily upon study of find-spots. Most have been found by [[metal detector]] since the 1970s. In this way, it has been possible to attribute some types with considerable confidence, such as series H with [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] (and in particular [[Southampton]]) and series S with [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]]. In [[Denmark]], series X has been plausibly associated with the early trading center at [[Ribe]]. 

The chronology of the sceattas is also very hard to unravel. Some of the earliest series use the same designs as the pale gold [[thrymsa]]s (similar to the continental {{lang-la|[[tremissis]]}}; notionally one-third of a pure gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]) and, by analogy with coins from the better-understood [[Franks|Frankish]] material, can be dated to the 680s. It is known that sceattas were minted in the [[Frisia]]n town of [[Dorestad]] (just south of [[Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]]); they were a commonly circulating currency in the Frankish realm until the [[Carolingian Renaissance#Currency|monetary reform]] of [[Pepin the Short]] instituted at Ver in 755.{{sfnp|Riché|1993|p=81}}

The thirty or forty years after 680 saw the production and circulation of the 'primary series' of sceattas, which were generally of good metal quality and weight {{nowrap|(c. 1–}}{{nowrap|1.3 grams).}} They were largely minted in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and the [[Thames Estuary]], though a few were produced in [[Northumbria]] bearing the name of [[kings of Northumbria|King]] [[Aldfrith]] {{nowrap|({{abbr|r|reigned}}. 685–704).}} The 'secondary series', struck from {{nowrap|c. 710}} to {{nowrap|c. 750,}} saw a massive expansion of minting all over southern and eastern [[England]] to every major [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom. One or more types can be attributed with more or less confidence to [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]], [[Kingdom of Mercia|Mercia]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Northumbria]], and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]]. 

There was much copying and [[debasement]], and weight could fluctuate considerably {{nowrap|(c. 0.8–}}{{nowrap|1.3 grams).}} There are relatively few hoards from this period with which to construct even a relative chronology, and any new discovery could radically alter our current understanding. The end of the sceattas is especially difficult to pinpoint, and it is likely that there was a period of some decades in the middle of the 8th century when very few if any coins were being produced in [[England]].

'''Sergey Nikolayevich Shubinsky''' ({{lang-ru|Сергей Николаевич Шубинский}}; 1834–1913) was a [[Russia]]n [[historian]] and [[journalist]] who edited two widely read magazines concerned with the history of [[Imperial Russia]].&lt;ref name="shub"&gt;Глинский Б. Б. Сергей Николаевич Шубинский. (1834—1913 гг.). Биографический очерк. — СПб.: Тип. А. С. Суворина, 1913..&lt;/ref&gt;

Shubinsky had a successful military career from 1854 onward, retiring with the rank of [[Major General]] in 1887. He developed a keen interest in the comparatively recent history of his country while collecting hitherto unpublished anecdotes about [[Prince Potemkin]].

Shubinsky edited an illustrated monthly periodical, ''[[Old and New Russia]]'', in 1875-79, before setting up a more widely distributed magazine, ''[[The Historical Herald]]'', in 1880. He remained in charge of the periodical until his death in 1913. The publisher was [[Aleksey Suvorin]].&lt;ref name="shub"/&gt; Shubinsky also authored a splattering of historical articles for the [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]].

Shubinsky's main rivals in the realm of Russian historical journalism were [[Pyotr Bartenev]], the editor of ''[[The Russian Archive]]'', and [[Mikhail Semevsky]] with his own periodical, ''[[Russkaya Starina|Old Times in Russia]]''.

[[File:Bobr-Tylingo, Stanislaw.jpg|thumb|Stanisław Bóbr-Tylingo]]
'''Stanisław Bóbr-Tylingo''' (1919–2001) was a Polish-born historian who specialized in 19th-century Polish history, a Polish resistance fighter who after 1945 had to live his life in exile in Britain and Canada, and a decorated veteran of the Polish [[Warsaw Uprising]] in August–September 1944. For most of his adult life he was a professor of History at [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary’s University in Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada.

==Biography==
Stanisław Tylingo was born in Warsaw on 30 March 1919. His family were formerly owners of the estate Suderwa near Wilno (Vilnius), but because of participation in the [[Revolution of 1905]] had lost that property to Tsarist confiscation, and consequently had moved to Warsaw. There he attended the Gymnasium Tadeusz Czacki and the Lyceum Adam Mickiewicz where he passed his matriculation exams in the last days before the outbreak of World War II. Consequently, he had to pursue his university studies during the [[German occupation of Poland|German occupation]] in the (''tajne komplety'') [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground University of Warsaw]].

The German and Soviet [[Invasion of Poland|invasions of Poland]] in September 1939 caught him in a training camp in eastern Poland near the city of Grodno. Already while in secondary school (probably in 1937–38) he was initiated into the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]] (''Obóz Narodowo Radykalny'' or ONR), a nationalist conspiracy organization opposed to the then government of the "Colonels", and when Poland was attacked, he joined the ONR’s military force, the ''[[Związek Jaszczurczy]]'' (ZJ or Salamander Association), which later in 1942 became the National Armed Forces (''[[Narodowe Siły Zbrojne]]'' or NSZ; not to be confused with the Polish Government-in-Exile’s ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' or Home Army).

When the Soviets invaded from the east (17 September 1939), Stanisław joined up with the defenders of [[Grodno]] and fought a three-day battle with the Red Army in which the Soviets lost 800 men, 19 tanks, and four armored cars. The Poles nevertheless were overpowered by their two neighbors, so Stanisław destroyed his weapons and made his way back to Warsaw, where he continued to participate in underground activity against the German and Soviet occupation. He was involved in actions in both Warsaw and Kraków, and for a short time in Rzeszow and Radom. He became an instructor in the underground Infantry Military College of the NSZ, and was given the pseudonym Bóbr (Beaver), which, like many of his fellow soldiers, he retained for the rest of his life.

It was also during the time of the occupation that he began his historical studies at the underground University of Warsaw under the direction of Prof. [[Maria Ossowska]] in Philosophy, Prof. [[Tadeusz Manteuffel]] in Medieval History, Prof. Janusz Woliński in Modern Polish History, and Prof. Władysław Tomkiewicz in Modern European History.

The [[Warsaw Uprising]] of the Home Army on 1 August 1944 caught him in Warsaw. He belonged to that part of the NSZ that had subordinated itself in March 1944 to the command of the Home Army, and so he fought in the Uprising in the NSZ unit "[[List of military units in the Warsaw Uprising|Koło]]"; with his fellow students he formed the Academic Legion.&lt;ref&gt;Lucjan Fajer, Żołnierze Starówki: Dziennik Bojowy Kpt. Ognistego (Iskry, Warszawa, 1957), p.139.&lt;/ref&gt;  He fought in the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] district on the Redoubt of Senatorska – Miodowa Street where he became commander of a barricade from 7 to 14 August (and where his brother Marian was killed by a tank missile). He was one of five soldiers that obtained the capture of a German antitank cannon in Foch Street. Then to the end of August he was deputy commander of the squad that captured and then defended the left flank at the Polish Bank. Here he received a severe wound in his right leg, but it did not make him withdraw from the fighting.

His unit was one of the last to abandon the Old Town through the sewer system on the morning of 2 September 1944 at about 10:00 am.  A few minutes later the Germans took [[Krasiński Square]], where was located the last free opening to the sewers in Old Town, It took about six hours for him to pass through the sewers to the city center ([[Śródmieście, Warsaw|Śródmieście]]) during which time his injured leg was in constant contact with the putrefying matter in the sewer: but contrary to what one would expect his injury began to heal very quickly.

In the city center he held command of a position on [[Aleje Jerozolimskie|Jerozolimski Avenue]] in the Battalion of Captain "Barski" in the "Koło" unit, and on Chmielna Street where he lost his last friends in the ONR from before the war. A hand grenade explosion drove binoculars into his eyes, but fortunately he got back his eyesight. For his service in the Old Town he was awarded the [[Cross of Valour (Poland)|Cross of Merit]], and then as one of only four NSZ soldiers, he was decorated with the [[Virtuti Militari|Virtuti Militari Class V]] in Bracki Street directly from the hands of [[General Bór-Komorowski]], the overall commander of the Uprising. At the beginning of the Uprising he had been a corporal officer cadet; he left Warsaw as a second lieutenant, having received the highest possible Polish military decoration.

Upon surrender of the Home Army on 3 October 1944 along with the rest of the AK he became a German POW interned first in [[List of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany|Oflag Lamsdorf]], Silesia, and then [[List of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany|Murnau]], Bavaria. Upon liberation in 1945 he was assigned to the Holy Cross Brigade (''[[Brygada Świętokrzyska]]'', from the region of the Holy Cross Mountains in southern Poland) where he was given command of a platoon in the guard companies. It was there that he met his future wife, Captain Halina Reszke, Chief of the Auxiliary Women’s Service on the Staff of the NSZ.

Before the outbreak of World War II, he had had military training as a parachutist, and so after the end of the war he made a jump back into Poland in order to create a communication link and an evacuation route to free countries in the West from out of the now Soviet occupied Poland. In January 1946 he received leave without limit from the NSZ to pursue historical studies in Paris, which he completed with a doctorate under Prof. [[Pierre Renouvin]] in 1955. His thesis was on the diplomacy of the Polish Question in the time of Napoleon III. Halina Jadwiga Reszke, now his wife, also pursued her studies in Biology in Paris.

His first academic position was as ''worden'' of the Polish students at the [[University College Cork|Cork Campus]] of the National University of Ireland. Then in 1958 he secured a position as History and French language teacher at the [[Lingfield Notre Dame School|Lingfield School]] in Surrey in England. It was at this time that he began to publish articles on his specialty in the 'free' historical journals in Paris (''Revue Internationale d’Histoire Politique et Constitutionnelle'', and its successor ''Politique …''), London (''Bellona'' and ''Teki Historyczne''), and Rome (''Antemurale''). Also at this time he won acceptance as a corresponding member of the Polish Scientific Society in Exile (''Polskie Towarzystwo Naukowo na Obczyżne'' or PTNO). He obtained his Habilitation in the [[Polish University in Exile]] in 1964 under Professor [[Marian Kukiel|General Marian Kukiel]], who wrote of him that "he is at this moment one of the best historical experts on diplomacy in the time of the [French] Second Empire."

Likewise from 1958 he was a member of the Polish Historical Society in Great Britain (''Polskie Towarzystwo Historyczne w Wielkiej Britanii'') which society published ''Teki Historyczne - Cahiers d’Historie - Historical papers'', where he published 18 articles from volume 5 (1951–52) to volume 22 (2000–01), mainly on the diplomatic relations of the European powers re Poland in the period of the [[Crimean War]] 1854-56 and the [[January Uprising]] 1863; in volume 19 he published two articles on the topic of German diplomacy towards the newly restored Poland in the years 1918-1919. He was a long-standing member of the editorial committee of the ''Teki Historyczne'' and chairman of that committee for the decade 1981-1991 – and again up to his death in 2001 a member of the committee. He published 44 book reviews in ''Teki Historyczne'', the last of which were sent in just two months before his death.

From 1959 onward he began publishing his research in North America: in the ''Etudes Slaves'' (Montreal) and the ''[[The Polish Review|Polish Review]]'' (New York). Then in 1963 he obtained an appointment as Assistant Professor in the History Department of [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary’s University]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He (together with his wife teaching in the Biology Department) remained at SMU for the rest of his life. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1963, granted tenure in 1965, promoted to Full Professor in 1971, retired in 1984, taught part-time to 1986, and then made Professor Emeritus in 1988. During his retirement he wrote a history of the restored Polish Republic, 1919-1947 (337 pages in typescript).

Typically his publications were based on primary research in historical archives: in France, Britain, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, USA, and Istanbul. He never finished his last work, a history of Poland from origins to the mid 17th century on which he spent the last five years of his life (970 pages in typescript).  The work was cut short at 1650 by his sudden death, and he had intended to write a history of the Crimean War. He died rather unexpectedly by a stroke on 18 December 2001 and is buried with his wife (died 17 April 2010) in the Oakridge Memory Gardens, Sackville, Nova Scotia.[[File:GraveB-T1.jpg|thumb|Grave of Bóbr-Tylingo]]

Both Stanisław and his wife Halina remained Polish patriots throughout their lives. They entertained at their home many Polish friends, among them Prof. [[Stanisław Swianiewicz]] and Prof. [[Lillian Falk]] (both also faculty members at SMU), General [[Stanisław Kopański]], Professor General [[Marian Kukiel]], and many other accomplished people of Polish origin. The Bóbr-Tylingos were responsible for the creation of the Polish Association of Halifax-Dartmouth (1982), a Polish Apostolate with a Polish priest, a Polish School, Polish scouts, a Polish publishing house, and a Polish library. They both deserve well of Poles and Poland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5375">'''Technological evolution''' is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. This theory originated with [[Czechs|Czech]] philosopher [[Radovan Richta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böhme|first1=Gernot|last2=Stehr|first2=Nico|title=The Knowledge Society: The Growing Impact of Scientific Knowledge on Social Relations|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400947245|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mdDBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=radovan%20richta%20describes%20the%20radical%20transformation%20of%20society%20through%20technological%20development&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=27 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of technological evolution==
''[[Mankind in Transition|Mankind In Transition]]; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Masse|title=The Automated Society; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future|date=1993|publisher=Masefield Books|isbn=1879981025|url=http://massebloomfield.com/books/the-automated-society/|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] (which Richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:

===Development===
The pretechnological period, in which all other animal species remain today aside from some avian and primate species was a non-rational period of the early [[Prehistory|prehistoric man]].

The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a [[microscope]], manipulating heavy objects with a [[pulley]] and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.

The second technological stage was the creation of the [[machine]]. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort, and requires  only to control its function. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though [[windmills]], a type of machine, are much older.

Examples of this include cars, trains, [[computers]], and lights. Machines allow humans to
Tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.

The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the [[automation]]. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are [[digital watches]], automatic telephone switches, [[pacemakers]], and computer programs.

It's crucial to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology, and so all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, a chicken and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.

===Theoretical implications===
The process of technological evolution culminates with the ability to achieve all the material values technologically possible and desirable by mental effort.

An [[Economics|economic]] implication of the above idea is that intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour. Contracts and agreements around information will become increasingly more common at the marketplace. Expansion and creation of new kinds of institutes that works with information such as    universities, book stores, patent-trading companies, etc. is considered an indication that a civilization is in technological evolution.

This highlights the importance underlining the debate over intellectual property in conjunction with decentralized distribution systems such as today's internet. Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented. Growing amounts of information being distributed to an increasingly larger customer base as times goes by. With growing [[disintermediation]] in said markets and growing concerns over the protection of intellectual property rights it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age.

'''''The Arcanum''''' is a 1998 book by [[Janet Gleeson]] telling the story of the invention of European [[porcelain]] and the start of the porcelain industry outside [[China]] and [[Japan]].

The book details the events leading to the discovery of the formula for porcelain (the intended meaning of the book title), the ensuing start of the porcelain industry in [[Meissen]], and its rapid spread to other places in [[Europe]] in the 18th century. The characters of the plot are: 
*Augustus, 1670-1733, (king of [[Poland]] as [[Augustus II the Strong]], [[Elector of Saxony]] as Friedrich Augustus I, Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]] as Augustas II), who is desperate for a way to finance his spending, and has hopes on the wonders of [[alchemy]]. 
*[[Johann Friedrich Böttger]], 1682-1719, the teenage alchemist who gets imprisoned and forced, given the materials required, to come up with a reliable way to produce gold and who tries hard but ends up changing direction toward the search to find a commercially viable formula for porcelain, which in this period was more valuable than gold. Assisting [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]], a scientist who has already been experimenting with ways to make porcelain. Their approach, an attempt to bake [[clay]] at higher temperatures than had ever before been attained in European [[kiln]]s, yielded the breakthrough that had eluded European potters for a century.
*[[David Köhler]], who learned porcelainmaking while assisting Böttger, and developed the first enamel colors for [[Meissen porcelain]].
*[[Samuel Stölzel]], who learned porcelainmaking while assisting Böttger, escaped and helped start a rival porcelain factory in [[Vienna]], recruited Herold, repented, returned with Herold and developed the enamel colors further.
*[[Johan Gregor Herold]], an ambitious artist, who developed the colors and patterns to decorate the early European porcelain. 
*[[Johann Joachim Kaendler]], 1706 – 1775, a virtuoso sculptor/modeler who used the new material, porcelain, to invent an artform.
*[[Japanisches Palais|Dutch Palace]], containing King Augustus' precious porcelain collection.
*[[Meissen]], German town near the Polish border, with a prison ([[Albrechtsburg]]) where Bøttger was locked up, which was later [[Meissen_porcelain|turned into a porcelain factory]].

'''Thomas of Eccleston''' was a thirteenth-century English [[Franciscan]] chronicler. He is known for ''De Adventu Fratrum Minorum in Angliam''. It runs from 1224, when Franciscan friars first came to England, under [[Agnellus of Pisa]], to about 1258. He styles himself simply "Brother Thomas" and [[John Bale]] seems to have first given him the title "of Eccleston".

==Life==

He appears to have entered the order about 1232-3 and to have been a student at Oxford between 1230 and 1240. After the latter year he was stationed at the convent in London, but he does not appear to have ever held any office in the order.

==The chronicle==
&lt;div id="imggoatse"&gt;

The ''De Adventu'' is a collection of notes rather than a finished work. Incidentally it throws some light on the trend of early Franciscan events and thought in general.

Eccleston declares that he spent twenty-six years collecting material for his chronicle, most of the information it contains being derived from personal knowledge or verbal communication, although he seems to have had access to certain written documents now lost. He describes vividly what has been called the heroic period of the Franciscan movement in England. In spite of the absence of dates and of any chronological sequence and of its tendency to extol the English province above all others, his chronicle is accurate and reliable in all that concerns the establishment and spread of the Friars Minor in England.

==Editions==

Four manuscripts of the ''De Adventu'', all of which go back to one lost archetype, are known to scholars. The chronicle has been often edited; in part by Brewer in the ''Monumenta Franciscana'' ([[Rolls Series]], London, 1858); and by Howlett in the same series (1882); by the Friars Minor at Quaracchi (in Analecta Franciscana, I, 1885, 217-57); by Liebermann in the "Monumenta Germaniæ" (XXVIII, Hanover, 1885, 560-69).

There are at least two English translations of Eccleston's work. One by Father Cuthbert, O.S.F.C., "The Friars and how they came to England" (London, 1903), and the other by E. Gurney Salter, "The Coming of the Friars Minor to England and Germany" (London, 1926).

'''Vera Anstey''' ({{nee|'''Powell'''}}; 3 January 1889 &amp;ndash; 26 November 1976) was a British economist and noted expert on the economy of India. Anstey is most closely associated with the [[London School of Economics]] where she served as a lecturer and chaired the admissions committee, and with the wider [[University of London]] where she served as dean of the faculty of economics.

==Early life==

Anstey was born in [[Reigate]], [[Surrey]] on 3 January 1889. Her father was leather merchant James Powell and her mother was Mary Sophia Powell ({{nee|Higginbotham}}).&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/61350 |title=Anstey, Vera |last=Thomas |first=J.J.|work=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2004 |accessdate=2 July 2017 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family consisted of her parents, three daughters and three sons, with Vera being the second of the three daughters.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

She was schooled at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] and spent a year at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] studying German and music (piano and violin).&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt; Her education continued at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford School for Women]] where she studied for a diploma in [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt; Anstey would then attend the [[London School of Economics]] to study for a degree in economic history in 1909, graduating in 1913 with first class honours.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

==Academic career==

Anstey married Percy Louis Anstey in 1913. Percy was a former actor who had then studied sociology at the London School of Economics, before serving as the head of the economics department at the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt; He took the role of principle at the [[Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics]], [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai) in 1914 and Vera accompanied him to India.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

Her role in India involved examining students studying for a BCom degree at Sydenham College, in addition to her formal role, she  developed a strong interest in the Indian economy and began to collect significant quantities of economic data concerning the Indian economy.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

Her husband and Arthur, their youngest child, died from cholera during November 1920.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt; This resulted in Vera returning to the United Kingdom with their two surviving children. Anstey, by now in need of a job to support herself and her two children, would take a role as an assistant lecturer in economic history at the London School of Economics in 1921. She was promoted and became a lecturer in commerce during 1929, received a DSc (Econ) degree in 1930 and was appointed the [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]] reader in commerce in 1941.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

Anstey's teaching at the London School of Economics involved significant coverage of the economy of India, including responsibility for teaching courses on Indian trade and Indian production, initially to undergraduate students, and eventually to graduate students. She also established a seminar on Indian economic development which was well received and which she ran until 1965, and would write several texts concerning the Indian economy, which gained widespread recognition.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

Her work at the university also took in several administrative roles; she served as senior tutor and chair of the undergraduate admissions committee from 1939 to 1959, and aided in the university's relocation from London to Cambridge during World War II.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt; Anstey would go on to serve as dean of the school of economics for the wider [[University of London]] (of which the London School of Economics is a constituent college) during 1950 to 1954.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

The Government approached Anstey in 1950 to take a position on the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income, examining potential changes to taxation policy in the UK. Anstey served on the commission from appointment in 1951 to completion of the work in 1955.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

Anstey retired from a full-time position at the London School of Economics in 1954, remaining a part-time member of staff until finally retiring in 1964.&lt;ref name="Oxford Biography" /&gt;

A variety of roles were played by '''women in post-classical warfare'''.  James Illston says "the field of medieval gender studies is a growing one, and nowhere is this expansion more evident than the recent increase in studies which address the roles of medieval women in times of war....this change in research has been invaluable". He provides a 20-page bibliography of dozens of recent scholarly books and articles, most of them connected to the crusades.&lt;ref&gt;James Michael Illston, "'An Entirely Masculine Activity'? Women and War in the High and Late Middle Ages Reconsidered," (Thesis,  Department of History, University of Canterbury, 2009) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zeno brothers''', namely '''Nicolò''' (c. 1326&amp;ndash;c. 1402) and '''Antonio Zeno''' (died c. 1403) were [[Italy|Italian]] noblemen from [[Venice]] living in the second half of the 14th century, who were famous during the [[Renaissance]] for a possible but controversial exploration of the north Atlantic and Arctic waters. They were brothers of the Venetian naval hero [[Carlo Zeno]]. The Zeno family was an established part of the aristocracy of Venice and held the franchise for transportation between Venice and the [[Holy Land]] during the [[Crusades]]. ''Zeno'' is the [[Italianization]] of the [[Venetian language|Venetian]] surname ''Zen''.{{citation required|date=April 2017}}

==Letters and map==

Nicolò and Antonio are notable for a number of letters and map (called the [[Zeno map]]) published in the year 1558 by one of their descendants, also named Nicolò Zeno. This descendant was a historian with other published works on the history of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Robilant|first=Andrea|title=Irresistible North: From Venice to Greenland on the Trail of the Zen Brothers|year=2011|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-307-26985-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ufWhjuXMc08C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Zen+Brothers#v=onepage&amp;q=Zen%20Brothers&amp;f=false |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters, allegedly written by the brothers around 1400, describe a voyage of exploration that they say they underook throughout the [[North Atlantic]] (and by some interpretations to [[North America]]), under the command of a prince named [[Zichmni]] (who some have identified as [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]]).

The letters and accompanying map are controversial and are regarded by at least one historian as a [[hoax]], either by the Zeno brothers themselves or by their descendant who wrote a narrative which he said was based on what was left of letters that he had torn up as a boy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1989 Italian scholar Giorgio Padoan &lt;ref&gt;Padoan studied the "detailed descriptions that could have not been borrowed by others" -as geographer Von Humboldt stated- in the book written by younger Nicolo' about his father&lt;/ref&gt; published a study suggesting that there is some authenticity in their travels and that Nicolò is not to be found in any document between the years 1396-1400 (so he could have been at least in Iceland),&lt;ref&gt;Padoan, Giorgio. "Sulla relazione cinquecentesca dei viaggi nord-atlantici di Nicolò e Antonio Zen (1383-1403)." Quaderni Veneti 9 (1989): 7-104.&lt;/ref&gt; while Andrea Di Robilant has written a book on this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Di Robilant. "Irresistible North". Prologue&lt;/ref&gt;

==The letters==

The letters are divided into two parts. The first set contains letters from Nicolò to Antonio. The second consists of letters from Antonio to their brother Carlo.

The first letters (from Nicolò to Antonio) tell how Nicolò set off in 1380 on a voyage from Venice to England and Flanders. Evidence exists that such a voyage took place, and that Nicolò returned to Venice around 1385.

In the letters, Nicolò describes being stranded on an island between [[Great Britain]] and [[Iceland]] called [[Frisland]]a, which is described as being larger in size than [[Ireland]].

By chance Nicolò is rescued by Zichmni, who is described as a prince who owned some islands called Porlanda off the southern coast of Frislanda, and who ruled the duchy of Sorant, or Sorand, south-east of Frislanda. It has been suggested that Frislanda is in fact a stand-in for the [[Faroe Islands]] with individual islands mistakenly merged into a single landmass by Nicolò the younger, although Frisland and the Faroe Islands both appear on several maps, many hundreds of miles apart.

Nicolò invites Antonio to come to Frislanda with him, which he does, and stays for fourteen years. Under Zichmni's direction, Antonio attacks "Estlanda", which is ostensibly the [[Shetland Islands]], as indicated by the similarity of place names mentioned in the letters.

Zichmni then attempts to attack Iceland. After finding it too well defended, he attacks seven islands along its eastern side: Bres, Talas, Broas, Iscant, Trans, Mimant, and Damberc. All of these islands are fictitious. An alternate interpretation finds that in transcribing the letters the Zen brothers' descendant mistook a reference to "Estlanda" for "Islanda" or [[Iceland]], thus accounting for both the presence of those superfluous islands off Iceland and the mysterious absence of an equal number of islands off of the [[Shetland]] Islands. Further evidence in support of this claim is the similarity of place names in the Zenos' "Islanda" to modern day Shetland, for instance the island of [[Bressay]] for "Bres" and Danaberg sound near [[Lerwick]] for "Damberc".

Zichmni then builds a fort on Bres and leaves Nicolò in charge of it. Nicolò makes a voyage to [[Greenland]] and finds a monastery with central heating. According to the alternate interpretation cited above, in which the travellers had yet to leave Estlanda, the subsequent destination is in fact Iceland, explaining the presence of geothermal heating and other observations.

Zichmni receives word that a group of lost fisherman from Frislanda have returned after an absence of over twenty-five years. The fishermen describe making landfall in the far west in unknown countries called [[Estotiland]] and Drogeo. They claim to have encountered strange animals as well as cannibals, from whom they escaped only after teaching the cannibals how to fish.

Inspired by the tales of the fishermen, Zichmni undertakes a voyage to the west with Antonio in charge of his fleet. To the west of Frislanda (see [[Zeno Map]]), they encounter a large island called Icaria, which does not exist.

According to the letters, the inhabitants of Icaria greet them before they can make landfall. Only one person among the Icarians is able to speak a language that Zichmni understands. The inhabitants state that visitors to the island are not welcome and that they will defend the island to the last man if need be. Zichmni sails along the island looking for a place to make landfall, but the inhabitants chase him and Zichmni abandons the effort.

Sailing west, they make landfall at a promontory called Trin on the southern tip of "Engrouelanda". Zichmni likes the climate and the soil, but his crew find it inhospitable. The sailors return home with Antonio, while Zichmni stays on to explore the area and build a town.

==Controversy and criticism==

The account of the voyages given by the younger Nicolò continues to attract debate. Some of the islands they allegedly visited either conflate existing locations or do not exist at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lainema|first=Matti|title=A History of Arctic Exploration: Discovery, Adventure and Endurance at the Top of the World|year=2009|publisher=Conway|isbn=978-1-84486-069-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IkvmKuIKJeMC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=Zeno+non-existent++islands#v=onepage&amp;q=Zeno%20non-existent%20%20islands&amp;f=false|author2=Juha Nurminen |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=William James|title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576074220|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=Zeno+non-existent++islands#v=onepage&amp;q=Zeno%20non-existent%20%20islands&amp;f=false|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown the Zeno brothers were occupied elsewhere when they supposedly were doing their exploring.&lt;ref name="biographi"&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=592 "Zeno, Nicolo and Antonio" at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Venetian court documents place Nicolò as undergoing trial for embezzlement in 1394 for his actions as military governor of Modone and Corone in Greece from 1390&amp;ndash;1392.  He wrote his last will and testament in Venice in 1400, many years after his alleged death in Frislanda around 1394. There is disagreement about the brothers' whereabouts at the time of the supposed voyages, with some readings of archival records placing the brothers in Venice at that time. [[Andrea di Robilant]] suggests this interpretation is in error.

According to ''The Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'', "the Zeno affair remains one of the most preposterous and at the same time one of the most successful fabrications in the history of exploration."&lt;ref name="biographi" /&gt; Di Robilant disagrees, stating that the younger Nicolò was "a first-class muddler, not a fablemonger", whose inaccuracy was the result of second-hand retelling that still contains much of the truth of his forebears' voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Robilant|first=Andrea|title=Irresistible North: From Venice to Greenland on the Trail of the Zen Brothers|year=2011|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-307-26985-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ufWhjuXMc08C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Zen+Brothers#v=onepage&amp;q=Zen%20Brothers&amp;f=false|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
