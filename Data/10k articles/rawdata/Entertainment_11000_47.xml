Crandall &amp; Mercy were born four years apart, in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. They met at a local film festival in Kitchener and began watching films that they later discussed together. Being both filmmakers themselves, these discussions dealt with subjects like writing, acting, editing, music and so forth.

Eventually, they came up with the idea of using Mercy's camera equipment (with his wife working the camera) and filmed one of these discussions and posting it on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxIOB2kwGeo&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Armchair Directors" comes from the term "[[Back-seat driver#Related idioms|Armchair quarterback]]".

==Format==

Crandall &amp; Mercy consider themselves "discussionists" rather than "critics". Because of this, they don't use a rating system, but rather give their "best part" and "worst part" of each film discussed. They also invite viewers to take part in the discussion, either in the comment section on YouTube or on their [[Facebook]] page.

'''''Armillo''''' is a 3D action puzzle platformer developed by Fuzzy Wuzzy Games. It was released on July 3, 2014 for the [[Wii U]] on the [[Nintendo eShop]].&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonintendo.com/s/223775-armillo-delayed-to-may-12th |title=Armillo delayed to May 12th |last=Cassidy |first=Kevin |publisher=GoNintendo |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=June 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308064636/http://www.gonintendo.com/s/223775-armillo-delayed-to-may-12th |archivedate=March 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}

''Armillo'' is an [[action game|action]] [[platform game]] in which the playable character, an [[armadillo]] named Armillo, rolls around a 3D space. He has the ability to perform three primary actions: roll, jump, and boost. The game is designed around the concept of an [[obstacle course]], so the player is constantly being presented to various new [[puzzle video game|puzzle]]s, mechanics and challenges.

Gameplay has been likened to other games such as the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' series]], [[Super Mario Galaxy]], and the ''[[Super Monkey Ball]]'' series.&lt;ref name="destruct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Players primarily progress through levels by rolling Armillo and have the option to utilize the tilt controls of the Wii U's GamePad to do so. Armillo is aided in his quest through special abilities and power-ups such as a size boost and the Critter gun which fires the [[non-playable characters|non-playable]] Critters at Armillo's enemies.&lt;ref name="NWR" /&gt;

While the majority of the game takes place in a 3D world, there are unlockable 2D bonus stages in every single non-boss level.&lt;ref name="NinLife" /&gt; Purchasable upgrades, obtained using blue orbs collected in levels, also enable optional backtracking&lt;ref name="NinLife" /&gt; of previously completed levels.

== Development ==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Armillo was developed by Fuzzy Wuzzy Games for the Wii U, and is distributed on the Nintendo eShop.

'''''Beauties of the Night''''' (in Spanish '''''Bellas de noche''''') is a 2016 Mexican [[documentary film]]. It is the first production of the filmmaker María José Cuevas. The film shows a glimpse of the glory, sunset and resurgence of five of the main showgirls ([[Vedette (cabaret)|vedettes]]) that triumphed in Mexico in the decades of the 1970s and 1980s.

==Plot==
They were the ''Queens of the Night'' in late-night [[Mexico]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The names of the great ''[[Vedette (cabaret)|Vedette]]s'' illuminated the streets of [[Mexico City]] from the awnings of the great nightclubs, cabarets and theaters of the capital. But time passed. Nightlife changed in Mexico. New types of entertainment replaced them and the big ''vedettes'' seemed to have been forgotten.

Today, more than thirty years of its splendor in the nightlife of Mexico, ''Beauties of the Night'' explores the lives of five of the main vedettes of the golden years: [[Olga Breeskin]], [[Lyn May]], [[Rossy Mendoza]], [[Wanda Seux]] and [[Princesa Yamal]]. The film shows the viewer a deeper facet of the current life of these five vedettes. Women who, despite the years and having taken their life to the extreme, are full of life and with an enviable physical condition. Not only have they managed to reinvent themselves and survive in the entertainment world, but also in life itself. Between laughter and tears, the film reflects the passage of years, emotions and personal challenges for the lives of each of these women&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatopardo.com/portafolio/medios/bellas-de-noche/ ''Gatopardo: Beauties of the Night, Ladies of the Mexican Pop Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
* [[Olga Breeskin]]
* [[Lyn May]]
* [[Rossy Mendoza]]
* [[Wanda Seux]]
* [[Princesa Yamal]]

==Production==
The title of the documentary evokes the film ''[[Bellas de noche]]'', the first film of the so-called [[Mexican sex comedy|Cine de ficheras]], which dates back to 1975.

The idea of Cuevas to pay homage to these women arises from her childhood. Cuevas, daughter of the prestigious Mexican artist [[José Luis Cuevas]], had contact with several of these women, who were friends of her father. Years later, Cuevas had a meeting with Princesa Yamal, who performed an Arab dance in front of her, giving her the idea of producing this documentary, whose realization lasted for a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWcQETCFBEQ ''Beauties of the Night: Press conference in YouTube'']&lt;/ref&gt; The film delivers an exercise in which the contrasts of time come to light and unveils what lies behind the stardom. You can appreciate an honest, dynamic and effective exercise in which remains the curiosity to know more details. Although the documentary came from the idea of paying homage to these women, the relationship between them and the filmmaker María José Cuevas, became so close that they became a family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatopardo.com/portafolio/medios/bellas-de-noche/ ''Gatopardo: Beauties of the Night, Ladies of the Mexican Pop Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a prequel to ''[[Billa (2007 film)|Billa]]'' (2007) and focuses on how David, an ordinary man from the coastal regions of South Tamil Nadu, becomes Billa, a dreaded underworld don, with  [[Ajith Kumar]] reprising the role of the titular character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/66818.html|title=Billa 2's plot revealed|publisher=IndiaGlitz|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parvathy Omanakuttan]], [[Bruna Abdullah]], [[Vidyut Jammwal]] and [[Sudhanshu Pandey]] appear in supporting roles, all of them marking their debut in Tamil cinema.

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=February 2013}}
David Billa ([[Ajith Kumar]]), a [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] refugee along with several others, arrives at the town of [[Rameswaram]] in boat. After being interrogated by an arrogant civil servant, he is let into the refugee camp where he befriends Ranjith ([[Yog Japee]]). Billa makes his presence felt, when he slaps Muthu (Theepatti Ganesh), one of the rogue workers around, for making a derogatory comment. The refugee camp is constantly terrorised by corrupt police officer Raghubir Sinha ([[Krishna Kumar (actor)|Krishna Kumar]]). After witnessing the brutal murder of one of the inmates at his hands, Billa attacks Raghubir when he tries to forcefully detain one of his friends. Raghubir then gets Billa tortured in prison and vows to make him suffer. A few days later, Muthu calls Billa and Ranjith aside and promises them work. Billa and Ranjith are hired to transport fish from Rameswaram to Chennai. But unknown to them, the truck they were driving had diamonds inside, and Raghubir had alerted his men on the highway to catch them red-handed. As per the plot, they get caught in the check post, and after realising what had happened, Billa kills all the cops and drive the truck to its destination. Here they meet Selvaraj ([[Ilavarasu]]), who is pleased by Billa's loyalty and includes him in his businesses. Billa gets back and murders Raghubir and the civil servant. He then goes to meet his elder sister ([[Janaki Sabesh]]) and niece Jasmine ([[Parvathy Omanakuttan]]) in a church. When they see his gun, they realise he is involved in crime. Not knowing what to say, Billa simply walks away.

Kotiswara Rao ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) visits Selvaraj and asks him if he could help in selling off the heroin he had brought along with him. Billa volunteers to sell it off on a 5% commission in exchange. He sets off and delivers the heroin to a local thug who refuses to pay for it in return. In a brutal scuffle that ensues where one of Billa's friends is slaughtered, Billa takes out the thug and his men and returns with the money and heroin. Soon, Billa meets Koti's boss Abbasi ([[Sudhanshu Pandey]]), who is very impressed by the former and recruits him. After a party held at his club, he receives a phone call from the Russian mafia led by Dimitri ([[Vidyut Jamwal]]), telling him that his arms consignment has been held by the Indian coastal guards and he asks for his help. Billa and Ranjith retrieve the consignment for him and are congratulated by Dimitri for their work.

Soon, Billa learns his sister died and brings Jasmine with him to live in a big villa in Goa. Jasmine displays her feelings for him, but Billa does not reciprocate and is instead more concerned at her education and safety. Billa and Koti travel to Russia to meet Dimitri, who happens to own an arms and ammunition manufacturing unit with Koti, where he signs a deal with Dimitri without Abbasi's knowledge in presence of Jagdish ([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]), a corrupt Interpol officer helping these underworld criminals. Abbasi learns of this from Koti, and is furious at Billa's daring and disobedient behaviour. Tensions further increase when Billa beats up Satish Kumar ([[Rohit Khurana]]), the son of an influential minister Praveen Kumar ([[Dinesh Lamba]]), when he tries to misbehave with Jasmine in a party. Abbasi expresses his discontent and vents at him. Billa, surprised and enraged at his ingratitude, walks away with Ranjith. Billa, Ranjith, and Ram (Sarath Mandava) plot to venture into the drug business on their own during the carnival. At the carnival, Billa is betrayed by Ram and is brutally attacked. However, he survives, finishes off the assailants, kills Abbasi and Ram, and becomes the most powerful crime lord, extending his business without any boundaries. He also ropes in Abbasi's girlfriend Sameera ([[Bruna Abdullah]]), much to Jasmine's displeasure.

Dimitri arrives into the scene and tries to negotiate a deal with Billa. But Billa refuses for his low payment, and angered by his defiance and rebellion, Dimitri seeks to oust him. Dimitri seeks out the help of Koti, Satish, and Praveen to eliminate David. They proceed to kill Chief Minister Mohan Kanth ([[Madhusudhan Rao (actor)|Madhusudhan Rao]]), and the blame falls upon Billa. However, Billa is freed, and Koti kidnaps Jasmine, who is found in a field, tied up and her mouth gagged with duct tape. Billa rescues her and informs Sameera to come to a church to take Jasmine away to Malaysia for safety. But Sameera conspires against them and the goons, with the minister's son, arrive at the church and hold Billa and Jasmine captives. Billa, stabbed, is held to the ground and is mocked at by Satish, who slits Jasmine's throat. Unable to witness her death, Billa overpowers everyone and kills all the goons. This is the scene at which the film initially starts.

Meanwhile, in Russia, Dimitri is having an auction of his weapons, and Koti is present with him. He shows his factory in his computer via a series of webcams and much to everyone's shock, Billa is seen destroying his factory in Georgia. He also sees his delivery train go off course. Angered with fear, he kills Koti for not killing Billa, and he sets out himself to finish the task. The arms factory is destroyed by Billa and his friends. Dimitri arrives and follows his delivery train, when to his shock, the delivery train is blown by Billa, who would be waiting for him on his own helicopter. After an intense battle, Billa kills Dimitri.
In the concluding scene, Billa and Ranjith boards a plane, and the former's goons (Sameera, Police and Lawyer) are eliminated by Billa.

===Development===
In 2008, reports claimed that [[Soundarya Rajinikanth]] was planning to make a follow-up after noting ''[[Billa (2007 film)|Billa]]''{{'}}s commercial success, to be produced by [[Ocher Studios]] in association with [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/may-08-01/billa-07-05-08.html|title=Will Ajith do Billa – 2 ?|publisher=Behindwoods|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/tamil/exclusive/2008/soundarya-rajinikanth-billa-2-190508.html|title=Soundarya Rajini confirms Billa-2|publisher=Oneindia.in|date=19 May 2008|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sequel did not materialise and the idea was dropped, with Ajith Kumar, Vishnuvardhan and Soundarya getting busy with other projects.

In 2010, sources confirmed that Vishnuvardhan had finished penning the script for a prequel, which would star Ajith Kumar as the titular character again,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BREAKING NEWS: AJITH'S BILLA 2|publisher=Behindwoods|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/jul-10-05/ajith-vishnuvardhan-billa-28-07-10.html|year=|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would commence in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Moviebuzz|title=Vishnuvardhan to make Billa prequel!|publisher=Sify|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14951341|year=2010|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project became officially announced in late 2010, after Ajith Kumar signed up to the prequel and first production poster were published to the media.&lt;ref name="Billa2sify11"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's official: Ajith signs 'Billa II'|publisher=IndiaGlitz|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/61364.html|year=2010|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billa2sify"&gt;{{cite web|author=Moviebuzz|title=Breaking News- Billa 2 confirmed|publisher=Sify|url=http://sify.com/movies/breaking-news-billa-2-confirmed-news-tamil-klel6kcbgfc.html|year=2010|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further details were disclosed, with [[Suresh Balaje]], son of producer and actor K. Balaji, who produced the original ''Billa'' with Rajinikanth, and George Pius from Wide Angle Creations banner, being confirmed as the producer,&lt;ref name="Billa2sify11"/&gt; who would associate with Mumbai-based IN Entertainment Limited, a [[Hinduja Group|Hinduja group company]].&lt;ref name="Billa2sify"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiainfoline.com/Markets/News/IN-Entertainment-ties-up-with-Wide-Angle-Creations/5071125059|title=IN Entertainment ties up with Wide Angle Creations|publisher=Indiainfoline.com|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire production team of the ''Billa'' remake, including cinematographer [[Nirav Shah]], editor [[A. Sreekar Prasad]] and music director [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], were announced to be retained for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-02/news-interviews/28372663_1_vishnu-telugu-film-heroine|title=Vishnuvardhan's double dhamaka|work=The Times of India|date=2 February 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a turn of events, [[Vishnuvardhan (director)|Vishnuvardhan]] opted out of the project citing that his dates clashed with the making of his Telugu film, ''[[Panjaa]]'' (earlier titled as ''The Shadow'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-18/news-interviews/28614918_1_director-vishnuvardhan-venkat-prabhu-directed-mankatha-film|title=Vishnu cancels billa date|work=The Times of India|date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chakri Toleti]] who directed the 2009 [[Kamal Haasan]]-[[Mohanlal]] starrer ''[[Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)|Unnaipol Oruvan]]'' was subsequently signed on by the producers to direct the venture.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-22/news-interviews/28624795_1_ajith-billa-thala|title=Ajith gets new script, director for Billa 2|work=The Times of India|date=22 February 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Chakri Toleti held his first press conference stating that production would begin in late June 2011 and revealing that "''Billa 2'' would focus on how David, an ordinary man from the coastal [[Thoothukudi]] in South Tamil Nadu, becomes Billa, a dreaded underworld don".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/billa-2-to-start-by-june-end-news-kollywood-lfsoQhdhgia.html|title=Billa 2 to start by June end|publisher=Sify|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; David's character was afterwards widely reported to be either a refugee from [[Tamil Eelam]] or a Tamilian from [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/70525.html|title=How does Ajith become a don in 'Billa 2'?|publisher=IndiaGlitz|date=|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ajith-not-a-sri-lankan-refugee-in-billa-ii/239098-62-128.html|title='Billa II': Ajith not playing Sri Lankan refugee|work= [[CNN-IBN]]|date=|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the director and the producer refused to confirm the statements, disclosing only that the film would depict David's journey over a period of five years.&lt;ref name="articles.timesofindia.indiatimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-13/news-interviews/31158865_1_billa-thala-ajith-death-defying-stunts|title=Death-defying stunts, Ajith style!|work=The Times of India|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Vishnuvardhan's exit from the project, his script was also scrapped, and Toleti along with Ajith Kumar began penning a new script for the prequel.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt; Yuvan Shankar Raja only was retained from the original production team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/64393.html|title='Billa 2': Yuvan on board|publisher=IndiaGlitz|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the rest of the technical crew being finalised in the following weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-02/news-interviews/28646721_1_mankatha-ajith-billa|title=Ajith bonding with Yuvan|work=The Times of India|date=2 March 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemant Chaturvedi]], who hitherto had worked in [[Bollywood]] productions only, was signed on to replace [[Nirav Shah]] as the cinematographer after the latter's schedules clashed with the making of his other film, ''[[Vettai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/hemant-chaturvedi-is-billa-2-cameraman-news-tamil-lehlhliadcd.html|title=Hemant Chaturvedi is Billa 2, cameraman|publisher=Sify|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2011, Hemant Chaturvedi too moved out of the project, fearing that the delay in commencement of ''Billa 2'' may hurt his chances in Bollywood, and [[R.

Raa. Murugan, who had previously collaborated with Chakri Toleti in the [[Kamal Hassan]]-starrer ''Unnaipol Oruvan'', was appointed to write the dialogue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15151">A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain [[problem]], or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D. J. R. Bruckner. "How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass." ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes." ''New-York tribune'', November 07, 1920.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published from year 1883 to 1936). At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term ''caption'' in its present sense firstly appeared in [[English language]] only in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=caption&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century, at least in the U.S. press (for example, ''[[The San Francisco Call]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1912-01-07/ed-1/seq-17/ "The Sunday Call Will Pay $20 for the Best Title for This Picture." ''The San Francisco call'', January 07, 1912.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-03-23/ed-1/seq-11/ "What does this Picture mean?" ''New-York tribune'', March 23, 1920, p.11.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Connecticut Post|The Bridgeport Telegram]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/bridgeport-telegram/1921-12-20/page-30/ "$10 A Week for the Best Titles in Sunday Post Caption Contest" ''Bridgeport Telegram'', December 20, 1921, p.30.] newspaperarchive.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. [[Photo caption]] contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).

During the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper ''Izvestia'' Sunday supplement ''Nedelya'' (''The Week'') at the beginning of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnako.org/magazine/material/show_14096/ "Золотой глаз-Геолог и Мальтус".] odnako.org. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little later a newspaper ''Literaturnaya gazeta'' began to publish caption contests that became very popular and they are part of this newspaper up until now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/ "Что бы это значило?".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620052849/http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/# |date=2012-06-20 }} lgz.ru. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.

== Present situation ==
Although a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538831896448132 Russell Adams. "How About Never-Is Never Good for You?" ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 10, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The contest first appeared in 1998 and has been published regularly in each issue since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/02/your-caption-here Your Caption Here] The New Yorker. 2 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each week several thousand participants take part in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/seven-reasons-why-hard-to-win-caption-contest Seven Reasons It's Hard To Win The Caption Contest] Mankoff, Robert. 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, a very popular is the weekly caption competition on ''[[BBC]]'' website (''[[BBC News Magazine Monitor|Magazine Monitor]]'' section), held since 2006.

Along the traditional caption contests, there have appeared different forms of this [[genre]] such as anti-caption contests&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; for worst submitted caption and reverse caption contests where the most suitable picture must be submitted for a given caption. There are also caption contests devoted to particular themes such as [[history]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=9388 "Thursday Photo Caption Contest"] blogs.archives.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footytube.com/forums/funny-football/the-silly-captions-competition-2770/ "The Silly Captions Competition"] footytube.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the website caption.me &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caption.me/&lt;/ref&gt; (then captioncompetition.co.uk) was founded, featuring amusing photos loaded automatically from photo-sharing site [[Flickr]]. Visitors submit captions and vote for others. Caption.Me features a real-time collaborative mind-mapping feature called [http://www.caption.me/forum/discussion/557/maption-is-live#Item_0 Maption]

In 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called ''[[Caption That (Game)|Caption That]]'' where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionthat.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001151/http://www.captionthat.com/ |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the iPhone app [http://www.captionit.co Captionit] was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/waste-your-creativity-with-captionits-new-iphone-app-483131.htm/ Waste Your Creativity with Captionit's New Iphone App"] SBWire, March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionit.co/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, mobile phone application [http://tinnbin.com TinnBin] was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called "Bins" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called "Tinns". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tinnbin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Yorker'' magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest [[board game]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731102549/http://www.familyandpartygames.com/pdf/NY_instructions.pdf/ "The New Yorker Cartoon caption game"] familyandpartygames.com.

Also concerning the ''New Yorker'' caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from [[University of New Mexico]], Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523/ | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006 | volume=39 | title=Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males | journal=Intelligence | pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''The New Yorker'' editorial board and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Leeds School of Business]] in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 Leeds School of Business "What It Takes To Win The New Yorker`s Cartoon Caption Contest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204013344/http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 |date=December 4, 2012}} leeds.colorado.edu, April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future perspectives ==
The future of caption contests depends on the [[imagination]] and [[creativity]] of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]].

== In popular culture ==
In U.S. TV series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', seventh-season episode ''[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-office/episode-guide/season-7/42801/the-search/episode-715/281549/ "The Search".] "The Office" episode guide. nbc.com.

In [[British sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]'', the second series, episode six, its character [[Alan Statham]] wins a caption competition on the ''Consultant Radiologists International'' website, an organisation of which Alan claims to be an "Esteemed member".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/green-wing/episodes/ "Episode 6 – Season 2".] "Green Wing" episode guide. tv.com.

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.

'''Children's music''' or '''kids' music''' is music composed and performed for children. In European-influenced contexts this means music, usually songs, written specifically for a juvenile audience. The composers are usually adults. Children's music has historically held both entertainment and educational functions. Children's music is often designed to provide an entertaining means of teaching children about their [[culture]], other cultures, good behavior, facts and skills. Many are [[folk song]]s, but there is a whole genre of [[educational music]] that has become increasingly popular.

==History==

===Early published music===
The growth of the popular music publishing industry, associated with New York's [[Tin Pan Alley]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to the creation of a number of songs aimed at children. These included 'Ten little fingers and ten little toes' by Ira Shuster and Edward G. Nelson and '[[School Days (1907 song)|School Days]]' (1907) by Gus Edwards and Will Cobb.&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Axford, ''Song Sheets to Software: A Guide to Print Music, Software, and Web Sites for Musicians'' (Scarecrow Press, 2004), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best remembered now is "[[Teddy Bears' Picnic]]", with lyrics by [[Jimmy Kennedy]] in 1932 and the tune by British composer John William Bratton was from 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]]. ''Roots of the Classical: The Popular Origins of Western Music'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early recordings for children ===
Recordings for children were intertwined with recorded music for as long as it has existed as a medium. The first words ever recorded (in 1860 by [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]]) was the first verse of the French folk/children's song "[[Au Clair de la Lune]]". In 1888, the first recorded discs (called "plates") offered for sale included [[Mother Goose]] nursery rhymes. The earliest record catalogues of several seminal figures in the recording industry such as Edison, Berliner, and Victor all contained separate children's sections.

Throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s record companies continued to produce albums for children. Such companies as [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]], [[Decca Records]], [[Capitol Records]], and [[Columbia Records]] (among others) published albums based on popular cartoons or nursery rhymes. Recordings based on [[Walt Disney|Disney]] films and cartoons were released at that time by RCA Victor and Capitol Records, and beginning in the late 1950s by [[Disneyland Records]] and [[Buena Vista Records]]. Often the albums were read-alongs that contained booklets that children could follow along with. Many of the biggest names in theater, radio, and motion pictures were featured on these albums, such as: [[Bing Crosby]], [[Harold Peary]] ("The Great Gildersleeve"), [[Orson Welles]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]], [[Roy Rogers]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] ("Hopalong Cassidy"), [[Ingrid Bergman]], [[Danny Kaye]], and [[Fredric March]].

The role of Disney in children's cinema from the 1930s meant that it gained a unique place in the production of children's music. The first popular Disney song was 'Minnie's Yoo Hoo' (1930) the theme song from a [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon.&lt;ref name="Jasen2003"&gt;D. A. Jasen, ''Tin Pan Alley: An Encyclopedia of the Golden Age of American Song'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003), p. 111-13.&lt;/ref&gt; After the production of their first feature-length animation ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937, with its highly successful score by [[Frank Churchill]] and Larry Morey, which included the songs "[[Whistle while you work]]", "[[Some Day My Prince Will Come]]" and "[[Heigh-Ho]]", the mould for a combination of animation, fairy tale and distinctive songs was set that would carry through to the 1970s with songs from films such as ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940) and ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946).&lt;ref name="Jasen2003"/&gt;

=== Growth during the 20th century ===

The mid-20th-century arrival of the baby boomers provided a growing market for children's music as a separate genre. [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Ella Jenkins]] were among a cadre of politically progressive and socially conscious performers who aimed albums to this group. During this time, such novelty recordings as "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" (a [[Montgomery Ward]] jingle that became a book and later a classic children's movie) and the fictional music group, [[The Chipmunks]], were among the most commercially successful music ventures of the time ("The Chipmunk Song" was a No. 1 hit single in 1958). TV personality [[Bob Keeshan]] (''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'') recorded several children's albums, as did [[Shari Lewis]].

In the 1960s, as the baby boomers matured and became more politically aware, they embraced both the substance and politics of folk ("the people's") music. [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[The Limeliters]], and [[Tom Paxton]] were acclaimed folk artists who wrote albums for children. In 1969, the [[Children's Television Workshop]] in the United States launched ''[[Sesame Street]]''. The quality of ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s children's music, much of it created by noted composers [[Joe Raposo]] and [[Jeff Moss]], has dominated the children's music landscape to this day - the show has won 11 [[Grammy Awards]].

Children's music gained an even wider audience in the 1970s when musical features such as ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' and the original Letter People were featured on network and public television, respectively. These represented an effort to make music that taught specific lessons about Math, History, and English to youngsters through the high-quality, award-winning music. The classic public television children's show ''[[Mister Rogers]]' Neighborhood'' had music heavily featured as well. In the late 1970s, Canadian artist [[Raffi (musician)|Raffi]], coincided with the rise of children's music as a distinct music industry genre.

In the early 1990s, [[songwriter]], [[record producer]], and [[performer]] [[Bobby Susser]], emerged strongly with his easy-to-learn, award-winning young children's songs and series, ''Bobby Susser Songs For Children'' that exemplified the use of children's music to educate young children in schools and at home.&lt;ref&gt;''Educational Dealer'' magazine, August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Musical duo [[Greg &amp; Steve]] have focused on the positive reaction children have to music.

Disney also re-entered the market for animated musical features, beginning with ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) from which the song "[[Under the Sea]]" won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for best song.&lt;ref name="Jasen2003"/&gt; This was followed by successful features including ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991) ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994), the last of which had music by [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]], and ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995), all of which were awarded best song Oscars.&lt;ref name="Jasen2003"/&gt;

=== Recent history ===
In the United States, children's music continues to be a force in the commercial music industry. At one point in early 2006, the top three albums on the Billboard charts were all children's music: [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[High School Musical]]'' soundtrack, the ''[[Kidz Bop]]'' series, and the ''[[Curious George (film)|Curious George]]'' film soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002113930|title=Billboard News|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most albums targeted nationally to children are soundtracks for motion pictures or symbiotic marketing projects involving mass-marketed acts such as, [[The Wiggles]] or [[VeggieTales]].

The 21st century has also seen an increase in the number of independent children's music artists, with acts like [[The Dirty Sock Funtime Band]], [[Dan Zanes]], [[Parachute Express]], Cathy Bollinger, [[Laurie Berkner]] and [[Lah-Lah]] getting wide exposure on cable TV channels targeted to children. [[Trout Fishing in America (band)|Trout Fishing in America]] has achieved much acclaim continuing the tradition of merging sophisticated folk music with family-friendly lyrics. [[Secret Agent 23 Skidoo]] infuses hip-hop with family friendly messages and imaginative stories and is known as "The King of Kid-Hop". Also recently, traditionally rock-oriented acts like [[They Might Be Giants]] have released albums marketed directly to children, such as ''[[No!]]'' and ''[[Here Come the ABCs]]''. [[Jimmy Buffett]] simply remade his "[[Cheeseburger in Paradise]]" song into children's music with cleaned up lyrics ("Root Beer" instead of "Draft Beer").  His songs were already kid friendly with catchy lyrics and simple melodies punctuated with penny whistles and ship bell sound effects. Conversely, [[Koo Koo Kanga Roo]], a children-oriented comedy [[synthpop]] duo, made a successful crossover from performing children's events into touring with adult rock and punk bands such as [[Reel Big Fish]] and [[Frank Turner]]. In Canada, artists such as [[The Kerplunks]] have paved modern pathways to the genre following in the footsteps of Raffi, [[Fred Penner]] and [[Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram]].

Sanitized versions of earthy songs like Harry McClintock's "[[Big Rock Candy Mountain]]" have regularly been adapted for younger audiences. The 2008 version by Gil McLachlan re-tells the story as a child's dream, the last stanza being:
:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you're going on a holiday
:Your birthday comes around once a week and it’s Christmas every day
:You never have to clean your room or put your toys away
:There's a little white horse you can ride of course
:You can jump so high you can touch the sky
:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

Many children's stores and sometimes music outlets sell covers of pop songs, performed by adults for children, especially Christmas songs. These were especially popular during the early 2000s.

The use of children's music, to educate, as well as entertain, continued to grow, as evidenced in February 2009, when [[Bobby Susser]]'s young children's series surpassed five million CD sales.&lt;ref&gt;Educational Dealer magazine, April 2009, Industry news section, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016 Smithsonian Folkways Recordings label acquired the [[Bobby Susser]] series, to further the exposure of children's music that teaches as well as entertains, throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/battersby-duo/smithsonian-folkways-acqu_b_12285162.html|title=Smithsonian Folkways acquires Bobby Susser's New Hope Records Catalog|first=Battersby|last=Duo|date=4 October 2016|publisher=[[Huff Post]]|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As more children are using smart phones, tablets, laptops and smart-TVs, kids songs have entered the on-demand streaming content era. On YouTube, some children's songs, like "[[Baby Shark]]" and "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let it go]]", have surpassed 1 billion views, easily becoming some of the [[List of most-viewed YouTube videos|most viewed YouTube videos]] of all time.

A '''clip show''' is an episode of a [[Television program|television series]] that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a [[frame story]] in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]].  Clip shows are also known as '''cheaters''', particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before [[series finale]]s, or once [[100 episodes|syndication becomes highly likely]]. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).

==Origin==
Clip shows have their origin in theatrical [[short film]]s and [[Serial (film)|serials]]. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these '''recap chapters''' (also called "economy chapters"),
previous chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the [[Republic Pictures]] serial ''[[Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island]]''. Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and [[stock footage]] from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.

Movie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of [[The Three Stooges]] which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was  adopted because the studios could charge more money for "new" films than for old ones.

Animation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as "cheaters" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include ''[[Betty Boop's Rise to Fame]]'' ([[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1934), ''[[What's Cookin' Doc?]]'' (1944, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Schlesinger]]/[[Warner Bros.]]) and a regular yearly series of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]'' "cheaters" such as ''[[Smitten Kitten]]'' (1952, [[MGM cartoon studio|MGM]]).

==Variations==
One variant of the modern clip show is the '''compilation episode''', using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.

Another format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of ''[[All in the Family]]'' featured actor [[Henry Fonda]] discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on ''[[Three's Company]]'', hosted by [[Lucille Ball]]. This format was parodied in a clip show for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"), in which fictional actor [[Troy McClure]]&amp;mdash;a recurring ''Simpsons'' character&amp;mdash;introduced the clips.

A third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of ''[[Cheers]]'' featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host [[John McLaughlin (host)|John McLaughlin]] about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of ''[[Barney Miller]]'' aired after the death of cast member [[Jack Soo]], with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character [[Detective Sergeant]] Nick Yamana.

''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=98, Clerks: The Animated Series |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2017-04-18 |date=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005244/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' episode "The Ember Island Players", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. "The Ember Island Players" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.

The [[NBC]] sitcom [[Community (TV series)|''Community'']] used the clip show format with the episode "[[Paradigms of Human Memory]]", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of ''Community'', [[Dan Harmon]], used the same format in another one of his shows, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.

In [[anime]], a common type of episode is the '''Recap episode''', which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.

==Rationale==
While clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or "corny" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent "remembering").{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Daytime [[soap operas]] frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of ''AtWT''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50th anniversary.

Another common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series ''[[Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles]]'' used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' season 3 episode "The Straight Poop" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the "weekly" series had been broadcast. ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' resorted to producing ''five'' clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.

Other times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' had one more episode to shoot. However, [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for [[principal photography]]. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG 365"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=Paula M.|last2=Erdmann|first2=Terry J.|last3=Moore|first3=Ronald D.|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation 365|date=2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=9781613124000|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbTA9wMmEAC&amp;pg=PT330|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was "[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]", in which the "clips" were the induced dreams of a comatose [[William T. Riker]]. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG companion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nemecek|first1=Larry|title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=9780743476577|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah1k_EsaOHsC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in [[self-parody]], explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using "clips" from episodes which never happened.  The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)|City on the Edge of Forever]]" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream.  As another example, ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material.  The aforementioned ''Moonlighting'' clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the [[fourth wall]] to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a "new episode next week!".

The clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'']]. Many [[anime]] dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'' running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).

Sometimes clip shows air before or during a [[series finale]] as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''/''[[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Cheers]]''.

Clip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special ''[[Scotch and Wry]]'' was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. ''[[Carson's Comedy Classics]]'' compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' for airing in syndication. Surviving content from [[Bozo the Clown]] and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into ''[[Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics]]'', an annual holiday special.

'''''Dracula''''' is a [[superhero]] [[comic book]] series published by [[Dell Comics]], based on the literary and movie character [[Count Dracula]]. The book was part of a line of three superhero comics based on the [[Universal Monsters]] characters; the other two were ''[[Frankenstein (Dell Comics)|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Werewolf (Dell Comics)|Werewolf]]''.

==Publication history==
''Dracula'' lasted 3 issues from 1966 through 1967, numbered 2 through 4. (#1, published in 1962, was an adaptation of the [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|1931 film]]).  In 1972-73, Dell reprinted the series, numbering them #6-8 (the reason for skipping issue #5 is unknown).

==Series background==
'''Dracula''' is a modern-day direct descendant of the original [[Count Dracula]] now working as a medical researcher in the old family castle in [[Transylvania]] where, due to his experiments to develop a cure for [[brain damage]] using a serum developed from [[bat]] [[blood]], he accidentally gains strange "[[vampire]]"-like powers, including the ability to turn into a bat and superhuman sight and hearing.  He decides to embark on a superhero career in order to redeem his family name, developing his body through diet and exercise to the peak of physical perfection and designing himself his own distinctive crimson-cowled purple costume with a bat-shaped gold belt buckle, after which he vows to fight evil and [[superstition]] in all its forms. 

Leaving for America after the local peasants burn down his castle, he adopts the [[secret identity]] of "'''[[ Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Al U. Card]]'''" (a hastily chosen [[pseudonym]] short for "Aloyisius Ulysses Card").  In issue #4, his girlfriend and confidante, blond [[socialite]] '''B.B. Beebe''', gains the same powers and became his blue-clad sidekick '''Fleeta''' (from "[[Die Fledermaus|fledermaus]]", the German word for bat), bringing to the team not only a [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[judo]] but also an abandoned hidden underground government [[radar]] installation/[[bomb shelter]] on her family's mountain estate that Dracula uses as his secret laboratory lair.

==Dracula's Oath==
"I pledge by the strange powers which have become mine to fight against the injustice, corruption, evil and greed which fills this Earth in the hopes that somehow my example will be an example to all men."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1804">In [[List of motion picture terminology|motion picture terminology]], '''feature length''' is the length of a [[feature film]]. According to the rules of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], a feature-length [[film|motion picture]] must have a running time of more than 40 minutes to be eligible for an [[Academy Award]].&lt;ref name="oscars.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2008/08.12.29.html |title= 281 Feature Films in Competition for 2008 Oscar |accessdate=2010-09-22 |work= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher= |date=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[television film|Television movies]] and [[direct-to-video]] may also be feature length. An episode of a [[television program|TV series]] that has been extended may also be feature length. Such feature-length episodes are usually [[television pilot|series pilots]], [[television special|holiday specials]], or [[season finale]]s.

==History==
The earliest known feature-length [[fictional film|narrative film]] in the world was the Australian production ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906), which was 60 minutes in length. Five-[[reel#Motion picture terminology|reel]] features became common practice in the [[film industry|industry]] in 1915. During the [[silent film|silent era]] a one-reel [[short film|short]] ran for an average of 10 [[minutes]], and a two-reeler (usually a comedy) for 20 minutes, thus a feature was around 50 minutes or more. Possibly due to competition from television, the average length of feature film increased from around 90 minutes in 1931 to almost 120 minutes in 1960.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

'''Fire eating''' is the act of putting a flaming object into the mouth and extinguishing it. A '''fire eater''' can be an [[entertainer]], a [[street performance|street performer]], part of a [[sideshow]] or a [[circus]] act but has also been part of spiritual tradition in [[India]].

==Physics==
Fire eating relies on the quick extinction of the fire in the mouth or on the touched surfaces and on the short term cooling effects of water evaporation at the surface on the source of fire (usually with a low percentage of alcohol mixed in the water) or saliva in the mouth. This allows for igniting a damp handkerchief or a bill of money without it burning. Closing the mouth, or covering it with a slap of the hand cuts off the [[oxygen]] to the fire. Blowing on it can remove the very thin area of reaction from the source of fuel, and thus extinguish the fire in some cases, where the blown air is faster than the fire front and the flame is small enough to be entirely removed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=4x7QHE7sm2gC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=why+alcohol+burns+and+does+not+ignite&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wMvPZXlAF2&amp;sig=d2U4Ce3LXHm-IRoXgK_i6PzcDnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX2faDh-_RAhVEnRoKHd5mA1kQ6AEIVDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=why%20alcohol%20burns%20and%20does%20not%20ignite&amp;f=false Why alcohol burns and does not ignite] in Classic Chemistry Demonstrations published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. ([[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/103447/why-does-a-candle-blow-out-when-we-blow-on-it-our-breath-is-16-oxygen-and-only Why does a candle blow out when we blow on it?] (Answer on [[Stack Exchange]] physics questions site)&lt;/ref&gt;

The flame itself is not a [[cold flame]], and the performers do not use any other material besides the fuel. Certain materials are avoided when doing the trick, such as materials which may easily ignite, melt or store the heat and release it later. These include paraffin candles, plastic, and thick multithreaded rope.&lt;ref name="juggling"&gt;[http://www.juggling.org/help/circus-arts/fire-eat/fire-eat.html Fire eating instructions] including instructions repeatedly stressing the importance of an attending experienced skilled master, and giving instructions as to the recommended materials to be used. (juggling.org website)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and hazards==
Fire eating was a common part of [[Hindu]], [[Sadhu]], and [[Fakir]] performances to show spiritual attainment. It became a part of the standard sideshow acts in the late 1880s and was often seen as one of the entry-level skills for sideshow performers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/blitzs-book-of-magic-and-fire-eating-made-easy/oclc/317384178 Blitz' book of magic and fire eating made easy], Library of Congress catalog first published in 1880. (Following a series of books published since 1875)&lt;/ref&gt; although skilled fire performers, such as those who can use the difficult and dangerous vapor transfers and produce large breaths of fire are regarded as equals in the circus community for their skill and devotion to their art.

Other than sound fire safety precautions and some practical advice regarding the laws of [[physics]] (i.e. "hot air rises"), there are few secrets to eating fire. Torches do not burn with "[[cold flame]]s" nor is there any special substance in the performer's mouth other than [[saliva]]. It is instead the cutting off of the [[oxygen]] from the flame which extinguishes it and the evaporation of saliva with the water in the alcoholic solution which keeps the nearby surfaces cool while it is still burning. Even so, according to Daniel Mannix's 1951 sideshow memoir ''Step right up!'', the real "secret" to fire eating is enduring pain; he mentions that tolerating constant blisters on your tongue, lips and throat is also necessary. Many other fire eaters dismiss this, claiming that a skilled fire eater should not burn themselves. The most common method of safely performing fire eating acts relies on the fact that it takes time to transfer heat, and that heat rises in air. Fire eating and fire breathing (and all variants) is a skill which should be passed on from a skilled master to an appropriate student&lt;ref name="juggling" /&gt; and almost all teachings include instructions on first aid, fire safety, chemistry and other appropriate skills.&lt;ref name="juggling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3481926 | pmid=23130274 | doi=10.4103/2229-5178.93491 | volume=3 | title=Fire-breathing burn | journal=Indian Dermatol Online J | pages=73–4 | last1 = Saraf | first1 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/activity/s/spinning-arts/safety-docs/fire-eating-fleshing-safety.pdf Safety for Fire Eating and Contact Fire] (Retrieved from the [[MIT]] students portal)&lt;/ref&gt; Accidental ingestion of fuel or improper technique can lead to a serious condition known as [[fire eater's pneumonia]].

==Famous fire eaters==
A famous fire eater from the 18th century was [[Robert Powell (fire-eater)|Robert Powell]] who allegedly not only swallowed fire but also red-hot coals, melted [[sealing wax]] and even [[sulfur|brimstone]]. He performed, often in front of British and other European royalty and nobility, for nearly sixty years and, in 1751, was awarded a purse of gold and a large silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Miracle-Mongers-An-Expose-1.html ''Miracle Mongers and their Methods''], Houdini: particularly chapters II, V, VI . Retrieved on 2008-06-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not the earliest, the first to attract the attention of the [[upper classes]] was an [[Englishman]] named Richardson, who first performed in [[France]] in 1667. His methods were subsequently made public by his servant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-E8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA313&amp;lpg=RA2-PA315&amp;ots=ktt2h7zORF&amp;dq=powell+richardson+Panthot "Hot Meals"], ''The Every-day Book and Table Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements, Sports, Pastimes, Ceremonies, Manners, Customs, and Events, Each of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days, in Past and Present Times; Forming a Complete History of the Year, Months, and Seasons, and a Perpetual Key to the Almanac, Including Accounts of the Weather, Rules for Health and Conduct, Remarkable and Important Anecdotes, Facts, and Notices, in Chronology, Antiquities, Topography, Biography, Natural History, Art, Science, and General Literature; Derived from the Most Authentic Sources, and Valuable Original Communication, with Poetical Elucidations, for Daily Use and Diversion. Vol III.'', ed. William Hone, (London: 1838) p 314-16. Retrieved on 2008-06-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guinness World Records==

The most torches extinguished in one minute with the mouth (using multiple rods) is 99 and was achieved by Bret Pasek (U.S.) at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival in Shakopee, Minnesota, on 7 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fire-eating-most-torches-extinguished-in-one-minute/ |title=Fire eating – most torches extinguished in one minute |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2014-09-07 |accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest duration fire torch teething is 3 minutes 38.39 seconds and was achieved by Alexander Spitfire (U.S.) at Circo Draconum's Draco's Inferno in Hell's Kitchen Lounge Newark, New Jersey on August 30, 2015.

==Fire-eating tricks==
While trick categories (vapor, transfers, extinguishes, etc.) are recognized by most, it is important to note that specific trick names may vary greatly depending on the region of the world in which the student learned.

===Vapor tricks===
Vapor tricks use the fuel vapors held in the mouth during or before an extinguish.
* Cigarette light – light a cigarette with a Human Candle
* Human candle – slowly feed a candle sized flame with vapors you hold
* Vapor transfer – ignite one torch with the vapor from another
* Moonshot – shoot vapors straight up
* Fiery Kiss - Small amounts of fuel on the palm of the hand is ignited by a vapor pull, creating the effect of the performer blowing a kiss of fire.

===Transfers===
Transfers are methods of moving a flame from one area to another, by using the body, or another surface or medium.
* Body transfers – transfer the flame from one torch to the other with parts of your body, e.g. arm, leg, chest, buttocks, toes etc.
* Finger transfer – transfer the flame from one torch to the other with your fingers (most common form of transfer)
* Fire floor transfer – transfer the flame from one torch to the other on the floor
* Tongue transfer – transfer the flame from one torch to the other with your tongue

===Extinguishes===
Extinguishes are methods of extinguishing torches, and are the traditional hallmark of fire eating.
* The Blow Out – Using breath control to extinguish
* Multiple fire eat – basic fire eat with several torches at once
* Flaming cotton ball extinguish – put out a cotton ball as you would a torch
* Hand snuff – put the torch out by snuffing it with your hand
* Jellyfish extinguish – pull the torch down out of the flame to extinguish it

===Others===
* Teething – hold a lit torch by the wick in your teeth
* Immolation – passing any part of the body through the flame
* Retention – Holding a lit fire torch by your hand with the lit wick within your mouth for an extended period of time
* Straight snuff – Fire eating whilst keeping your head level
* Tongue rest – Letting the lit wick of a fire torch rest on the tongue
* Shotgun – lighting a trail of fuel on the body to light an unlit fire torch.
* Slow burn – Very slowly dragging a lit fire torch on the skin

[[File:Audrey Hepburn screentest in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Audrey Hepburn]] has been cited as the epitome of a gamine.]]
A '''gamine''' is  a slim, elegant young woman who is, or is perceived to be, mischievous, teasing or sexually appealing.

The word ''gamine'' is a French word, the feminine form of ''gamin'', originally meaning [[Street Urchin|urchin]], [[waif]] or playful, naughty child. It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.

== Lexicography ==
In 1997 the publisher [[HarperCollins]] drew up a list of 101 words – one a year – that defined the years 1896 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt; "Gamine" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in ''[[The Times]]'' as follows:

{{quote|An [[elf]]ish young woman. [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' was the archetypal, unforgettable, adorable gamine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Gamine'' has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word – of [[Anglo-Norman langauge|Anglo-Norman]] origin – is probably "waif" (although "gamine" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and [[chic (style)|chic]]). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario [[Andrew Oldham]] described the 17-year-old singer [[Marianne Faithfull]] as "shy, wistful, waif-like";&lt;ref&gt;''Faithfull – An Autobiography'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress [[Luise Rainer]] (b. 1910) as [[Paul Muni]]'s "waif-wife" in the 1937 film, ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oldie'', August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaminerie'' has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.

== In silent films ==
In the early 20th century, [[silent films]] brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born [[Mary Pickford]] (1892–1979), who became known as "America’s Sweetheart" and, with her husband [[Douglas Fairbanks]], was one of the founders of the film production company [[United Artists]]; [[Lillian Gish]] (1893–1993), notably in ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920); and [[Louise Brooks]] (1906–86), whose short [[bob cut|bobbed]] [[hairstyles, eponymous|hairstyle]], widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a "[[boho-chic|Bohemian]]" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris ''demi-monde'' before World War I and among London art students during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among the Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1936, [[Charlie Chaplin]] cast his then-girlfriend [[Paulette Goddard]] (1910–1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as "A Gamin") in one of his last silent films, ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]''.

== Audrey Hepburn and gamines of the 1950s ==
In the 1950s "gamine" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born actress [[Audrey Hepburn]] (1929–1993): for example, in the films, ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954) and ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by [[Colette]], who had personally "talent-spotted" her when she was filming in [[Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;Judith Thurman (1999) ''Secrets of the Flesh – A Life of Colette''&lt;/ref&gt; On film and in photographs, Hepburn’s short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring "look", well defined by Don Macpherson,&lt;ref&gt;''Stars of the Screen'' (Marks &amp; Spencer, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; who cited her "naïveté which did not rule out sophistication", and described her as "the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic".

Other film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included [[Leslie Caron]] (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''; [[Jean Seberg]] (1938–79), best known in ''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1957) and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]’s ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|À bout de souffle]]'' (1960); [[Jean Simmons]] (1929-2010), for example, in ''Angel Face'' (1952); and [[Rita Tushingham]] (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961). The French singer [[Juliette Greco]] (b. 1926), who emerged from [[Bohemian style#Post-Liberation Paris|Bohemian]] Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.

== 1960s and beyond ==
In many ways, the "gamine look" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: [[Jean Shrimpton]] (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the [[mini-skirt]] in 1965; [[Twiggy]] (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became "The Face of '66";&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/breakfast/4725427.stm "The face of '66"] ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kate Moss]] (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the "[[waif]]" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for [[Calvin Klein]] in 1997, became known as "[[heroin chic]]." Moss was part of a trend of "wafer" thin models which was satirized in [[Neil Kerber]]’s strip cartoon "Supermodels" in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.

Gamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic "[[Manic Pixie Dream Girl]]" stock character.

== Other gamines ==
Others who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress [[Anna Karina]] (b. 1940); American actresses [[Julia Roberts]] (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), [[Edie Sedgwick]] (1943–1971), [[Elizabeth Hartman]] (1943–1987), [[Mia Farrow]] (b. 1945), [[Sissy Spacek]] (b. 1949), [[Winona Ryder]] (b. 1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traill-Nash|first1=Glynis|title=Cream of the gamine crop|journal=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 April 2007|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/cream-of-the-gamine-crop/2007/03/31/1174761805542.html|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] (b. 1980), [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] (b. 1972),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A747453 The Austin Chronicle 2009-02-27].

Chan Marshall, 1972) ("The French, in particular, took to her gamine looks and confused air"&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Frere-Jones, ''The New Yorker'', 10 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Penelope Chetwode]] (1910–86), later Lady Betjeman, wife of the Poet Laureate, [[John Betjeman]], was described by Betjeman's biographer [[A. N. Wilson]] as "gamine of feature, but large-breasted".&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson (2006) ''Betjeman''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corinne Bailey Rae]] alleged that she was called a gamine in her song, "Choux Pastry Heart" (2005).

Japanese 1990s J-Pop rock band vocalist Maki Watase was called a "spry gamine firecracker" in a review in the New Music Express.

=== In film ===
Among the notable gamine characters of film are Gelsomina, the street performer from ''[[La Strada]]'', played by [[Giulietta Masina]]; Bree Daniels, the prostitute played by [[Jane Fonda]] (b. 1937) in ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) (whose hairstyle was sometimes referred to as the "Klute shag"); Nikita ([[Anne Parillaud]], b. 1960), the titular [[Punk subculture|punkish]] [[Substance dependence|junkie]] in [[Luc Besson]]'s [[Nikita (film)|1990 film]]; and, most recently, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) in the [[Amélie|2001 romantic comedy of that name]].

'''Global Orgasm''' was an action originally scheduled for 22 December 2006 by the author and activist couple of Donna Sheehan and Paul Reffell to coincide with the end of [[solstice]].&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/12/19/world-orgasm-day-to-promote-peace-in-war-torn-countries/|title=World Orgasm Day to Promote Peace in War-Torn Countries|date=December 19, 2007|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was for participants throughout the world to have an [[orgasm]] during this one day while thinking about [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/make-love-end-monogamy-war/2006/12/21/1166290676285.html "Make love; end monogamy war"], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Based on ideas such as that of the [[noosphere]] and the work of the [[Global Consciousness Project]] at Princeton, it was thought that such an event would have a "widespread positive effect on human well-being."

The "Second Annual Synchronized Global Orgasm for Peace" was scheduled for 6:08 (UTC) on 22 December 2007, the  moment of the solstice.&lt;ref name="FOX" /&gt;

==Competition summary==
The Google Lunar XPRIZE was announced at the [[Wired (magazine)#NextFest|Wired Nextfest]] on 13 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

The first team to do so would have claimed the US$20&amp;nbsp;million grand prize; while the second team to accomplish the same tasks would have been awarded a US$5&amp;nbsp;million second prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guidelines|url = http://lunar.xprize.org/about/guidelines|website = Google Lunar XPRIZE|access-date = 18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams also earned additional money by completing additional tasks beyond the baseline requirements required to win the grand or second prize, such as traveling ten times the baseline requirements (greater than 5,000 meters (3&amp;nbsp;mi)), capturing images of the remains of [[Apollo program]] hardware or other man-made objects on the Moon, verifying from the lunar surface the recent detection of water ice on the Moon, or surviving a lunar night. Additionally, a US$1&amp;nbsp;million diversity award was to be given to teams that make significant strides in promoting ethnic diversity in [[STEM fields]].

To provide an added incentive for teams to complete their missions quickly, it was announced that the prize would decrease from US$20&amp;nbsp;million to US$15&amp;nbsp;million whenever a government-led mission lands on and explores the lunar surface.&lt;ref name="GLXPabout2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Google Lunar XPRIZE|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/prize-details|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2013, the organizers and the teams agreed to drop this rule, as the launch of the Chinese [[Chang'e 3]] probe—which landed on the Moon in December 2013—approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/blog/new-player-return-moon|title=A New Player in the Return to the Moon|publisher=Google Lunar XPRIZE |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Google Lunar XPRIZE expired on 31 March 2018 as none of the five final teams were able to launch their vehicles by the deadline. Another extension of the deadline was ruled out by Google,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/22/google-will-not-extend-lunar-xprize-deadline.html|title=Google's $20 million race to the moon will end with no winner — and Google is OK with that|last=Sheetz|first=Michael|date=2018-01-22|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prize went unclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/39467-google-lunar-xprize-moon-race-ends.html|title=Ex-Prize: Google's $30 Million Moon Race Ends with No Winner|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Peter Diamandis]], the project founder, wrote on the official web page in 2007: {{cquote|It has been many decades since we explored the Moon from the lunar surface, and it could be another 6–8 years before any government returns. Even then, it will be at a large expense, and probably with little public involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/ |title=A Word From the Founders of X Prize &amp; Google |accessdate=16 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The goal of the Google Lunar X Prize was similar to that of the [[Ansari X Prize]]: to inspire a new generation of private investment in hopes of developing more cost-effective technologies and materials to overcome many limitations of space exploration that are currently taken for granted.

==History==

The Google Lunar XPRIZE was announced in 2007.&lt;ref name="ieee20140605"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Laursen|first1 = Lucas|title = Google Lunar Race Teams Discuss Next Steps, House on the Moon|url = http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/robotic-exploration/google-lunar-x-prize-summit|accessdate = 12 June 2014|publisher = IEEE Spectrum|date = 5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the prize===
[[File:Carnegie Mellon University Google Lunar X-Prize Moon Rover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Carnegie Mellon University]] lunar rover]]
Similar to the way in which the [[Ansari X Prize|Ansari XPRIZE]] was formed, the Google Lunar XPRIZE was created out of a former venture of Peter Diamandis to achieve a similar goal. Dr Diamandis served as CEO of [[BlastOff! Corporation]], a commercial initiative to land a robotic spacecraft on the Moon as a mix of entertainment, internet, and space. Although it was ultimately unsuccessful, the BlastOff! initiative paved the way for the Google Lunar X Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the prize|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-zGwqO5BwY|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, [[NASA]] was the planned sponsor and the prize purse was just US$20&amp;nbsp;million. As NASA is a federal agency of the United States government, and thus funded by US tax money, the prize would only have been available to teams from the United States. The original intention was to propose the idea to other national space agencies, including the [[European Space Agency]] and the [[JAXA|Japanese space agency]], in the hope that they would offer similar prize purses.&lt;ref name="thelaunchpad.xprize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that originally the Google Lunar X Prize was going to be the NASA Lunar X Prize (or the ESA or similar)? |url=http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2011/02/is-it-true-that-originally-google-lunar.html|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, budget setbacks stopped NASA from sponsoring the prize. Peter Diamandis then presented the idea to [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], co-founders of Google, at an [[X Prize Foundation|XPRIZE]] fundraiser. They agreed to sponsor it, and also to increase the prize purse to US$30&amp;nbsp;million, allowing for a second place prize, as well as bonus prizes.&lt;ref name="thelaunchpad.xprize" /&gt;{{when|date=June 2014}}

===Extensions of the deadline===
The prize was originally announced in 2007 as "a contest to put a robotic rover on the Moon by 2012,"&lt;ref name="Koman" /&gt; with a $20&amp;nbsp;million prize to the winner if the landing was achieved by 2012; the prize decreased to $15M until the end of 2014, at which point the contest would conclude. The five-year deadline was optimistic about schedule. Jeff Foust commented in ''Space Review'' that as the end of 2012 approached, "no team appeared that close to mounting a reasonable bid to win it."&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Foust, [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2164/1 "The Google Lunar X PRIZE at five: can it still be won?]" ''The Space Review'', 1 October 2012 (accessed 25 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the deadline was extended by one year, with the prize to expire at the end of December 2015, and the reduction of the grand prize from $20&amp;nbsp;million to $15&amp;nbsp;million changed from originally 2012 to "if a government mission successfully lands on the lunar surface."

On 16 December 2014, XPRIZE announced another extension in the prize deadline from 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2016.&lt;ref name="extended2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunar.xprize.org/press-release/deadline-30-million-google-lunar-xprize-extended-end-of-2016|title=Deadline For $30 Million Google Lunar XPRIZE Extended To End of 2016|date=16 December 2014|publisher=lunar.xprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the foundation announced another extension of the deadline. The deadline for winning the prize was now December 2017, but contingent on at least one team showing by 31 December 2015 that they have a secured contract for launch. On 9 October 2015, team [[SpaceIL]] announced their officially verified launch contract with [[SpaceX]], therefore extending the competition until the end of 2017.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

On 16 August 2017, the deadline was extended again, to  31 March 2018.&lt;ref name="2018-ext"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;nasaspaceflight.com&lt;/ref&gt; None of the remaining teams were be able to claim the Google X-Prize money due to the inability to launch before the final deadline.

===Objections to the Heritage Bonus Prizes===
Some observers have raised objections to the inclusion of the two "Heritage Bonus Prizes," particularly the Apollo Heritage Bonus Prize, which was to award an additional estimated US$1&amp;nbsp;million to the first group that successfully delivers images and videos of the landing site of one of the [[Apollo Program]] landing sites, such as [[Tranquility Base]], after landing on the lunar surface.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-walsh1-2009jun01,0,5840745.story|title=Space archaeology|first1=Jill|last1=Thomas|first2=Justin St P.|last2=Walsh|date=1 June 2009|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such sites are widely regarded as archaeologically and culturally significant, and some have expressed concern that a team attempting to win this heritage bonus might inadvertently damage or destroy such a site, either during the landing phase of the mission, or by piloting a rover around the site.&lt;ref name="SEED"&gt;{{cite web|last=Billings|first=Lee |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/preserving_tranquility/ |title=Billings, Lee, "Should the Sites of Lunar Landings Be Protected as PArt of our Cultural Inheritance?"  |publisher=SEED |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some archaeologists went on record calling for the Foundation to cancel the heritage bonus and to ban groups from targeting landing zones within {{convert|100|km|sp=us}} of previous sites.&lt;ref name="HD-Video Interview"&gt;[http://www.hdtvtotal.com/module-pagesetter-viewpub-tid-1-pid-1393.html "uncomPRESSed: Google Lunar X PRIZE – William Pomerantz"] Andreas -horn- Hornig, HDTVTotal.com, 1 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, the Foundation noted that, as part of the competition's educational goals, these bonuses fostered debate about how to respectfully visit previous lunar landing sites, but that it does not see itself as the appropriate adjudicator of such an internationally relevant and interdisciplinary issue. This response left detractors unsatisfied.&lt;ref name="SciAm2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matson |first=John |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=can-space-faring-companies-be-entru-2009-06-09 |title=Matson, John, "Can space-faring companies be entrusted with the Apollo program's history?," Scientific American, "60-Second Science," Comments, 9 June 2009 |publisher=Scientificamerican.com |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation pointed to the historical precedent set by the [[Apollo 12]] mission, which landed nearby the previous [[Surveyor 3]] robotic probe. [[Pete Conrad]] and [[Alan Bean]] approached and inspected Surveyor 3 and even removed some parts from it to be returned to Earth for study; new scientific results from that heritage visit, on the exposure of manmade objects to conditions in outer space, were still being published in leading papers nearly four decades later.&lt;ref name="NASASurv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/20jun_apollorelic/ |title=Apollo Relic Reveals its Secrets |publisher=NASA |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Surveyor 3 and Apollo 12 were both NASA missions, there was no controversy at the time.

In January 2011, NASA's manager for lunar commercial space noted on Twitter that work was underway to provide insight and guidelines on how lunar heritage sites could be protected while still allowing visitations that could yield critical science.&lt;ref name="Twitter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rmkelso/status/28216037832925184 |title=Twitter / @Rob Kelso – Great meeting yesterday at ...  |publisher=NASA |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in July 2011, NASA issued ''Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities: How to Protect and Preserve the Historic and Scientific Value of U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts''.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/617743main_NASA-USG_LUNAR_HISTORIC_SITES_RevA-508.pdf |title=Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities: How to Protect and Preserve the Historic and Scientific Value of U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts |author=[[NASA]] |orig-year=First published 20 July 2011 |date=28 October 2011 |access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These guidelines were developed with the assistance of Beth O'Leary, an anthropology professor at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, and a recognized leader in the emerging field of [[space archaeology]].&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/13346-nasa-guidelines-protect-apollo-moon-landing-sites.html|title=NASA Sets Guidelines to Preserve Apollo Moon Landing Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are only guidelines and recommendations and are not enforceable beyond the possibility of "moral sanctions."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/science/space/a-push-for-historic-preservation-on-the-moon.html|title=A Push for Historic Preservation on the Moon|first=Kenneth|last=Chang|date=23 January 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An organization called [[For All Moonkind, Inc.]] is now working to develop an international treaty that will include enforceable provisions designed to manage access to the Apollo sites and protect and preserve those sites, as well as others on the Moon, as the common heritage of all humankind.&lt;ref name="For All Moonkind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forallmoonkind.org/|title=For All Moonkind - Preserving Our First Off World Footsteps|website=forallmoonkind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some of the Apollo astronauts themselves have expressed support for the bonus, with [[Apollo 11]] Moonwalker [[Buzz Aldrin]] appearing at the Google Lunar XPRIZE's initial announcement and reading a plaque signed by the majority of his fellow surviving Apollo Astronauts.&lt;ref name="Aldrin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35qjYeddq9k |title=Buzz Aldrin at the Google Lunar X PRIZE Launch |publisher=X PRIZE Foundation |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prize not won===
On 23 January 2018, the X Prize Foundation announced that "no team would be able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the [31 March 2018] deadline... and the {{USD|30 million}} Google Lunar XPRIZE will go unclaimed."&lt;ref name=sn20170123&gt;

That deadline has been extended several times in the past, but foundation officials previously said there would be no further extensions of the competition. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitors==
Registration in the Google Lunar X Prize closed by 31 December 2010. The complete roster of 32 teams was announced in February 2011. By January 2017, there were just five officially registered Google Lunar X Prize teams continuing to pursue the prize objectives, as other teams had left the competition entirely, failed to achieve a competition interim [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]], or merged with other teams:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunar.xprize.org/news/blog/meet-5-teams-are-launching-moon-year|title=Meet The 5 Teams That Are Launching To The Moon This Year|date=24 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially 32 teams were registered, with 16 teams having actively participated in all activities and only 5 teams satisfying the rule requiring a verified launch contract by 31 December 2016.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Shortly after the announcement of the complete roster of teams, an X Prize Foundation official noted that a total of thirty one teams entered a partial registration program by filing a "Letter of Intent" to compete; of these, twenty did indeed register or join other registered teams, while eleven ultimately did not register.&lt;ref name=LOI&gt;

==Terrestrial Milestone Prizes==

===Overview===
In November 2013 the X-Prize organization announced that several milestone prizes will be awarded to teams for demonstrating key technologies prior to the actual mission. A total of {{USD|6 million}} was awarded throughout 2014 for achieving the following milestones:&lt;ref name="milestone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/prize-details/milestone-prizes|title=Regulations – Milestone Prizes|publisher=Google Lunar X-Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* $1&amp;nbsp;million (for up to 3 teams) for the ''Lander System Milestone Prize'' to demonstrate hardware and software that enables a soft-landing on the Moon.
* $500,000 (for up to 4 teams) for the ''Mobility Subsystem Milestone Prize'' to demonstrate a mobility system that allows the craft to move 500 meters after landing.
* $250,000 (for up to 4 teams) for the ''Imaging Subsystem Milestone Prize'' for producing "Mooncasts" consisting of high-quality images and video on the lunar surface.

===Selected teams===
In February 2014, a judging panel selected five teams which could compete for several interim prizes based on their proposals to achieve particular goals. The teams and their ultimate awards were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/media/press-releases/google-lunar-xprize-selects-five-teams-compete-6-million-milestone-prizes|title=Google Lunar XPRIZE Selects Five Teams to Compete for $6 Million in Milestone Prizes|publisher=googlelunarxprize.org|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heliopolis Sporting Club''' ('''HSC''', {{lang-ar|نادى هليوبوليس الرياضى}}, [[Arabic transliteration|transliteration]]: ''nādī heliopolis al-reyādī'') is one of Egypt's major sporting clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panoramio.com/photo/6908898 Heliopolis Sporting Club], [[Panoramio]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Heliopolis-Sporting-Club-HSC/24546039208 Heliopolis Sporting Club (H.S.C)], [[Facebook]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club's history ==
Heliopolis Sporting Club was founded in [[Cairo]] on January 1, 1910, by the [[Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oases Company]], which managed the club until December 31, 1921. On January 1, 1922, the club members took over the management by a contract signed with the company.

The activities of the club included [[water polo]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[Cricket (sport)|cricket]], [[field hockey|hockey]], [[Contract bridge|bridge]], [[bowling]], soccer, handball, basketball, Volleyball, Speed ball, Ballet, Gymnastics, Snooker, Athletics and different kinds of [[dancing]].

In 1947, the area of the club was reduced to its present size (around 19 [[feddans]]) after the company took back the land of the golf course. Golf was cancelled after the frequent objections of club members to the large expenses incurred by the game, which, after all, was not played by many members.

== Shorouk branch ==
Like other major sporting clubs in Egypt, Heliopolis Sporting Club has another branch, in [[Al Shorouk City, Cairo|Shorouk city]]. The total area of the Shorouk branch is three times bigger than the main club in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]]. Thus, that area is more suitable for all developmental and improving future possibilities.

'''Herschend Family Entertainment''' ('''HFE''') is a privately owned themed-entertainment company that operates several [[theme parks]] and [[tourist attractions]] within the United States.

Founded by Jack and Pete Herschend of [[Branson, Missouri]], in its early years HFE was simply known as '''Herschend Enterprises'''. In the 1980s the name was changed to '''Silver Dollar City Inc.''', and in 2003 the company gained the current name. HFE is currently headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The company's mission is to "Create Memories Worth Repeating."

==History==
HFE traces roots back to Hugo and Mary Herschend from [[Chicago, Illinois]] along with sons Jack and Pete. The family vacationed in Missouri’s [[Ozark Mountains]] region and fell in love with the nature the area offered. In 1951 Hugo obtained a [[99-year lease]] on a [[Branson, Missouri]] area attraction called [[Marvel Cave]]. Hugo suffered a heart attack and later died in 1955, however Mary along with her two sons continued to improve the cave attraction by installing electric lighting and building cement walkways. A cable train was installed in 1958 to ferry guests out of the depths of the cave upon the end of the tour. The attendance nearly doubled and a small frontier town was erected to entertain visitors as they waited for their cave tour. In order to increase attendance furthermore at the attraction, a gimmick was used by naming the village "[[Silver Dollar City]]" and distributing [[Dollar (United States coin)|silver dollars]] as change to every visitor in hope that when they would spend the rare coins they would tell people where they had got them from. The idea was a success, and the Herschend family soon found themselves involved in the theme park business.

In 1969, Silver Dollar City drew national attention when producer [[Paul Henning]] brought the cast and crew of the popular ''[[Beverly Hillbillies]]'' television show to the park to film five episodes.

The park is also home to many bats which the park takes measures to try and protect from diseases that could prove fatal.

In 2010, Herschend Family Entertainment was featured on the reality TV series ''[[Undercover Boss]]''.

The company also co-owns and co-operates with partners [[Dolly Parton]] and her company The Dollywood Company, the dinner and theatre company Pirates Voyage Dinner and Show in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadling.com/2011/06/06/dolly-partons-pirates-voyage-replaces-dixie-stampede-in-myr/ |title=Dolly Parton's 'Pirates Voyage' replaces 'Dixie Stampede' in Myrtle Beach |publisher=Gadling |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By MyrtleBeach.comSeptember 23, 2010 |url=http://www.myrtlebeach.com/blog/curtain-to-close-on-myrtle-beachs-dixie-stampede/ |title=Curtain to close on Myrtle Beach's Dixie today Stampede |publisher=MyrtleBeach.com |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/entertainment/article16657346.html |title=Pirates Voyage all settled in former Dixie Stampede location, enjoying holiday shows &amp;#124; Myrtle Beach Sun News |publisher=Myrtlebeachonline.com |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly Dixie Stampede).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-01-08/news/stampede08_1_parton-dixie-dixie-stampede-pigeon-forge |title=Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede dinner theater in Orlando sold, closed - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel |publisher=Articles.orlandosentinel.com |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soldorlando"&gt;{{cite news| title=Orlando's Dixie Stampede shuts down| last=Blake| first=Scott| publisher=Florida Today| url=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080108/BUSINESS/301080002/1003| archiveurl=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080108/BUSINESS/301080002/1003| date=2008-01-08| archivedate=2008-01-19| accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stampede/&gt;

==The Dollywood Company==
The Herschends extended their brand in 1976 upon purchasing a small tourist attraction in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]], called Goldrush Junction. The following year the attraction was renamed Silver Dollar City Tennessee as part of a development plan to transform the property into a theme park patterned after the original Silver Dollar City in Branson. For the Pigeon Forge park, the [[Ozark Mountains]] theme of the original Silver Dollar City was slightly reworked to represent the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] and [[Appalachia|Appalachia culture]] instead, fitting the location in the foothills of the Smokies.

In 1986, singer and actress [[Dolly Parton]], who grew up near Pigeon Forge, became a co-owner, and the park's name was changed to [[Dollywood]], reflecting her involvement. At this point, the Pigeon Forge park was branched off into a separate division of HFE called The Dollywood Company, which oversees all the properties that Dolly Parton has interest in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollywood.com/company-info/about.aspx About Dollywood: Company Information: Dollywood&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Along with the Herschend family, Dolly Parton co-owns the Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly [[Dixie Stampede]]&lt;ref name=Stampede&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/09/dolly-partons-dixie-stampede-gets-name-change-now-called-stampede/1017388001/|title=Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede gets name change, now called Stampede|last=Jones|first=Maggie|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 9, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) dinner attraction chain, which has locations in Pigeon Forge (opened 1988), [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] (1992), and Branson (1995). A location in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] opened in 2003 and closed in early 2008.

In 2001 a new water park was opened adjacent to the Dollywood theme park called [[Dollywood's Splash Country]].

==Past properties==
HFE built several water parks in the 1980s which have since sold to other companies such as [[Wet 'n Wild (brand)|Wet 'n Wild]], [[Frontier City]], and [[Six Flags]]. White Water Branson, built in 1980, was the forerunner and is still owned by HFE; while the White Waters in [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|Oklahoma City]] (1981), [[Boardwalk Fun Park|Grand Prairie, Texas]] (1982), [[Garland, Texas]] (1982) and [[Six Flags White Water|Atlanta]] (1983) have been sold.

The 4,000 seat [[Grand Palace Theatre]] opened in 1992 by the Herschends. The theatre was co-owned by singer [[Kenny Rogers]]. Along with Rogers headliners were [[Glen Campbell]], [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]]. In 1994 HFE entered into a ten-year contract with Radio City Entertainment. The Grand Palace Theatre would be the first to host the [[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]] starring the world famous [[The Rockettes|Rockettes]] outside of [[New York City]]’s [[Radio City Music Hall]]. The shows were successful and led to Radio City Entertainment launching tours of their shows in other cities throughout the United States.

HFE built the $10 million Grand Village Shops with [[Kenny Rogers]] adjacent to The Grand Palace Theatre in 1993. Ozark wares and English [[bone china]] filled the twenty six [[New Orleans]] themed shops. HFE later bought out entertainer Kenny Rogers and sold The Grand Palace in 1996 and The Grand Village in 2005.

American Adventures, a children’s theme park opened alongside [[Six Flags White Water|White Water Atlanta]]. The park was sold to [[Six Flags]] in 1999.

In 1994, The Dollywood Company constructed a large music theatre in Pigeon Forge called Music Mansion. Headlined by James Rogers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesrogersonline.com/home.html |title=Welcome to James Rogers Online |publisher=Jamesrogersonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209123830/http://www.jamesrogersonline.com/home.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the highly successful theatre was operated by HFE until 2001, when it was sold to [[Anita Bryant]]. In 2005 the theatre was sold again and converted to a [[WonderWorks (attraction)|WonderWorks]] location. A Music Mansion Theatre was planned for Myrtle Beach, but never materialized.

In 2003 the Dollywood Company opened a new Dixie Stampede location in [[Orlando, Florida]] along [[Interstate 4]]. The location operated until early 2008, when the property was sold to [[Simon Property Group]] for an undisclosed amount. The building was torn down, and an extension of the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets was built on the land. HFE has plans to build another Dixie Stampede in the region at some point, though specific plans have not been disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-dixie0908jan09,0,451819.story Orlando Premium Outlets' owner buys Dixie Stampede - OrlandoSentinel.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 HFE purchased the [[Hawaiian Falls]] water parks located in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] and [[The Colony, Texas]]. In 2006 all three parks were sold.

Due to unreliable peak season water access, Ride The Ducks in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] closed in 2007.

[[Celebration City]] in Branson closed on October 25, 2008. The company has plans to restructure the site.

== Name ==
The name Hulu comes from two [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] words, ''húlú'' ([[wikt:葫芦|葫芦]]/[[wikt:葫蘆|葫蘆]]), "[[calabash]]; bottle gourd", and ''hùlù'' ([[wikt:互录|互录]]/[[wikt:互錄|互錄]]), "interactive recording". The company blog explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Mandarin, ''Hulu'' has two interesting meanings, each highly relevant to our mission. The primary meaning interested us because it is used in an ancient Chinese proverb that describes the Hulu as the holder of precious things. It literally translates to "gourd," and in ancient times, the Hulu was hollowed out and used to hold precious things. The secondary meaning is "interactive recording". We saw both definitions as appropriate bookends and highly relevant to the mission of Hulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilar|first=Jason|title=What's in a Name?|date=2008-05-14|url=http://blog.hulu.com/2008/05/13/meaning-of-hulu/|accessdate=2010-07-17|postscript=.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717203005/http://blog.hulu.com/2008/05/13/meaning-of-hulu/|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 18, 2016, all content from The CW was removed from Hulu, as The CW's own website and apps became the exclusive portals for streaming their shows during the current season, with Netflix becoming the exclusive streaming provider for The CW shows post-current season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The CW Bloodbath is Coming – Hulu Removing CW Shows September 18th | url = http://exstreamist.com/the-cw-bloodbath-is-coming-hulu-removing-cw-shows-september-18th/ | work = Exstreamist.com | date = 17 August 2016 | access-date = 14 November 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161114085218/http://exstreamist.com/the-cw-bloodbath-is-coming-hulu-removing-cw-shows-september-18th/ | archive-date = 14 November 2016 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|January}}, a limited amount of content from [[CBS]]'s library is available on-demand, mostly limited to shows that are no longer producing new episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.hulu.com/articles/22330147|title=CBS shows on Hulu|website=help.hulu.com|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105084731/https://help.hulu.com/articles/22330147|archive-date=2017-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/companies/cbs|title=CBS|website=Hulu|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105080054/http://www.hulu.com/companies/cbs|archive-date=2017-01-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 4, 2017, it was reported that a deal was reached to bring live broadcasts of CBS and several affiliated channels to Hulu's upcoming live streaming service&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cbs-corp-hulu-deal-idUSKBN14O1Y1|title=CBS signs deal to be on Hulu's live-streaming platform|date=2017-01-04|publisher=Reuters|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104233511/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cbs-corp-hulu-deal-idUSKBN14O1Y1|archive-date=2017-01-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to make more shows available on-demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/04/hulu-adds-cbs-to-its-upcoming-live-tv-service/|title=Hulu adds CBS to its upcoming live TV service|publisher=[[Engadget]]|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105061502/https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/04/hulu-adds-cbs-to-its-upcoming-live-tv-service/|archive-date=2017-01-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Hulu Plus}} Hulu subscription service ===
At an industry conference held on October 21, 2009, [[News Corporation]] Deputy Chairman [[Chase Carey]] stated that Hulu "needs to evolve to have a meaningful subscription model as part of its business" and that it would likely start charging for at least some content by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/ADverse_Atkinson_on_Advertising/23941-Chase_Carey_Hulu_to_Charge_in_2010.php?nid=2228&amp;source=title&amp;rid=6454445 |title=Chase Carey: Hulu to Charge in 2010 |date=2009-10-21 |author=Atkinson, Claire |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=2009-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025045542/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/ADverse_Atkinson_on_Advertising/23941-Chase_Carey_Hulu_to_Charge_in_2010.php?nid=2228&amp;source=title&amp;rid=6454445 |archive-date=2009-10-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey's comment jibes with other News Corp. heads, including Rupert Murdoch who has expressed a desire to charge for content with a number of online units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10381622-261.html |title=More signs Hulu subscription service is coming |first=Greg |last=Sandoval |date=October 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |work=Media Maverick |publisher=CNET |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617000040/http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10381622-261.html |archive-date=June 17, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it offers an expanded content library including full seasons, day-after access to current season content and more episodes of shows available through the free Hulu. A Hulu subscription also provides a wider array of viewing choices. The free-access to Hulu was only available on PCs and laptops, while a Hulu subscription allows viewers to access Hulu through all Hulu-supported devices including set-top boxes, smart TVs, gaming consoles, mobile devices and more. A little more than a year after the launch of the Hulu subscription service, the number of paying subscribers reached 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Nakashima, Ryan January 13, 2012.

On April 29, 2015, Hulu announced to the press that they would do away with the "Plus" brand name to reduce confusion between the paid and free plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Advertising Age|url=http://adage.com/article/media/hulu-drop-hulu-brand-picks-seinfeld/298305/|title=Hulu Will Drop Hulu Plus Brand, Picks up 'Seinfeld'|accessdate=September 13, 2015|author=Peterson, Tim|date=April 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906123704/http://adage.com/article/media/hulu-drop-hulu-brand-picks-seinfeld/298305/|archive-date=September 6, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2016, Hulu announced that it would end the availability of its free streaming service through its own platform, making it oriented exclusively to subscription services. In turn, the company announced a partnership with [[Yahoo!]] to move this free content, which consists primarily of recent episodes of ABC, Fox, and NBC series, to a new website known as [[Yahoo!

The service, marketed only as "Hulu with Live TV," which couples the live TV offerings with Hulu's existing library of television series and films, launched in [[beta testing|beta]] on May 3, 2017. The $39.99-per-month service – which provides support for [[Xbox One]], [[Apple TV]], [[Chromecast]], iOS and Android devices – offers live streams of more than 50 broadcast and cable-originated channels, including feeds of the five major broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and The CW – as well as cable channels owned by Hulu co-parents NBCUniversal, 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company, along with [[CBS Corporation]], [[Turner Broadcasting System]], [[Scripps Networks Interactive]] and [[A+E Networks]] (encompassing networks such as [[CNN]], [[Food Network]], [[Disney Channel]], [[A&amp;E (TV network)|A&amp;E]], [[MSNBC]] and [[ESPN]]), with the Showtime OTT service available as an add-on for an extra fee. Currently, live content from the major broadcast networks is limited to [[owned-and-operated station]]s and affiliates based in New York City, Los Angeles, [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Philadelphia]]; Hulu representatives stated that it intends to negotiate carriage agreements with independently-owned broadcasting groups to gain distribution rights to local stations from additional markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You can now watch 50-plus channels of live TV on Hulu with $39.99 upgrade|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/05/03/net-video-streamer-hulu-gets-3999-live-tv-upgrade/101218510/|author=Mike Snider|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508210018/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/05/03/net-video-streamer-hulu-gets-3999-live-tv-upgrade/101218510/|archive-date=May 8, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hulu Live TV launches in beta: What you need to know|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/3193912/streaming-services/hulu-live-tv-launches-in-beta-what-you-need-to-know.html|author=Jared Newman|website=[[TechHive]]|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509022030/http://www.techhive.com/article/3193912/streaming-services/hulu-live-tv-launches-in-beta-what-you-need-to-know.html|archive-date=May 9, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd Spangler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hulu Live TV Service Launches With 50 Channels for $40 Monthly|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/hulu-live-tv-service-launch-channels-1202407778/|author=Todd Spangler|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508083536/http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/hulu-live-tv-service-launch-channels-1202407778/|archive-date=May 8, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd Spangler" /&gt; Features include the ability to create up of six user account profiles per a single subscription (with personalized program recommendations based on a user's favorite programs and varying simultaneous streams depending on the package), personalized sports recommendations and a [[cloud computing|cloud]] [[digital video recorder|DVR]] with between 50 and 200 hours of storage depending on the level of service (the lower-tier DVR does not have ad skipping functionality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hulu just launched its $40-a-month cable-TV competitor — here are all the details|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hulu-live-tv-package-details-pricing-channels-features-2017-5|author=Nathan McAlone|website=Business Insider|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507140451/http://www.businessinsider.com/hulu-live-tv-package-details-pricing-channels-features-2017-5|archive-date=May 7, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hulu launches live TV service|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/03/media/hulu-live-tv-service/index.html|author=Sandra Gonzalez|website=CNN Money|publisher=Time Warner|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503203436/http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/03/media/hulu-live-tv-service/index.html|archive-date=May 3, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hulu Live TV Bundle: Full Channel Lineup|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/hulu-live-tv-full-channel-lineup-1202407833/|author=Todd Spangler|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508033929/http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/hulu-live-tv-full-channel-lineup-1202407833/|archive-date=May 8, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hulu Live TV Service Won't Have Viacom Networks|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/hulu-live-tv-service-no-viacom-networks-1202006300/|author=Todd Spangler|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 10, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512084000/http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/hulu-live-tv-service-no-viacom-networks-1202006300/|archive-date=May 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viewership ==
Viewership numbers for the site are tracked by measurement firms such as [[ComScore]], [[Nielsen ratings]], and [[Quantcast]]. In partnership with comScore, Hulu is the first digital company to receive multi-platform measurement at an individual level that includes co-viewing for living room devices. When factoring this in, Hulu's reach among adults aged 18–49 increases 50 percent.

However, the reliability of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu dropped from 43.5 million unique viewers to 24 million in a single month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/26/business/la-fi-ct-hulu-20100721|title=Hulu's sharp decline in viewership underscores inconsistency in measuring size of online audience|publisher=LA Times|author=Dawn C.

From January 17, 2011 to April 24, 2014, Hulu streamed its own in-house web series ''[[The Morning After (web series)|The Morning After]]'', a light-hearted pop-culture news show. It was produced by Hulu in conjunction with [[Jace Hall]]'s HDFilms and stars Brian Kimmet and Ginger Gonzaga.

On January 16, 2012, Hulu announced that it would be airing its first original script based program, titled ''[[Battleground (TV series)|Battleground]]'', which premiered in February 2012.

At the start of April 2014, [[Neon Alley]], a [[Viz Media]]-owned 24/7 anime-oriented streaming service that started on October 2, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-10-02/viz-debuts-neon-alley|title=Viz Debuts Neon Alley|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628222130/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-10-02/viz-debuts-neon-alley|archive-date=28 June 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; streaming to both US and Canadian markets (similar to Æsir Media Group LLC and Valkyrie Media Partners LLC's [[Anime Network]], [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[Crunchyroll]] and [[Aniplex of America]]'s [[Aniplex of America#Aniplex Channel|Aniplex Channel]]), discontinued its web network format and relaunched as a Free Video on Demand ([[Video on demand|FVOD]]) service streaming anime to the US market through its website or [[Internet]]-connected devices through Hulu. As a result, with Hulu being unable to stream to the Canadian market, Neon Alley stopped streaming to that market and restricted its service to the US market only.  This leaves [[Anime Network]], [[Crunchyroll]], [[Daisuki (website)|Daisuki]] and [[Aniplex of America#Aniplex Channel|Aniplex Channel]] as the only anime-focused streaming services streaming to the Canadian market at the same time as the US market, though these four all continue today. On July 21, 2016, [[Tubi TV]] announced that they had commenced streaming of certain Viz titles in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tubitv.com/blog/2016/07/21/stream-naruto-sailor-moon-viz-media-partners-tubi-tv-deliver-free-anime/|title=Stream Naruto, Sailor Moon &amp; More: VIZ Media Partners with Tubi TV to Deliver Free Anime|publisher=Tubi TV|date=July 21, 2016|accessdate=October 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024131340/http://tubitv.com/blog/2016/07/21/stream-naruto-sailor-moon-viz-media-partners-tubi-tv-deliver-free-anime/|archive-date=October 24, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nippon TV acquisition of Hulu Japan service ====
On February 27, 2014, Nippon Television Network Corporation ([[Nippon TV]]) acquired Hulu's Japan business. The transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory conditions, marked Nippon TV's entry into the SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) business. Through the acquisition, the Hulu service continues to offer Japanese consumers premium content, including Hollywood and Japanese films and dramas and popular television programming. Additionally, Nippon TV's popular shows and original exclusive content launched on the Hulu service in Japan, expanding its content offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nippon TV Acquires Hulu Service in Japan |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140227006802/en/Nippon-TV-Acquires-Hulu-Service-Japan |publisher=Businesswire |date=2014-02-27 |access-date=2017-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205125604/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140227006802/en/Nippon-TV-Acquires-Hulu-Service-Japan |archive-date=2017-12-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese users have access to a library of popular television shows such as the CSI franchise, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', and ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', and as well as movies such as ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'', and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hulu launches its first overseas operation in Japan |url= http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?hulu_launches_its_first_overseas_operation_in_japan_17333.aspx |work= Asia Pacific Arts |date= 2011-09-01 |access-date= 2011-09-29 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060011/http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?hulu_launches_its_first_overseas_operation_in_japan_17333.aspx |archive-date= 2013-11-02 |dead-url= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Absence in Canadian market ===
Hulu is unable to launch in Canada due to the relatively small size of Canada's online advertising market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mudhar|first1=Raju|title=Why these five well-known online services snub Canada|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/01/04/why-are-these-five-well-known-online-services-snubbing-canada.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=1 November 2016|date=4 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103235733/https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/01/04/why-are-these-five-well-known-online-services-snubbing-canada.html|archive-date=3 November 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because Canada's television networks already have the exclusive online streaming rights in Canada to several titles offered on Hulu, including many mainstream American television network programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-02-20/.85204 |title=Life Is Just a Game |department=Answerman (column) |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=8 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628230637/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-02-20/.85204 |archive-date=28 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of Hulu in the Canadian market raised concerns by fans of the sitcom ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' when it was cancelled by Fox in the spring of 2015 and subsequently picked up by Hulu; the show's Canadian broadcaster, [[City (TV network)|City]], subsequently announced it would continue to air the series in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindy Project staying on City despite being dropped by Fox|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2015/05/25/mindy-project-staying-on-city-despite-being-dropped-by-fox.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928204054/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2015/05/25/mindy-project-staying-on-city-despite-being-dropped-by-fox.html|archive-date=28 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, Canadian consumers have access to several other streaming systems, including a Canadian version of [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]] and [[Crave (streaming service)|Crave]], with Crave streaming some programming from Hulu.

The '''legal thriller''' is a subgenre of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] and [[crime fiction]] in which the major characters are [[lawyers]] and their employees.  The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters.  In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller much as the system of modern police work does for the [[police procedural]].

Usually, crusading lawyers become involved in proving their cases (usually their client's innocence of the crime of which he is accused, or the culpability of a corrupt corporation which has covered up its malfeasance until this point) to such an extent that they imperil their own interpersonal relationships and frequently, their own lives.

[[Image:A chorus line.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Broadway musical]] ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' was lit using conventional lighting instruments.]]
[[Image:Classical spectacular10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lighting at the 2005 Classical Spectacular Concert]]

A [[theatre]] '''lighting designer''' (or '''LD''') works with the [[theatre director|director]], [[choreographer]], [[set designer]], [[costume designer]], and [[sound designer]] to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production in response to the text, while keeping in mind issues of visibility,  safety, and cost. The LD also works closely with the [[Stage management|stage manager]] or [[show control]] programming, if show control systems are used in that production.  Outside [[stage lighting]], the job of a Lighting Designer can be much more diverse and they can be found working on rock and pop tours, corporate launches, art installation and on massive celebration spectaculars, for example the Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies.

==During pre-production==
The role of the lighting designer varies greatly within professional and amateur theater. For a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show, a touring production and most regional and small productions the LD is usually an outside freelance specialist hired early in the production process.  Smaller theatre companies may have a resident lighting designer responsible for most of the company's productions or rely on a variety of freelance or even volunteer help to light their productions. At the [[Off-Broadway]] or [[Off-Off-Broadway]] level, the LD will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work (hanging instruments, programming the [[lighting control console|light board]], etc.) that would be the work of the lighting crew in a larger theater.

The LD will read the script carefully and make notes on changes in place and time between scenes - such changes are often done just with lighting to avoid too many blackouts in one scene - and will have meetings (called design or production meetings) with the director, designers, [[stage manager]], and [[production manager]] to discuss ideas for the show and establish budget and scheduling details.  The LD will also attend several later rehearsals to observe the way the [[actor]]s are being directed to use the stage area  ('blocking') during different scenes, and will receive updates from the [[stage manager]] on any changes that occur.  The LD will also make sure that he or she has an accurate plan of the theatre's lighting positions and a list of their equipment, as well as an accurate copy of the set design, especially the ground plan and section. The LD must take into account the show's mood and the director's vision in creating a lighting design.

Because lighting design is much more abstract than costume or scenic design, it is sometimes difficult for the lighting designer to accurately convey his or her ideas to the rest of the production team.  To help the LD communicate the ethereal aspects of lighting, he or she may employ renderings, storyboards, photographs, reproductions of artwork, or mockups of actual lighting effects to help communicate ideas about how the lighting should look. Various forms of paperwork are essential for the LD to successfully communicate their design to various members of the production team.  Examples of typical paperwork include cue sheets, lightplots, [[Instrument Schedule|instrument schedules]], shop orders and focus charts. Cue sheets communicate the placement of cues that the LD has created for the show, using artistic terminology rather than technical language, and information on exactly when each cue is called, so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the cue. Cue sheets are of the most value to stage management.

The [[light plot]] is a scale drawing that communicates the location of lighting fixtures and lighting positions so a team of electricians can independently install the lighting system.   Next to each instrument on the plan will be information for any [[color gel]], [[gobo (lighting)|gobo]], or other accessory that needs to go with it, and its channel number. Often, paperwork listing all of this information is also generated by using a program such as [[Lightwright]]. The lighting designer uses this paperwork to aid in the visualization of not only ideas but simple lists to assist the Master Electrician during load-in, focus and technical rehearsals.  Professional LDs generally use special [[computer-aided design]] packages to create accurate and easily readable drafted plots that can be swiftly updated as necessary.  The LD will discuss the plot with the show's production manager and the theatre's master electrician or technical director to make sure there are no unforeseen problems during load-in.

The lighting designer is responsible, in conjunction with the production's independently hired "Production Electrician" who will interface with the theatre's [[Master Electrician]], for directing the theatre's electrics crew in the realization of his or her designs during the technical rehearsals.  After the Electricians have hung, circuited and patched the lighting units, the LD will direct the focusing (pointing, shaping and sizing of the light beams) and gelling (coloring) of each unit.

After focus has occurred the LD usually sits at a temporary desk (tech table) in the theater (typically on the Center Line in the middle of the house) where he or she has a good view of the stage and work with the [[lighting board]] [[Light board operator|operator/programmer]], who will either be seated alongside him or her at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room.  At the tech table, the LD will generally use a Magic Sheet, which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage, so he or she can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments. The LD may also have a copy of the light plot and [[channel hookup]], a remote lighting console, a computer monitor connected to the light board (so they can see what the board op is doing), and a headset, though in smaller theatres this is less common.  There may be a period of time allowed for pre-lighting or "pre-cueing", a practice that is often done with people known as Light Walkers who stand in for performers so the LD can see what the light looks like on bodies.  At an arranged time, the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order, with occasional stops to correct sound, lighting, entrances etc.; known as a "cue-to-cue" or [[technical rehearsal|tech rehearsal]].  The lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues, but because the focus of a [[technical rehearsal|"tech" rehearsal]] is the production's technical aspects, the LD may require the performers to pause ("hold") frequently. Nevertheless, any errors of focusing or changes to the lighting plan are corrected only when the performers are not onstage.  These changes take place during 'work' or 'note' calls.  The LD only attends these notes calls if units are hung or rehung and require additional focusing.  The LD or Assistant Lighting Director (also known as the ALD, see below for description) will be in charge if in attendance.  If the only work to be done is maintenance (i.e. changing a lamp or burnt out gel) then the Production or Master Electrician will be in charge and will direct the Electrics crew.

After the tech process, the performance may (or may not, depending on time constraints) go into [[Dress rehearsal]] without a ticketed audience and/or [[Preview (theatre)|Previews]] with a ticketed audience.  During this time, if the cueing is finished, the LD will sit in the audience and take notes on what works and what needs changing.  At this point, the [[Stage Manager]] will begin to take over the work of calling cues for the light board op to follow.  Generally, the LD will stay on headset, and may still have a monitor connected to the light board in case of problems, or will be in the [[Control booth (theater)|control booth]] with the board operator when a monitor is not available.  Often, changes will take place during notes call, but if serious problems occur the performance may be halted and the issue will be resolved then.

Once the show is open to the public, the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show, making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call.  If the show is still in previews, then the LD will make changes, but once the production officially opens, normally the lighting designer will not make further changes.

Changes should not be made after the lighting design is finished, and never without the LD's approval.  There may be times when changes are necessary after the production has officially opened.  Reasons for changes after opening night include: casting changes; significant changes in blocking; addition, deletion or rearrangement of scenes; or the tech and/or preview period (if there was a preview period) was too short to accommodate as thorough a cueing as was needed (this is particularly common in dance productions).  If significant changes need to be made, the LD will come in and make them, however if only smaller changes are needed, the LD may opt to send the ALD.  If a show runs for a particularly long time then the LD may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color (some [[color gel|gel]], especially saturated gel, loses its richness and can fade or 'burn out' over time).  The LD may also sit in on a performance to make sure that the cues are still being called at the right place and time.  The goal is often to finish by the opening of the show, but what is most important is that the LD and the directors believe that the design is finished to each's satisfaction. If that happens to be by opening night, then after opening no changes are normally made to that particular production run at that venue.  The general maintenance of the lighting rig then becomes the responsibility of the Master Electrician.

==In small theatres==
It is uncommon for a small theatre to have a very large technical crew, as there is less work to do.  Many times, the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people, who collectively are in charge of hanging, focusing and patching all lighting instruments. The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer.  Many times the designer will directly participate in the focusing of lights.  The same crew will generally also program cues and operate the [[Lighting control console|light board]] during rehearsals and performances.  In some cases, the [[Lighting control console|light board]] and [[Mixing console|sound board]] are operated by the same person, depending on the complexity of the show.  The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board.

==Advances in visualization and presentation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:180px-LDA08.jpg|thumb|left|LD Assistant 08 Total Show Simulation© Software with Integrated Real-time Video]] --&gt;
As previously mentioned, it is difficult to fully communicate the intent of a lighting design before all the lights are installed and all the cues are written.   With the advancement in computer processing and visualization software, lighting designers are now able to create [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated images]] (CGI) that represent their ideas.  The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible (which helps in creating complete renderings).  This creates a 3D model in computer space that can be lit and manipulated.  Using the software, the LD can use the lights from his plot to create actual lighting in the 3D model with the ability to define parameters such as color, focus, gobo, beam angle etc.  The designer can then take renderings or "snapshots" of various looks that can then be printed out and shown to the director and other members of the design team.

==Mockups and lighting scale models==

In addition to computer visualization, either full scale or small scale mock ups are a good method for depicting a lighting designer's ideas.  Fiber optic systems such as  LightBox or Luxam allow a users to light a scale model of the set.  For example, a set designer can create a model of the set in 1/4" scale, the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures.  These 'mini lights' can then be attached to cross pieces simulating different lighting positions.  Fiber optic fixtures have the capacity to simulate attributes of full scale theatrical lighting fixtures including; color, beam angle, intensity, and gobos.  The most sophisticated  fiber optic systems are controllable through computer software or a [[DMX512-A|DMX]] controlled [[Lighting control console|Light board]].  This gives the lighting designer the ability to mock up real time lighting effects as they will look during the show.

==Additional members of the lighting design team==
If the production is large or especially complex, the Lighting Designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design.

===The Associate Lighting Designer===
The Associate Lighting Designer will help assist the Lighting Designer in creating and executing the lighting design.  While the duties that an LD may expect the Associate LD to perform may differ from person to person, usually the Ass't LD will do the following:
*Attend design and production meetings with or in place of the LD
*Attend rehearsals with or in place of LD and take notes of specific design ideas and tasks that the lighting department needs to accomplish
*Assist the LD in generating the light plot, channel hookup and sketches
*If needed, the Associate may need to take the set drawings and put them into a CAD program to be manipulated by the LD (however, this job is usually given to the Assistant LD if there is one).
*The Ass't LD may be in charge of running focus, and may even direct where the lights are to be focused.
*The Associate is generally authorized to speak on behalf of the LD and can make creative and design decisions when needed (and when authorized by the LD).  This is one of the biggest differences between the Associate and the Assistant.

===The Assistant Lighting Designer===
The Assistant Lighting Designer assists the Lighting Designer and the Associate Lighting Designer.  Depending on the particular arrangement the ALD may report directly to the LD, or they may in essence be the Associate's assistant.  There also may be more than one assistant on a show depending on the size of the production.  The ALD will usually:
*Attend design and production meetings with the LD or the Associate LD
*Attend rehearsals with the LD or the Associate LD
*Assist the LD in generating the light plot and channel hookup.  If the plot is to be computer generated, the ALD is the one who physically enters the information into the computer.
*The ALD may run errands for the LD such as picking up supplies or getting the light plot printed in large format.
*The ALD will help the Associate LD in running focus.
*The ALD may take [https://web.archive.org/web/20101119033446/http://www.mckernon.com/_/Focus_Charts.html Focus Charts] during focus.
*Track and coordinate [[Followspot]]s (if any exist for the production) and generate paperwork to aid in their cueing and color changes.
*In rare instances the ALD may be the light board operator.

===A note on focus===
During focus, the LD is up on stage directing members of the Electrics crew on where and how to focus each individual lighting unit.  This can be a time consuming and frustrating process.  Focus can run much smoother if the Associate LD and the Assistant LD are keeping good track of which lights have been focused, what's coming up next and directing the electrics crew so that there is minimal down time between focusing each light.  They should also direct the LD to which units are next and even what their purpose is and a rough focus.

===Damian Wayne===
{{main|Damian Wayne}}
The 5th and current Robin. Portrayed as the successor to Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson in a possible future of mainstream continuity (prior to [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]).

[[File:Fons Rademakers (1986).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Fons Rademakers]] was the first Dutch director to win the award, for ''[[The Assault (film)|The Assault]]'' in 1987.]]
The [[Netherlands]] has submitted films for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] since 1959. The award is handed out annually by the [[United States]] [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to a [[feature length|feature-length]] motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-[[English language|English]] dialogue.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was created for the [[28th Academy Awards|1956 Academy Awards]], succeeding the non-competitive [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Awards]] which were presented between 1947 and 1955 to the best foreign language films released in the United States.&lt;ref name="HistPg1"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy Awards - Page 1 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history01.html |accessdate=2008-07-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622050215/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history01.html |archivedate=22 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, seven Dutch films have been nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, three of which have won the award: ''[[The Assault (film)|The Assault]]'' in 1987, ''[[Antonia's Line]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Character (1997 film)|Character]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref name="ForeignFilmFacts"&gt;{{cite web | title = Foreign Language Film Facts | publisher = [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | url = http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/forlangfacts.html | date = 2008-03-08 | accessdate = 2008-06-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613115409/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/forlangfacts.html | archivedate = 13 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Dutch submissions were disqualified: ''[[The Vanishing (1988 film)|The Vanishing]]'' in 1989 because more than half of the film was spoken in [[French language|French]] and ''[[Bluebird (2004 film)|Bluebird]]'' in 2006 because it had aired on television.&lt;ref name="redorbit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/330677/oscar_shoots_down_dutch_bluebird/|title=Oscar shoots down Dutch 'Bluebird'|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=2005-12-14|publisher=redOrbit|first=Ab|last=Zagt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fons Rademakers]] represented the Netherlands in the competition five times, achieving two Oscar nominations, including one win.

==Submissions==
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956.&lt;ref name="HistPg2"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy Awards - Page 2 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html |accessdate=2008-07-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622191328/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html |archivedate=22 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via [[secret ballot]] to determine the five nominees for the award.&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt; Before the award was created, the Board of Governors of the Academy voted on a film every year that was considered the best foreign language film released in the United States, and there were no submissions.&lt;ref name="HistPg1"/&gt; Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by the Netherlands for review by the Academy for the award since its first entry in 1959.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
:'''A'''{{note|Disqualified1}}: ''[[The Vanishing (1988 film)|The Vanishing]]'' was disqualified because the Academy determined that there was too much French dialogue in the film to meet the requirements. Although the film was produced in the Netherlands by French-Dutch filmmaker and a mostly Dutch cast, [[AMPAS]] deemed that the film was unsuitable to represent the Netherlands. The Dutch declined to send another film, leaving them unrepresented for the first time since 1972.&lt;ref name="redorbit"/&gt;
:'''B'''{{note|Disqualified2}}: ''[[Bluebird (2004 film)|Bluebird]]'' was rejected by the Academy because the film previously aired on Dutch television. The Academy was not persuaded by the fact that the film had been newly edited for cinema since the broadcasting, stating "there was not enough difference between the two versions." Because of the late notification the Netherlands was unable to submit a new entry.&lt;ref name="redorbit"/&gt;
:'''C'''{{note|Disqualified3}}: The Dutch selection committee originally announced ''[[The Silent Army]]'', by [[Jean van de Velde (director)|Jean van de Velde]] as their official Oscar submission. Several people within the Dutch film industry protested that the film was not eligible since it contained too much English dialogue and because it had screened in Dutch theatres in an alternate version, in violation of AMPAS rules. The committee withdrew the submission and agreed to reconvene. They then chose ''The Silent Army'' a second time. After conferring with AMPAS and being told that the film was, in fact, going to be disqualified, they met a third time and selected ''Winter in Wartime''.&lt;ref name="redorbit"/&gt;

'''Metanoia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μετάνοια}}, ''metanoia'', ''changing one's mind'') in the context of [[rhetoric]] is a device used to retract a statement just made, and then state it in a better way.&lt;ref name="meta1"&gt;Silva Rhetoricae (2006). [http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm Metanoeia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117043043/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm |date=2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, metanoia is similar to correction. Metanoia is used in recalling a statement in two ways—-to weaken the prior declaration or to strengthen it.

Metanoia is later personified as a figure accompanying [[kairos]], sometimes as a hag and sometimes as a young lady. Ausonius' epigrams describe her thus: "I am a goddess to whom even Cicero himself did not give a name. I am the goddess who exacts punishment for what has and has not been done, so that people regret it. Hence my name is Metanoea." &lt;ref&gt; Qtd. in Myers, Kelly A. "Metanoia and the Transformation of Opportunity" RSA 41.1 pp1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weakening==

The use of metanoia to weaken a statement is effective because the original statement still stands, along with the qualifying statement.&lt;ref name="meta2"&gt;VirtualSalt.com (2006). [http://www.virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm#Metanoia A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when one says, "I will murder you. You shall be punished," the force of the original statement ("I will murder you") remains, while a more realistic alternative has been put forward ("you shall be punished").

==Strengthening==

When it is used to strengthen a statement, metanoia works to ease the reader from a moderate statement to a more radical one, as in this quote from [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing
the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions (Book One);&lt;ref name="meta3"&gt;The Internet Classics Archive (2006). [http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.mb.txt The Meditations]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Aurelius utilizes metanoia to move from a mild idea ("not observing the admonitions of the gods") to a more intense one ("not observing... their direct instructions"); the clause "I may almost say" introduces the metanoia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21829">'''Timothy Patrick Barrus''', also known as '''Tim Barrus''' (born 1950), is an American author and social worker who is best known for having published three "memoirs" between 2000 and 2004 under the [[pseudonym]] '''Nasdijj''', by which he presented himself as a [[Navajo people|Navajo]]. The books were critically acclaimed, and Nasdijj received several literary awards and recognition from major institutions. His "memoirs," which dealt in part with issues of two adopted children who suffered from severe problems, were also acclaimed by Child Rights{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and HIV/AIDS activists{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} advocating for greater awareness of American children living at acute risk.

In 2006 journalists revealed that Barrus had published the Nasdijj books under a fictional identity, and that the events depicted in all three were largely fiction. In the United States publishing world, Barrus' work is cited as an example of memoirs released under misleading pretenses. The deception was revealed in the same period as two other literary scandals. Controversy arose over the portrayal of fictional accounts as memoirs, as well as authors presenting false personas. Native Americans strongly criticized Barrus for appropriating the historic suffering of their people. They criticized the publishing world for so readily accepting impostors.

In the 1980s and 1990s Barrus had published numerous articles and several novels.  He is credited by [[Jack Fritscher]] with coining the term "Leather Lit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jackfritscher.com/Drummer/Drummer_RearView.html |publisher=JackFritscher.com |title=Rear-View Mirror |date=June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tim Barrus was born and grew up in [[Lansing, Michigan]], where he attended public schools. His parents were European American: his father Maynard Barrus worked as a foreman at the power plant. His mother Jean Anne Steginga was of [[Scandinavia]]n descent. He has a younger sister Suzanne.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;

Marrying at a young age, Barrus took a variety of jobs and lived in different regions of the country in his early years. He attended community college in [[Largo, Florida]] and started writing in the early 1970s, although he did not publish anything for years.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
At the age of 19, Barrus married Jan Abbott, from a nearby town.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt; Together they have a daughter named Kree, born in 1974. In 1975 they adopted Tommy, a boy who Barrus said had severe developmental problems. After two years, they turned him back to the state, finding they were unable to care for him adequately. Barrus and Jan later separated and divorced. He moved to San Francisco and later Key West.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;

Barrus remarried in 1993 in San Francisco, to a special education teacher named Tina Giovanni.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt; She has worked with [[autistic]] children for 20 years.&lt;ref name="Chaikivsky"&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/fiction/fiction/ESQ0506NASDIJJ_138 Andrew Chaikivsky, "Nasdijj"], ''Esquire'', 30 April 2006, accessed 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work life==
Barrus was a "provocative associate editor" of ''[[Drummer Magazine (leather)|Drummer Magazine]]'' for five issues (#117-122).  An editorial by the publishers on his departure explained that they were impressed with the work that he had done, and regretted that "Justice Department persecution of publishers of erotica" had caused him to terminate the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer,'' (Palm Drive: San Francisco, 2008), 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Jack Fritscher (editor in chief) described Barrus as "one of the best editors" the magazine had in the 1980s. Barrus subsequently worked as an editor at Knights Press, creating the LeatherLit Writers Series.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer,'' (Palm Drive: San Francisco, 2008), 361&lt;/ref&gt;

By his account in later interviews, Barrus moved into social work, serving "special-needs children in Florida, Apache kids in New Mexico, disabled adults in Michigan," and autistic children in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Chaikivsky"/&gt; In 1996, he and his wife Tina moved from [[Ft. Lauderdale, Florida]] to a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] School at Mariano Lake, [[New Mexico]].

This period inspired his persona as Nasdijj. He has said this [[Navajo language|Navajo]] word means "to become again," according to an 1890s text.&lt;ref name="Chaikivsky"/&gt; Irvin Morris, a full-blood Navajo and professor of literature and Navajo studies at [[Dine College]], in 2006 said there was no such word in the language.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;

==Literary career==
Barrus began publishing articles in the late 1970s, primarily for the gay leather magazing ''Drummer.''&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt; After his move to Key West in 1984, he also wrote for ''The Weekly News,'' a local gay newspaper.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;

From 1985 to 1992, he published five novels, all dealing with homosexuality in different genres. While some were favorably reviewed, he never broke into mainstream acceptance. His novel ''Genocide'' was recognized as an early contribution to AIDS literature, described by critic Toby Johnson as "dark and pessimistic".&lt;ref&gt;Toby Johnson, "AIDS and Spiritual Wisdom", in ''Confronting AIDS Through Literature: The Responsibilities of Representation,'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1993), 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with ''Anywhere, Anywhere'', a novel about Americans in Vietnam during the war, Barrus said that he had been a Vietnam veteran. This account was disputed by people who knew him.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt; He also published numerous articles, reviews and other short pieces.&lt;ref name="Chaikivsky"/&gt;

==Reception as Nasdijj==
In 1999, Barrus submitted an unsolicited manuscript to ''Esquire'' magazine under the byline Nasdijj; he noted to them that the magazine had never published a work by a Native American author.&lt;ref name="Chaikivsky"/&gt; "Nasdijj" wrote that his essay was about the death of his adopted son from [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] (FAS), and that he also had it.&lt;ref name="Chaikivsky"/&gt; His essay, "The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams", was published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 1999 and was a finalist in the [[National Magazine Award]]s that year.&lt;ref name="Award"/&gt;

The following year Nasdijj published this and other non-fiction essays collected as a book under the same name.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/about/honors/990901_web_hnrs01.html |publisher=Esquire |title=National Magazine Award |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823104607/http://www.esquire.com/about/honors/990901_web_hnrs01.html |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving widespread notice and praise, the collection was selected as a "Notable Book of the Year" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and sold 27,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Chaikivsky"/&gt; Nasdijj's work received critical acclaim, and his first book was a finalist for the [[International PEN|PEN]]/Martha Albrand Award and winner of the [[Salon (website)|Salon]] Book Award.&lt;ref name=Fleischer/&gt;

In a 2002 PEN Forum, in which authors were asked to describe "literary lineage", Nasdijj responded,

{{quote|My literary lineage is [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]]. I hear Changing Woman in my head. I listen to trees, rocks, deserts, crows, and the tongues of wind. I am Navajo and the European things you relate so closely to often simply seem alien and remote. I do not know them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/519 |publisher=PEN American Center |title=Forum |date=August 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907161249/http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/519 |archivedate=2006-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Nasdijj, Barrus received widespread recognition as a writer on the Native American experience. His work was described as a compelling combination of poetry and prose.&lt;ref name=Fleischer/&gt; His second Navajo memoir, ''The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping'' (2003), won the 2004 [[PEN American Center]]'s [[PEN/Beyond Margins Award]].&lt;ref name="Beyond Margins Award Winners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/929 |publisher=PEN American Center |title=Beyond Margins Award Winners |date= |author= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626212832/https://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/929 |archivedate=2012-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the specialist Native American journal, ''[[Studies in American Indian Literatures]]  (SAIL)'', [[Marijo Moore]] wrote,

{{quote|Nasdijj has shed his blood that runs like a river through his dreams. Spilled it all over the pages of this book so that others might relate. Raw, poignant, poetic, and painful, Nasdijj's style of writing is refreshing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oncampus.richmond.edu/faculty/ASAIL/SAIL2/124.html#100 |work=[[Studies in American Indian Literatures]] |author=Marijo Moore |title=Review |publisher=University of Richmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Interested in ''The Boy'' for its portrayal of fatherhood, in 2004 James Dowaliby, a former vice president for Paramount International Television Group, acquired the film rights from Nasdijj. By the end of 2004, he had approval from FilmFour of the United Kingdom to develop a feature-length adaptation. During the process, he began to suspect the book was fraudulent when an adviser identified numerous errors, including the portrayal of Navajo clans and kinship system.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;

Barrus published the following books under the name Nasdijj:  
*''The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams'' (2000),
*''The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping'' (2003), and
*''Geronimo's Bones: A Memoir of My Brother and Me'' (2004)

Published as [[non-fiction]], each memoir recounted purported aspects of the author's life. The memoirs referred to his [[Navajo people|Navajo]] heritage, his self-destructive and [[abusive]] parents (a white father and Navajo mother), his unhappy childhood as a [[migrant worker]], his [[dysfunctional]] relationships with other family members, and his growing up to become a nurturing father. As an adult, he adopted two children: one with [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] (FAS) and a second who was [[HIV]]-positive. In the books, the children are unprotected; the author attacks white society for their plight.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;

=={{anchor|A hoax?}}Hoax controversy==
In January 2006, the journalist Matthew Fleischer published "Navahoax", an article in the ''LA Weekly,'' documenting Nasdijj as an [[ethnic]] European American named Timothy Patrick "Tim" Barrus. Fleischer provided details about Barrus' parents, marriages and other writings. The article noted that Barrus was known as the author of fiction relating to gay [[Sadism and Masochism|sado-masochism]].&lt;ref name=Fleischer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2006-01-26/news/navahoax/ |work=LA Weekly |title=Navahoax |date=January 26, 2006 |author=Matthew Fleischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feischer said that suspicions about Nasdijj had arisen with publication of his first book; [[Sherman Alexie]], a respected author of the [[Spokane tribe]], said that he had complained to Anton Mueller, Nasdijj's editor, that the author had plagiarized him and other Native Americans. Alexie also wrote to [[Houghton Mifflin]], which published the first book but then dropped Nasdijj as an author. Dowaliby dropped his film project because of his belief that the work was false.&lt;ref name=Fleischer/&gt;

Extensive media coverage followed the article's publication. A former literary agent for Nasdijj, while not confirming the ''LA Weekly'' article, called it "well researched and highly persuasive."&lt;ref name="LAWeekly2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2006-01-26/news/nasdijj-shops-tell-all/ |publisher=LA Weekly |title=Nasdijj Shops Tell-All |author=Matthew Fleischer |date=January 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The News &amp; Observer|News &amp; Observer]]'', a [[North Carolina]] newspaper that had published some of Nasdijj's work, confirmed that it had on file a [[social security]] number that matched that of Tim Barrus. ''Esquire'' magazine revealed that it had paid for a 1999 Nasdijj article with a check made out to "Tim Nasdijj Barrus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/393229.html |title=Navajo life, or just pale-faced lie? |author=Craig Jarvis |work=The News &amp; Observer |date=January 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207004540/http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/393229.html |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Nasdijj Shops Tell-All", Fleischer noted these developments. He quoted an e-mail from Nasdijj to an editor at [[Penguin Books]], in which the author offered a novel called ''Year of the Hyena: The Story of Nasdijj''. The article presented excerpts from Nasdijj's blog with the headline, "Deserving Death for Evil Deeds, by Tim Barrus". It quoted, "What you want to believe you want to believe. If I am the devil incarnate then I am the devil incarnate."  Subsequently, the host [[TypePad]] deleted Nasdijj's blog.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly2" /&gt;

Sherman Alexie (Spokane-[[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene]]&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;), commented publicly on the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1154221,00.html |title=When the Story Stolen Is Your Own |work=Time Magazine |date=January 29, 2006 |author=Sherman Alexie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in the February 6, 2006 issue of ''[[Time magazine]]'', Alexie wrote,

{{quote|So why should we be concerned about his lies? His lies matter because he has cynically co-opted as a literary style the very real suffering endured by generations of very real Indians because of very real injustices caused by very real American aggression that destroyed very real tribes.{{cite quote}} }}

He had become suspicious of Nasdijj, finding that the author appeared to borrow from his and other Native American writings.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt; Asked by Alexie to review the books by Nasdijj, Morris found numerous errors that led him to believe the author was an impostor. He did not pursue the matter; as he said,

{{quote|I have always been bothered by the false claim to the Dine identity by Nasdijj, but if I spent my time tracking down every white writer pretending to be Navajo, I’d have no time left to do anything else.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;}}

The author and critic [[David Treuer]] (Ojibwe) described Barrus' actions as "harmful cultural fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidtreuer.com/wordpress/?p=12 |publisher=David Treuer |author=David Treuer |title=thoughts on my USER'S MANUAL |date= }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activist [[Suzan Shown Harjo]] (Muscogee Creek and Cheyenne) questioned why the publishing world was taken in by Native American impostors.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt; She said, "There should be a law for the Navajo Nation to sue Barrus for the profits he made while committing the crime of stealing tribal identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28168604.html |title=Harjo: Fakers and phonies and frauds, egad: There ought to be a law |author=Suzan Shown Harjo |date=February 10, 2006 |work=Indian Country Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; (She has also been critical of [[Ward Churchill]], who as a professor of ethnic studies claimed to be Native American and acts as a spokesman. Harjo and others have documented that he has no record of Native American ancestry.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;)

Barrus' [[hoax]] gained attention for occurring at the same time as other literary scandals: the writer [[James Frey]] was found to have made up portions of works published as memoirs, and the purported author [[JT LeRoy]] was revealed as a deception created by three people: a woman who performed as the young man in public appearances, and a woman and man who wrote "his" published works. None was the teenage boy from a poor background who was represented in interviews and the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11116478/ |title=Examining publishing’s culture of trust |publisher=The Associated Press, retrieved via msnbc.com |author=The Associated |date=January 31, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One journalist noted that "the convergence of all three scandals at once had the feel of a [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] of hoaxery, with the grand losers being accuracy, truth, and literature itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/060313/13publish.htm |work=US News &amp; World Report |title=Publish or Panic |author=Diane Cole |date=March 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleischer said that, writing under his pseudonym, Barrus had described the cost of such appropriation:

{{quote|In an essay on [[Louis L’Amour]] titled "The Saddest Book I Ever Read," Nasdijj writes, “The accumulated weight of fictions (like L’Amour’s), when added up, form a place that never was and a time that never happened. Fictions like this are murderous. They pass off illusion as fact, stereotype as portraiture... Counterfeit comes to be seen as the genuine article. It kills people. It kills culture. It kills even the shadow of truth.&lt;ref name="Fleischer"/&gt;}}

==After "Nasdijj"==
After the scandal broke, [[J. Peder Zane]], the ''News &amp; Observer'''s book-review editor, who had published some of Nasdijj's work and promoted his writing, reflected,
 
{{quote|I felt no sense of betrayal. I knew it wasn't personal. Barrus hadn't conned me; I had just drifted into the black hole of his life, which sucked the trust out of everything within reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/1051/story/398715.html |work=The News &amp; Observer |author=J. Peder Zane |title=Bluff ran like a river through his schemes |date=February 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629174315/http://www.newsobserver.com/1051/story/398715.html |archivedate=June 29, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In May 2006, ''Esquire'' published the article "Nasdijj", for which the journalist Andrew Chaikivsky interviewed Barrus. Chaikivsky describes a man whose "shifting emotional temperature" veered between "meticulousness and careful good manners" and "a full roar."  Barrus was quoted as saying, "I understand that a trust was violated. I'm not defending it." In the course of the interviews, Barrus spoke of knowing [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], being encouraged to write by [[Tennessee Williams]], and adopting a developmentally challenged child with his first wife during the mid-1970s. Chaikivsky said, "Over the three days I spend with Barrus, I don't believe much of what he tells me." The adoption was documented, as was Barrus and his wife returning the child to the state, which he said was because of the boy's severe problems caused by FAS.&lt;ref name="Chaikvisky"&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/fiction/fiction/ESQ0506NASDIJJ_138 Andrew Chaikvisky, "Nasdijj"], ''Esquire'', 30 April 2006, accessed 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, [[Virginia Heffernan]] reported in the ''Screens'' blog of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Barrus had "found a home on [[YouTube]]", where he was posting "[[Nuyorican]] beat-style stuff", which she described as "irritable, pretty, autodidactic, engrossing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screens.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/give-us-your-snakecharmers-your-fakirs-your-frauds/ |title=Give Us Your Snakecharmers, Your Fakirs, Your Frauds |work=The New York Times |author=Virginia Heffernan |date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was followed up by a sequel titled ''Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon'', released August 2017 in Japan, and October 2017 worldwide.

==Gameplay==
The game features an RPG battle system where characters fight alongside contracted demons known as Servan. These demons can be summoned during battle through the use of SP, and are categorised into attacker and support types. As they become stronger through subsequent battles, they gain new abilities.&lt;ref name=gem2/&gt;&lt;ref name=gem3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/05/yoru-no-nai-kuni-details-transformation-weapon-changes|title=Yoru no Nai Kuni details transformation, weapon changes|date=May 31, 2015|website=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dengeki2&gt;''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' volume 593 (9 July 2015 issue&lt;!--Released 2015-06-25--&gt;), [http://i.imgur.com/AlBfaWp.jpg page 90-91].&lt;/ref&gt; The player accepts quests and performs customisations at the Hotel, when not taking orders to progress the story or battling enemies.&lt;ref name=dengeki594_no1&gt;''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' volume 594 (23 July 2015 issue&lt;!--Released 2015-07-09--&gt;), [http://i.imgur.com/c6ce22V.jpg page 46-47], [http://i.imgur.com/suE1ouV.jpg page 48-49].&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnice can also land attack chains using light, heavy and special attacks, with each chain gradually filling a transformation gauge. When full, the player can trigger a transformation which increases offensive power. Her demon form allows her to control flames, while her rabbit form focuses on speed and melee combat, and her phantom form improves her recovery capabilities.&lt;ref name=dengeki594_no3/&gt; She is also able to transform her blood into different types of blood power weapons depending on the situation, such as daggers and longswords, which change her attack moveset and the abilities of summoned demons.&lt;ref name=gem3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201506/01079470.html|title=『よるのないくに』主人公アーナスの変身や"従魔"、武器チェンジなど戦闘システム詳細が明らかに 新キャラ情報も！(1/2)|date=June 1, 2015|website=[[Famitsu]]|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also contains an optional arena where players can take on various challenges and earn rewards, and these include battles with special restrictions placed upon them and fighting against enemies within a labyrinth.&lt;ref name=dengeki2/&gt;

==Setting==
The game follows the journey of two girls within an uncharted land known as Rusewall Island, where no one sleeps at night. After humans emerged victorious from the battle against the Ruler of the Night, the blue blood from the monster scattered and polluted those who bathed in it, changing them into creatures known as Jayou which steal night-time from the people.&lt;ref name=gem2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/05/yoru-no-nai-kuni-first-details-screenshots|title=Yoru no Nai Kuni first details, screenshots|date=May 17, 2015|website=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201506/15080782.html|title=『よるのないくに』 ストーリーの詳細、大型邪妖とのバトル、プレミアムボックス特典などが公開(1/3)|date=June 15, 2015|website=[[Famitsu]]|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ant farm]]s had been popularized in 1956 by [[Milton Levine]].&lt;ref name="Beerenbaum"/&gt; [[Harold von Braunhut]] invented a brine-shrimp-based product the next year, 1957.&lt;ref name="Beerenbaum"&gt;{{cite book |author=May Berenbaum |authorlink=May Berenbaum |year=2000 |title=Buzzwords: a Scientist Muses on Sex, Bugs, and Rock 'n' Roll |publisher=[[Joseph Henry Press]] |isbn=978-0-309-06835-2 |chapter=Sea monkey see, sea monkey do |pages=45–49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nSNEHxcESIC&amp;pg=PT38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Braunhut collaborated with marine biologist Dr. Anthony D'Agostino to develop the proper mix of nutrients and chemicals in dry form that could be added to plain tap water to create an accommodating habitat for the shrimp to thrive. Von Braunhut was granted a patent for this process on July 4, 1972.&lt;ref name="Sea-Monkeys unofficial website"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Sea-Monkeys|url=https://toytales.ca/sea-monkeys/|website=ToyTales.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were initially called "Instant Life" and sold for $0.49,&lt;ref name="Sea-Monkeys"/&gt; but von Braunhut changed the name to "Sea-Monkeys" in 1962. The new name was based on the supposed resemblance of the animals' tails to those of [[monkey]]s, and their [[saline water|salt-water]] habitat.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tim Walsh |year=2005 |title=Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers who Created Them |publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7407-5571-2 |chapter=Ant Farm and Sea-Monkeys |pages=124–129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;pg=PA128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea-Monkeys were intensely marketed in [[comic book]]s throughout the 1960s and early 1970s&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; using illustrations by the comic-book illustrator [[Joe Orlando]]. These showed [[humanoid]] animals that bear no resemblance to the crustaceans.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; Many purchasers were disappointed by the dissimilarity and by the short lifespan of the animals.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; Von Braunhut is quoted as stating: "I think I bought something like 3.2 million pages of comic book advertising a year. It worked beautifully."&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;

==Use==
A colony is started by adding the contents of a packet labelled "Water Purifier" to a tank of water. This packet contains [[salt]], water conditioner, and some brine shrimp eggs. After 24 hours, this is augmented with the contents of a packet labelled "Instant Life Eggs", containing more eggs, [[yeast]], [[borax]], soda, salt, some food and sometimes a [[dye]].&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, Sea-Monkeys hatch from the eggs that were in the "Water Purifier" packet. "Growth Food" containing yeast and [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] is then added every few days. The best temperature for hatching is {{convert|24–27|C|F}}&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sharon M.

==Biology==

The animals sold as Sea-Monkeys are an artificial breed known as ''Artemia NYOS'' (New York Ocean Science), formed by [[hybrid (biology)|hybridising]] different species of ''[[Artemia]]''.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; They live longer and grow bigger than ordinary brine shrimp.&lt;ref name="Sea-Monkeys"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Walsh|title=Official Sea Monkeys Website Cite|url=https://www.sea-monkeys.com/about-the-sea-monkeys/|website=sea-monkeys.com}}&lt;/ref https://www.sea-monkeys.com/about-the-sea-monkeys/&lt;/ref&gt; They undergo [[cryptobiosis]] or [[anhydrobiosis]], a condition of apparent lifelessness which allows them to survive the [[desiccation]] of the [[temporary pool]]s in which they live.&lt;ref name="Beerenbaum"/&gt;

[[Astronaut]] [[John Glenn]] took Sea-Monkeys into space on October 29, 1998, aboard [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] during mission [[STS-95]]. After nine days in space, they were returned to Earth, and hatched eight weeks later apparently unaffected by their travels.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;
However, earlier experiments on ''[[Apollo 16]]'' and ''[[Apollo 17]]'', where the eggs (along with other biological systems in a state of rest, such as spores, seeds and cysts) traveled to the Moon and back and were exposed to significant [[cosmic ray]]s, observed 
a high sensitivity to cosmic radiation in the ''[[Artemia salina]]'' eggs; only 10% of the embryos which were induced to develop from eggs survived to adulthood.  The most common mutations found during the developmental stages of the radiated eggs were deformations of the abdomen or deformations on the swimming appendages and naupliar eye of the [[Crustacean larvae#Nauplius|nauplius]].&lt;ref name=R15&gt;{{cite journal |author=H.

The '''Sells Floto Circus''' was a combination of the [[Floto Dog &amp; Pony Show]] and the [[Sells Brothers Circus]] that toured with sideshow acts in the United States during the early 1900s.

==History==
[[Frederick Gilmer Bonfils]] and [[Harry Heye Tammen]] owned the first outfit as well as the [[Denver Post]], and the "Floto" name came from the Post's one-time sportswriter, Otto Floto. During the 1914-1915 seasons the circus featured [[Buffalo Bill Cody]].

the sells floto circus aborbed buffalo bill wild west shows, and  the sells brothers circus. it also was a "combined" shows.  later became the concessions department of Ringling brothers circus. along with haggenback wallace who made the floats, and other equipment
 

The circus had four elephant births, three born to "Alice" and one to "Mama Mary". The sire of all four was "Snyder". None survived longer than five months.

By 1929 the Sells Floto Circus was part of the [[American Circus Corporation]] which consisted of [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus]], the [[John Robinson Circus]], the [[Sparks Circus]], and the [[Al G. Barnes Circus]].  [[John Nicholas Ringling]] then bought [[American Circus Corporation]] for $1.7-million creating a monopoly of traveling circus in America.&lt;ref name=acc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ringling.com/explore/history/bailey_2.aspx |title=Bailey and the Ringlings |accessdate=2008-07-21 |quote=In 1929, reacting to the fact that his competitor, the American Circus Corporation, had signed a contract to perform in New York's Madison Square Garden, Ringling purchased American Circus for $1.7-million. In one fell swoop, Ringling had absorbed five major shows: Sells-Floto, Al G. Barnes, Sparks, Hagenbeck-Wallace, and John Robinson. |publisher=[[Feld Entertainment]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611203430/http://www.ringling.com/explore/history/bailey_2.aspx |archivedate=2008-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sesinho''' is a popular Brazilian comic character and a mascot of  [[Industrial Social Services|SESI]]. He is characterized as a seven-year-old boy who is shrewd, smart, adventurous, and part of a gang named ''Sesinho's Gang''. The character was created in 1947, became popular through the 1960s, and recently became known again with the relaunch of the character in 2001. With the success of his magazine, the character was adapted for cartoons and multimedia in the following years.

== Characters ==
* '''Sesinho''': Sesinho is a boy adventurer and a good friend who is the leader of ''Sesinho's Gang''. He is the protagonist in most stories, in the earliest stories was an ingenuous kid, but then became more intelligent and help their friends in personal problems. He has an older sister named Alice, and a pet dog named Amigão. His name comes from SESI, the company responsible for the publication of the magazines.
* '''Nina''': She is considered the 'nerd' of the gang. She is a very intelligent and studious girl, and is an inventor, doing various experiments in her garage. She considers books a better way to learn than searching the internet or using DVDs.
* '''Ruivo''': The most distracted and naive member of the gang. Always does things before thinking, often getting into trouble. Ruivo means "redhead" an allusion to the colour of the character's hair.
* '''Bocão''': In the first stories he was a rude and coarse bully. Over time he became friends with Sesinho and the others, although he occasionally displays his old habits. His name means "big mouth" because of his gluttony and laziness.

* '''David''': The aspiring sorcerer of the gang. He has a magic wand that serves to create somewhat useful magic. He is always wearing a wizard's apron.
* '''Tuta''': He is a [[Afro-Brazilians|afro-Brazilian]] boy and the sportiest member of the group. He often accompanies his friends on their adventures and has a younger brother named Tito.

=== Comics ===
[[File:Sesinho comic.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Cover to '''Sesinho''' #01, 2001]]
The first edition of the Sesinho comic was published in 1947, one year after the creation of SESI. The magazine served as a method to alleviate the sorrow caused earlier in [[World War II]]. Shows children's comics of adventure designed by several Brazilian cartoonists. It became quite popular and was sold until 1960, before slowly declining in popularity. In total, there were 154 magazines published.
&lt;!--Someone who speaks Portuguese should review the sources to see if the production timeline is correct.--&gt;

The character was reintroduced in 2001, this time with a redesign and new characters, when SESI once again began publishing the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.sesi.org.br/Programas/sesinho.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060851/http://www3.sesi.org.br/Programas/sesinho.htm |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the first version that was sold, this version was freely distributed by business schools. It was so successful that it became popular outside the schools as well. SESI also began producing a series of animated shorts to be displayed on educational channels such as [[Futura (TV channel)|Futura]] and [[TV Cultura]]. The modern magazines have an educational focus, with about half of the pages devoted to a story, and the rest to educational games. The adventures in which the characters get involved are always related to social issues (e.g. health, education, child labor).

=== Animation ===
With the relaunch of the comic series were made some animated shorts for television. The first new series was launched around 2002–2003 by Futura. In 2005, they launched another new series, entitled ''Sesinho: É Tempo de Aprender'' (''Sesinho: It's Time to Learn''), which aired for a few years, the last season being in 2008. In 2009, a new version, entitled ''Sesinho: Educação, Saúde e Lazer'' (''Sesinho: Education, Health and Recreation'') was launched. This series aired on TV Cultura until 2011. The show is no longer being broadcast.{{Clarify|date=July 2013|reason=As of when?}}

By the time the SESI has not shown interest in adapting the stories of the comics or make a larger series.

"'''Someone to Watch Over Me'''" is the 116th episode of the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the 22nd episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 5)|fifth season]]. It was directed by cast member [[Robert Duncan McNeil]] (Lt. [[Tom Paris]]).

In this episode, [[Doctor (Star Trek)|the Doctor]] and [[Seven of Nine]], a hologram and an ex-[[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], are learning to deal with [[romantic love|romance]] in a Pygmalion-esqe story, with the Doctor as Henry Higgins and Seven as an intergalactic Eliza Doolittle.

==Plot==
Captain [[Kathryn Janeway]] and [[Tuvok]] leave the ship as official guests of a nearby colony; [[Neelix]] is assigned the task of escorting the colony's guest, Tomin, aboard the ship. Neelix is surprised that Tomin is quick to break the strict regime set by his people to sample everything from food to entertainment that ''Voyager'' has to offer. The crew finds that Tomin's physiology is unable to handle the synthahol used in drinks and becomes highly intoxicated on the night prior to the return of his elder, on the night a shipwide reception is due to take place for him. Neelix works with [[The Doctor (Star Trek)|the Doctor]] and [[Seven of Nine]] to use Seven's [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] nano-probes to process the synthahol. Tomin, though still unsteady on his feet, is collected enough to greet his elder, Janeway, and Tuvok with Neelix's help in the same regiment he initially arrived with. To their surprise, the elder thought that Tomin would have taken time to sample what ''Voyager'' had, in moderation. Neelix is commended for his duties.

Meanwhile, after [[Tom Paris]] and [[B'Elanna Torres]] become upset after discovering Seven observing and documenting their romantic interactions, The Doctor offers to help teach Seven on human courting rituals through an elaborate educational course, including such elements as singing. Seven works her way up from interactions with holodeck men and eventually ends up on a date with another human crewman. When they attempt to dance, Seven's strength strains the crewmen's arms, prematurely ending the date. Seven comes to believe that she is unsuitable for dating. The Doctor has become somewhat smitten with her, and on a bet with Paris, offers to take her to Tomin's reception. Seven's behavior is perfectly appropriate for the event but upon learning of the Doctor's bet, she storms off.

The Doctor, alone, practises wooing Seven in the holodeck, noting to the simulation that the last few dates have been "unforgettable". However, his practice is interrupted by the real Seven. She presents the Doctor with an enhanced tricorder as a gift for his help, but admits that she believes there is no suitable mate on board, leaving the Doctor unable to express his feelings to the real Seven. After she leaves, the Doctor begins to play [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (song)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]" on piano in one of the training hologram simulations.

{{Culture of Cape Verde}}
[[Cape Verde]] has risen to prominence in a number of [[sports|sporting areas]] in recent decades.

==History==
The first sport began in the island of São Vicente in the start of the 20th century, one of the first sports brought to the island was tennis and golf brought by the British and passengers visiting through Cape Verde.  Later it spread to Santiago where the colonial capital was located and Sal.

Kite surfing, windsurfing has recently increased in use and popularity in Cape Verde today.

==Football==
{{Main|Football in Cape Verde}}
Football is the most popular sport in Cape Verde and has been for many years.  Today it is one of the few countries that does not use the common division system (e.g. the Gambia, another small country uses the national division system and has the Premier and Second Divisions), another small country smaller in size is [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] who uses the same system as Cape Verde, but the system which Cape Verde used up to the 1990s having only a national championship match, the winner of each island competes in the national championships, sometimes when an island winner also won the championship as they won a national title in the previous season, a second place club competes, the national winner competes in the following season.  The first edition was held in 1953 and was the Colonial Championships held up to 1974 as Cape Verde was under Portuguese rule.  After Cape Verde became independent in 1975, it held its first edition in 1976, three championship competitions were cancelled, the first was difficulty of finding a winner from Sotavento, that year, other islands competed in the national championships.  Mindelense also has the most number of national titles numbering 12.

The first regional championship was [[São Vicente Island League|São Vicente]], its first edition was held in 1938.  [[CS Mindelense|Mindelense]] won the most number of titles numbering 48, the highest of any of the regional championships in the world. The [[Santiago Island League]] is the second oldest and since 2001 and formally since 2003, broken up into two zones.  There are 11 championships in 9 islands, two are in the North and South Zones.  Cape Verde has over 100 football clubs.  Youth championships are held in most islands.

The nation also has the cup, the super cup and the opening tournament in each region, the Santiago North Zone does not have these competitions.  The [[Taça Nacional de Cabo Verde|Cape Verdean Cup]] held its first edition in 2007, it was held four times up to 2012, afterwards it was cancelled.  The winner of the cup from each island competed.  Maio competed twice and Brava competed once.  Santiago North never competed.  There are 11 cup competitions, Santiago North does not have any, Santo Antão has both the North and South Zones and since 2016, the regional level.

The [[Cape Verdean Super Cup]] took place in 2013 with its first edition, the champion featured a cup winner, Sporting Praia win their only title, a year later the champion faced a super cup winner from the previous year, Mindelense won their only title in the recent edition in 2014.

The first club to compete at the African level was [[Sporting Clube da Praia|Sporting Praia]] in 1993, years after Cape Verde became a CAF member.  A total of five clubs participated including Sporting Praia, Mindelense, [[FC Derby]], [[Boavista FC (Cape Verde)|Boavista Praia]] and [[CD Travadores|Travadores]], only one club [[SC Atlético]] was disqualified in 1992 due to that the football federation did not name the entrant on time.

Mindelense is the oldest football club in Cape Verde.  It also has the westernmost club in the whole of Africa named [[Tarrafal de Monte Trigo]], a lesser club and a newly established one who participated in the Santo Antão South Zone in the 2013-14 season.

The Opening Tournaments (Association Cup in some islands) has one part with a club meeting once, some has three or four rounds than a final match.

There are several venues for football, [[Estádio da Várzea]] in Praia, the capital is the most used, second is Mindelo's [[Estádio Municipal Adérito Sena]] is the second most used.  Santiago has the most number of football venues.  Boa Vista, Maio and Brava have only a venue each.

==Basketball==
{{Main|Basketball in Cape Verde}}
Basketball is the country's second most popular sport, popularity continues to grow today.  Today it is one of the few countries that does not use the common division system,  another small country smaller in size is [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] who uses the same system as Cape Verde, but the system which Cape Verde used up to the 1990s having only a national championship match, the winner of each island competes in the national championships, sometimes when an island winner also won the championship as they won a national title in the previous season, a second place club competes, the national winner competes in the following season.

The championship was first held after independence.

[[AD Bairro|ADESBA]] is the only champion to compete at the continental level in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asemana.publ.cv/spip.php?article115303&amp;ak=1|title=Liga dos Campeões Africanos: Bairro termina na oitava posição|trans-title=African Champions League, Bairro Finished Eight in Basketball|newspaper=A Semana|date=19 December 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volleyball==
Volleyball is another sport in Cape Verde.

==Futsal==
Futsal, a sport originated in Brazil has increasing in popularity in Cape Verde.

==Golf==
A small golf course is located about 3&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Mindelo]] in the island of São Vicente and was the first of its kind in Cape Verde.  More golf courses are planned especially in the Island of Sal and probably near [[Salamansa]].

==Kite and wind surfing==
Surfing is not done in Cape Verde.  Other related sports such as kite and wind surfing are common in Cape Verde.  It was introduced at the time of independence and was mainly dominant in the island of São Vicente.  After the end of the 20th century, this type of sports was gaining in other islands notably Sal and Boa Vista which has a lot of sands and dunes with its desert-type landscape.  Much of them were tourists.  Its popularity was gaining in recent years in the two eastern islands mostly by tourists. It made Sal and Boa Vista the commonplace of kite and wind surfing in the country and does into the present day.

==Other sports==
Other sports used in the country are tennis and cricket.  Tennis is gaining in popularity and players in recent years.  The most notable complex in the country are in Praia's [[Várzea, Praia|Várzea]] in the west and another in Mindelo.  Badminton in Cape Verde is not common.

Cricket is another sport, one of the first sports brought to Cape Verde in the island of São Vicente.  At the time, its popularity was mostly done by British visitors in the late 19th century and the 1900s at the height of ship service and refueling at [[Porto Grande Bay]]. Cricket remains popular today but not as much as that time, much of its dominance is in the island of São Vicente, a cricket club in existence today is [[GS Castilho]].

[[File:Barneygoogle1227.jpg|right|thumb|270px|An example of a classic full-page Sunday humor strip, [[Billy DeBeck]]'s ''[[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith|Barney Google and Spark Plug]]'' (January 2, 1927), showing how an accompanying [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] strip was displayed on a Sunday page.]]

The '''Sunday comics''' or '''Sunday strip''' is the [[comic strip]] section carried in most western newspapers, almost always in color. Many newspaper readers called this section the '''Sunday funnies''', the '''funny papers''' or simply the '''funnies'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/funnies "funnies"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first US newspaper comic strips appeared in the late 19th century, closely allied with the invention of the color press.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book| last=Robinson | first=Jerry | authorlink=Jerry Robinson | title=The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art | year=1974 | publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Swinnerton]]'s ''[[The Little Bears]]'' introduced sequential art and recurring characters in [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. In the United States, the popularity of color comic strips sprang from the newspaper war between Hearst and [[Joseph Pulitzer]]. Some newspapers, such as ''[[Grit (newspaper)|Grit]]'', published Sunday strips in black-and-white, and some (mostly in [[Canada]]) print their Sunday strips on Saturday.

Subject matter and genres have ranged from adventure, detective and humor strips to dramatic strips with [[soap opera]] situations, such as ''[[Mary Worth]]''. A continuity strip employs a narrative in an ongoing storyline. Other strips offer a gag complete in a single episode, such as ''[[Little Iodine]]'' and ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]''. The Sunday strip is contrasted with the [[daily comic strip]], published Monday through Saturday, usually in black and white. Many comic strips appear both daily and Sunday, in some cases, as with ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', telling the same story daily and Sunday, in other cases, as with ''[[The Phantom]]'', telling one story in the daily and a different story in the Sunday. Some strips, such as ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' appear only on Sunday. Others, such as ''[[Rip Kirby]]'', are daily only and have never appeared on Sunday. In some cases, such as ''[[Buz Sawyer]]'', the Sunday strip is a spin-off, focusing on different characters than the daily.

==Popular strips==
[[Image:First Phantom Sunday strip.jpg|right|490px|thumb|An example of an action-adventure strip is ''[[The Phantom]]'' (May 28, 1939). With [[Ray Moore (comics)|Ray Moore]] art, this was the first ''Phantom'' Sunday strip.]]
Famous full-page Sunday strips include ''[[Alley Oop]]'', ''[[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith]]'', ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', ''[[Buck Rogers]]'', ''[[Captain Easy]]'', ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', and ''[[Thimble Theatre]]''. Such classics have found a new home in book collections of recent years. On the other hand, numerous strips such as [[Bob Gustafson]]'s ''Specs'' and [[Virgil Partch]]'s ''The Captain's  Gig'' are almost completely forgotten today, other than a brief display in the Stripper's Guide site run by comics historian [[Allan Holtz]].

Many of the leading cartoonists also drew an accompanying [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] strip to run above or below their main strip, a practice which began to fade away during the late 1930s. Holtz notes, "You'll hear historians say that the topper strip was a victim of World War II paper shortages. Don't believe a word of it—it's the ads that killed full-page strips, and that killed the topper. World War II only exacerbated an already bad situation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2008/03/obscurity-of-day-wimpys-zoos-who.html Holtz, Allan. "Obscurity of the Day: Wimpy's Zoo's Who" March 17, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the color press==
After the publisher of the ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean|Chicago Inter-Ocean]]'' saw the first color press in Paris at the offices of ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', he had his own color press operating late in 1892.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;Becker, Stephen. ''Comic Art in America''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''[[Don Carlos Seitz|New York Recorder]]'', manager George Turner had R. Hoe &amp; Co. design a color press, and the ''Recorder'' published the first American newspaper color page on April 2, 1893. The following month, Pulitzer's ''[[New York World]]'' printed cartoonist [[Walt McDougall]]'s "The Possibilities of the Broadway Cable Car" as a color page on May 21, 1893. In 1894, Pulitzer introduced the Sunday color supplement.

''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' is usually credited as one of the first US newspaper comic strips. However, the artform combining words and pictures evolved gradually, and there are many examples of proto-comic strips. In 1995, [[King Features Syndicate]] president Joseph F. D'Angelo wrote:
:It was in Joseph Pulitzer's ''New York World'' that cartoonist Richard Outcault's legendary ''Yellow Kid'' made his newspaper debut in 1895, but it was Hearst's ''[[New York Journal American|New York Journal]]'' that cannily snatched the Kid away from the rival sheet and deployed him as a key weapon in the historic newspaper circulation wars. The Kid led the charge in Hearst's trailblazing ''American Humorist'' comic supplement, with its famous motto: "Eight Pages of Iridescent Polychromous Effulgence That Makes The Rainbow Look Like A Lead Pipe!" Pulitzer fought back by hiring another artist to draw Outcault's character for the ''World''. The publishers' fierce battle over the bald urchin in the yellow nightshirt led bystanders to refer to sensational, screaming-headline style newspaper combat as "yellow journalism." The popularity of that expression tainted the early comics as a less-than-genteel entertainment, but it also made it clear that the "funnies" had become serious business, seemingly overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/hearst.html "William Randolph Hearst and the Comics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Winsor McCay's ''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' began. Stephen Becker, in ''Comic Art in America'', noted that ''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' was "probably the first strip to exploit color for purely aesthetic purposes; it was the first in which the dialogue, occasionally polysyllabic, flirted with adult irony.&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

By 1906, the weekly Sunday comics supplement was commonplace, with a half-dozen competitive syndicates circulating strips to newspapers in every major American city. In 1923, ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'' in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], became among the first in the nation to acquire its own radio station, and it was the first Southern newspaper to publish a Sunday comic section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=M072 The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of the 20th century, the Sunday funnies were a family tradition, enjoyed each weekend by adults and kids alike. They were read by millions and produced famous fictional characters in such strips as ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' and ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]''. Leading the lists of classic humor strips are ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', ''[[Gasoline Alley]]'', ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Smokey Stover]]''. Some newspapers added their own local features, such as ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'' in the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''. There were educational strips, such as King Features' ''Heroes of American History''. In addition to the comic strips, Sunday comics sections also carried advertisements in a comics format, single-panel features, puzzles, paper dolls and cut-and-paste activities. ''[[The World Museum]]'' gave readers instructions for cutting pictures apart and assembling them into a [[diorama]], often with a subject from nature, such as ''The [[Grand Canyon]]'' or ''[[American Bison|Buffalo Hunt]]''. A page on [[covered wagon]]s carried the headline, "Covered wagons shown in an easy-to-build model: Scissors, paste and wrapping paper are all you need to make this Western set."

Some radio stations across the United States featured Sunday morning programs in which an announcer read aloud from the Sunday comics section, allowing readers to follow action in the panels as they listened to the dialogue. Most notably, on July 8, 1945, during a New York newspaper deliverers' strike, New York mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] read comic strips over the radio.

Early Sunday strips filled an entire newspaper page. Later strips, such as ''[[The Phantom]]'' and ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', were usually only half that size, with two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, such as the ''[[New Orleans Times Picayune]]'', or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.&lt;ref name=holtz&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2007/08/strippers-guide-dictionary-part-1.html Holtz, Allan. Stripper's Guide Dictionary Part 1: Sunday Strips, August 14, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;  When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to follow a standardized strip layout, which provides newspapers with the greatest flexibility in determining how to print a strip.&lt;ref name="Watterson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watterson|first=Bill|title=Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book|year=1995|publisher=Andrews and McMeel|isbn=0-8362-0438-7|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One notable distinction among Sunday comics supplements was the supplement produced in a comic book-like format, featuring the character [[The Spirit]]. These sixteen-page (later eight-page) standalone Sunday supplements of [[Will Eisner]]'s character (distributed by the 
[[Register and Tribune Syndicate]]) were included with newspapers from 1940 through 1952.
During [[World War II]], because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller, to save the expense of printing so many color pages.   The last full-page comic strip was the ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' strip for 11 April 1971. The dimensions of the Sunday comics continued to decrease in recent years, as did the number of pages. Sunday comics sections that were 10 or 12 pages in 1950 dropped to six or four pages by 2005. One of the last large-size Sunday comics in the United States is in the ''[[Reading Eagle]]'', which has eight Berliner-size pages and carries 36 comics. Its banner headline is "Biggest Comics Section in the Land".&lt;ref name=holtz/&gt; Another big-size comic section is that of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' which carries 41 strips in eight broadsheet pages although it also contains a sudoku and a Jumble puzzle. Canadian newspaper comic sections are unique not only because of being printed on Saturdays, but these usually are also part of the entertainment or  lifestyle section. A notable exception is that of the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' which publishes an eight-page comic-only tabloid section.

In some cases today, the daily strip and Sunday strip dimensions are almost the same. For instance, a daily strip in ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' measures 4{{frac|3|4}}" wide by 1{{frac|1|2}}" deep, while the three-tiered ''[[Hägar the Horrible]]'' Sunday strip in the same paper is 5" wide by 3{{frac|3|8}}" deep.

=== Early strips ===
Early Sunday strips usually filled a full newspaper page, but over decades they shrank in size, becoming smaller and smaller. Currently, no Sunday strips stand alone on a page, and some newspapers crowd as many as eight Sunday strips on a single page. The last [[Comic strip formats#Full page|full-page]] Sunday strip was ''Prince Valiant'', which was published as a full page in some newspapers until 1970. Shortly after the full-page ''Prince Valiant'' was discontinued, [[Hal Foster]] retired from drawing the strip, though he continued to write it for several more years. [[Manuscript Press]] published a print of his last ''Prince Valiant'' strip in full-page format; this was the last full-page comic strip, though it did not appear in that format in newspapers.&lt;ref name=holtz&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2007/08/strippers-guide-dictionary-part-1.html Holtz, Allan. Stripper's Guide Dictionary Part 1: Sunday Strips, August 14, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revivals===
During the 1950s, there were a few short-lived attempts to revive the full-page Sunday strip. Examples such as ''[[Lance (comic strip)|Lance]]'' by [[Warren Tufts]] and [[Frank Giacoia]]'s ''[[Johnny Reb and Billy Yank]]'' proved artistic, though not commercial, successes.

=== Other formats ===
Other formats for Sunday strips include the [[half page (comic strip)|half-page]], the [[Comic strip formats#Third|third of a page]], the quarter page, the tabloid page or [[Comic strip formats#Tab|tab]], and the [[Comic strip formats#Half tab|half tab]], short for half of a tabloid page. Today, with the ever-shrinking size of Sunday strips, many other smaller formats abound.&lt;ref name=holtz/&gt;

Usually, only the largest format is complete, with the other formats dropping or cropping one or more panels. Such "throwaway" panels often contain material that is not vital to the main part of the strip. Most cartoonists fill the first two panels of their strips with a "[[throwaway gag]]," knowing that the public may not see them, and making them integral to the plot would likely be wasteful. Exceptions to this rule include ''[[Steve Canyon]]'' and, until its last few years, ''[[Mary Perkins, On Stage|On Stage]]'', which are complete only in the [[Comic strip formats#Third|third]] format. Half-page Sunday strips have at least two different styles. The [[King Features]], the [[Creators Syndicate|Creators']] and the Chicago Tribune syndicates use nine panels (with only one used for the title), while [[United Features]] and [[Universal Press Syndicate|Universal Press]]' half-page Sunday strips (most of them use a third-page format instead) use two panels for the title (except for [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]' ''[[U.S. Acres]]''—which used the nine-panel format- during the 1980s, when most UFS strips -particularly Davis' more successful ''[[Garfield]]''—would have a throwaway gag).

Currently, the largest and most complete format for most Sunday strips, such as ''[[Peanuts]]'', is the [[Comic strip formats#Half page|half page]]. A few strips have been popular enough for the artist to insist on the Sunday strip being run in a half-page format, though not necessarily in a half-page size. ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' was the first strip to do this, followed by ''[[Outland (comics)|Outland]]'' and later ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]''. ''The [[Reading Eagle]]'' is one of the few newspapers that still run half-page Sunday strips.&lt;ref name=holtz/&gt;

In some cases today, the daily strip and Sunday strip dimensions are almost the same. For instance, a daily strip in ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' measures 4{{frac|3|4}}" wide by 1{{frac|1|2}}" deep, while the three-tiered ''[[Hägar the Horrible]]'' Sunday strip in the same paper is 5" wide by 3{{frac|3|8}}" deep.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">'''Teatro di narrazione''' (narrative theatre) is a style of theatre, developed in Italy in the later decades of the 20th century, in which there are no actors or action, but only a "narrattore" (a neologism for narrator-actor, or "narractor") who tells the story in narrative form.

==Overview==
During the show, the narrattore often sits on a chair without moving. There are no props or costumes, nor any lights beyond those necessary to let the audience see the narratore: sometimes the theatre itself is lit so that the narrattore can see the faces of the audience to address them directly.

The genre generally said to have begun with ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' (''Comic Mystery'') by [[Dario Fo]] in 1969, though Fo has traditionally used mime to physicalize the actions and the entire cast of characters when performing in this style.  This influenced two generations of narrattori, notably Marco Paolini, [[Marco Baliani]] and [[Laura Curino]]; and later [[Ascanio Celestini]], [[Davide Enia]] and [[Alessandro Ghebreigziabiher]].

Although ''Mistero Buffo'' reworked medieval stories, the ''teatro di narrazione'' has a particular focus on investigating the "dark holes" of Italian modern history. ''Corpo di stato'' by Baliani concerns the murder of [[Aldo Moro]] by the [[Red Brigades]] in 1978; Curino's ''Olivetti'' concerns Camillo and [[Adriano Olivetti]], founders of the [[Olivetti]] business empire; [[Marco Paolini|Paolini]]'s ''Il racconto del Vajont'' the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] of the [[Vajont Dam]] disaster; Enia's ''Maggio '43'' the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of [[Palermo]] during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in [[World War II]]; Celestini's ''Radio Clandestina'' and ''Scemo di guerra'' the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-[[Fascism|Fascist]] occupation of Rome and its subsequent [[United States|American]] liberation; and Ghebreigziabiher's ''Tramonto'' and ''Il dono della diversità'' racism and immigration problems in the society.

[[Image:AlexanderPope.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander Pope, author of ''The Dunciad'']]
'''''The Dunciad''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|n|s|i|.|æ|d}} is a landmark [[mock-heroic]] [[narrative poem]] by [[Alexander Pope]] published in three different versions at different times from 1728 to 1743. The poem celebrates a goddess [[Dulness]] and the progress of her chosen agents as they bring decay, imbecility, and tastelessness to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].

==Versions==
The first version—the "three book" ''Dunciad''—was published in 1728 anonymously. The second version, the '''''Dunciad Variorum''''' was published anonymously in 1729. The '''''New Dunciad''''', in a new fourth book conceived as a sequel to the previous three, appeared in 1742, and '''''The Dunciad in Four Books''''', a revised version of the original three books and a slightly revised version of the fourth book with revised commentary was published in 1743 with a new character, Bays, replacing theobald as the 'hero'.

==Origins==
Pope told Joseph Spence (in ''Spence's Anecdotes'') that he had been working on a general satire of Dulness, with characters of contemporary [[Grub Street]] scribblers, for some time and that it was the publication of ''Shakespeare Restored'' by [[Lewis Theobald]] that spurred him to complete the poem and publish it in 1728. {{Citation needed | reason=Searching available texts of the Anecdotes shows no obvious source for this claim |date=November 2017}} Theobald's edition of Shakespeare was not, however, as imperfect as ''The Dunciad'' would suggest; it was, in fact, far superior to the edition Pope had himself written in 1725.

However, Pope's reputation had been impugned, as the full title of Theobald's edition was ''Shakespeare restored, or, A specimen of the many errors, as well committed, as unamended, by Mr. Pope : in his late edition of this poet. Designed not only to correct the said edition, but to restore the true reading of Shakespeare in all the editions ever yet published.'' Although Theobald was certainly Pope's superior in the realm of [[Historical criticism|historical editing and criticism]], ''The Dunciad'' shows Pope flexing his superior creative muscles, and it succeeds to the extent that Pope's work is the chief reason Theobald is remembered.

Pope had written characters of the various "Dunces" prior to 1728. In his "[[An Essay on Criticism|Essay on Criticism]]," Pope describes some critics of a witless nature. In his various ''[[Moral Epistles]],'' Pope likewise constructs characters of contemporary authors of [[poor taste]]. The general structure owes its origins to the communal project of the [[Scriblerians]] and other similar works such as the [[mock-heroic]] "[[MacFlecknoe]]" by [[John Dryden]] and Pope's own "[[The Rape of the Lock]]".

The Scriblerian club most consistently comprised [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], and [[Thomas Parnell]]. The group met during the spring and summer of 1714. One group project was to write a satire of contemporary abuses in learning of all sorts, in which the authors would combine their efforts to write the biography of the group's fictional founder, Martin Scriblerus, through whose writings they would accomplish their satirical aims. The resulting ''The Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus'' contained a number of [[parodies]] of the most lavish mistakes in [[Scholarship (scholarly method)|scholarship]].

For the mock-heroic structure of the ''Dunciad'' itself, however, the idea seems to have come most clearly from ''MacFlecknoe''.  ''MacFlecknoe'' is a poem celebrating the [[apotheosis]] of [[Thomas Shadwell]], whom Dryden nominates as the dullest poet of the age. Shadwell is the spiritual son of Flecknoe, an obscure Irish poet of low fame, and he takes his place as the favourite of the goddess Dulness.

Pope takes this idea of the personified goddess of Dulness being at war with reason, darkness at war with light, and extends it to a full ''[[Aeneid]]'' [[parody]]. His poem celebrates a war, rather than a mere victory, and a process of ignorance, and Pope picks as his champion of all things insipid Lewis Theobald (1728 and '32) and [[Colley Cibber]] (1742).

[[Jean-Pierre de Crousaz]] who wrote a biting commentary on Pope's ''Essay on Man'' found that Pope had "reserved a place for him in the ''Dunciad''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Literary Imagination, Ancient and Modern: Essays in Honor of David Grene|editor=Todd Breyfogle|year=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The three-book ''Dunciad A'' and the ''Dunciad Variorum''==
[[Image:Pope dunciad variorum 1729.jpg|frame|right|Frontispiece and front page to ''The Dunciad Variorum'' (1729).]] Pope first published ''The Dunciad'' in 1728 in three books, with Lewis Theobald as its "hero."  The poem was not signed, and he used only initials in the text to refer to the various Dunces in the kingdom of Dulness. However, "Keys" immediately came out to identify the figures mentioned in the text, and an Irish pirate edition was printed that filled in the names (sometimes inaccurately). Additionally, the men attacked by Pope also wrote angry denunciations of the poem, attacking Pope's poetry and person. Pope endured attacks from, among others, [[George Duckett (Calne MP)|George Duckett]], [[Thomas Burnet (judge)|Thomas Burnet]], and [[Richard Blackmore]]. All of these, however, were less vicious than the attack launched by [[Edmund Curll]], a notoriously unscrupulous publisher, who produced his own pirate copy of the Dunciad with astounding swiftness, and also published 'The Popiad' and a number of pamphlets attacking Pope.

In 1729, Pope published an acknowledged edition of the poem, and the ''Dunciad Variorum'' appeared in 1732. The Variorum was substantially the same text as the 1729 edition, but it now had a lengthy [[prolegomenon]]. The prefatory material has Pope speaking in his own defence, although under a variety of other names; for example, "A Letter to the Publisher Occasioned by the Present Edition of the Dunciad" is signed by William Cleland (d. 1741), one of Pope's friends and father of [[John Cleland]], but it was probably written by Pope himself.

In these prefatory materials, Pope points out that the Keys were often wrong about the allusions, and he explains his reluctance at spelling out the names. He says that he wishes to avoid elevating the targets of the satire by mentioning their names (which, of course, did happen, as a number of persons are only remembered for their appearances in the poem), but he similarly did not want innocents to be mistaken for the targets. Pope also apologises for using [[parody]] of the Classics (for his poem imitates both [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]]) by pointing out that the ancients also used parody to belittle unworthy poets. Pope's preface is followed by advertisements from the bookseller, a section called "Testimonies of Authors Concerning Our Poet and his Works" by "Martinus Scriblerus," and a further section named "Martinus Scriblerus, of the Poem."

Martinus Scriblerus was a corporate identity employed by Pope and the other members of the Scriblerians. Therefore, these two portions of the preface could have been written by any of its members, but they, like the other prefatory materials, were most likely written by Pope himself. The various Dunces had written responses to Pope after the first publication of ''The Dunciad,'' and they had not only written against Pope, but had explained why Pope had attacked other writers. In the "Testimonies" section, Martinus Scriblerus culls all the comments the Dunces made ''about each other'' in their replies and sets them side by side, so that each is condemned by another. He also culls their contradictory characterisations of Pope, so that they seem to all damn and praise the same qualities over and over again.

The "Testimonies" also includes commendations from Pope's friends. The words of [[Edward Young]], [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] and [[Jonathan Swift]] are brought together to praise Pope specifically for being temperate and timely in his charges. The conclusion asks the reader "to chuse whether thou wilt incline to the Testimonies of Authors avowed" (like Pope's friends) "or of Authors concealed" (like many of the Dunces)--in short, "of those who knew him, or of those who knew him not."

==="Tibbald" King of Dunces===
Alexander Pope had a proximal and long term cause for choosing Lewis Theobald as the King of Dunces for the first version of the ''Dunciad.''  The proximate cause was Theobald's publication of ''Shakespeare Restored, or a Specimen of the many Errors as well Committed as Unamended by Mr Pope in his late edition of this poet; designed not only to correct the said Edition, but to restore the true Reading of Shakespeare in all the Editions ever published'' in 1726. Pope had published his own version of Shakespeare in 1725, and he had made a number of errors in it. He had "smoothed" some of Shakespeare's lines, had chosen readings that eliminated [[pun]]s (which Pope regarded as low humour), and had, indeed, missed several good readings and preserved some bad ones. In the ''Dunciad Variorum'', Pope complains that he had put out newspaper advertisements when he was working on Shakespeare, asking for anyone with suggestions to come forward, and that Theobald had hidden all of his material. Indeed, when Pope produced a second edition of his Shakespeare in 1728, he incorporated many of Theobald's textual readings.

Pope, however, had already a quarrel with Theobald. The first mention of Theobald in Pope's writings is the 1727, ''[[Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry|Peri Bathos]],'' in ''Miscellanies, The Last Volume'' (which was the third volume), but Pope's attack there shows that Theobald was already a figure of fun. Regardless of the quarrels, though, Theobald was, in a sense, the nearly perfect King of Dunces.  ''The Dunciad's'' action concerns the gradual sublimation of all arts and letters into Dulness by the action of hireling authors. Theobald, as a man who had attempted the stage and failed, plagiarised a play, attempted translation and failed to such a degree that John Dennis referred to him as a "notorious Ideot," attempted subscription translation and failed to produce, and who had just turned his full attention to political attack writing, was an epitome, for Pope, of all that was wrong with British letters. Additionally, Pope's goddess of Dulness begins the poem already controlling state poetry, odes, and political writing, so Theobald as King of Dunces is the man who can lead her to control the stage as well. Theobald's writings for [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]], in particular, are singled out within the ''Dunciad'' as abominations for their mixing of tragedy and comedy and their "low" pantomime and opera; they are not the first to bring the Smithfield muses to the ears of kings, but they ferried them over in bulk.

===Overview of the three-book ''Dunciad''===
[[Image:Pope-Alexander.png|thumb|left|260px|A satirical print against Pope from ''Pope Alexander'' (1729). The print was also sold separately. It shows Pope as a monkey, because the satirist calls him by the letters "A---&amp;nbsp;P—E" selected from his name. The monkey sits atop a stack of Pope's works and wears a [[papal tiara]] (referring to Pope's [[Roman Catholicism]], a minority [[Christian denomination]] at that place and time). The Latin motto at the top means "[[Know thyself]]," and the verse at the bottom is Pope's own satire on [[Thersites]] from ''[[Essay on Criticism]]''. This was only one of many attacks on Pope after the ''Dunciad Variorum.'']]
The central premise of the poem is the same as that of ''MacFlecknoe'': the crowning of a new King of Dulness. However, Pope's poem is far more wide-ranging and specific than Dryden's had been. His satire is political and cultural in very specific ways. Rather than merely lambasting "vice" and "corruption," Pope attacks very particular degradations of political discourse and particular degradations of the arts.

The political attack is on the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], and specifically on the Hanoverian Whigs. The poem opens, in fact, with the goddess Dulness noting that "Still Dunce the second rules like Dunce the first," which is an exceptionally daring reference to [[George II of England|George II]], who had come to the throne earlier in the year. Furthermore, although the King of Dunces, Theobald, writes for the radical [[Tory]] ''Mist's Journal,'' Pope consistently hammers at radical Protestant authors and controversialists. [[Daniel Defoe]] is mentioned almost as frequently as anyone in the poem, and the booksellers picked out for abuse both specialised in partisan Whig publications.

The cultural attack is broader than the political one, and it may underlie the whole. Pope attacks, over and over again, those who write for pay. While [[Samuel Johnson]] would say, half a century later, that no man but a blockhead ever wrote but for money, Pope's attack is not on those who get paid, but those who will write on cue for the highest bid. Pope himself was one of the earliest poets to make his living solely by writing, and so it is not the ''professional'' author, but the ''mercenary'' author that Pope derides. He attacks hired pens, the authors who perform poetry or religious writing for the greatest pay alone, who do not believe in what they are doing. As he puts it in book II, "He (a patron) chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state... And (among the poets) instant, fancy feels th' imputed sense" (II 189–91). He objects not to professional writers, but to hackney writers. His dunce booksellers will trick and counterfeit their way to wealth, and his dunce poets will wheedle and flatter anyone for enough money to keep the bills paid.

The plot of the poem is simple. Dulness, the goddess, appears at a Lord Mayor's Day in 1724 and notes that her king, Elkannah Settle, has died. She chooses Lewis Theobald as his successor. In honour of his coronation, she holds heroic games. He is then transported to the Temple of Dulness, where he has visions of the future. The poem has a consistent setting and time, as well. Book I covers the night after the Lord Mayor's Day, Book II the morning to dusk, and Book III the darkest night. Furthermore, the poem begins at the end of the Lord Mayor's procession, goes in Book II to the Strand, then to [[Fleet Street]] (where booksellers were), down by [[Bridewell Palace|Bridewell Prison]] to the [[Fleet ditch]], then to [[Ludgate]] at the end of Book II; in Book III, Dulness goes through Ludgate to the [[City of London]] to her temple.

===The arguments of the three books===
====''A'' Book I====
The poem begins with an epic invocation, "Books and the Man I sing, the first who brings/ The Smithfield Muses to the Ear of Kings" (Smithfield being the site of [[Bartholomew Fair]] entertainments, and the man in question was [[Elkanah Settle]], who had written for Bartholomew Fair after the [[Glorious Revolution]]; Pope makes him the one who brought pantomime, farce, and monster shows to the royal theatres). The goddess Dulness notes that her power is so great that, "Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land," and thus claims credit for the routine violation of the [[Classical unities|Unities]] of [[Aristotle]] in poetry. On Lord Mayor's Day of 1724, when [[George Thorold|Sir George Thorold]] was Lord Mayor, Dulness announces the death of the current King of Dunces, Elkanah Settle. Settle had been the City Poet, and his job had been to commemorate Lord Mayor's Day pageants. Thanks to his hard work in stultifying the senses of the nation, Dulness claims control of all official verse, and all current poets are her subjects ("While pensive Poets painful vigils keep,/ Sleepless themselves to give their readers sleep" I 91–92). She mentions [[Thomas Heywood]], [[Daniel Defoe]] (for writing political journalism), [[Ambrose Philips]], [[Nahum Tate]], and Sir Richard Blackmore as her darlings. However, her triumph is not complete, and she aspires to control dramatic poetry as well as political, religious, and hack poetry. She therefore decides that Theobald will be the new King.

The action shifts to the library of Lewis Theobald, which is "A Gothic Vatican! of Greece and Rome/ Well-purg'd, and worthy Withers, Quarles, and Blome" (a [[Vatican Library]] for Northern European authors, and especially notable for vainglorious and contentious writing and criticism). Theobald is despairing of succeeding in writing dull poetry and plays, and he is debating whether to return to being a lawyer (for that had been Theobald's first trade) or to become a political hack. He decides to give up poetry and become an entirely hired pen for [[Nathaniel Mist]] and his ''Mist's Journal.''  He therefore collects all the books of bad poetry in his library along with his own works and makes a virgin sacrifice of them (virgin because no one has ever read them) by setting fire to the pile. The goddess Dulness appears to him in a fog and drops a sheet of ''Thule'' (a poem by Ambrose Philips that was supposed to be an epic, but which only appeared as a single sheet) on the fire, extinguishing it with the poem's perpetually wet ink. Dulness tells Theobald that he is the new King of Dunces and points him to the stage. She shows him,
:"How, with less reading than makes felons 'scape,
:Less human genius than God gives an ape,
:Small thanks to France and none to Rome or Greece,
:A past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd, new piece,
:'Twixt [[Plautus]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]], [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]], and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]],
:Can make a [[Colley Cibber|Cibber]], [[Charles Johnson (writer)|Johnson]], or [[John Ozell|Ozell]]." (I 235–40)
The book ends with a hail of praise, calling Theobald now the new King Log (from [[Aesop]]'s fable).

====''A'' Book II====
Book II centres on the highly scatological "heroic games."  Theobald sits on the throne of Dulness, which is a velveteen tub ("tub" being the common term for the pulpit of [[Dissenter]]s), and Dulness declares the opening of heroic games to celebrate his coronation. Therefore, all her sons come before her on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in London, leaving half the kingdom depopulated, for she summons both dull writers, their booksellers, ''and'' all who are stupid enough to patronise dull writers.

The first game is for booksellers. (Booksellers at the time purchased manuscripts from authors, and the proceeds from book sales went entirely to the bookseller, with the author getting no more than the advance price.) Dulness therefore decides upon a race for the booksellers. She creates a phantom Poet, &lt;br&gt;
:"No meagre, muse-rid mope, adust and thin,
:In a dun night-gown of his own loose skin," (II 33–4)
but, instead, a fat, well dressed poet (and therefore a wealthy, noble one who would command sales by his title). The phantom poet is named More, a reference to [[James Moore Smythe]], who had plagiarised both Arbuthnot (''Historico-physical Account of the South-Sea Bubble'') and Pope (''Memoirs of a Parish Clark''), and whose only original play had been the failed ''The Rival Modes''. The booksellers immediately set out running to be the first to grab Moore, with [[Barnaby Bernard Lintot|Bernard Lintot]] setting forth with a roar (Lintot had been James Moore Smythe's publisher), only to be challenged by Edmund Curll:&lt;br&gt;
:"As when a dab-chick waddles thro' the copse,
:On feet and wings, and flies, and wades, and hops;
:So lab'ring on, with shoulders, hands, and head,
:Wide as a windmill all his figure spread . . .
:Full in the middle way there stood a lake,
:Which Curl's [[Elizabeth Thomas (Poet)|Corinna]] chanc'd that morn to make,
:(Such was her wont, at early down to drop
:Her evening cates before his neighbour's shop,)
:Here fortun'd Curl to slide; loud shout the band,
:And Bernard! Bernard! rings thro' all the Strand." (II 59–70)
The race seemingly having been decided by progress through bed-pan slops, Curll prays to [[Jove]], who consults the goddess [[Cloacina]]. He hears the prayer, passes a pile of feces down, and catapults Curll to the victory. As Curll grabs the phantom Moore, the poems it seemed to have fly back to their real authors, and even the clothes go to the unpaid tailors who had made them (James Moore Smythe had run through an inherited fortune and bankrupted himself by 1727). Dulness urges Curll to repeat the joke, to pretend to the public that his dull poets were really great poets, to print things by false names. (Curll had published numerous works by "Joseph Gay" to trick the public into thinking they were by John Gay.) For his victory, she awards Curll a tapestry showing the fates of famous Dunces. On it, he sees Daniel Defoe with his ears chopped off, [[John Tutchin]] being whipped publicly through western England, two political journalists clubbed to death (on the same day), and himself being wrapped in a blanket and whipped by the schoolboys of [[Westminster School|Westminster]] (for having printed an unauthorised edition of the sermons of the school's master, thereby robbing the school's own printer).

The next contest Dulness proposes is for the phantom poetess, Eliza ([[Eliza Haywood]]). She is compared to their [[Hera]]. Whereas Hera was "cow-eyed" in ''Iliad'', and "of the herders," Haywood inverts these to become a
:". . . Juno of majestic size,
:With cow-like-udders, and with ox-like eyes" (II 155–6).
The booksellers will urinate to see whose urinary stream is the highest. Curll and Chetham compete. Chetham's efforts are insufficient to produce an arc, and he splashes his own face. Curll, on the other hand, produces a stream over his own head, burning (with an implied case of [[venereal disease]]) all the while. For this, Chetham is awarded a kettle, while Curll gets the phantom lady's works and company.

The next contest is for authors, and it is the game of "tickling": getting money from patrons by flattery. A very wealthy nobleman, attended by jockeys, huntsmen, a large [[sedan chair]] with six porters, takes his seat. One poet attempts to flatter his pride. A painter attempts to paint a glowing portrait. An opera author attempts to please his ears. [[John Oldmixon]] simply asks for the money (Oldmixon had attacked Pope in ''The Catholic Poet'', but Pope claims that his real crime was plagiarism in his ''Critical History of England,'' which slandered the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] and got him an office from the Whig ministry), only to have the lord clench his money tighter. Finally, a young man with no artistic ability sends his sister to the lord and wins the prize.

Another contest, primarily for critics, comes next. In this, Dulness offers up the prize of a "catcall" and a drum that can drown out the braying of asses to the one who can make the most senseless noise and impress the king of monkeys. They are invited to improve mustard-bowl thunder (as the sound effect of thunder on the stage had been made using a mustard bowl and a shot previously, and John Dennis had invented a new method) and the sound of the bell (used in tragedies to enhance the pitiful action). Pope describes the resulting game thus:
:"'Twas chatt'ring, grinning, mouthing, jabb'ring all,
:And Noise, and Norton, Brangling, and Breval,
:Dennis and Dissonance; and captious Art,
:And Snip-snap short, and Interruption smart.
:'Hold (cry'd the Queen) A Catcall each shall win,
:Equal your merits! equal is your din!" (II 229–234)
The critics are then invited to all bray at the same time.  In this, Richard Blackmore wins easily:
:"All hail him victor in both gifts of Song,
:Who sings so loudly, and who sings so long." (II 255–6)
(Blackmore had written six epic poems, a "Prince" and "King" Arthur, in twenty books, an ''Eliza'' in ten books, an ''Alfred'' in twelve books, etc. and had earned the nickname "Everlasting Blackmore."  Additionally, Pope disliked his overuse of the verb "bray" for love and battle and so had chosen to have Blackmore's "bray" the most insistent.)

The assembled horde go down by Bridewell (the women's prison) between 11:00&amp;nbsp;am and 12:00&amp;nbsp;pm, when the women prisoners are being whipped, and go "To where [[Fleet-ditch]] with disemboguing streams/ Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames" (II 267–8). At the time, Fleet Ditch was the city's sewer outlet, where all of the gutters of the city washed into the river. It was silted, muddy, and mixed with river and city waters.

In the ditch, the political hacks are ordered to strip off their clothes and engage in a diving contest. Dulness says, "Who flings most filth, and wide pollutes around/ The stream, be his the Weekly Journals, bound" (II 267–8), while a load of lead will go to the deepest diver and a load of coal to the others who participate.  "The Weekly Journals" was a collective noun, referring to ''London Journal, Mist's Journal, [[British Journal]], Daily Journal, inter al.''  In this contest, John Dennis climbs up as high as a post and dives in, disappearing forever. Next, "Smedly" ([[Jonathan Smedley]], a religious opportunist who criticised Jonathan Swift for gain) dives in and vanishes. Others attempt the task, but none succeed like [[Leonard Welsted]] (who had satirised Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot's play ''[[Three Hours after Marriage]]'' in 1717), for he goes in swinging his arms like a windmill (to splash all with mud):  "No crab more active in the dirty dance,/ Downward to climb, and backward to advance" (II 296–7). He wins the ''Journals,'' but Smedly reappears, saying that he had gone all the way down to [[Hades]], where he had seen that a branch of [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] flows into the Thames, so that all who drink city water grow dull and forgetful from [[Lethe]].

Smedly becomes Dulness's high priest, and the company move to Ludgate. There, the young critics are asked to weigh the difference between Richard Blackmore and [[John Henley (clergyman)|John "Orator" Henley]]. The one who can will be the chief judge of Dulness. Three second year students ("college sophs") from [[Cambridge University]] and three lawyers from [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] attempt the task, but they all fall asleep. The entire company slowly falls asleep, with the last being [[Susanna Centlivre]] (who had attacked Pope's translation of [[Homer]] before its publication) and "Norton Defoe" (another false identity created by a political author who claimed to be the "true son" of Daniel Defoe). Finally, [[Folly]] herself is killed by the dullness of the works being read aloud. The result is, appropriately, that there is no judge for Dulness, for Dulness requires an absence of judgment.

====''A'' Book III====
Book three is set in the Temple of Dulness in the City. Theobald sleeps with his head on the goddess's lap, with royal blue fogs surrounding him. In his dream, he goes to Hades and visits the shade of Elkannah Settle. There he sees millions of souls waiting for new bodies as their souls [[Reincarnation|transmigrate]]. [[Bavius]] dips each soul in Lethe to make it dull before sending it to a new body. (In classical [[Greek mythology|mythology]], the souls of the dead were put into Lethe to forget their lives before passing on to their final reward, but these are dipped in Lethe before being born.) Elkannah Settle hails Theobald as the great promised one, the [[messiah]] of Dulness, for Bavius had dipped him over and over again, from lifetime to lifetime, before he was perfected in stupidity and ready to be born as Theobald. Theobald had formerly been a [[Boeotia]]n, several [[Netherlands|Dutchmen]], several monks, all before being himself:  "All nonsense thus, of old or modern date, / Shall in thee centre, from thee circulate" (III 51–2).

Settle gives Theobald full knowledge of Dulness.  This is his [[baptism]]: the time when he can claim his divine role and begin his mission (in a parody of Jesus being blessed by the [[Holy Spirit]]). Settle shows Theobald the past triumphs of Dulness in its battles with reason and science. He surveys the ''[[translatio studii|translatio stultitia]]'':  the [[Great Wall of China]] and the emperor burning all learned books, Egypt and [[Omar I]] burning the books in the Ptolemean library. Then he turns to follow the light of the sun/learning to Europe and says,
:"How little, mark! that portion of the ball,
:Where, faint at best, the beams of Science fall.
:Soon as they dawn, from [[Hyperborea]]n skies,
:Embody'd dark, what clouds of [[Vandal]]s rise!" (III 75–8)
[[Goths]], [[Alans]], [[Huns]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Islam]] are all seen as destroyers of learning. Christianity in the medieval period is also an enemy of learning and reason in Settle's view:
:"See Christians, Jews, one heavy sabbath keep;
:And all the Western World believe and sleep." (III 91–2)
Pope lambastes the medieval popes for destroying statuary and books that depicted Classical gods and goddesses and for vandalising others, for making statues of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] into [[Moses]].

Settle then surveys the future. He says that [[Grub Street]] will be Dulness's [[Mount Parnassus]], where the goddess will "Behold a hundred sons, and each a dunce" (III 130). He names two sons of contemporary dunces who were already showing signs of stupidity:  [[Theophilus Cibber]] (III 134) and the son of [[Gilbert Burnet|Bishop Burnet]].

Settle turns to examine the present state of "duncery", and this section of the third book is the longest. He first looks to literary critics, who are happiest when their authors complain the most. Scholars are described as:
:"A Lumberhouse of Books in every head,
:For ever reading, never to be read." (III 189–90)
[[File:Hogarth-rehearsal (2).png|thumb|right|260px|[[William Hogarth]] made this engraving entitled "A Just View of the English Stage" in 1727. It shows the managers of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane theatre]] (including [[Colley Cibber]] (center)) concocting an absurd farce with every possible stage effect, simply to get the better of [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]. The toilet paper in the privy is labelled "Hamlet" and "Way of Ye World."]]
From critics, he turns to the contrastive of triumphant dunces and lost merit. Orator Henley gets special attention here (lines 195 ff.). Henley had set himself up as a professional lecturer. On Sundays, he would discuss theology, and on Wednesdays any other subject, and those who went to hear him would pay a shilling each ("Oh great Restorer of the good old Stage,/ Preacher at once, and Zany of thy Age!" 201–202), while learned bishops and skilled preachers spoke to empty congregations. Next come the theatres:  a ''Dr. Faustus'' was the toast of the 1726–1727 season, with both Lincoln's Inn Fields and Drury Lane competing for more and more lavish [[Special effect|stage effects]] to get the audiences in:
:"Gods, imps, and monsters, music, rage, and mirth,
:A fire, a jig, a battle, and a ball,
:Till one wide Conflagration swallows all."  (III 233–6)
Even though Pope was on good terms with some of the men involved (e.g. [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]], who provided music for the Drury Lane version), the two companies are fighting to see who can make the least sense. This competition of vulgarity is led by two theatres, and each has its champion of decadence. At Lincoln's Inn Fields is the "Angel of Dulness," [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]:
:"Immortal Rich! how calm he sits at ease
:Mid snows of paper, and fierce hail of pease;
:And proud his mistress' orders to perform,
:Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm." (III 257–260)
Rich's ability to ride in a stage whirlwind (in parody of God in the [[Book of Job]]) is matched by Colley Cibber and [[Barton Booth]], patentees of the Drury Lane theatre, who mount the stage in purple dragons and have an aerial battle. Dulness is the winner in these contests, for she benefits. Settle urges Theobald to refine these entertainments, to hammer them home and get them all the way to court, so that Dulness can be the true empress of the land. He prophesies that Theobald will live in an age that will see [[Laurence Eusden]] the Poet Laureate and Colley Cibber the "Lord Chancellor of plays".

Settle then reveals some current triumphs of dullness over good sense. He mentions William Benson as the proper judge of architecture,
:"While Wren with sorrow to the grave descends,
:Gay dies un-pension'd with a hundred Friends.
:Hibernian Politicks, O Swift, thy doom,
:And Pope's translating three whole years with Broome."  (III 325–328)
William Benson was a fool who had taken the place of [[Sir Christopher Wren]] and told the [[House of Lords]] that the house was unsound and falling down. It was not. [[John Gay]] never obtained a pension and yet was often remarked as one of the most jovial, intelligent, and compassionate wits of the age. Jonathan Swift had been "exiled" to Ireland, where he had become involved in Irish politics. Pope himself had spent three years translating [[Homer]]. Settle sees in these things great prospects for the coming age of darkness.

The poem ends with a vision of the apocalypse of nonsense:
:"Lo! the great Anarch's ancient reign restor'd,
:Light dies before her uncreating word."  (III 339–40)
Settle invokes the second coming of stupidity, urging,
:"Thy hand great Dulness! lets the curtain fall,
:And universal Darkness covers all."  (III 355–6)
At the very conclusion, Theobald cannot take any more joy, and he wakes.  The vision goes back through the ivory gate of [[Morpheus (god)|Morpheus]].

===Themes of ''The Dunciad A''===
The Three Book ''Dunciad'' has an extensive inversion of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid'', but it also structures itself heavily around a [[Christology|Christological]] theme. To some degree, this imagery of unholy consecration had been present in Dryden's ''MacFlecknoe,'' but Pope's King of Dunces is much more menacing than [[Thomas Shadwell]] could ever have been in Dryden's poem. It is not a case of an unworthy man getting praised that spurs the poem, but rather a force of degradation and decadence that motivates it. Pope is not targeting one man, but rather a social decline that he feels is all but irrevocable. Nevertheless, the poem is still a satire and not a lamentation. The top of society (the kings) may be dulled by [[spectacle]] and freak shows, but Dulness is only one force. She is at war with the men of wit, and she can be opposed. In the Four Book ''Dunciad'' (or ''Dunciad B''), any hope of redemption or reversal is gone, and the poem is even more nihilistic.

==The four book ''Dunciad B'' of 1743==
In 1741, Pope wrote a fourth book of the ''Dunciad'' and had it published the next year as a stand-alone text. He also began revising the whole poem to create a new, integrated, and darker version of the text. The four-book ''Dunciad'' appeared in 1743 as a new work. Most of the critical and pseudo-critical apparatus was repeated from the ''Dunciad Variorum'' of 1738, but there was a new "Advertisement to the Reader" by [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]] and one new substantial piece: a schematic of anti-heroes, written by Pope in his own voice, entitled ''Hyper-Critics of Ricardus Aristarchus.''  The most obvious change from the three book to the four book ''Dunciad'' was the change of hero from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.

===Colley Cibber: King of Dunces===
Pope's choice of new 'hero' for the revised Dunciad, Colley Cibber, the pioneer of sentimental drama and celebrated comic actor, was the outcome of a long public squabble that originated in 1717, when Cibber introduced jokes onstage at the expense of a poorly received farce, Three Hours After Marriage, written by Pope with John Arbuthnot and John Gay.  Pope was in the audience and naturally infuriated, as was Gay, who got into a physical fight with Cibber on a subsequent visit to the theatre. Pope published a pamphlet satirising Cibber, and continued his literary assault until his death, the situation escalating following Cibber's politically motivated appointment to the post of poet laureate in 1730.  Cibber's role in the feud is notable for his 'polite' forbearance until, at the age of 71, he finally became exasperated.  An anecdote in "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope", published in 1742, recounts their trip to a brothel organised by Pope's own patron, who apparently intended to stage a cruel joke at the expense of the poet.  Since Pope was only about 4' tall, with a hunchback, due to a childhood tubercular infection of the spine, and the prostitute specially chosen as Pope's 'treat' was the fattest and largest on the premises, the tone of the event is fairly self-apparent. Cibber describes his 'heroic' role in snatching Pope off of the prostitute's body, where he was precariously perched like a tom-tit, while Pope's patron looked on, sniggering, thereby saving English poetry.  In the third book of the first version of Dunciad (1728), Pope had referred contemptuously to Cibber's "past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd, new" plays, produced with "less human genius than God gives an ape". While Cibber's elevation to laureateship in 1730 had further inflamed Pope against him, there is little speculation involved in suggesting that Cibber's anecdote, with particular reference to Pope’s "little-tiny manhood", motivated the revision of hero.  Pope's own explanation of the change of hero, given in the guise of Ricardus Aristarchus, provides a detailed justification for why Colley Cibber should be the perfect hero for a mock-heroic parody.

Aristarchus's "hyper-criticism" establishes a science for the mock heroic and follows up some of the ideas set forth by Pope in ''[[Peri Bathos]]'' in the ''Miscellanies, Volume the Third'' (1727). In this piece, the rules of heroic poetry could be inverted for the proper mock-heroic. The epic hero, Pope says, has wisdom, courage, and love. Therefore, the mock-hero should have ''"Vanity, Impudence, and Debauchery."''  As a wise man knows without being told, Pope says, so the vain man listens to no opinion but his own, and Pope quotes Cibber as saying, "Let all the world impute to me what Folly or weakness they please; but till ''Wisdom'' can give me something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be '''Gazed at.'''"  Courage becomes a hero, Pope says, and nothing is more perversely brave that summoning all one's courage just to the face, and he quotes Cibber's claim in the ''Apology'' that his face was almost the best known in England. [[Platonic love|Chivalric love]] is the mark of a hero, and Pope says that this is something easy for the young to have. A mock-hero could keep his lust going when old, could claim, as Cibber does, "a man has his Whore" at the age of 80. When the three qualities of wisdom, courage, and love are combined in an epic hero, the result is, according to Pope, [[magnanimity]] that induces admiration in the reader. On the other hand, when vanity, impudence, and debauchery are combined in the "lesser epic" hero (Pope uses the term "lesser epic" to refer to the satirical epic that would function like a satire play in the Classical theatre), the result is "Buffoonry" that induces laughter and disgust. Finally, Pope says that Cibber's offences are compounded by the outlandishness of his claims. Although he was "a person never a hero even on the Stage," he sets himself out as an admirable and ''imitable'' person who expects applause for his vices.

===The argument of the four book ''Dunciad''===
Most of the argument of the ''Dunciad B'' is the same as that of ''Dunciad A'':  It begins with the same Lord Mayor's Day, goes to Dulness contemplating her realm, moves to ''Cibber'' (called "Bays," in honour of his being Poet Laureate and thereby having the laurel wreath and butt of sherry) in despair, announces Cibber's choice as new King of Dunces, etc. Other than a change of hero, however, Pope made numerous adaptations and expansions of key passages. Not only are the topical references altered to fit Cibber's career, but Pope consistently changes the nature of the satire subtly by increasing the overarching metaphor of Cibber as "Anti-Christ of Wit," rather than Classical hero of Dulness. Most of the adaptations increase the parody of the Bible at the expense of the parody of Virgil.

====''B'' Book I====
The invocation changes from "the one who brings" the Smithfield muses to the ears of kings to "The Mighty Mother, and her Son who brings," thus immediately making Cibber the fatherless son of a goddess, and the poem addresses "how the Goddess bade Britannia sleep,/ And pour'd her Spirit o'er the land and deep" (I 7–8). From the invocation, the poem moves to an expanded description of the Cave of Poverty and Poetry, near [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]. Cibber is the co-master of the cave, as "o'er the gates of Bedlam, by his fam'd father's hand/ Great Cibber's brazen, brainless brothers stand" (I 31–2) (referring to statues constructed by Caius Cibber, Colley Cibber's father), and the cave is now the source of "Journals, Medleys, Merc'ries, Magazines" (I 42). These changes introduce the Biblical and apocalyptical themes that Book IV, in particular, will explore, as Dulness's spirit parodies the [[Holy Spirit]] dwelling upon the face of the waters in the [[Book of Genesis]].

When Dulness chooses her new king, she settles on Bays, who is seen in his study surveying his own works: "Nonsense precipitate, like running Lead,/ That slip'd thro' Cracks and Zig-zags of the Head" (I 123–4) and "Next, o'er his Books his eyes began to roll,/ In pleasing memory of all he stole" (''B'' I 127–8).  The base of Cibber's pile of sacrificed books is several [[commonplace book]]s, which are the basis of all his own productions. Although Cibber confesses "Some Daemon stole my pen... And once betray'd me into common sense," he prays to Dulness for inspiration, insisting that "Else all my Prose and Verse were much the same;/ This, prose on stilts; that, poetry fall'n lame" (I 187–90). The accidental common sense was ''The Careless Husband.''  When Cibber casts about for new professions, he, unlike Theobald in 1732, decides, "Hold-to the Minister I more incline;/ To serve his cause, O Queen! is serving thine" (I 213–4). The "minister" is [[Robert Walpole]], an extremely unpopular Whig leader, and the "queen" is both Dulness and [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline of Hanover]], who was a Tory enemy for her reconciliation of George II with Walpole. When the new king is about to burn his books in despair, Pope heightens the religious imagery, for Cibber says to his books, "Unstain'd, untouch'd, and yet in maiden sheets;/ While all your smutty sisters walk the streets" (I 229–30), and it is better that they be burned than that they be wrapped in "Oranges, to pelt your Sire" (I 236). Again, Dulness extinguishes the pyre with a sheet of the ever-wet ''Thule.''

Cibber goes to Dulness's palace, and Pope says that he feels at home there, and "So Spirits ending their terrestrial race,/ Ascend, and recognize their Native Place" (I 267–8). The Christian Heaven-home of [[Puritan]] songs is altered for Cibber to the originating sleep of Dulness. While in the ''Dunciad A'' the palace had been empty, it is here crowded with ghosts (the same dunces mentioned in 1727, but all having died in the interim). Dulness calls forth her servants to herald the new king, and the book ends with Dulness's prayer, which takes an apocalyptic tone in the new version:
:"'O! when shall rise a Monarch all our own,
:And I, a Nursing-mother, rock the throne,
:'Twixt Prince and People close the Curtain draw,
:. . . And suckle Armies, and dry-nurse the land:
:'Till Senates nod to Lullabies divine,
:And all be sleep, as at an Ode of thine.'" (''Dunciad B'' I 311–18)

====''B'' Book II====
[[Image:Dunciad Cibber illustration 1760.jpg|thumb|300px|Frontispiece Book II of 1760 London edition of Pope's works (Vol V), showing the Goddess surrounded by sleeping poets.]]
Most of Book II of the ''Dunciad B'' is the same as ''Dunciad A.''  The Dunce Games are largely the same, with a few changes in personnel. Cibber watches all, with "A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead" (II 44). The contest of booksellers is generally as it was in 1727, with Curll slipping on bedpan slops. However, when Curll prays to Cloacina, Pope provides more motivation for her hearing his prayer:
:"Oft had the Goddess heard her servant's call,
:From her black grottos near the Temple wall,
:List'ning delighted to the jest unclean
:Of link-boys vile, and watermen obscene." (''B'' II 97–100)
Further, Cloacina aids Curll win the race herself, and not by intercession with Jove, and Pope here explains ''how'' she propels him to victory:  she makes the ordure nourishment to Curll, and he "Imbibes new life, and scours and stinks along" (''B'' II 106).  Again, the phantom poet, More, vanishes.  The game for Eliza Heywood's person and poetry is the same as the previous version, except that the promised gift for the victor is a [[chamber pot]]. Curll here competes with [[Thomas Osborne (publisher)|Thomas Osborne]], a bookseller who had claimed to sell Pope's subscription edition of ''Iliad'' at half price, when he had merely pirated it, cut the size of the book to octavo, and printed on low quality paper. Curll wins Eliza, and Osborne is crowned with the pot.

The "tickling" contest is the same, except that [[Thomas Bentley (scholar)|Thomas Bentley]], nephew of [[Richard Bentley]] the classicist, replaces Richard Blackmore. This Bentley had written a fawning ode on the son of [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]] (a former friend of Pope's with whom he seems estranged). In the noise battle, Dulness tells her poets,
:"With [[Shakespeare's reputation|Shakespeare's nature]], or with [[Ben Jonson|Johnson's]] art,
:Let others aim: 'Tis yours to shake the soul
:With Thunder rumbling from the mustard bowl."  (''B'' II 224–6)
In the braying contest that follows, there is a noise that seems to come "from the deep Divine;/ There Webster! peal'd thy voice, and Whitfield! thine" (''B'' II 257–8).  Webster was a radical Protestant religious writer who had demanded the scourging of the church, and Whitfield was [[George Whitfield]], the notable collaborator with [[John Wesley]], whom Pope describes as "a Field-preacher. . . thought the only means of advancing Christianity was by . . . the old death of fire and faggot" who agreed with Webster only "to abuse all the sober Clergy" (note to line 258). Richard Blackmore appears again as the single singer with the loudest "bray."

The progress by Bridewell to Fleet-ditch and the muck-diving games are the same, but, again, with some changes of dunces. Oldmixon, who had appeared in 1727 as one of the ticklers, is here the elderly diver who replaces John Dennis. [[Jonathan Smedley|Smedley]] and Concanen are the same, but Pope adds a new section on party political papers:
:"Next plung'd a feeble, but a desp'rate pack,
:With each a sickly brother at his back:
:Sons of a Day! just buoyant on the flood,
:Then number'd with the puppies in the mud.
:Ask ye their names? I could as soon disclose
:The names of these blind puppies as of those."  (''B'' 305–310)
These "sons of a day" are the daily newspapers that only had lifespans of a single issue.  They were frequently printed with two different papers on the same sheet of paper (front and back), and Pope quotes the investigation into Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (conducted by Walpole's administration) as showing that the Tory ministry of Pope's friends had spent over fifty thousand pounds to support political papers.  The dead gazettes are mourned only by "Mother Osborne" ([[James Pitt]], who had run the ''London Journal'' under the name of "Father Osborne"; he had been called "Mother Osborne" for his dull, pedantic style).  The champion of splattering in ''Dunciad B'' is William Arnal, a party author of the ''[[British Journal]]'' who had gotten ten thousand pounds as a political hack. In keeping with the insertion of Webster and Whitfield, earlier, Pope takes a new turn and has the winner of the depth dive be the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[John Potter (Archbishop)|John Potter]] (1674–1747), and he is surrounded by an army of minor authors, "Prompt to guard or stab, to saint or damn./ Heav'n's Swiss, who fight for any God, or Man" (''B'' II 357–8). These trimming religious authors are people like [[Benjamin Hoadley]] (who had been an aid to Smedley) and John "Orator" Henley. Potter describes the vision of Hades and the Styx pouring into the Thames, but it is not merely Lethe that pours in. Lethe and the effluvia of dreams go into the Thames, so the effect is that it "Intoxicates the pert, and lulls the grave" (''B'' II 344). The Archbishop of Canterbury becomes the Archbishop of Dulness.

The book concludes with the contest of reading Blackmore and Henley.

====''B'' Book III====
Book III is, like Book II, largely the same text as the ''Dunciad Variorum.''  In light of the new fourth book and the subtle changes of Book I, however, some passages take on more menace. The opening, in which Cibber rests with his head in Dulness's lap, is here a clear parody of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Madonna with child]]. The vision granted Cibber is less Christological, as Cibber is not given a mission in the same way with an infusion of the Unholy Spirit, as Book IV provides a new ending, but the general vision of Hades is the same. Cibber visits the shade of Elkannah Settle and is shown the ''translatio studii'' and its inverse, the ''translatio stultitiae,'' as learning moves ever westward across the world, with the sun, and darkness springs up right behind it.

In the survey of the formless poets waiting to be born (in print), Cibber sees the same faces as Theobald had, but with a few excisions and additions. The implied homosexual couple of critics from the ''Dunciad A'' are cut, but a mass of nameless poets contend, "who foremost shall be dam'd to Fame" (''B'' III 158) (both cursed with fame and damned by the goddess Fama for being an idiot), and altogether,
:"Down, down they larum, with impetuous whirl,
:The Pindars, and the Miltons of a Curl."  (''B'' III 163–4)
As in the previous version, these struggling hack writers and political character assassins are contrasted to the glorious dunces who win all the money and fame of the kingdom, while worthy ministers and divines go ignored. Thus, Settle features Orator Henley as a paragon,
:". . . his breeches rent below;
:Imbrown'd with native bronze, lo! Henley stands,
:Tuning his voice, and balancing his hands."  (''B'' III 197–200)

As in the three book ''Dunciad,'' Settle shows the happy triumph of Dulness on the stage, but the lines are compressed and take on a new parodic context:
:"All sudden Gorgons hiss, and Dragons glare,
:And ten-horn'd fiends and Giants rush to war.
:Hell rises, Heav'n descends, and dance on Earth;
:Gods, imps, and monsters, music, rage, and mirth,
:A fire, a jigg, a battle, and a ball,
:'Till one wide conflagration swallows all.
::Thence a new world to Nature's laws unknown,
:Breaks out refulgent, with a heav'n its own."  (''B'' III 235–42)
The theatre is providing a mockery of the [[Apocalypse]] and the [[second coming]], an inverted, man-made spectacle of the divine. For these accomplishments, Settle blesses Cibber and mourns his own failure in Dulness's service. For Cibber,
:"Happier thy fortunes! like a rolling stone,
:Thy giddy dulness still shall lumber on,
:Safe in its heaviness, shall never stray,
:But lick up ev'ry blockhead in the way."  (''B'' III 293–6).
Settle then takes a glance at the loss of learning incipient in the age. In architecture, the fool triumphant is Ripley, who was making a new Admiralty building, while "[[Inigo Jones|Jones']] and Boyle's" fail. Settle wishes for the day to come soon when [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Westminster School|Westminster]] are in permanent holiday. As with the earlier version of the poem, the book ends with Cibber excitedly waking from his dream.

====Book IV====
Book IV was entirely new to the ''Dunciad B'' and had been published first as a stand-alone concluding poem. Pope himself referred to the four-book version "the ''Greater Dunciad,''" in keeping with the ''Greater Iliad.''  It is also "greater" in that its subject is larger. Book IV can function as a separate piece or as the conclusion of the ''Dunciad'': in many ways its structure and tone are substantially different from the first three books, and it is much more [[allegory|allegorical]].

It opens with a second, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] invocation:
:"Yet, yet a moment, one dim Ray of Light
:Indulge, dread Chaos, and eternal Night!" (''B'' IV 1–2)
:"Suspend a while your Force inertly strong,
:Then take at once the Poet, and the Song." (ibid. 7–8)
The fourth book promises to show the obliteration of sense from England.  The [[Sirius|Dog-star]] shines, the lunatic prophets speak, and the daughter of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and [[Nox (mythology)|Nox]] (Dulness) rises to "dull and venal a new World to mold" (''B'' IV 15) and begin a Saturnian age of lead.

Dulness takes her throne, and Pope describes the allegorical tableau of her throne room. Science is chained beneath her foot-stool. Logic is gagged and bound. Wit has been exiled from her kingdom entirely. Rhetoric is stripped on the ground and tied by [[sophism]]. Morality is dressed in a gown that is bound by two cords, of furs (the [[ermine]]s of judges) and lawn (the fabric of bishops sleeves), and at a nod from Dulness, her "page" (a notorious hanging judge named Page who had had over one hundred people executed) pulls both cords tight and strangles her. The [[Muse]]s are bound in tenfold chains and guarded by Flattery and Envy. Only mathematics is free, because it is too insane to be bound. Nor, Pope says, could [[Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Chesterfield]] refrain from weeping upon seeing the sight (for Chesterfield had opposed the [[Licensing Act]] of 1737, which is the chaining of the Muses). Colley Cibber, however, slumbers, his head in Dulness's lap. (In a note, Pope says that it is proper for Cibber to sleep through the whole of Book IV, as he had had no part in the actions of book II, slept through book III, and therefore ought to go on sleeping.)

Into the audience chamber, a "Harlot form" "with mincing step, small voice, and languid eye" comes in (''B'' IV 45–6). This is opera, who wears patchwork clothing (for operas being made up of the patchwork of extant plays and being itself a mixed form of singing and acting). Opera then speaks to Dulness of the Muses:
:"Chromatic tortures soon shall drive them hence,
:Break all their nerves, and fritter all their sense:
:One Trill shall harmonise joy, grief, and rage,
:Wake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage;
:To the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore,
:And all thy yawning daughters cry, ''encore.''"  (''B'' IV 55–60)
However, Opera warns Dulness that [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] is a threat to her. His operas make too much sense, have too strong a plot, and are too masculine in their performance. Accordingly, Dulness banishes Handel to Ireland.

[[Image:Othello-tragedy-18th.gif|thumb|left|160px|An illustration of Othello striking Desdemona from Thomas Hanmer's ornate 1743 edition of [[William Shakespeare]]. The text was based on Pope's edition.]]
Fame blows her "posterior trumpet," and all the dunces of the land come to Dulness's throne. There are three classes of dunce. First, there are the naturally dull. These are drawn to her as bees are to a queen bee, and they "adhere" to her person. The second are the people who do not wish to be dunces but are, "Whate'er of mungril no one class admits,/ A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits" (''B'' IV 89–90). These dunces orbit Dulness. They struggle to break free, and they get some distance from her, but they are too weak to flee. The third class are "false to [[Phoebus]], bow to [[Baal]];/ Or impious, preach his Word without a call" (''B'' IV 93–4). They are men and women who do dull things by supporting dunces, either by giving money to hacks or by suppressing the cause of worthy writers. These people come to Dulness as a comet does:  although they are only occasionally near her, they habitually do her bidding.  Of this last group, Pope classes [[Thomas Hanmer (politician)|Sir Thomas Hanmer]], a "decent knight," who absurdly thinks himself a great [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] editor and uses his own money to publish an exceptionally lavish and ornate edition (with a text that was based on Pope's own edition). He is outshone in darkness by one Benson, who is even more absurd, in that he begins putting up monuments of [[John Milton]], striking coins and medals of Milton, and translating Milton's [[Latin]] poetry and who had then passed from excessive Milton fanaticism to fanaticism for [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Arthur Johnston]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician and Latin poet. Unable to be the most fantastically vain man, Hamner prepares to withdraw his edition, but "[[Apollo]]'s May'r and Aldermen" (''B'' IV 116) take the page from him. (This was a reference to [[Oxford University Press]], with which Pope had a quarrel based on their denying [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]] a doctorate in 1741). Dulness tells her followers to imitate Benson and tack their own names to statues and editions of famous authors, to treat standard authors as trophies (the busts made of them like hunting trophies), and thus "So by each Bard an Alderman shall sit" (''B'' IV 131).

All of the dunces press forward, vying to be the first to speak, but a ghost comes forward who awes them all and makes all to shake in fear. [[Richard Busby|Doctor Busby]], headmaster of [[Westminster School]] appears, "Dripping with Infants' blood, and Mothers' tears" (''B'' IV 142) from the birch cane that he used to whip boys, and every man in the hall begins to tremble. Busby tells Dulness that he is her true champion, for he turns geniuses to fools, "Whate'er the talents, or howe'er design'd,/ We hang one jingling padlock on the mind" (161–2). Dulness agrees and wishes for a pedant king like [[James I of England|James I]] again, who will "stick the Doctor's Chair into the Throne" (177), for only a pedant king would insist on what her priests (and only hers) proclaim: "The RIGHT DIVINE of Kings to govern wrong" (188), for Cambridge and Oxford still uphold the doctrine.

As soon as she mentions them, the professors of Cambridge and Oxford (except for [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] college) rush to her, "Each fierce Logician, still expelling Locke" (196). ([[John Locke]] had been censured by Oxford University in 1703, and his ''Essay on Human Understanding'' had been banned.) These professors give way to their greatest figure, [[Richard Bentley]], who appears with his [[Society of Friends|Quaker]] hat on and refuses to bow to Dulness. Bentley tells Dulness that he and critics like him are her true champions, for he had "made [[Horace]] dull, and humbled [[John Milton|Milton's]] strains" (212) and, no matter what her enemies do, critics will always serve Dulness, for "Turn what they will to Verse, their toil is vain,/ Critics like me shall make it Prose again" (213–214). Picking fine arguments on letters and single textual variants and correcting authors, he will make all wits useless, and clerics, he says, are the purely dull, though the works of [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[Francis Atterbury]] might argue otherwise. He says that it is "For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it,/ And write about it, Goddess, and about it" (251–2). They cement over all wit, throwing stone back onto the figures that authors had chiselled out of marble. As he makes his boast, he sees "A whore, a pupil, and a French governor" come forward, and the devout Bentley skulks away.

The French governor attempts to speak to Dulness but cannot be heard over the [[French horn]] sound that emerges, so the pupil tells his story. The "governor" is an English nobleman who went to school and college without learning anything, then went abroad on the [[Grand Tour]], on which "Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too" (294). He went to Paris and Rome and "he saunter'd Europe round,/ And gather'd ev'ry Vice on Christian ground" (''B'' IV 311–312). At the end of his travels, he is "perfectly well bred,/ With nothing but a Solo in his head" (323–4), and he has returned to England with a despoiled [[nun]] following him. She is pregnant with his child (or the student's) and destined for the life of a prostitute (a kept woman), and the lord is going to run for [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] so that he can avoid arrest. Dulness welcomes the three—the devious student, the brainless lord, and the spoiled nun—and spreads her own cloak about the girl, which "frees from sense of Shame."

After the vacuous traveller, an idle lord appears, yawning with the pain of sitting on an easy chair. He does nothing at all. Immediately after him, Annius speaks. He is the natural predator for idling nobles, for he is a forger of antiquities (named for [[Annio di Viterbo]]) who teaches the nobles to value their false Roman coins above their houses and their forged Virgil manuscripts above their own clothing. He serves Dulness by teaching her servants to vaunt their stupidity with their wealth.

'''Juggling torches''' are one of various [[juggling prop|props]] used by [[jugglers]]. Torches are usually commercially made props that are made of wood and/or metal with a wick attached at one end. The wick is impregnated with a flammable substance (usually [[Kerosene|paraffin]]) and ignited before use.

== Wicks ==
The two most common wicks used with juggling torches are:
*[[Kevlar]] para-aramid 
*[[Cotton]]
Both materials come in reels of material ranging from 13mm to 180 mm wide and up to 100 m long. Around 40–80 cm of wick is wrapped onto each torch. In general, it is best to use hard limiting devices, such as nuts and bolts, to hold the wick onto the shaft of the torch.

== Construction ==
The torch is usually constructed around a wooden dowel which runs the length of the torch from the knob (base) to the top. The lower 8-10 inch section is fitted with a [[Handle (grip)|handle]], and is the section the juggler uses to catch and throw the torch. The handle can be covered in spiral wound plastic, cloth or leather. The middle of the torch is often larger in diameter than the handle and this section helps to balance the torch and makes it easier to juggle. The upper portion of the dowel is often covered in metal (usually aluminium) with the uppermost section covered in a wick. The wick is wrapped around the top of the shaft several times and secured with screws into the wooden core.

Torches as described are commercially available from all the main juggling/circus skills manufacturers such as [[Renegade Juggling]] (as pictured above), Dubé, [[Beard]], [http://flamesngames.co.uk Flames 'N Games], [[Mister Babache]], Henrys, [http://www.playjuggling.com Play], [[Infinite Illusions]] and cost anywhere from around 15GBP to around 25GBP each. The Ivan's Torch by SupremeFire retail at up to 105GBP ($199.99 USD) per torch.

== Fuels ==

The most common fuel used with juggling fire torches in the US is [[white gas]], or Coleman fuel. Beginning torch jugglers usually use some form of lamp oil (like barbecue lighter fluid or kerosene) since it burns cooler than white gas and is easier on the club itself. Alcohol is generally not considered a good fuel for juggling torches.
In the UK fire jugglers almost exclusively use paraffin (kerosene) or lamp oil - treated paraffin that emits less smoke.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jugglingdb.com/compendium/skills/fire/juggling.html#fuel Juggling with torches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balls ==

It is possible to buy flammable juggling balls. Gloves are often needed but not always; fyrefli juggling balls for example are designed so the flame sits a few centimeters above the hand. Ball juggling is easier than club juggling, and with juggling fire balls, any stage performances look impressive. However, juggling necessarily requires the hands to alternately grip the flaming balls for 1 or more 'juggling beats'(usually around 0.5 second), known as 'dwell time'. This restricts the size of flame and the duration of the burn to avoid overheating the hands, even with gloves. For these reasons all commercially available fire juggling balls use a smaller wick and flame than standard juggling torches. Some enthusiasts have attempted to overcome this problem using fuel-soaked balls of kevlar rope and welding gloves or similar, but have been unable to achieve more than 30 seconds of useful juggling before the gloves catch fire.

"'''Wrecking Ball'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Miley Cyrus]] for her fourth studio album ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013). It was released on August 25, 2013, by [[RCA Records]] as the album's second single. The song was written by [[MoZella]], [[Stephan Moccio]], [[Sacha Skarbek]], [[Kiyanu Kim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/catching_up_with_kiyanu_kim|title=Catching Up With Kiyanu Kim|website=BMI.com|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz Gottwald]], and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Henry Russell Walter]];&lt;ref&gt;https://secure.harryfox.com/songfile/public/publicsearch.do (first entry on Harry Fox Agency songfile website listing writers); http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=30531 (songfacts website identifying writers and writing process)&lt;/ref&gt; production was helmed by the last two. "Wrecking Ball" is a [[pop ballad]] which lyrically discusses the deterioration of a relationship.

"Wrecking Ball" debuted on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number 50, and later became Cyrus' first number-one single in the United States after the release of its controversial music video; it retained the peak position during the following week. Nine weeks later, the track returned to number one, and consequently had the largest gap between number-one sittings in ''Billboard'' Hot 100 history without dropping out between. As of January 2014, "Wrecking Ball" has sold three million copies in the United States. Internationally, the song charted strongly; it topped the charts in Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom, and charted in the top ten throughout much of Europe and Oceania.

An accompanying music video for "Wrecking Ball" was released on September 9, 2013. It featured close-up scenes of Cyrus tearfully singing, reminiscent of the clip for "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]" by [[Sinéad O'Connor]], interspersed with footage of a nude Cyrus swinging on a [[wrecking ball]]. Critics were divided in their opinions of the music video, feeling that it was more provocative than the clip for her previous single "[[We Can't Stop]]". "Wrecking Ball" previously held the [[Vevo]] record for the most views in the first 24 hours after its release with 19.3 million views. At the [[2013 MTV Europe Music Awards]], Cyrus took home the award for Best Video and the award for Video of the Year at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Adding to the video's success, Cyrus won the award for World's Best Video at the [[2014 World Music Awards]] in Monte Carlo. Cyrus has performed "Wrecking Ball" during several live performances, including the [[iHeartRadio]] Music Festival and an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Background==
[[File:Beyonce - Montreal 2013 (3) crop.jpg|thumb|150px|"Wrecking Ball" was originally written with [[Beyoncé]] (''pictured'') in mind before being offered to Cyrus.]]

Before directly stating that "Wrecking Ball" was originally written with [[Beyoncé]] in mind, songwriter [[Sacha Skarbek]] tweeted "Beyonce song now becoming a Miley Cyrus song?!! Good/bad? I don't know??!!!! {{sic}}" in December 2012.&lt;ref name="Beyonce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a541314/miley-cyruss-wrecking-ball-written-in-session-meant-for-beyonce.html|title=Miley Cyrus's 'Wrecking Ball' written in session meant for Beyoncé|author=Meg Drewett|publisher=[[Digital Spy]].

But as the song ['Wrecking Ball'] progressed, the songwriters realized the song would not work for her."&lt;ref name="Beyonce"/&gt;

The song, and the cover of its parent album ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013), were unveiled on August 25, 2013, before Cyrus' performance at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]]. She released the cover artwork for "Wrecking Ball" on September 6, which shows Cyrus dressed in a sleeveless white shirt and underwear while swinging on a [[wrecking ball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/music/951308/miley-cyrus-unveils-wrecking-ball-artwork-and-announces-music-video-premier|title=Miley Cyrus unveils 'Wrecking Ball' artwork and announces music video premiere|author=Carl Smith|publisher=[[Sugarscape.com]]|date=September 6, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was serviced to [[contemporary hit radio]] stations in the United States on September 17.&lt;ref name="CHR"/&gt; It serves as the second single from ''Bangerz'', following the [[lead single]] "[[We Can't Stop]]", which was released in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcarecords.com/news/miley-cyrus-scores-her-first-billboard-hot-100-1-%E2%80%9Cwrecking-ball%E2%80%9D|title=Miley Cyrus Scores Her First Billboard Hot 100 #1 with 'Wrecking Ball'|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
"Wrecking Ball" gained mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Marah Eakin provided a favorable review, calling it a "solid ballad" and describing it as "a modern day '[[My Heart Will Go On]]' that discussed a deteriorated, shortlived young romance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/miley-cyrus-ibangerzi-103885|title=Miley Cyrus: Bangerz: Music: MusicalWork Review|author=Mariah Eakin|work=[[The A.V.

Writing for [[Digital Spy]], Robert Copsey questioned Cyrus' decision to premiere a ballad in the midst of controversies regarding her "salacious exploits", but enjoyed the song itself and opined that it "proves that there's method behind the madness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a515810/miley-cyrus-wrecking-ball-single-review.html|title=Miley Cyrus: 'Wrecking Ball' – Single review|author=Robert Copsey|publisher=Digital Spy.

After a month of voting, on March 31, 2014, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' declared the song to be the winner of the 2014 Hot 100 March Madness and their favorite Top 5 single from the past year. It defeated songs like "[[Holy Grail (Jay-Z song)|Holy Grail]]" by [[Jay-Z]] &amp; [[Justin Timberlake]], "[[Best Song Ever (song)|Best Song Ever]]" by [[One Direction]], "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]" by [[Lady Gaga]], "[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]" by [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] &amp; [[Kesha]] and finally "[[Just Give Me a Reason]]" by [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[Nate Ruess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6029403/hot-100-march-madness-2014-the-winner-is|title=Hot 100 March Madness 2014: The Winner Is…|date=March 31, 2014|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial performance==
Before officially being serviced as a single, "Wrecking Ball" made a "hot shot debut" at number 50 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for the week issued on September 7, 2013, with 90,000 downloads in two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/chart-alert/5679851/chart-moves-lorde-keeps-leaping-with-royals-miley-cyrus-debuts|title=Chart Moves: Lorde Keeps Leaping With 'Royals'; Miley Cyrus Debuts Next Single; Keith Urban Tops Country Airplay|author=Gary Trust|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached number 14 the following week with 201,000 downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5680131/katy-perry-dethrones-robin-thicke-atop-hot-100|title=Katy Perry Dethrones Robin Thicke Atop Hot 100|author=Gary Trust|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its official premiere as the second single from ''Bangerz'', the track peaked at number one in the United States in its fourth week, heavily assisted by online streaming credits from its recently released music video; this gave Cyrus her first number-one single in the country.

==Music video==

===Synopsis===
An accompanying music video for "Wrecking Ball" was directed by [[Terry Richardson]], and was premiered through [[Vevo]] on September 9, 2013. The clip features close-up footage of Cyrus emotionally singing to the camera against a white backdrop, having been inspired by the music video for "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]" by [[Sinéad O'Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/sinead-o-connor-pens-open-letter-miley-cyrus-warning-prostitute-article-1.1475086|title=Sinead O’Connor pens open letter to Miley Cyrus: Don’t let them ‘make a prostitute of you’|author1=Chiderah Monde|author2=Stephen Rex Brown|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interspersed throughout are scenes of Cyrus licking a [[sledgehammer]] and swinging on a wrecking ball. At first, she is shown dressed in a sleeveless shirt, panties and [[Dr. Martens|Doc Martens]] boots; as the video progresses, she is then shown wearing only the boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popstyle.ew.com/2013/09/09/wrecking-ball-miley-cyrus-isnt-totally-naked-shes-wearing-shoes/|title='Wrecking Ball' Miley Cyrus isn't totally naked – she's wearing shoes|author=Lindsey Scharf|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=September 9, 2013|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
{{Quote box
| quote  = "I think the video is much more, if people get past the point that I'm naked and you actually look at me you can tell that I actually look more broken than even the song sounds. The song is a pop ballad. It's one of these songs that everyone is going to relate to, everyone has felt that feeling at one point. If people can take their minds out of the obvious and go into their imagination a little bit and see kind of what the video really means and the way it's so vulnerable and actually if you look in my eyes I look more sad than my voice sounds on the record it was a lot harder to do the video than it was to record the songs. It was much more of an emotional experience."

The music video received generally mixed reviews from critics, who were divided in their opinions regarding Cyrus' increasingly provocative image.

''Billboard'' editor Jason Lipshutz opined "Wrecking Ball" is Cyrus' "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]", for their controversial music videos and the artists' music evolution. "A decade ago, [[Justin Timberlake]] was in "My music will shut everyone up" mode, too, as he railed against a teenybopper image". He concluded "Cyrus is breathtaking and talented, and, now that she has our attention with her own version of "Cry Me a River," can dial down the shock tactics and present her artistic vision in the form of a new full-length."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5719195/why-wrecking-ball-is-miley-cyrus-cry-me-a-river-opinion | title=Why 'Wrecking Ball' Is Miley Cyrus' 'Cry Me A River' (Opinion) | work=Billboard | date=September 19, 2013 | accessdate=April 22, 2016 | author=Lipshutz, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;
