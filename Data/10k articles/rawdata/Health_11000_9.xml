'''Alcohol Justice''' is a San Rafael, California-based non-profit advocacy, research and policy organization describing itself as "the [[industry]] [[Consumer organization|watchdog]]."  '''The Marin Institute''' was renamed and re-branded as  '''Alcohol Justice''' in 2011; it was originally named '''The Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alcoholjustice.org/about/who-we-are Alcohol Justice: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Alcohol Justice shifted its focus to the practices of alcohol corporations who produce, distribute, retail and advertise alcoholic beverages. Until 2006, Alcohol Justice focused strictly on alcohol harms and environmental prevention strategies.  These strategies included reducing the hours during which time alcohol can be sold, increasing the size of warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers, requiring warnings on all alcohol advertisements, restricting the content and placement of alcohol ads, and prohibiting alcohol sponsorship of athletic events.

==History==
Alcohol Justice was established in 1987 as one of three major projects funded by the Leonard and Beryl H. Buck Trust at the same time the Marin Community Foundation was formed. The Marin Institute reported in 2006 that "countering the alcohol industry has always been a high priority for the Marin Institute, but we now want to make it the central focus of our efforts. That means we'll put 100% of our energy into stopping the alcohol industry from harming [[public health]]."{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
In July 2011, the Marin Institute changed its name to Alcohol Justice to better align the organization's name with the national reach of its network.&lt;ref name=marinij&gt;J. Bernstein-Wax ''"[http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_18712045 San Rafael's Alcohol Justice, formerly the Marin Institute, still fighting after 24 years]"'' Marin Independent Journal, August 21st, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns and programs==
Alcohol Justice, although based in San Rafael, California, plays a research and advocacy role in other cities and counties of California, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, and has led numerous campaigns for legislation and regulatory reform in Sacramento, California. Nonetheless, it is a national organization that has conducted national and international research projects, conducted hundreds of trainings of youth, community leaders and public health advocates throughout the United States, and participated in international activities as well in Canada, Europe, Africa and Thailand.

===Alcohol taxes and fees: Charge for Harm===

The Marin Institute participated in a flurry of alcohol tax increase campaigns in the early 1990s, which resulted in small increases in beer excise taxes in California at the U.S. federal level in 1991 and 1992. From December 2006 to November 2010, The Marin Institute convened and organized a California coalition to promote proposals for nickel or dime a drink excise taxes or mitigation fees, including [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB1019&amp;search_keywords=alcohol/ AB 1019] (Assm. [[Jim Beall (California politician)|Jim Beall]], Dem-Santa Clara) supported in a testimonial video by [[Johnny Whitaker|John O. Whitaker, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;"Charge for harm testimonial," by John O. Whitaker, Jr., October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charge for Harm campaign supported various bills in Sacramento and the San Francisco "Alcohol Cost Recovery Fee" ultimately vetoed by PlumpJack wine-distributorship owning Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"Advocates Rally in San Francisco to Support a Charge for Harm Alcohol Mitigation Fee," PRNewswire/Sys-Con Media, August 2, 2010, http://www.sys-con.com/node/1484758&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"City Hall clash brews over booze fee," Wall Street Journal,Cari Tuna, August 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.F. Mayor Newsom vetoes fee on alcohol, John Coté,San Francisco Chronicle/SFGate.com, September 22, 2010. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/S-F-Mayor-Newsom-vetoes-fee-on-alcohol-3173753.php#ixzz24hA3vNqr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.F. Mayor Newsom vetoes fee on alcohol, John Coté,San Francisco Chronicle/SFGate.com, September 22, 2010. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/S-F-Mayor-Newsom-vetoes-fee-on-alcohol-3173753.php#ixzz24hA3vNqr&lt;/ref&gt; (More info at San Francisco Alcohol Cost Recovery database.)

Ultimately the California campaign ground to a halt in November 2010 with the passage of Proposition 26 with 51.4% of the vote, supported by the Wine Institute, the California Chamber of Commerce, Chevron, and collectively oil, tobacco, and alcohol corporations. Proposition 26 now requires in California a 2/3 vote of both legislative houses to pass impact or mitigation fees to charge industries for the harm caused by production or consumption, and requires a 2/3 vote of the electorate to pass such fees at the municipal or county level.&lt;ref&gt;"California Proposition 26, Supermajority Vote to Pass New Taxes and Fees (2010)", http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_26,_Supermajority_Vote_to_Pass_New_Taxes_and_Fees_%282010%29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Calif.'s Little-Noticed Prop 26 Squeaks Through in Dead of Night," by Colin Sullivan, New York Times, Nove. 3, 2010. https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/11/03/03greenwire-califs-little-noticed-prop-26-squeaks-through-59912.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stop Alcopops===
Alcohol Justice argues that [[alcopops]] should be regulated because they appeal to youth, who might not like other alcoholic beverages.  When caffeinated alcoholic beverages, commonly containing 12% ABV and packaged in 24-oz cans, went off the market, the manufacturers of these beverages reformulated the beverages so as to be without caffeine.  Alcohol Justice especially argues against the reformulated products partly due to the fact that the alcohol content has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;"Alcohol Justice:  Stop Alcopops",http://www.alcoholjustice.org/campaigns/stop-alcopops.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208053611/http://www.alcoholjustice.org/campaigns/stop-alcopops.html |date=2012-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alcohol Justice is currently lobbying for legislation to limit the size and alcohol concentration of alcopops.&lt;ref&gt;"Model Statute by Marin Institute", http://www.alcoholjustice.org/images/stories/FINALModelSuperSized-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;!--Alistair was never this character's name, so please do not add it--&gt;Ally Gorman''' (also '''Edward James'''&lt;ref name="LMorgan"/&gt;) is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Daniel O'Connor (singer)|Daniel O'Connor]]. The actor's casting was announced in December 2011. O'Connor originally auditioned for a different role, before being asked to audition for the part of Ally. O'Connor was given the part and began filming his scenes three days later. ''Hollyoaks''{{'}} series producer, [[Emma Smithwick]], said that O'Connor "nailed" his audition. O'Connor signed up for an initial twelve episode stint, but his contract was extended and he became a regular cast member. The actor commutes from London to Liverpool for filming. O'Connor made his debut screen appearance as Ally during the episode broadcast on 31 January 2012. O'Connor departed ''Hollyoaks'' on 27 November 2012.

Before his arrival on screen, O'Connor revealed that Ally has a "dark past" that would be "uncovered eventually in true soap style". Ally is Australian and a military medic. O'Connor described his character as a "nice, loveable guy" who is "very friendly and kind". Smithwick said Ally is "contradictory" and "crosses a divide". She called Ally sensitive and described him as a "real guy's guy". A writer for the official ''Hollyoaks'' website described Ally as a "Hot Aussie" In June 2012, it was revealed that Ally would lose his "strait-laced good boy" reputation.

Ally is introduced as the new lodger of [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) and [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]). Ally's storylines have mainly focused on his relationship with [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]). It is later revealed that Ally has a "mystery connection" to newcomer, [[Walker (Hollyoaks)|Walker]] ([[Neil Newbon]]). [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]) discovers this and decides to investigate their past history. Lynsey is later murdered in a [[whodunit]] storyline, with Ally becoming a suspect in her death. Sarah Ellis of ''Inside Soap'' did not agree with a viewers criticism of O'Connor's acting and opined that he is doing a "stellar job".

===Characterisation and introduction===
Ally is Australian and a military medic, who has recently returned from service in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; O'Connor revealed that Ally has a "dark past" that would be "uncovered eventually in true soap style".&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; When asked to describe his character in an interview with Daniel Kilkelly of [[Digital Spy]], O'Connor stated "He's a nice, loveable guy - very friendly and kind."&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; The official ''Hollyoaks'' website described Ally as a "Hot Aussie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/boys/allygrogan.html|title=Ally Gorman (played by Dan O'Connor)|work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]]|publisher=([[Channel 4 Television Corporation]])|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithwick said she liked Ally because he is "contradictory" and "crosses a divide", calling him "sensitive".&lt;ref name=emma/&gt; Smithwick described Ally as a "real guy's guy".&lt;ref name=emma/&gt; Ally arrives in the village as a lodger for [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) and [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]).&lt;ref name="war"/&gt; Both Jacqui and Rhys like Ally.&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; Smithwick revealed that Ally would befriend Rhys and they would become "buddies".&lt;ref name=emma/&gt; O'Connor told Kilkelly that there is a "good bond" between Ally and Rhys.&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; The actor revealed that Ally and Rhys "seem to get on really well".&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; It initially appears that the living arrangements are "quite rosy and like a perfect match".&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; However, as Ally stays longer he questions whether he was right to move in with Jacqui and Rhys as they are continuously arguing.&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; O'Connor noted the similarities between Ally and Ned Parker, the character he portrayed in Australian soap opera, ''Neighbours''.&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; He told Kilkelly "At first, it felt like I was playing the same character that I played on ''Neighbours'', but that could just be a stereotypical Australian thing - that we all seem to be laid-back, genuine people!"&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt;

O'Connor told a writer from ''[[All About Soap]]'' that there is "definitely potential" for a romance to develop between Ally and another character.&lt;ref name="romance"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' Dan O'Connor expects Ally romance|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a360804/hollyoaks-dan-oconnor-expects-ally-romance.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor was not permitted to reveal the character's identity.&lt;ref name="romance"/&gt; [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) and [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]) "take an instant fancy" to Ally, who is not aware of their interest in him.&lt;ref name="romance"/&gt; O'Connor explained "The whole thing is pretty innocent to start off with, but it quickly gets more complicated when Ste and Amy make it their mission to find out whether Ally is gay or straight."&lt;ref name="romance"/&gt; On-screen there is mystery surrounding Ally's sexuality and Ste and Amy are "both being ultra nice and saying suggestive things to him".&lt;ref name="romance"/&gt; O'Connor stated that he knows Ally's sexuality, but ''Hollyoaks'' producers told him to keep it a secret.&lt;ref name="romance"/&gt; Richardson revealed that he was "very heavily involved" in Ally's introduction to the show.&lt;ref name="richardsonds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' star Kieron Richardson teases Ste's future: Interview

Ally is "not bothered" that Amy and Ste have two children, [[Leah Barnes]] (Elá-May Melek Demircan) and [[Lucas Hay]] (Reuben Thwaites), together as he "likes kids".&lt;ref name="whatsontv"/&gt; O'Connor told a writer from ''Soaplife'' that Ste does not want Ally to be a father figure to the Leah and Lucas.&lt;ref name="whatsontv"/&gt; O'Connor said "I think Ste's feeling protective."&lt;ref name="whatsontv"/&gt; Ste interrupts Ally and Amy whilst they are on a date and asks Ally what his intentions towards Amy are.&lt;ref name="meaty"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' Dan O'Connor: 'Meaty story ahead for Ally'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a375732/hollyoaks-dan-oconnor-meaty-story-ahead-for-ally.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, O'Connor commented "Ally's a bit frustrated, but he understands why Ste feels he needs to look after Amy."&lt;ref name="meaty"/&gt; Ally tells Ste he wants a "committed relationship" with Amy and that he "fell for her" the first time they met.&lt;ref name="whatsontv"/&gt;

In May 2012, Amy tells Ally that their relationship is progressing too fast, leaving him "heartbroken".&lt;ref name="rival"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/249679/Hollyoaks-Ally-Grogan-attacks-his-love-rival-|title=Hollyoaks: Ally Grogan attacks his love rival|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=6 May 2012|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy then has a one-night stand with [[Dodger (Hollyoaks)|Dodger]] ([[Danny Mac]]).&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt; Ally returns to see Amy the next day and hopes they can reconcile.&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt; He is unaware of her fling with Dodger, who hides on Ally's arrival.&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt; Amy refuses to reconcile to get Ally out of the flat.&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt; Amy goes on a road trip to forget about her problems, but is unaware that Dodger's cousin, [[Dennis Savage]] ([[Joe Tracini]]), has invited both Dodger and Ally on the trip.&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt; A ''Hollyoaks'' insider explained "Dennis has no idea that Dodger has slept with Amy when he decides to help Ally get back with her. He’s really pleased with his match-making skills but as you can imagine Amy is mortified."&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt; They revealed that Amy feels "terrible" for the one-night stand, which Ally would discover.&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt; The insider added that "Ally feels like a total idiot" and attacks Dodger.&lt;ref name="rival"/&gt;

===Secret===
When the character of Ally was announced, it was revealed that he has a "dark past" that would be "uncovered eventually in true soap style".&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt; In January 2012, O'Connor admitted that he did not know Ally's secret and that the storyline was still being developed.&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; O'Connor said "I've been told that [the secret is] a good one" and added that it would probably shock people.&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; The actor opined that the secret would cause conflict between Ally and other character's.&lt;ref name="oconnords"/&gt; O'Connor later commented that the secret would produce a "very big, meaty storyline".&lt;ref name="whatsontv"/&gt; In June 2012, it was reported that [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]) would discover that there may be a "mystery connection" between Ally and newcomer, [[Walker (Hollyoaks)|Walker]] ([[Neil Newbon]]).&lt;ref name="plot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' Neil Newbon: 'Walker plot is so exciting'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a385157/hollyoaks-neil-newbon-walker-plot-is-so-exciting.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=3 June 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynsey sees Walker threatening Ally to keep quiet about their past and decides to investigate them.&lt;ref name="changes"/&gt; O'Connor told [[Matthew Wright (television presenter)|Matthew Wright]] of ''[[The Wright Stuff]]'' that Ally would lose his "strait-laced good boy" reputation.&lt;ref name="changes"/&gt;

During the episode broadcast on 29 June 2012, Lynsey is found dead by [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]).&lt;ref name="lynsey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' airs shock death in E4 first look episode

===The Kane family===
In October 2012, Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that ''Hollyoaks'' had planned scenes involving Ally and [[Lacey Kane]] (Georgia Bourke) growing close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' lines up Ally, Lacey spark? - spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a422868/hollyoaks-lines-up-ally-lacey-spark-spoiler-pictures.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=15 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor told a writer from ''Inside Soap'' that Ally feels "put out" by Martha's return. She is "out to expose Ally" at a time he was beginning to become liked by the Kanes.&lt;ref name=lace/&gt; Lacey develops a crush on Ally after she steals Ash's credit card and he covers for her. The duo fall to the ground and stare at each other during a game of football. The actor explained that "there's a split second where there is something" between them. Ally gains control over the Kane household because of his encounter with Lacey. O'Connor concluded that Ally has a "hero complex" and "goes about everything the wrong way".&lt;ref name=lace&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ally's game plan|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=13–19 October 2012|issue=41|pages=28|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Jacqui McQueen and Rhys Ashworth advertise for a lodger, and Ally replies to the advertisement. Jacqui and Rhys interview Ally and subsequently allow him to move in. Ally meets his neighbours, Ste Hay and Amy Barnes, and invites them over for a dinner party. Ally is unimpressed when Jacqui and Amy become drunk and ruin the party. Ally considers moving out when Jacqui and Rhys continuously argue. Ally kisses [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) and asks her out on a date, but she declines. Ally goes on the date with Mercedes' sister, [[Michaela McQueen]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]), instead. Ally becomes annoyed when Michaela and Amy argue as they are both attracted to him. Ally tells Michaela and Amy that he does not want to date either of them. Jacqui and Rhys' new lodger, [[Phoebe McQueen|Phoebe Jackson]] (Mandip Gill), steals Ally's laptop and Jacqui refuses to report Phoebe to the police. Jacqui and Rhys pay Ally the amount the laptop was worth and he moves out. Ally asks Amy out on a date before returning to the army.

Ally returns; he and Amy begin a relationship. Ally hopes to spend time alone with Amy, but Ste interrupts them and questions Ally's intentions towards Amy. Amy tells Ally that their relationship is moving to fast and he leaves for the night. The next day, Ally attempts to reunite with Amy, unaware that she has had a one-night stand with Dodger. Amy refuses, and goes on a road trip to forget about her problems. Amy is unaware that Dodger's cousin, [[Dennis Savage]] ([[Joe Tracini]]), has invited both Dodger and Ally on the trip. Dennis hopes to reconcile Ally and Amy. Ally learns that Amy and Dodger had sex, and attacks Dodger. Ally refuses to forgive Amy and returns to the village. Ally and Amy later reunite.

Ally sees Walker and recognises him as "Nick" from the army. Walker tells Ally he is mistaken. Walker threatens Ally not to reveal their past history to anyone, which Lynsey Nolan witnesses. Lynsey decides to investigate Ally and follows him to a strip club. Lynsey confronts Ally and they argue when she threatens to tell Amy. Ste overhears them arguing and decides to tell Amy. Lynsey is later found dead. Ste tells Amy about Ally and Lynsey's argument. Ally and Lynsey's argument was witnessed and the police question Ally about Lynsey's death. Amy provides an alibi for Ally, telling the police that they were together at the time Lynsey was murdered. Ally tells Amy he was at a strip club when Lynsey was murdered. Ally explains that he visits strip clubs to look out for the strippers, as his sister was a stripper and was raped by two customers. A stripper at the club verifies Ally's story to Amy and Ste. Amy tells Ally she cannot trust him and leaves. Ally then pays the stripper for covering for him. When [[Will Savage]] (James Atherton) is accused of being Lynsey's murderer, Ally leads a hate campaign against him. Ally befriends [[Ash Kane]] ([[Holly Weston]]) and they both help prove Will's innocence. Ally and Ash later share a kiss. Ally tells Amy about the kiss, explaining that he suffers from Post traumatic stress disorder and was having a panic attack when the kiss happened. Ally then ends his relationship with Amy and moves out. Ash allows Ally to stay with her. He then later sustains a relationship with Ash, and this angers Amy- so soon after they separated.

==Reception==
''Inside Soap's'' Sarah Ellis did not agree with a viewer's criticism of O'Connor's acting, commenting that the actor had been doing a "stellar job" of portraying Ally.&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|title=Soap Box|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=11–17 February 2012|issue=6|pages=97|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony D. Langford writing for [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com#AfterElton.com|AfterElton]] stated "I see the show is trying to make Ally interesting by tying him into Brendan and Walker's storyline. But the character is so dull and so underwritten I don't see how it can help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/tv/langford-on-soaps-06-27-2012?page=1,2|title=Langford On Soaps: Will Scott Pay for What He Did to Macs on "People of the Valley"?|last=Langford|first=Anthony D.|date=27 June 2012|work=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com#AfterElton.com|AfterElton]]|publisher=[[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]]|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' said "Ever since smooth-talking Ally strolled into Hollyoaks village, the suave Aussie has managed to charm his way into most of the locals' good books - but what do they really know about him?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Anlene Orchard Mile''' is a sporting event exclusive to women held in [[Singapore]] where women either run or walk a mile (1.6 kilometres) on a straight course down Singapore’s most famous and popular shopping street, [[Orchard Road]].  Just for the event, traffic authorities close off two lanes of one of Singapore’s busiest streets for the duration of the race that is usually held in the morning from 7am onwards.  The flag-off for the mile begins near the [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station]] and ends near [[Orchard MRT Station]] where participants run past famous landmarks such as the [[Istana]], the President’s place of residence.

==History==

The Anlene Orchard Mile was first launched in Singapore in 2007 and was sponsored by Anlene, a dairy nutrition corporation. 
The aim is to highlight the risk of [[osteoporosis]] and raise bone health awareness about building strong bones from within through a sufficient calcium intake of milk everyday coupled with [[weight bearing]] exercises as well as to foster the growth and recognition of women in sports in Singapore.
The inaugural event in 2007 saw over 2,000 female participants taking part with local TV and radio celebrities lending their name to the cause.  Although Anlene Orchard Mile is a running event, participants can walk the race according to their own fitness level.  For 2007 and 2008, the official beneficiary of the Anlene Orchard Mile has been the Osteoporosis Society of Singapore (the local chapter of the International Osteoporosis Foundation), where a portion of the proceeds goes to the society.
The Anlene Orchard Mile is modelled against successful mile events around the world including the prestigious [[Fifth Avenue Mile]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the [[Sport_Relief#Sport_Relief_Mile|Sport Relief Mile]] which attracts over 10,000 runners and walkers to 15 events across [[England]].

==Entrants==

The Anlene Orchard Mile comprises three categories – the ''Elite Mile'', the ''Women’s Mile'' and the ''Corporate Mile''.  The ''Elite Mile'' is an invitational category with a cash prize that is open to competitive runners where past race records are compulsory for verification before an invitation is extended for participation by the organisers.  The Anlene Orchard Mile 2007 Elite category winner was Suzy Walsham, a two-time winner of the [[Empire_State_Building#Empire_State_Building_Run-Up|U.S. Empire State Building Run-up]], who walked away with a cash prize of SGD10,500.   

The ''Women’s Mile'' is a category open to women of all ages and fitness levels. The ''Corporate Mile'' is targeted at corporations where female employees are encouraged to participate in groups of four or more.

[[Jesus Christ]], whom the Church holds as its founder, instructed his followers to heal the sick. The early Christians were noted for tending the sick and infirm, and Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals. The influential Benedictine rule holds that "the care of the sick is to be placed above and before every other duty, as if indeed Christ were being directly served by waiting on them".  During the [[Middle Ages]], monasteries and convents were the key medical centres of Europe and the Church developed an early version of a welfare state. [[Cathedral schools]] evolved into a well integrated network of [[medieval universities]] and Catholic scientists (many of them clergymen) made a number of important discoveries which aided the development of modern science and [[medicine]].

Saint [[Albert the Great]] (1206–1280) was a pioneer of biological field research; [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466-1536)  helped revive knowledge of [[ancient Greek medicine]], Renaissance popes were often patrons of the study of anatomy, and Catholic artists such as [[Michelangelo]] advanced knowledge of the field through sketching cadavers. The Jesuit [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602 – 1680) first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood (a precursor of germ theory). The Augustinian [[Gregor Mendel]] (1822-1884) developed theories on [[genetics]] for the first time. As Catholicism became a global religion, the Catholic orders and religious and lay people established health care centres around the world. Women's religious institutes such as the [[Sisters of Charity]], [[Sisters of Mercy]] and [[Marianne Cope|Sisters of St Francis]] opened and operated some of the first modern general hospitals.

While the prioritization of charity and healing by early Christians created the hospital, their spiritual emphasis tended to imply "the subordination of medicine to religion and doctor to priest". "[P]hysic and faith", wrote historian of medicine Ray Porter "while generally complementary... sometimes tangled in border disputes."  Similarly in modern times, the moral stance of the Church against contraception and abortion has been a source of controversy. The Church, while being a major provider of health care to HIV AIDS sufferers, and of orphanages for unwanted children, has been criticised for opposing condom use. Due to some Catholics' belief in the sanctity of life from conception, IVF, which leads to the destruction of many embryos, surrogacy, which relies on IVF, and embryonic stem-cell research, which necessitates the destruction of embryos, are among other areas of controversy for the Church in the provision of health care.

==Theological basis: ''euntes docete et curate infirmos''==
[[File:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''St Matthew the Evangelist and an Angel'' by [[Rembrandt]]. St Matthew, one of the authors of the New Testament, wrote that Jesus wanted his followers to care for the sick.]]

[[Catholic social teaching]] urges concern for the sick. [[Jesus Christ]], whom the church holds as its founder, placed a particular emphasis on care for the sick and outcast, such as lepers. According to the [[New Testament]], he and his Apostles went about curing the sick and [[anointing of the sick]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Parable of [[the Sheep and the Goats]], which is found in [[Matthew 25]], Jesus identified so strongly with the sick and afflicted that he equated serving them with serving him:

[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|upright|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aimé Morot]] (1880) illustrates the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] told by Jesus.]]

{{quotation|For I was hungry and you fed me, thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you received me in your homes. Naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you took care of me, in prison and you visited me&amp;nbsp;... [W]hatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.}}

In a 2013 presentation to its twenty-seventh international conference in 2013, the President of the [[Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers]], [[Zygmunt Zimowski]], said that "The Church, adhering to the mandate of Jesus, 'Euntes docete et curate infirmos' (Mt 10:6-8, Go, preach and heal the sick), during the course of her history, which by now has lasted two millennia, has always attended to the sick and the suffering."

In orations such as his ''[[Sermon on the Mount]]'' and stories such as the ''[[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]'', Jesus called on followers to worship God, act without violence or prejudice and care for the sick, hungry and poor. Such teachings formed the foundation of Catholic Church involvement in hospitals and health care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

According to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'':&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07480a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Hospitals |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-06-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Christ Himself gave His followers the example of caring for the sick by the numerous miracles He wrought to heal various forms of disease including the most loathsome, leprosy. He also charged His Apostles in explicit terms to heal the sick ([[Luke 10:9]]) and promised to those who should believe in Him that they would have power over disease ([[Mark 16:18]]) [...] Like the other works of Christian charity, the care of the sick was from the beginning a sacred duty for each of the faithful, but it devolved in a special way upon the bishops, presbyters, and deacons. The same ministrations that brought relief to the poor naturally included provision for the sick who were visited in their homes. }}

The Benedictine rule, which led the profusion of medieval hospitals founded by the Church, requires that "the care of the sick is to be placed above and before every other duty, as if indeed Christ were being directly served by waiting on them".&lt;ref name="Present p.112"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jean-Jacques Henner Fabiola.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Saint Fabiola]] founded a hospital at Rome around 400AD.]]

===Antiquity===
[[Ancient Greek medicine|Ancient Greek]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Roman]] medicine developed solid foundations over seven centuries, creating, Roy Porter wrote, "the ideal of a union of science, philosophy and practical medicine in the learned physician...".&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.82&lt;/ref&gt; But Greek and Roman religion did not preach of a duty to tend to the sick.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.88"&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]]  emerged into this world as [[Jewish Christians#Jewish origin of Christianity|a Jewish sect]] in the mid-1st century and early Christians from the outset went about tending the sick and infirm. Their priests were often also physicians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; St [[Luke the Evangelist]], credited as one of the authors of [[The New Testament]], was a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.86&lt;/ref&gt; Christian emphasis on practical charity was to give rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals after the end of the persecution of the early church.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The early Christian outlook on sickness drew on various traditions, including Eastern asceticism and Jewish healing traditions, while the New Testament wrote of Jesus and his Apostles as healers.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp.84-6&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Porter wrote: "While suffering and disease could appear as chastisement of the wicked or a trial of those the Lord loved, the Church also developed a healing mission...".&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.87"&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Pagan religions seldom offered help to the sick, but the early Christians were willing to nurse the sick and take food to them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.88"/&gt; Notably during the smallpox epidemic of AD 165–180 and the measles outbreak of around AD 250, "In nursing the sick and dying, regardless of religion, the Christians won friends and sympathisers", wrote historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Hospitality was considered an obligation of Christian charity and bishops' houses and the valetudinaria of wealthier Christians were used to tend the sick.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Deacons were assigned the task of distributing alms, and in Rome by 250 AD, the Church had developed an extensive charitable outreach, with wealthy converts supporting the poor.&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.87"/&gt; It is believed that the first church hospitals were constructed in the East, and only later in the Latin West. An early hospital may have been built at Constantinople during the age of Constantine by [[St. Zoticus]]. [[St. Basil]] built a famous hospital at Cæsarea in [[Cappadocia]] which "had the dimensions of a city".  In the West, [[Saint Fabiola]] founded a hospital at Rome around 400.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Saint Jerome]] wrote that Fabiola founded a hospital and "assembled all the sick from the streets and highways" and "personally tended the unhappy and impoverished victims of hunger and disease... washed the pus from sores that others could not even behold".&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.88"/&gt;

Several early Christian healers are honoured as Saints in the Catholic tradition. [[Cosmas and Damian]], brothers from Cilicia in Asia Minor, supplanted the pagan [[Asclepius]] as the patron saints of medicine and were celebrated for their healing powers.&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.111"&gt;Roy Porter; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Presen''t; Harper Collins; 1997; p.111&lt;/ref&gt; Said to have lived in the late Third Century AD and to have performed a miraculous first leg transplant on a patient, and later martyred under the [[Emperor Diocletian]], Cosmos and Damian appear in the heraldry of barber-surgeon companies.&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.111"/&gt; Notable contributors to the medical sciences of those early centuries include [[Tertullian]] (born A.D. 160), [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lactantius]] and the learned St. [[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636). St. [[Benedict of Nursia]] (480) emphasised medicine as an aid to the provision of hospitality.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10122a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: History of Medicine |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The martyr [[Saint Pantaleon]] was said to be physician to the [[Galerius|Emperor Maximinianus]], who sentenced him to death for his Christianity. Since the Middle Ages, Pantaleon has been considered a patron saint of physicians and midwives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11447a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Pantaleon |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fra Angelico 031.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Benedict of Nursia]].]]

The administration of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires split and the [[Fall of Rome|demise of the Western Empire]] by the sixth century was accompanied by a series of violent invasions and precipitated the collapse of cities and civic institutions of learning, along with their links to the learning of classical Greece and Rome. For the next thousand years, medical knowledge would change very little.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp82-83&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarly medical tradition maintained itself in the more stable East, but in the West, scholarship virtually disappeared outside of the Church, where monks were aware of a dwindling range of medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of this early period was, in the words of Porter, that "Christianity planted the hospital: the well-endowed establishments of the Levant and the scattered houses of the West shared a common religious ethos of charity."&lt;ref name="Roy Porter p.88"/&gt;

===Middle Ages===

Geoffrey Blainey likened the Catholic Church in its activities during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for monks and clerics to practice medicine and medical students in northern European universities often took minor Holy orders. Mediaeval hospitals had a strongly Christian ethos, and were, in the words of historian of medicine [[Roy Porter]], "religious foundations through and through", and Ecclesiastical regulations were passed to govern medicine, partly to prevent clergymen profiting from medicine.&lt;ref name="Present pp. 110-112"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 110-112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pope John XXI.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John XXI]] was a medieval pope and physician who wrote popular medical texts.]]

After a period of decline, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charlamagne]] had decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery. Following his death, the hospitals again declined, but by the tenth century, monasteries were the leading providers of hospital work - among them the Benedictine [[Abbey of Cluny]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Charlemagne's decree required each monastery and Cathedral chapter to establish a school and in these schools, medicine was commonly taught. Gerbert of Aurillac (c. 946 – 12 May 1003), known to history as [[Pope Sylvester II]], taught medicine at one such school.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; Petrus of Spain (1210-1277) was a physician who wrote the popular ''Treasury of the Poor'' medical text and became [[Pope John XXI]] in 1276.&lt;ref name="Present pp. 110-112"/&gt;

[[File:Hildegard von Bingen.jpg|thumb|upright|St [[Hildegard of Bingen]] dictating to a scribe. Hildegarde is recognised as a [[doctor of the church]], and was among the most distinguished of Medieval Catholic women scientists.]]

Other famous physicians and medical researchers of the Middle Ages include the Abbot of Monte Cassino [[Bertharius]], the Abbot of Reichenau [[Walafrid Strabo]], the Abbess St [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and the Bishop of Rennes [[Marbodus of Angers]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Monasteries of this era were diligent in the study of medicine, and often too were convents. Hildegard of Bingen, a [[doctor of the church]], is among the most distinguished of Medieval Catholic women scientists. Other than theological works, Hildegard also wrote ''Physica,'' a text on the natural sciences, as well as ''Causae et Curae''. Hildegard was well known for her healing powers involving practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the Benedictine rule that the care of the sick be placed above all other duties, monasteries were the key medical care providers prior to 1300. Most monasteries offered shelter for pilgrims and an infirmary for sick monks, while separate hospitals were founded for the public.&lt;ref name="Present p.112"/&gt; The Benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monks sought a revival of the ideals of [[Francis of Assisi]], offering care after plague struck at Camerino in 1523.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Healing shrines were established and different saints came to be invoked for every body part in the hope of miraculous cures.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; p.111&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the shrines remain to the present day, and were in the Middle Ages great centres for pilgrims, complete with relics and souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; p.112&lt;/ref&gt; St Luke or St Michael were invoked for various ailments, and a host of saints for individuals conditions, including [[Saint Roch|St Roch]] as a protector against Plague.&lt;ref name="Present pp. 111"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;   St Roch is venerated as one who provided care to plague suffers, only to fall sick himself and be "healed by an angel".&lt;ref name="Present pp. 111"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13100c.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Roch |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-02-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the devastating [[Bubonic Plague]], the Franciscans were notable for tending the sick. The apparent impotence of medical knowledge against the disease prompted critical examination. Medical scientists came to divide among anti-[[Galen]]ists, anti-Arabists and positive Hippocratics.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

[[The Crusades|Crusader]] orders established several new traditions of Catholic medical care.&lt;ref name="Present pp. 112-113"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Knights Hospitaller]]  arose as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in Jerusalem, which was built to provide care for poor, sick or injured pilgrims to the Holy Land. Following the capture of the city by Crusaders, the order became a military as well as infirmarian order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07477a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Knights of Malta |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-06-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knights of St John of Jerusalem were later known as the [[Knights of Malta]]. The [[Knights Templar]] and [[Teutonic Knights]] established hospitals around the Mediterranean and through Germanic lands.&lt;ref name="Present p.113"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlbertusMagnus.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Albert Magnus]] was a pioneer of biological field research.]]

Non military orders of brothers also took up the service of the infirmed. By the 15th century, the brothers of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] were providing care across Europe, and by the sixteenth century the Spanish founded [[Order of St John of God]] had set up about 200 hospitals in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Present p.113"/&gt; In Catholic Spain amidst the early [[Reconquista]], [[Archbishop Raimund]] founded an institution for translations, which employed a number of Jewish translators to communicate the works of Arabian medicine. Influenced by the rediscovery of Aristotelean thought, churchmen like the Dominican [[Albert Magnus]] and the Franciscan [[Roger Bacon]] made significant advances in the observation of nature.

Small hospitals for pilgrims sprung up in the West during the early Middle Ages, but by the latter section of the period had grown more substantial, with hospitals founded for lepers, pilgrims, the sick, aged and poor. Milan, Siena, Paris and Florence had numerous and large hospitals. "Within hospitals walls", wrote Porter, "the Christian ethos was all pervasive". From just 12 beds in 1288, the Sta Maria Nuova in Florence "gradually expanded by 1500 to a medical staff of ten doctors, a pharmacist, and several assistants, including female surgeons", and was boasted of as the "first hospital among Christians".&lt;ref name="Present pp. 112-113"/&gt;

Clergy were active at the [[School of Salerno]], the oldest medical school in Western Europe - among the important churchmen to teach there were [[Alpuhans]], later (1058–85) Archbishop of Salerno and the influential [[Constantine of Carthage]], a monk who produced superior translations of [[Hippocrates]] and investigated Arab literature.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; [[Cathedral schools]] began in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education, some of them ultimately evolving into [[medieval universities]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-06-01 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter wrote that, "The great age of hospital building from around 1200 coincided with the flourishing of universities in Italy, Spain, France and England, sustained by the new wealth of the [[High Middle Ages]]&amp;nbsp;... The Universities extended the work of Salerno in medical education".&lt;ref name="Present p.113"/&gt;

===Renaissance===

From the 14th Century, the European Renaissance saw a revival of interest in Classical learning in Western Europe, coupled with and fuelled by the spread of new inventions like the printing press. The [[Fall of Constantinople]] brought refugee scholars from the Greek East to the West. The Catholic scholar [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466-1536) was interested in medicine and influential in reviving Greek as a language of learning, and the study of the pre-Christian works of [[Galen]]. Roy Porter wrote that "after centuries where the Church had taught mankind to renounce worldly goods, for the sake of eternity, Renaissance man showed an insatiable curiosity for the materiality of the here and now...".&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 168-170&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Renaissance Italy]], the Popes were often patrons of the study of anatomy and Catholic artists such as Michelangelo advanced knowledge of the field through such studies as sketching cadavers to improve his portraits of the crucifixion.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; It is often wrongly asserted that the papacy banned dissection during the period, though in fact the directive of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] of 1482 to the [[University of Tübingen]] said that the Church had no objection to anatomy studies, provided the bodies belonged to an executed criminal, and was given a religious burial once examinations were completed.&lt;ref name="Present p.112"/&gt;

[[File:Gregor Mendel Monk.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gregor Mendel]], Augustinian Friar and scientist, who developed theories on [[genetics]] for the first time.]]

===Development of modern medicine===
In modern times, the Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of health care in the world. Catholic religious have been responsible for founding and running networks of hospitals across the world where medical research continues to be advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/20/health/saint-marianne-cope/index.html?hpt=hp_t3 |title=Mother Marianne becomes an American saint - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Robert Calderisi]] wrote that the Catholic Church has around 18,000 clinics, 16,000 homes for the elderly and those with special needs, and 5,500 hospitals - with 65 per cent of them located in developing countries.&lt;ref name="World Development p.40"/&gt;

====Europe====
[[File:Jeanne Jugan.jpg|upright|thumb|The French Saint [[Jeanne Jugan]] (1792-1879) founded the [[Little Sisters of the Poor]] who specialise in care for the aged.]]
Catholic scientists in Europe (many of them clergymen) made a number of important discoveries which aided the development of modern science and medicine. Catholic women were also among the first female professors of medicine, as with [[Trotula of Salerno]] the 11th century pysician and [[Dorotea Bucca]] who held a chair of medicine and philosophy at the [[University of Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Freddy |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/features/2011/05/06/what-the-church-has-given-the-world/ |title=What the Church has given the world |publisher=CatholicHerald.co.uk |date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuit order, created during the Reformation, contributed a number of distinguished medical scientists. In the field of bacteriology it was the Jesuit [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1671) who first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood (a precursor of [[germ theory]]). In the development of [[ophthalmology]], [[Christophe Scheiner]] made important advances in relation to refraction of light and the retinal image.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

[[Gregor Mendel]], an Austrian scientist and Augustinian friar, began experimenting with peas around 1856.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[Jacob Bronowski]]; ''The Ascent of Man''; Angus &amp; Robertson, 1973 {{ISBN|0-563-17064-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendel had joined the [[Brno]] Augustinian Monastery in 1843, but also trained as a scientist at the Olmutz Philosophical Institute and the [[University of Vienna]]. The Brno Monastery was a centre of scholarship, with an extensive library and tradition of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Bryson]]; ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]''; Black Swan; 2004; p.474&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the processes of pollination at his monastery in modern Czechoslovakia, Mendel studied and developed theories pertaining to the field of science now called [[genetics]]. Mendel published his results in 1866 in the ''Journal of the Brno Natural History Society'', and is considered the father of modern genetics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Where [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories suggested a mechanism for improvement of species over generations, Mendel's observations provided explanation for how a new species itself could emerge. Though Darwin and Mendel never collaborated, they were aware of each other's work (Darwin read a paper by [[Wilhelm Olbers Focke]] which extensively referenced Mendel). [[Bill Bryson]] wrote that "without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life sciences in the twentieth century.

Catholic religious institutes, notably those for women, developed many hospitals throughout Europe and its empires. Ancient orders like the Dominicans and Carmelites have long lived in religious communities that work in ministries such as education and care of the sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/eng/about-us/sisters |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326202047/http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/eng/about-us/sisters |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese Saint [[John of God]] (d. 1550) founded the [[Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God]] to care for the sick and afflicted.

====The Americas====
[[File:Hospicio Cabañas.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hospicio Cabañas]] was the largest hospital in colonial America, in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico]]
The Spanish and Portuguese Empires were largely responsible for spreading the Catholic faith and its philosophy regarding health care to South and Central America, where the church established substantial hospital networks.

Catholic hospitals were established in the modern United States prior to the [[American War of Independence]]. The first was probably [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital, New Orleans]], established around 1727.&lt;ref name="nytimes1994"&gt;{{cite news|author=GUSTAV NIEBUHRPublished: August 25, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/25/us/health-care-debate-catholic-church-catholic-leaders-dilemma-abortion-vs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH; Catholic Leaders' Dilemma: Abortion vs. Universal Care - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1994-08-25 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sisters of Saint Francis of Syracuse, New York, produced Saint [[Marianne Cope]], who opened and operated some of the first general hospitals in the United States, instituting cleanliness standards which influenced the development of America's modern hospital system, and famously taking her nuns to Hawaii to work with Saint [[Father Damien|Damien of Molokai]] in the care of lepers. St Damien himself is considered a [[martyr of charity]] and model of Catholic humanitarianism for his mission to the lepers of Molokai.

The Catholic Church is the largest private provider of health care in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;''The Health Care Debate: The Catholic Church; Catholic Leaders' Dilema: Abortion vs. Universal Care''; by [[Gustav Niebuhr]], New York Times, 25 August 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, the church provided about one in six hospital beds in America, at around 566 hospitals, many established by nuns.&lt;ref name="nytimes1994"/&gt; The church has carried a disproportionate number of poor and uninsured patients at its facilities and the American bishops first called for [[universal health care]] in America in 1919.

Compared to the public system, the church provided greater financial assistance or free care to poor patients, and was a leading provider of various low-profit health services such as breast cancer screenings, nutrition programs, trauma, and care of the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward Morrissey |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2012/03/01/Obama-Risks-$100-Billion-if-Catholic-Hospitals-Close.aspx#duHJcO1ezw65J8s8.99 |title=Obama Risks $100 Billion If Catholic Hospitals Close |publisher=The Fiscal Times |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic medical facilities refuse treatment which runs counter to their beliefs.  Contraception among other treatments is not provided, complications due to existing contraception may not be treated.  Users may be unaware of these restrictions, even unaware that their health provider is connected with the Roman Catholic Church till something goes wrong.  For example, a woman bleeding and in pain due to a misplaced [[Intrauterine device|Intrauterine contraceptive device]] was refused treatment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aclu-il.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-8-22_Redacted-Charge-of-Discrimination-Melanie-Jones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We think that people should be aware that they may face limitations on the kind of care they can receive when they go to the doctor based on religious restrictions.

====Asia====
[[Image:Hunger and sickness Madras.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco|Salesian sister]] caring for sick and poor in former [[Madras Presidency]], India. Catholic women have been heavily involved as care givers.]]

During the Middle Ages, Arab medicine was influential on Europe. During Europe's [[Age of Discovery]], Catholic missionaries, notably the Jesuits, introduced the modern sciences to India, China and Japan. While persecutions continue to limit the spread of Catholic institutions to some Middle Eastern Muslim nations, and places such as the People's Republic of China and North Korea, elsewhere in Asia the church is a major provider of health care services - especially in Catholic Nations like the [[Philippines]].

The famous [[Mother Teresa]] of Calcutta established the [[Missionaries of Charity]] in the slums of Calcutta in 1948 to work among "the poorest of the poor". Initially founding a school, she then gathered other sisters who "rescued new-born babies abandoned on rubbish heaps; they sought out the sick; they took in lepers, the unemployed, and the mentally ill". Teresa achieved fame in the 1960s and began to establish convents around the world. By the time of her death in 1997, the religious institute she founded had more than 450 centres in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5872071/Mother-Teresa.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Mother Teresa | date=6 September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mother Theresa encouraged a daily prayer for the Mother Theresa Children’s Home: 

{{cquote| Dearest Lord, May I see you today and every day in the person of your sick, and, whilst nursing them, ministering unto you.

Though you hide yourself behind the unattractive guise of the irritable, the exacting, the unreasonable, may I still recognize you, and say: “Jesus, my patient, how sweet it is to serve you.”

Lord, give me this seeing faith, then my work will never be motononous. I will ever find joy in humoring the fancies and gratifying the wishes of all poor sufferers.

O beloved sick, how doubly dear you are to me, when you personify Christ; and what a privilege is mine to be allowed to tend to you.

Sweetest Lord, make me appreciative of the dignity of any high vocation, and it’s many responsibilities. Never permit me to disgrace it by giving way to coldness, unkindness, or impatience.

And O God, while you are Jesus, my patient, deign also to be to me a patient Jesus, bearing with my faults, looking only to my intention, which is to love and serve you in the person of each of your sick.

Lord, increase my faith, bless my efforts and work, now and forevermore. Amen}}

====Oceania====

[[File:Edward Clifford – Damien in 1888.jpg|thumb|upright|St [[Damien of Molokai]] famously established a mission among the lepers of Molokai, Hawaii.]]

French, Portuguese, British and Irish missionaries brought Catholicism to Oceania and built hospitals and care centres across the region. The church remains not only a key provider of health care in predominantly Catholic nations like [[East Timor]] but also in predominantly Protestant and secular nations like Australia and New Zealand.

As restrictions were lifted by British authorities on the practice of Catholicism in colonial Australia, Catholic religious institutes founded many of Australia's hospitals. Irish [[Sisters of Charity of Australia|Sisters of Charity]] arrived in Sydney in 1838 and established [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney]] in 1857 as a free hospital for the poor. The Sisters went on to found hospitals, hospices, research institutes and aged care facilities in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://national.stvincents.com.au/history.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402062826/http://national.stvincents.com.au/history.php |archivedate=April 2, 2010 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At St Vincent's they trained leading surgeon [[Victor Chang]] and opened Australia's first [[AIDS]] clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exwwwsvh.stvincents.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=132&amp;Itemid=160 |title=St Vincent's Hospital, history and tradition, sesquicentenary – sth.stvincents.com.au |publisher=Exwwwsvh.stvincents.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321142552/https://exwwwsvh.stvincents.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=132&amp;Itemid=160# |archive-date=2012-03-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, with more and more lay people involved in management, the sisters began callaborating with [[Sisters of Mercy]] Hospitals in Melbourne and Sydney. Jointly the group operates four public hospitals; seven private hospitals and 10 aged care facilities.

====Africa====
Catholicism has grown rapidly in Africa over the last two centuries. As in all other continents, Catholic missionaries established health care centres across the continent - though limitations on Catholic institutions remain in place for much of Muslim North Africa. [[Caritas Internationalis]] is the Church's main international aid and development body and operates in over 200 countries and territories and co-operates closely with the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2012/april/20120411afaithbasedresponsetohiv/ UNAIDS requests Pope Benedict XVI for support in efforts to stop new HIV infections in children]; UNAIDS Feature Story; 11 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious orders dedicated to care giving==
{{expand section|date=February 2013}}

In keeping with the emphasis of [[Catholic social teaching]], many religious institutes have devoted themselves to service of the sick, homeless, disabled, orphaned, aged or mentally ill. Women's religious institutes played a particularly prominent role in the development of the Catholic Church's health care networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">A '''chief medical informatics officer''' ('''CMIO''', also sometimes referred to as a '''chief medical information officer''', or '''chief clinical information officer - CCIO''' in the United Kingdom) is a healthcare executive generally responsible for the [[health informatics platform]] required to work with clinical IT staff &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informatics-review.com/jobdesc/sample3.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408022132/http://www.informatics-review.com/jobdesc/sample3.html |date=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to support the efficient design, implementation, and use of health technology within a healthcare organization.

Typically the CMIO is a [[physician]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmio.net/index.php?option=com_articles&amp;view=article&amp;id=20446:cmio-2010-compensation-survey-the-results-are-in |title=CMIO 2010 Compensation Survey: The Results Are In! |publisher=Cmio.net |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some degree of formal [[health informatics]] training or a working equivalent thereof, who often works in conjunction with, or helps to manage other physician, nurse, pharmacy, and general [[Health informatics|informaticists]] within the organization.  According to the 2012 CMIO Survey, 60% had salaries higher than $200,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhaguide.com/chief-medical-information-officer-salary/ |title=Chief Medical Information Officer Salary &amp;#124; MHA Guide: Health Administration Degree Guide |publisher=MHA Guide |date= |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While historically there have been physicians and others filling this role, the more formal CMIO position started around 1992 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hersher.com/ChiefMedicalInformationOfficerandBeyond.pdf |title=The Chief Medical Information Officer and Beyond |author=Betsy Hersher |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help hospitals support the adoption and implementation of health technologies such as [[electronic medical records]] (EMRs), [[electronic health records]] (EHRs), [[computerized physician order entry]] (CPOE), [[electronic documentation]], [[health information exchange]]s (HIEs), and other technologies used in the clinical setting. The trend for healthcare organizations to have a CMIO has continued to grow, and accelerated as technology use in the clinical setting has been stimulated by programs such as the 2009 [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] ([[HITECH Act]]).

CMIOs generally report to either the [[chief medical officer]] (CMO), [[chief information officer]] (CIO), [[chief operations officer]] (COO), or [[chief executive officer]] (CEO). The exact roles and responsibilities vary widely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmiomagazine.com/?cat=4 |title=CMIO Role Definition |publisher=CMIO Magazine |date= |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20070730/FREE/70730007 |title=What does a chief medical information officer do? |publisher=ModernHealthcare.com |date=July 30, 2007 |author=Joseph Conn |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/faculty/ssilverstein/cases/?loc=cases&amp;sloc=tenrules |title=Common Examples of Healthcare IT Failure |publisher=Ischool.drexel.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; from organization to organization, often depending on the reporting structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag_app/jsp/articledisplay.jsp?dcrpath=HHNMAG/Article/data/02FEB2008/0802HHN_FEA_Gatefold&amp;domain=HHNMAG |title=The Changing Role of the CMIO |publisher=Hhnmag.com |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226212257/http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag_app/jsp/articledisplay.jsp?dcrpath=HHNMAG%2FArticle%2Fdata%2F02FEB2008%2F0802HHN_FEA_Gatefold&amp;domain=HHNMAG |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they typically include at least one of the following:

In 1998, the [[Swiss government]] began a comprehensive '''Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine''' (PEK : Programm Evaluation Komplementärmedizin = Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine) to study the role and effectiveness of [[complementary medicine]], which was playing an ever-increasing role in the Swiss medical system.

According to the PEK Report,&lt;ref Name=PEKreport/&gt; results of the evaluation were inconclusive, and in June 2005, the five complementary therapies under evaluation - anthroposophical medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy, phytotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine (more precisely, traditional Chinese herbal therapy) - were removed from the list of services covered by the compulsory health insurance scheme (KLV).

==Summary of the PEK Report==

The complete text of the 24 April 2005 version of the "Programm Evaluation Komplementärmedizin" Report, (also referred to as PEK, "Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine" and "Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme"), is available from the Swiss Parliament website&lt;ref name=PEKreport&gt;[http://biblio.parlament.ch/e-docs/139404.pdf Complete text of the official PEK report.] (In German, with summaries in German, French, Italian and English.) Accessed June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and also from the Swiss Federal Office of Health (BAG)&lt;ref name=BAG/&gt; PEK download webpage.&lt;ref name=BAG-PEK&gt;Various PEK related documents, mostly in German, but some also in French, Italian and English, (including the report on the PEK study) can be downloaded from the [https://archive.is/20071220232238/http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/krankenversicherung/00305/02363/index.html Swiss Federal Office of Health (BAG) PEK download page.] Accessed August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

Following the decision taken by the Swiss [[Federal Department of Home Affairs]] (DHA) on 9 July 1998, five complementary therapies - [[anthroposophical medicine]], [[homeopathy]], [[neural therapy]], [[phytotherapy]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (more precisely, traditional Chinese herbal therapy) - were included on 1 July 1999 for a limited period (until 30 June 2005) in the list of services covered by the compulsory health insurance scheme (KLV). These  five services were only eligible for reimbursement if they were provided by physicians who had the relevant proficiency certificates, issued by the Swiss Medical Association (FMH).

The decision on whether these complementary methods would be retained within the basic health insurance scheme was to be based on their efficacy, appropriateness and cost-effectiveness being demonstrated. To this end, the Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme (PEK) was carried out from 1998 to 2005.

===Design of the PEK===

A basic procedure was defined, comprising two parts.

In '''Part 1''' (evaluation of the provision of complementary medicine for patients in Switzerland), empirical studies were to be carried out, permitting conclusions as to: 
:a) how prevalent the five therapies are in Switzerland,
:b) which physicians offer these therapies,
:c) which patients have recourse to them,
:d) what results are achieved with these treatments, and
:e) what impact these therapies have on costs.
For points b), c), and e), comparisons were made with conventional medicine. On account of [[methodological]] and time-related problems, however, point d) could not be evaluated.

In '''Part 2''' ([[literature analysis]]), the literature available internationally on efficacy, appropriateness (here primarily defined in terms of safety and utilization) and cost-effectiveness was to be systematically compiled and reviewed.

===Outcomes===

Part 1 was carried out by a team from the Panmedion Foundation, a pro-[[Complementary and alternative medicine|CAM]] think tank. The results were not published in the peer-reviewed literature but an expanded version was separately published an translation as "Homeopathy in Healthcare: Effectiveness, Appropriateness, Safety, Costs". This paper, promoted by homeopathy supporters&lt;ref name="Novella"&gt;[http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-swiss-report-on-homeopathy/ The Swiss Report on Homeopathy], [[Steven Novella]], Science Based Medicine, 2012-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; as a "Swiss government report"&lt;ref name="ullman"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/homeopathic-medicine-_b_1258607.html The Swiss Government's Remarkable Report on Homeopathic Medicine], Dana Ullman, [[Huffington Post]] 2012-02-15&lt;/ref&gt; was strongly criticised&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;A critique of the Swiss report Homeopathy in Healthcare, Ernst, E, Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies (FACT) Volume 17, Issue 3, pages 160–162, September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and characterised as "a case study of research misconduct" due to undeclared conflicts of interest, reversal of the normal hierarchy of evidence and other concerns,&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw, DM, "The Swiss Report: A case study of research misconduct", Swiss Med Wkly. 2012;142:w13594&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Dr. Felix Gurtner of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health to disown its purported status.&lt;ref name="Gurtner"&gt;The report “Homeopathy in healthcare: effectiveness, appropriateness, safety, costs” is not a “Swiss report”, Felix Gurtner, Swiss Med Wkly. 2012;142:w13723&lt;/ref&gt;

Part 2 was published in [[The Lancet]] as ''Are the clinical effects of homoeopathy placebo effects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of homoeopathy and allopathy.''&lt;ref name="Shang"&gt;Are the clinical effects of homoeopathy placebo effects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of homoeopathy and allopathy. Shang A, Huwiler-Müntener K, Nartey L, Jüni P, Dörig S, Sterne JA, Pewsner D, Egger M. Lancet. 2005 Aug 27-Sep 2;366(9487):726-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms-of-reference for the PEK study stated that the results of the study would determine which complementary medicines, if any, would continue to be supported by the national insurance program in Switzerland. However, before the study was completed and the final draft report reviewed by the international Review Board, the government announced that it would withdraw support for all complementary approaches to medicine.&lt;ref name=Unipub&gt;[http://www.unipublic.unizh.ch/magazin/gesundheit/2005/1996.html Unipublic Zurich University.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527234509/http://www.unipublic.unizh.ch/magazin/gesundheit/2005/1996.html |date=27 May 2006 }} Accessed August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of CAM (including the scientific director of the program) were dissatisfied with the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fisher, ''Homeopathy and the Lancet'' from "Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine", 2006 3(1):145-147 [http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/1/145 Online at OxfordJournals.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820063331/http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/1/145 |date=20 August 2008 }} Accessed August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Concensus&gt;Walach H, Linde K, Eichenberger R, Stalder H, Kristensen FB, Kleijnen J.

Both reports were given reduced weight

Following a referendum in which the authors of the Part 1 report acted as proponents, reimbursement was reinstated for a further trial period of 5 years from 2012.&lt;ref name="swissinfo"&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38110">'''Comprehensive sex education (CSE)''' is a [[sex education]] instruction method based on-curriculum that aims to give students the knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009.

Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fonner et al. 2014.

Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616–25. Epub 2010, May 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. ''Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa''. Geneva, UNAIDS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a.

These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015.

The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a.

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014.

CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and
*provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Diabetes mellitus type&amp;nbsp;2''' (also known as '''type 2 diabetes''') is a long-term [[metabolic disorder]] that is characterized by [[hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]], [[insulin resistance]], and relative lack of [[insulin]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014Cause&gt;{{cite web|title=Causes of Diabetes|url=http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/causes-diabetes/Pages/index.aspx|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|accessdate=10 February 2016|date=June 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-date=2 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202083725/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/causes-diabetes/Pages/index.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common symptoms include [[polydipsia|increased thirst]], [[polyuria|frequent urination]], and unexplained [[weight loss]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014Diag/&gt; Symptoms may also include [[polyphagia|increased hunger]], feeling tired, and sores that do not heal.&lt;ref name=NIH2014Diag/&gt; Often symptoms come on slowly.&lt;ref name=NIH2014Cause/&gt; Long-term complications from high blood sugar include [[heart disease]], [[stroke]]s, [[diabetic retinopathy]] which can result in [[blindness]], [[kidney failure]], and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to [[amputation]]s.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; The sudden onset of [[hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state]] may occur; however, [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|ketoacidosis]] is uncommon.&lt;ref name=Pas2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasquel|first1=FJ|last2=Umpierrez|first2=GE|title=Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: a historic review of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.|journal=Diabetes Care|date=November 2014|volume=37|issue=11|pages=3124–31|pmid=25342831|doi=10.2337/dc14-0984|pmc=4207202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fas2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fasanmade|first1=OA|last2=Odeniyi|first2=IA|last3=Ogbera|first3=AO|title=Diabetic ketoacidosis: diagnosis and management|journal=African Journal of Medicine and Medical Sciences|date=June 2008|volume=37|issue=2|pages=99–105|pmid=18939392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of [[obesity]] and lack of exercise.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Some people are more [[Heredity|genetically]] at risk than others.&lt;ref name=NIH2014Cause/&gt; Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], with the other 10% due primarily to [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] and [[gestational diabetes]].&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; In diabetes mellitus type&amp;nbsp;1 there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose, due to an [[autoimmune]] induced loss of insulin-producing [[beta cells]] in the [[pancreas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=MacKay|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Rose|editor2-first=Noel|title=The Autoimmune Diseases| publisher=Academic Press| isbn=978-0-123-84929-8| year=2014| page=575 |oclc=965646175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green2011&gt;{{cite book|editor2-last=Shoback |editor1-first=David G. |editor1-last=Gardner |editor2-first=Dolores|title=Greenspan's basic &amp; clinical endocrinology|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=0-07-162243-8|chapter=Chapter 17: Pancreatic hormones &amp; diabetes mellitus |edition=9th |oclc=613429053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as [[fasting plasma glucose]], [[oral glucose tolerance test]], or [[glycated hemoglobin]] (A1C).&lt;ref name=NIH2014Diag&gt;{{cite web|title=Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes|url=http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/diagnosis-diabetes-prediabetes/Pages/index.aspx|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|accessdate=10 February 2016|date=June 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-date=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306174631/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/diagnosis-diabetes-prediabetes/Pages/index.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Main symptoms of diabetes.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes.]]

===Complications===
{{Main|Complications of diabetes mellitus}}
Type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.&lt;ref name=Will2011/&gt; This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including: two to four times the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], including [[ischemic heart disease]] and [[stroke]]; a 20-fold increase in lower limb [[amputations]], and increased rates of [[hospitalization]]s.&lt;ref name=Will2011/&gt; In the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic [[blindness]] and [[Chronic kidney disease|kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=AFP09/&gt; It has also been associated with an increased risk of [[cognitive dysfunction]] and [[dementia]] through disease processes such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[vascular dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pasquier|first=F|title=Diabetes and cognitive impairment: how to evaluate the cognitive status?|journal=Diabetes &amp; Metabolism|date=October 2010|volume=36 Suppl 3|pages=S100–05|doi=10.1016/S1262-3636(10)70475-4|pmid=21211730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other complications include [[acanthosis nigricans]], [[sexual dysfunction]], and frequent infections.&lt;ref name=Vij2010/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.jpg|thumb|Insulin resistance (right side) contributes to high glucose levels in the blood.]]
Type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from [[beta cells]] in the setting of [[insulin resistance]].&lt;ref name=Green2011/&gt; Insulin resistance, which is the inability of [[cell (biology)|cells]] to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, [[liver]], and fat tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diabetes mellitus a guide to patient care.|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-58255-732-8|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiAclxvKblkC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the liver, insulin normally suppresses [[glucose]] release. However, in the setting of insulin resistance, the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood.&lt;ref name=Will2011/&gt; The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals, with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion.&lt;ref name=Green2011/&gt;

Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes and insulin resistance include: increased breakdown of [[lipids]] within [[fat cell]]s, resistance to and lack of [[incretin]], high [[glucagon]] levels in the blood, increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys, and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name=Will2011/&gt; However, not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes, since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required.&lt;ref name=Green2011/&gt;

==Background==

===Body Dissatisfaction===

Eating disorders, once thought prevalent only in [[Western culture]]s such as that of the United States, are now seen in Chinese women. This is surprising as, in the past, it was highly unlikely. Their body shapes, including their round faces with mild plumpness, showed their beauty and healthy living. Thus, once thought unusual in China, body dissatisfaction and eating disorders are almost as common now as they are in Western countries.&lt;ref name="Humphry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung2007" /&gt;

==Causes==

===Cultural===

In China, many traditional people hold to a collectivistic cultural tradition (or [[Confucianism]]). They learn to conform as an interdependent whole rather than as unique independent beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Sandy Chih-Ann|title=Eating disorder symptomatology, self-construal, and dimensions of perfectionism in Chinese American women|year=2006|publisher=Alliant International University|location=San Francisco Bay|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dependency starts in the family, where a parent to child hierarchy is enforced and children are taught to be submissive and obedient. This can cause feelings of rebellion in the child which is why some of them may turn to [[eating disorder]]s. The child wants to have some control, but they also do not want to disrespect their parents by pursuing [[autonomy]], and so restricting food or [[binge eating|binging]] and [[vomiting|purging]] is, in a way, their way of making decisions.&lt;ref name="Schmidt1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Ulrike|author2=U London|title=Bulimia nervosa in the Chinese|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=Dec 1993|volume=14|pages=505–509|doi=10.1002/1098-108X(199312)14:4&lt;505::AID-EAT2260140415&gt;3.0.CO;2-N|pmid=8293034|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Several studies confirmed that cultural factors resulting in rebelliousness caused eating disorder symptoms. Ulrike Schmidt, a professor in eating disorders, studied three patients with Chinese heritage who participated in binging and purging behaviours. Her first patient, patient A, grew up in England. As a teenager, patient A{{‘}}s parents expected her to help them with their business since they did not speak fluent English. On top of this she gave them most of her earnings from her job, and she was expected to participate in family life. Dr. Schmidt found that her bulimia symptoms came about because she was seeking independence, and yet she wanted to remain obedient to her parents. This conclusion supports the idea that loyalty versus independence played a conflicting role that lead to eating disorder symptoms.&lt;ref name="Schmidt1993" /&gt; 
 
Moreover, Dr. Schmidt also concluded that patient A{{‘}}s mother nurtured her when she started losing weight. As a result, patient A exploited this in order to make up the deprivations from her childhood.&lt;ref name="Schmidt1993" /&gt; This correlation between conflicting feelings of growing up or remaining young is the other studied cause of why eating disorders arise in young Chinese women. Joyce  L. C. did a study in [[Shenzhen]] and she reported that some Chinese woman struggle with growing up and so they turn to eating disorders as a control. One such girl relates her feelings when she said, &lt;blockquote&gt; “I like to be a little girl. In being an adult, you need to care about people{{‘}}s feelings and interact with others. They tend to disappoint me. I met two senior students in college and they seemed to treat me well at first. However, suddenly they had become unfriendly and hostile to me. I felt being betrayed. I hid myself in my dormitory, the only place where I felt safe and secure. I indulged in binge eating and vomiting. I don{{‘}}t wish to be hurt by them again.”&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; She turns to bulimia as a way of hiding from reality and indulging herself. Because of [[societal norm]]s in China, it is seen that some women are turning to eating disorders as a way out from their stress and worry.

===Westernization===

Eating disorders in China were primarily thought to have come about because of the [[Westernization]] of their cities through the [[Mass media|media]]. Western media idolizes thin, beautiful woman. This unrealistic standard entices women to lose weight through dieting, exercising, and if necessary surgery, so as to meet it.&lt;ref name="Jung2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=Jaehee|title=Multidimensional Assessment of Body Dissatisfaction and Disordered Eating in Korean and US College Women: A Comparative Study|journal=Sex Roles|date=Jul 2006|volume=55|issue=1/2|pages=39–50|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9058-3|last2=Forbes|first2=Gordon B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the body dissatisfaction that this standard causes it can lead to [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Ma"/&gt;

Many researchers studied westernization as a cause of eating disorders in Chinese women and it is one of the main theories believed today. Lee and Lee, in a study of different levels of [[socioeconomic development]] in three Chinese communities, compared the aptitude of disordered eating among females in high school. He found that females in the higher income cities, even though they were slimmer than the other females in the less modernized cities, desired a lower [[body mass index]] (BMI), had greater levels of body dissatisfaction, and overall had more symptoms that relate to [[risk factor]]s for eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sing|author2=Antoinette M. Lee|title=Disordered Eating in Three Communities of China: A Comparative Study of Female High School Students in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Rural Hunan|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=Apr 2000|volume=27|issue=3|pages=317–327|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(200004)27:3&lt;317::AID-EAT9&gt;3.0.CO;2-2|pmid=10694718}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from their results, westernization is a probable cause of increased eating disorders. However, some studies suggest other factors account for higher eating disorders in Chinese woman, so even though western media may be one of the causes, it may not be the primary one.

'Little fatty' was once a term of endearment for children in China, but today dieting is popular and thinness is the ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordo|first=Susan|title=Unbearable weight: feminism, Western culture, and the body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rezqDU30R5wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=feminism+dieting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Njh8UZD-AsPHObrmgLAN&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=feminism%20dieting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Change===

One of the other factors scientist have come up with that may contribute to higher eating disorders in Chinese woman, are [[sociocultural]] factors that include [[gender role]]s, economic opportunities, [[religious values]], and the cultural objectification of women. When disruptive social change comes about, women are more likely to have disordered eating. [[Naomi Wolf]] observed this when she said, “The more legal and material hindrances women have broken through, the more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverstein|first=Brett|title=The Cost of Competence: Why Inequality Causes Depression, Eating Disorders and Illness in Women|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women seek equality, the extreme of ideal body shape arise.&lt;ref name="Humphry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung2007" /&gt;

This is seen in many cases throughout history in Western and non—Western cultures. For example, in America, during the 1920s and the 1970s when the role of women were changed the most, “models in US fashion magazines were the most slender and least curvaceous.”&lt;ref name="Humphry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung2007" /&gt; In contrast to the Western culture, a study showed that Korean woman, since the economic, social, and political changes in the 1980s to 2000, are more dissatisfied with their bodies (Tsai, 2000). In another study, Jaehee Jung and Gordon B. Forbes, found that among University female students from Korea and the United States, Koreans had greater eating disorder risk factors than the Americans. They concluded this was because of the more recent social changes for woman in Korea.&lt;ref name="Jung2006" /&gt; Thus, because both groups of women were equally exposed to Western media, this theory is a contender with the westernization theory as a cause of higher eating disorders.

==Treatment==

Many people have difficulty seeking treatment in China because receiving help from a [[therapist]] is personally looked down on as a mark against one{{‘}}s dignity because if a person needs help, then they cannot help themselves and that is shameful. Thus, reaching out to those who have [[eating disorder]]s or eating disorder symptoms may be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conlin|first=Michelle|author2=Dexter Roberts|title=Go-Go-Going to Pieces in China|journal=BusinessWeek|date=Apr 23, 2007|volume=4031|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, most patients with eating disorders will initially find it difficult to find the motivation to overcome their eating disorder because they are not sure whether they want to change, and yet they know that they need to because it will help them in their lifestyles. When a therapist starts treating a new patient they need to make sure to connect with the patient and create a professional, but helpful client to therapist bond because that connection will help the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ma|first=Joyce L.C.|title=Patients' Perspective on Family Therapy for Anorexia Nervosa: A Qualitative Inquiry in a Chinese Context|journal=Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy|date=Mar 2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=10–16|doi=10.1375/anft.29.1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family Therapy===

A common method for helping eating disordered persons is to involve the family. Researchers found that in Western places, like England, [[family therapy]] was useful and effective. However, in China, because of the difference in culture, some underage patients refuse help and they will not trust the therapist because they see it as another way of their parents controlling them. In a case study done by Joyce L. C. Ma, she was treating a 17-year-old girl who would not accept her help. The girl said, &lt;blockquote&gt;“It{{‘}}s my father{{‘}}s session, not my session. My father has a problem and I don{{‘}}t have any. He arranged everything for me. He did too much. I am sick of his over–interference in my life. I knew the sessions were his arrangement too. I dislike being at his disposal any more. So I refuse to meet you.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; In order for the patient to receive help, the therapist needs to create a bond with them first, so that they can voice their needs and the cause of their disorder.&lt;ref name="Ma2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ma|first=Joyce L.C.|title=Journey Of Acculturation: Developing A Therapeutic Alliance With Chinese Adolescents Suffering From Eating Disorders In Shenzhen, China|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|date=Nov 2007|volume=29|issue=4|pages=389–402|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6427.2007.00407.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Family therapy in China has also proven beneficial because families can talk about issues in the family. This in turn strengthens the patient and creates a foundation for them to hold onto. Accomplishing this kind of therapeutic bond though is the difficult part for some Chinese people because of the collectivistic culture in which they live in where the children are afraid to speak up against their parents because they do not want to bring shame upon them. Once the therapist can overcome this though, overcoming their eating disorder will be much easier than if it were individual therapy.&lt;ref name="Ma2007" /&gt;

[[File:Production of cheese 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Industrial [[cheese]] production]]'''Food processing''' is the transformation of agricultural products into [[food]], or of one form of food into other forms.  Food processing includes many forms of processing foods, from grinding [[grain]] to make raw [[flour]] to [[home cooking]] to complex industrial methods used to make [[Convenience food|convenience foods]].

Primary food processing is necessary to make most foods edible, and secondary food processing turns the ingredients into familiar foods, such as bread.

Tertiary food processing has been criticized for promoting [[overnutrition]] and obesity, containing too much sugar and salt, too little fiber, and otherwise being unhealthful.

==Classification==

=== Primary food processing ===
[[File:03 Ban Bang Krathum Bananas.jpg|thumb|These whole, dried [[banana]]s in [[Thailand]] are an example of primary food processing.]]'''Primary food processing''' turns agricultural products, such as raw [[Wheat|wheat kernels]] or livestock, into something that can eventually be eaten.  This category includes ingredients that are produced by ancient processes such as [[Food drying|drying]], [[threshing]], [[winnowing]], and [[Grain mill|milling]] grain, [[Nutshell|shelling nuts]], and [[butchering]] animals for meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wIxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA430|title=Food Processing for Increased Quality and Consumption|last=Grumezescu|first=Alexandru Mihai|last2=Holban|first2=Alina Maria|date=2018-04-08|publisher=Academic Press|year=|isbn=9780128114995|location=|pages=430|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|title=Measurement, Modeling and Automation in Advanced Food Processing|last=Hitzmann|first=Bernd|date=2017-08-11|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319601113|location=|pages=30–32|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also includes deboning and cutting meat, freezing and smoking fish and meat, extracting and filtering oils, [[canning]] food, preserving food through [[food irradiation]], and [[Candling|candling eggs]], as well as [[Homogenized milk|homogenizing]] and [[Pasteurized milk|pasteurizing milk]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB9jDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|title=Sustainable Food and Beverage Industries: Assessments and Methodologies|last=Ionescu|first=Gabriela|date=2016-05-25|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781771884112|location=|pages=21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7mxV6X9lAYC&amp;pg=PA278|title=Integrated Renewable Resource Management for U.S. Insular Areas: Summary|last=US Congress|first=Office of Technology Assessment|date=June 1987|publisher=US Government Printing Office|year=|isbn=9781428922792|location=Washington, DC|pages=278–281|language=en|chapter=Chapter 8, Technologies Supporting Agricultural, Aquacultural, and Fisheries Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Contamination and [[Food spoilage|spoilage]] problems in primary food processing can lead to significant [[public health]] threats, as the resulting foods are used so widely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, many forms of processing contribute to improved food safety and longer [[shelf life]] before the food spoils.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Commercial food processing uses control systems such as [[hazard analysis and critical control points]] (HACCP) and [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) to reduce the risk of harm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Secondary food processing ===
[[File:Baking Bread Communal Oven, 2011.jpg|alt=A man using a bread peel to slide a round disk of raw flatbread dough into a brick oven|thumb|Baking bread is an example of secondary food processing.]]

'''Secondary food processing''' is the everyday process of creating food from ingredients that are ready to use.  [[Bread making|Baking bread]], regardless of whether it is made at home, in a small bakery, or in a large factory, is an example of secondary food processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Fermented fish|Fermenting fish]] and making [[wine]], [[beer]], and other alcoholic products are traditional forms of secondary food processing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Sausage|Sausages]] are a common form of secondary processed meat, formed by [[comminution]] (grinding) of meat that has already undergone primary processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZRCMRXbbwoC&amp;pg=PA599|title=Handbook of Meat and Meat Processing, Second Edition|last=Hui|first=Y. H.|date=2012-01-11|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781439836835|location=|pages=599|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tertiary food processing ===
'''Tertiary food processing''' is the commercial production of what is commonly called [[processed food]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These are ready-to-eat or heat-and-serve foods, such as [[TV dinner|TV dinners]] and re-heated [[Airline meal|airline meals]].  

==History==
Food processing dates back to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated fermenting, sun drying, preserving with [[salt]], and various types of [[cooking]] (such as roasting, smoking, steaming, and oven baking), Such basic food processing involved chemical enzymatic changes to the basic structure of food in its natural form, as well served to build a barrier against surface microbial activity that caused rapid decay. Salt-preservation was especially common for foods that constituted warrior and sailors' diets until the introduction of [[Canning|canning methods]]. Evidence for the existence of these methods can be found in the writings of the ancient [[Aegean civilization|Greek]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldean]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations as well as archaeological evidence from Europe, North and South America and Asia. These tried and tested processing techniques remained essentially the same until the advent of the [[industrial revolution]]. Examples of ready-meals also date back to before the preindustrial revolution, and include dishes such as [[Cornish pasty]] and [[Haggis]]. Both during ancient times and today in modern society these are considered processed foods.[[File:Wakefield, Nebraska Michael Foods plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Michael Foods [[egg (food)|egg]]-processing plant in Wakefield, Nebraska|alt=|left]]

Modern food processing technology developed in the 19th and 20th centuries was developed in a large part to serve military needs. In 1809 [[Nicolas Appert]] invented a hermetic bottling technique that would preserve food for French troops which ultimately contributed to the development of tinning, and subsequently canning by Peter Durand in 1810. Although initially expensive and somewhat hazardous due to the lead used in cans, canned goods would later become a staple around the world. [[Pasteurization]], discovered by [[Louis Pasteur]] in 1864, improved the quality and safety of preserved foods and introduced the wine, beer, and milk preservation.

[[File:Erbswurst-1.jpg|thumb|A form of pre-made [[Pea soup|split-pea soup]] that has become traditional]]
In the 20th century, [[World War II]], the [[space race]] and the rising consumer society in developed countries contributed to the growth of food processing with such advances as [[spray drying]], [[Climbing and Falling Film Plate Evaporator|evaporation]], juice concentrates, [[freeze drying]] and the introduction of artificial sweeteners, colouring agents, and such preservatives as [[sodium benzoate]]. In the late 20th century, products such as dried instant soups, reconstituted fruits and juices, and self cooking meals such as [[MRE]] food ration were developed. By the 20th century, automatic appliances like [[microwave oven]], [[blender]], and [[rotimatic]] paved way for [[convenience cooking]].

In western Europe and North America, the second half of the 20th century witnessed a rise in the pursuit of convenience. Food processing companies marketed their products especially towards middle-class working wives and mothers. Frozen foods (often credited to [[Clarence Birdseye]]) found their success in sales of juice concentrates and  "[[TV dinner]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Levenstein, H: "Paradox of Plenty", pages 106-107. University of California Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Processors utilised the perceived value of time to appeal to the postwar population, and this same appeal contributes to the success of [[convenience food]]s today.

==Benefits and drawbacks==

===Benefits===
[[File:Processed seafood.jpg|thumb|Processed [[seafood]] - [[fish]], [[squid]], [[prawn]] balls and simulated crab sticks ([[surimi]])]]

Benefits of food processing include toxin removal, preservation, easing marketing and distribution tasks, and increasing food consistency. In addition, it increases yearly availability of many foods, enables transportation of delicate perishable foods across long distances and makes many kinds of foods safe to eat by de-activating spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms. Modern [[supermarket]]s would not exist without modern food processing techniques, and long voyages would not be possible.

Processed foods are usually less susceptible to early spoilage than fresh foods and are better suited for long-distance transportation from the source to the [[consumer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When they were first introduced, some processed foods helped to alleviate food shortages and improved the overall nutrition of populations as it made many new foods available to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |quote=Where modern food became available, people grew taller and stronger and lived longer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processing can also reduce the incidence of [[foodborne disease]]. Fresh materials, such as fresh [[produce]] and raw meats, are more likely to harbour pathogenic micro-organisms (e.g. Salmonella) capable of causing serious illnesses.

The extremely varied modern diet is only truly possible on a wide scale because of food processing. Transportation of more exotic foods, as well as the elimination of much hard labour gives the modern eater easy access to a wide variety of food unimaginable to their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |quote=If we fail to understand how scant and monotonous most traditional diets were, we can misunderstand the “ethnic foods” we encounter in cookbooks, at restaurants, or on our travels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of processing can often improve the taste of food significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |quote=For our ancestors, natural was something quite nasty. Natural often tasted bad. Fresh meat was rank and tough, fresh fruits inedibly sour, fresh vegetables bitter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Potted Meat Food Product.jpg|thumb|left|Libby's brand "Potted Meat Food Product"]]
Mass production of food is much cheaper overall than individual production of meals from raw ingredients. Therefore, a large [[profit (economics)|profit]] potential exists for the manufacturers and suppliers of processed food products. Individuals may see a benefit in [[convenience food|convenience]], but rarely see any direct financial cost benefit in using processed food as compared to home preparation.

Processed food freed people from the large amount of time involved in preparing and cooking "natural" unprocessed foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudan |first=Rachel |url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Fast-Food-Culinary-Ethos.aspx?page=4 |title=In Praise of Fast Food |publisher=UTNE Reader |date=September–October 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in free time allows people much more choice in life style than previously allowed. In many families the adults are working away from home and therefore there is little time for the preparation of food based on fresh ingredients. The [[food industry]] offers products that fulfill many different needs: e.g. fully prepared [[ready meal]]s that can be heated up in the [[microwave oven]] within a few minutes.

Modern food processing also improves the quality of life for people with allergies, [[diabetes|diabetics]], and other people who cannot consume some common food elements. Food processing can also add extra nutrients such as [[vitamin]]s.

===Drawbacks===
[[File:Meat packages in a Roman supermarket.jpg|thumb|[[Meat]] packages in a Roman [[supermarket]]]]

Processing of food can decrease its nutritional density. The amount of nutrients lost depends on the food and processing method. For example, heat destroys [[Vitamin C#Natural and artificial dietary sources|vitamin C]]. Therefore, canned fruits possess less vitamin C than their fresh alternatives. The [[USDA]] conducted a study of nutrient retention in 2004, creating a table of foods, levels of preparation, and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf|title = USDA Table of Nutrient Retention Factors, Release 6|date = Dec 2007|accessdate = |website = USDA|publisher = USDA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New research highlighting the importance to human health of a rich microbial environment in the intestine indicates that abundant food processing (not fermentation of foods) endangers that environment.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pollan, 'Some of my Best Friends are Germs', New York Times Magazine, 15 May 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/say-hello-to-the-100-trillion-bacteria-that-make-up-your-microbiome.html?hp&lt;/ref&gt;

Using some [[food additive]]s represents another safety concern. The health risks of any given additive vary greatly from person to person; for example using sugar as an additive endangers diabetics. In the [[European Union]], only [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) approved food additives (e.g., sweeteners, preservatives, stabilizers) are permitted at specified levels for use in food products. Approved additives receive an E number (E for Europe), simplifying communication about food additives included in the ingredients' list for all the different languages spoken in the EU.  As effects of chemical additives are learned, changes to laws and regulatory practices are made to make such processed foods more safe.

Food processing is typically a mechanical process that utilizes extrusion, large mixing, grinding, chopping and emulsifying equipment in the production process. These processes introduce a number of contamination risks. Such contaminates are left over material from a previous operation, animal or human bodily fluids, microorganisms, nonmetallic  and metallic fragments. Further processing of these  contaminates will result in downstream equipment failure and the risk of ingestion by the consumer. Example: A mixing bowl or grinder is used over time, metal parts in contact with food will tend to fail and fracture. This type of failure will introduce into the product stream small to large metal contaminants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Further processing of these metal fragments will result in downstream equipment failure and the risk of ingestion by the consumer. Food manufacturers utilize [[industrial metal detectors]] to detect and reject automatically any metal fragment. Large food processors will utilize many metal detectors within the processing stream to reduce both damage to processing machinery as well as risk to consumer health.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Food processing does have some benefits, such as making food last longer and making products more convenient. However, there are drawbacks to relying on a lot of heavily processed foods. Whole foods and those that are only minimally processed, like frozen vegetables without any sauce, tend to be more healthy. An unhealthy diet high in fat, added sugar and salt, such as one containing a lot of highly-processed foods, can increase the risk for cancer, [[type 2 diabetes]] and heart disease, according to the World Health Organization.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Added sodium ==
One of the main sources for sodium in the diet is processed foods. Sodium is added to prevent spoilage, add flavor and improve the texture of these foods. Americans consume an average of 3,436 milligrams of sodium per day, which is way more than the recommended limit of 2,300 milligrams per day for healthy people, and more than twice the limit of 1,500 milligrams per day for those at increased risk for heart disease.

== Added sugars ==
While you don't need to limit the sugars found naturally in whole, unprocessed foods like fresh fruit, eating too much [[added sugar]] found in many processed foods can increase your risk for heart disease, obesity, cavities and Type 2 diabetes. The [[American Heart Association]] recommends women limit added sugars to no more than 100 calories, or 25 grams, and men limit added sugars to no more than 155 calories, or about 38.75 grams, per day. Currently, Americans consume an average of 355 calories from added sugars each day.

== Nutrient losses ==
Processing foods often involves nutrient losses, which can make it harder to meet your needs if these nutrients aren't added back through fortification or enrichment. For example, using high heat during processing can cause vitamin C losses. Another example is refined grains, which have less fiber, vitamins and minerals than whole grains. Eating refined grains, such as those found in many processed foods, instead of whole grains may increase your risk for high [[cholesterol]], diabetes and obesity, according to a study published in "[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]" in December 2007.

== Trans fats ==
Foods that have undergone processing, including some commercial baked goods, desserts, margarine, frozen pizza, microwave popcorn and coffee creamers, sometimes contain [[trans fats]]. This is the most unhealthy type of fat, and may increase your risk for high cholesterol, heart disease and stroke. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends keeping your trans fat intake as low as possible.

== Other potential disadvantages ==
Processed foods may actually take less energy to digest than whole foods, according to a study published in "[[Food &amp; Nutrition Research]]" in 2010, meaning you retain more of the calories they contain. Processed foods also tend to be more allergenic than whole foods, according to a June 2004 "Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology" article. Although the preservatives and other food additives used in many processed foods are generally recognized as safe, a few may cause problems for some individuals, including sulfites, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors and flavors, sodium nitrate, BHA and BHT, olestra, caffeine and monosodium glutamate.

==Performance parameters for food processing==
[[File:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|thumb|Factory automation - robotics palettizing [[bread]]]]
When designing processes for the food industry the following performance parameters may be taken into account:
* [[Hygiene]], e.g. measured by number of micro-organisms per mL of finished product
* [[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] measured e.g. by “ton of steam per ton of sugar produced”
* [[Waste minimisation|Minimization of waste]], measured e.g. by “percentage of peeling loss during the peeling of potatoes”
* [[Labour economics|Labour]] used, measured e.g. by “number of working hours per ton of finished product”
* Minimization of cleaning stops measured e.g. by “number of hours between cleaning stops”

==Trends in modern food processing==
{{Section OR|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Women working in a cannery.jpg|thumb|Women working in a cannery]]
===Hygiene===
The rigorous application of industry and government endorsed standards to minimise possible risk and hazards. The international standard adopted is [[HACCP]].

===Efficiency===
* Rising energy costs lead to increasing usage of energy-saving technologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stacenergy.org/projects/03-stac-01/07-western.htm STAC - Project Information Center - 03-STAC-01 - Western U. S.

* Factory automation systems (often [[Distributed control system]]s) reduce personnel costs and may lead to more stable production results.

'''Grogue''', also known as '''grogu''' or '''grogo'''&lt;ref name="childrenstricyc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governo.cv/images/stories/brochura_igae__n__4.pdf |title=Aguardente de Cana-de-açúcar GROGU |publisher=www.governo.cv |date=2008 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (derived from English ''[[grog]]''), is a [[Cape Verde]]an alcoholic beverage, an [[aguardente]] made from sugarcane. Its production is fundamentally artisanal, and nearly all the sugarcane is used in the production of grogue. The cane is processed in a press known as a ''trapiche''.

Grogue is the basis for a Cape Verdean cocktail known as ''ponche'', which also includes lime and molasses, comparable to the ''ponche'' of the island of [[Madeira]].

Grogue and sugarcane production are primarily found in [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] (notably [[Ribeira do Paul]] and [[Ribeira da Cruz]]) and [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]].

Grogue is also used as a base for medicinal preparations, with the addition of herbs such as [[common rue]], [[rosemary]], or [[anise]]. There is also a grogue preparation made with [[percebe]]s ([[goose neck barnacles]]).

Grogue is made by an old traditional way and because of this there are a lot of different qualities on the market. The government of Cabo Verde is now busy with a European company to introduce grogue on the European markets. This will be a fully controlled grogue of the best quality by the name 'Grogue Official'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grogueofficial.com/|title=Grogue Official|publisher= Grogue Official|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some tourist locations, [[caipirinha]]s are prepared with grogue.

The '''Haffkine Institute''' for Training, Research and Testing is located in [[Parel]] in [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[India]]. It was established on 10 January 1899 by Dr. [[Waldemar Haffkine|Waldemar Mordecai Haffkine]], as a bacteriology research centre called the "Plague Research Laboratory".&lt;ref name= "HIH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/institute.htm |title=History|publisher= Haffkine Institute|access-date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now offers various basic and applied bio-medical science services. The Institute opened a museum on its premises in March 2014 to showcase Haffkine's research and developments in microbiology and chart the history of the institute.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Museum-of-Maladies-and-their-miracles/articleshow/31496696.cms | title=Museum of Maladies and their miracles| publisher=[[Mumbai Mirror]] | date= 6 March 2014| access-date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute received ISO 9001:2008 certification in 2012.&lt;ref name= "HID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/director.htm |title= From Directors Desk|publisher= Haffkine Institute|access-date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute now serves as a teaching institution in the field of biomedical sciences and is affiliated to the [[University of Mumbai]] for M.Sc (Microbiology, Applied Biology and Organic Chemistry), Ph.D. (Microbiology) and M.D (P.S.M.) degree programs. In addition, the Institute undertakes specialized testing assignments and projects for pharmaceutical and other health-related products. The Institute conducts research in the improvement of the [[foot-and-mouth disease]] vaccine, surveillance and microbiological analysis of typhoid, prevalence of drug resistance in bacteria, studies of infections occurring in [[AIDS]] patients, and the development of newer [[chemotherapeutic]] agents to combat [[microbial]] and [[zoonotic]] infections.&lt;ref name= "HID"/&gt;

== History ==
Dr. Haffkine, an orthodox Jewish Ukrainian scientist assigned by the [[Pasteur Institute]] to work in India&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Un illustre inconnu|last=Hanhart|first=Joel|publisher=Lichma|year=2017|isbn=978-2-912553-84-3|location=Paris|pages=|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is recognized as the [[microbiologist]] who first developed and used vaccines against [[cholera]] and [[bubonic plague]]. In October 1896, an epidemic of bubonic plague struck Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) and the government asked Haffkine to help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waldemar Mordekhaï Haffkine (1860-1930). Biographie intellectuelle|last=Hanhart|first=Joel|publisher=Éditions Honoré Champion|year=2016|isbn=978-2-7453-3074-1|location=Paris|pages=|language=French|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He embarked upon the development of a vaccine in a makeshift laboratory in a corridor of [[Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Group of Hospitals|Grant Medical College]]. In three months of persistent work (one of his assistants experienced a [[nervous breakdown]], two others quit), a form of vaccine was ready for human trials.  On 10 January 1897,&lt;ref name= "HIH"/&gt; Haffkine tested it on himself. The vaccines that Haffkine prepared had remarkable results.

===Sans Pareil===
Sans Pareil was once the official residence of the Governor of Bombay. This mansion, which was originally a [[Jesuit]] chapel, was built as part of the Jesuit monastery on Parel Island&lt;ref name="Tindall1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillian Tindall|title=City of Gold: The Biography of Bombay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKwmBWs-jGMC&amp;pg=PA38|year=1992|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-009500-5|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1673.&lt;ref name= "HIH"/&gt; [[William Hornby (governor)|William Hornby]] (1771–1784) was the first governor to take up residence at the mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rajbhavan.maharashtra.gov.in/Pages/frm_rajbhavanhistory.aspx?lang=en-US |title=The History of Raj Bhavan, Mumbai|publisher= Raj Bhavan Maharashtra|access-date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor's residence moved to [[Raj Bhavan (Mumbai)|its present site]] on [[Malabar Hill]] in 1885 and the property was used by the Bombay Presidency Recorders. Haffkine moved into the building to set up the "Plague Research Laboratory" in 1899, the laboratory being formally opened by the then governor of Bombay, [[William Mansfield, 1st Viscount Sandhurst|Lord Sandhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Debi Prasad Chattopadhyaya|title=History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization: pt. 1. Science, technology, imperialism and war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrx3wLz4itkC&amp;pg=PA566|year=1999|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9788131728185|pages=556–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was renamed "Bombay Bacteriology Laboratory" in 1906 and finally as "Haffkine Institute" in 1925.

Haffkine Institute has been the hub where homeopaths like [[Rajesh Shah]] revamped the method of preparation and introduced a new nosode sourced from Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. This study prepared a nosode at eminent Haffkine Institute, sourced from four strains of the organisms, including Multidrug resistance Tuberculosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2685">There are four hospitals in the Cayman Islands. Grand Cayman is home to the private [[Health City Cayman Islands]] as well as the Chrissie Tomlinson Memorial Hospital. The public hospitals include the Cayman Islands Hospital (commonly known as the George Town Hospital); and Faith Hospital on Cayman Brac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalsworldwide.com/countries/cayman_islands.php |title=Cayman Islands Hospitals |publisher=Hospitalsworldwide.com |date=29 February 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergency Medical Services are provided by paramedics and Emergency Medical Technicians using ambulances based in George Town, West Bay and North Side in Grand Cayman and in Cayman Brac. EMS is managed by the Government's Health Services Authority.

In 2007, a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) unit was installed at the Chrissie Tomlinson Memorial Hospital, replacing the one destroyed by [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004. In 2009, a stand-alone open MRI facility was opened. This centre provides MRI, CT, X-ray and [[DEXA]] (bone density) scanning. Also housed in this building is the Heart Health Centre, which provides ultrasound, nuclear medicine, echocardiography and [[cardiac stress test]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caymannetnews.com/article.php?news_id=18920 caymannetnews.com] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517214015/http://www.caymannetnews.com/article.php?news_id=18920 |date=17 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For divers and others in need of [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], there is a two-person [[recompression chamber]] at the Cayman Islands Hospital on Grand Cayman, run by Cayman Hyperbaric Services. Hyperbaric Services has also built a hyperbaric unit at Faith Hospital in Cayman Brac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caymannewsservice.com/health/2011/07/31/hyperbaric-chamber-looks-add-volunteers|title=Hyperbaric chamber looks to add volunteers|website=caymannewsservice.com|date=31 July 2011|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compasscayman.com/caycompass/2014/02/06/Hyperbaric-chamber-tackles-more-than-just-the-bends/|title=Hyperbaric chamber tackles more than just the bends |first1=Samantha|last1=Bonham|website=compasscayman.com|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Cayman Islands became the first country in the world to mandate health insurance for all residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhrs.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=4201,7261469&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL "No Health Cover for 25%"].

'''Hereditary gingival fibromatosis''' (HGF), also known as '''idiopathic gingival hyperplasia''', is a rare condition of [[gingival overgrowth]].&lt;ref name=Poulami&gt;Poulami Majumder, Vineet Nair, Malancha Mukherjee, Sujoy Ghosh, and Subrata Kumar Dey, “The Autosomal Recessive Inheritance of Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis,” Case Reports in Dentistry, vol. 2013, Article ID 432864, 4 pages, 2013. doi:10.1155/2013/432864&lt;/ref&gt; HGF is characterized as a [[benign]], slowly progressive, nonhemorrhagic, fibrous enlargement of keratinized [[gingiva]]. It can cover teeth in various degrees, and can lead to [[aesthetic]] disfigurement.&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;Thomas C. Hart, Yingze Zhang, Michael C. Gorry, P. Suzanne Hart, Margaret Cooper, Mary L. Marazita, Jared M. Marks, Jose R. Cortelli, Debora Pallos Am J Hum Genet. 2002 April; 70(4): 943–954. Published online 2002 February 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Fibrous enlargement is most common in areas of [[maxilla]]ry and [[mandibular]] tissues of both arches in the [[mouth]].&lt;ref name=Poulami /&gt; [[Phenotype]] and [[genotype]] frequency of HGF is 1:175,000 where males and females are equally affected but the cause is not entirely known.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butchi&gt;K. B. Butchi, K. Pavankumar, B. R. Anuradha, and N. Arora, “Hereditary gingival fibromatosis—a case report and management using a novel surgical technique,” Revista Sul-Brasileira de Odontologia, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 453–458, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It mainly exists as an isolated abnormality but can also be associated with a multi-system syndrome.&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;

==Physical signs and symptoms==
There may or may not be any evidence of history of HGF in the family nor any usage of taking long-term medicines for any particular disease when it comes to diagnosing HGF. There also may or may not be any signs of medical and/or family history of [[mental retardation]], [[hypertrichosis]], nor clinical symptoms that can be associated with gingival enlargement. Although, enlargement of gingiva, [[interdental papilla]], hindered speech, and secondary inflammatory changes taking place in the mouth commonly at the marginal gingiva are all very indicative of this condition. Commonly the patient will have mandiblular and maxilliary [[inflammation]] and overgrowth as opposed to the traditional pink, firm, and fleshy consistency of healthy gingiva. The patient's jaw may also appear distorted because of the gingiva englargements. Overgrowth of the gingiva can range from slightly covering the surface of teeth or it can even completely cover the surrounding teeth. The patient can also experience damage or loss of teeth.&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butchi/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeAngelo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jorgenson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poulopoulos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith RG (1997) Gingival recession: reappraisal of an enigmatic condition and a new index for monitoring.

===Checklist of obvious signs of HGF===
* Most obvious sign is gingival overgrowth (overgrowth of the gums)&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butchi/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeAngelo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jorgenson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poulopoulos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scannapieco/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coletta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;
* Hindered chewing efficiency and difficulties eating&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;
* Increasing [[periodontal disease|mobility]] of teeth&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;
* Abnormally shaped teeth and abnormal movement of teeth&lt;ref name=DeAngelo/&gt;
* Inflammation and/or swelling of the gums/gingiva&lt;ref name=Butchi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;
* Not necessarily any signs of pain but experiencing pain is possible&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;
* Difficulties in speaking, oftentimes can lead to [[speech disorders]]&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;
* Other dental and oral problems&lt;ref name=DeAngelo/&gt;
* In some cases, Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis may cause bleeding from the gums, or gum ulcerations.

==Cause==
Though much more research needs to be done, researchers have mostly agreed that a [[mutation]] in [[SOS1]], son-of-sevenless gene, is responsible for this disease.&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeAngelo&gt;S. DeAngelo, J. Murphy, L. Claman, J. Kalmar, and B. Leblebicioglu, “Hereditary gingival fibromatosis—a review,” Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 138–143, 2007. View at Scopus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jorgenson&gt;R. J. Jorgenson and M. E. Cocker, “Variation in the inheritance and expression of gingival fibromatosis,” Journal of Periodontology, vol. 45, no. 7, pp. 472–477, 1974. View at Scopus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poulopoulos&gt;A. Poulopoulos, D. Kittas, and A. Sarigelou, “Current concepts on gingival fibromatosis-related syndromes,” Journal of Investigative and Clinical Dentistry, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 156–161, 2011. View at Publisher • View at Google Scholar&lt;/ref&gt; [[SOS1]] is a [[guanine]] nucleotide-exchange factor that functions in the [[Signal transduction|transduction]] of signals that control [[cell growth]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. A mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene results in a single [[nucleotide]] [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]].&lt;ref name=Poulopoulos/&gt; Specific [[linkage studies]] have localized the [[mutation]] for isolated, nonsyndromic [[autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] forms of gingival [[fibromatosis]] to [[chromosomes]] 2 and 5, more specifically 2p21-p22 and 5q13-q22.&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;

=== HGF can be divided into two main categories ===

;Genetic

HGF1 - Caused by a mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene localized on chromosome 2p21-p22&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;

HGF2 - Caused by a mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene localized on chromosome 5q13-q22&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;{{Contradict-inline|article = SOS1|date=July 2016}}

Mutations in the [[RE1-silencing transcription factor]] (REST) gene can also cause this syndrome.&lt;ref name=Bayram2017&gt;Bayram Y, White JJ, Elcioglu N, Cho MT, Zadeh N, Gedikbasi A, Palanduz S, Ozturk S, Cefle K, Kasapcopur O, Coban Akdemir Z, Pehlivan D, Begtrup A, Carvalho CMB, Paine IS, Mentes A, Bektas-Kayhan K, Karaca E, Jhangiani SN, Muzny DM, Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics, Gibbs RA, Lupski JR (2017) REST Final-Exon-Truncating Mutations Cause Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis. Am J Hum Genet 101(1):149-156 &lt;/ref&gt;  

;Non genetic

HGF may also be caused by unwanted side effects of pharmacological agents like [[phenytoin]], [[ciclosporin]], and some calcium-channel blockers, meaning HGF is a disease that can be [[drug-induced]].&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt; However, there is little next to no research done in this area to support the claim.

* Multi-system syndromes: [[Zimmerman-Laband syndrome]], [[Jones syndrome]], [[Ramon syndrome]], [[Rutherford syndrome]], [[juvenile hyaline fibromatosis]], [[systemic infantile hyalinosis]], and [[mannosidosis]]&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan&gt;T. Ramakrishnan and Manmeet Kaur, "Multispeciality Approach in the Management of Patient with Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis: 1-Year Followup: A Case Report," Hindawi Publishing Corporation International Journal of Dentistry, Volume 2010, Article ID 575979, doi:10.1155/2010/575979&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some unknown causes&lt;ref name=Butchi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khan/&gt;

==Mechanism==
Genetic linkage studies are among the most popular methods of study to look at the mechanism of this HGF. Genetic linkage studies have found to localize genetic loci for autosomal dominant forms of HGF to chromosome 2p21-p22 (indicative of HGF1) and chromosome 5q13-q22 (indicative of HGF2). Chromosome 2p21-p22 has been refined to an interval of ∼2.3 Mb to construct an integrated physical and genetic map of the 16 genes interval. Here, a mutation is found in sequencing these 16 genes.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;

There is an insertion of a cytosine between nucleotides 126,142 and 126,143 in codon 1083 of the [[SOS1]] gene, meaning there is a mutation in [[SOS1]]. This causes a problem because [[SOS1]] introduces a [[frameshift mutation]] and creates a premature stop codon. Also, it can segregate over generations, most commonly four. Once it causes a premature stop codon, the chromosome loses four important [[proline]]-rich SH-3 binding domains in the carboxyl-terminal region of the [[SOS1]] [[protein]]. As a result, the N-terminal [[amino acids]] for [[SOS1]] is fused into a 22–amino acid carboxyl terminus.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt; Researchers claim that this mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene is a probable primary cause of this disease but limited information supports the mechanism of this claim.

==Diagnosis==

There are very few ways to test a patient for HGF. Currently, the most common way to diagnose a patient is by means of a physical evaluation. The physician can make a physical evaluation of the patient and send them to a dentist or better yet a specialist like a periodontist to evaluate signs of gingival overgrowth, quality of gingiva, inflammation, mechanical difficulties of the mouth, tooth conditions, and any sort of discomfort.&lt;ref name=Butchi/&gt;

Aside from obvious physical symptoms seen in a physical evaluation, molecular tests can be run to check if there is a mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene to confirm the diagnosis. If there is indeed a mutation in this gene coupled with the typical physical symptoms, then it is quite probable that a patient suffers from this disease. Also, looking at family history is also becoming more prominent in aiding to diagnose the patient. Otherwise, researchers are working to find new and better ways to test for the presence of HGF.&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

==Prevention==
Since this condition is generally agreed upon to be [[hereditary]], nothing can be done to prevent HGF. However, in some cases where it can develop as a result of rare multi-system syndromes, such as: Zimmerman-Laband, Jones, Ramon Syndrome, Rutherford Syndrome, Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis, Systemic Infantile Hyalinosis, and [[Mannosidosis]], it is best for one to simply monitors the possible progression for HGF with regular dental check-ups.&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan/&gt;

If the patient's disease is treated by means of surgery, it is recommended that the patient undergoes post-surgical therapies for maintenance and periodic monitoring of gums for the sake of the possibility of re-occurrence of HGF.&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan/&gt;

==Treatment and prognosis==
This disease has not been shown to be life-threatening or the cause of death in patients. However, treatment is necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

===If left untreated===

The following can occur if left untreated:
* Too much gingiva exposure
*  
* Oral [[morbidity]] 
* 
* [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] [[infection]] of areas between the gums and teeth, or at the [[gum line]]
*
* various degrees of [[Periodontitis]] - most likely due to the inability and difficulty of keeping the gingival margin and surrounding tissue clean due to the overgrowth
*
* Improper [[tooth eruption]] and/or complete prevention of tooth eruption as a result of too much gingiva exposure
*
* Systemic every-day troubles including functional and aesthetic problems of the mouth
*
* [[Malocclusion]]

&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scannapieco/&gt;

===Treatment===
Most recent methods of treatment take the form of surgeries such as oral [[prophylaxis]], followed by post-surgical therapies to monitor, provide proper oral hygiene, and correct the deformity. Although, the nature of recurrence post-treatment is virtually unknown, let alone what type of treatment is most effective for HGF. (SOURCE 2) In some cases, there is re-growth after surgical removal of the excess gingival tissues, in others there is minimal. No cases yet have shown any particular treatment or form of medicine to permanently remove HGF.&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;

One type of procedure that can be executed is as follows: Removal of excess tissue under [[anesthesia]] through an internal bevel [[gingivectomy]] or undisplaced [[pocket reduction surgery|flap]] followed by [[gingivoplasty]] and continuous sling [[Surgical suture|suture]] placements and periodontal dressing; after about a week of recovery after the surgery, remove sutures and periodically do observational evaluations to look for any signs of re-occurrence.&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;

==Recent research==
Some researchers suggest that HGF is transmitted as a [[Mendelian trait]] since both [[autosomal dominant]] and [[autosomal recessive]] transmission has been reported since the early 1970s. (SOURCE 1) In more recent scientific literature, there is evidence in which [[pedigree chart|pedigree]] analyses confirm autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or even as [[X-linked]] inherited cases of the HGF trait.&lt;ref name=Coletta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer/&gt;

In 2002, researchers described the [[SOS1]] gene and proved for the first time that a single-nucleotide–insertion mutation of the [[SOS1]] gene on codon 1083 is the preliminary cause of HGF1 in humans. (Source 1) Later on in 2010, there was a case study done on a 16-year-old male with severe gingival overgrowth, almost covering all teeth. Researchers approached this issue with [[periodontics]] - a partial [[gingivectomy]] and [[flap surgery]]. This case study concluded that surgery followed by regular follow-ups is a good way to treat HGF despite the fact that the risks of re-occurrence of the condition remain high.&lt;ref name=Ramakrishnan/&gt;

Even more recently, a study was done in 2013 on a family that showed history of autosomal recessive inheritance of HGF. The study did not dismiss the return of HGF after treatment but did claim that general surgical intervention after scaling and [[root]] planning of teeth supplemented with good [[oral hygiene]] is good enough to prevent the re-occurrence of HGF. This case study also acknowledged how HGF can be part of a multi-system syndrome associated with disorders such as [[Zimmermann Laband syndrome]] (ear, nose, bone, and nail defects with hepatosplenomegaly), [[Rutherford syndrome]]  (microphthalmia, mental retardation, athetosis, and hypopigmentation), [[Murray-Puretic Drescher syndrome]] and [[Ramon syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Poulami/&gt;

'''Islam Barrage''' is a [[barrage (dam)|barrage]] on the [[River Sutlej]] in [[Hasilpur Tehsil]] of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]]

Islam Barrage is used for irrigation and flood control. It is about {{convert|15|km|mi}} north of [[Hasilpur]] and about {{convert|7.5|km|mi}} south of [[Luddan]] on the [[Vehari]]-Hasilpur road. It was completed as Sutlej Valley Project&lt;ref name="nation2010"/&gt; for irrigation of Nili Bar in 1927. 1650 feet long with design discharge of 300,000 cusecs, it has two off taking larger canals which irrigate 689,000 acres of land in Southern Punjab and 700, 000 acres in the former [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur state]]. Mailsi Canal (5400 cusecs) arises from its right Bank and Bahawal Canal (5400 cusecs) from the left. A third smaller canal is called Qaim Canal (558 cusecs) also arising from the left bank.

According to a report, Islam Headworks is in distress owing to aging, design deficiencies, constructional defects, hydraulic and mechanical problems, inadequate operation, maintenance and drastic changes in river morphology as a result of implementation of Indus Water Treaty of 1960.  

The major problem was inadequate flood passage capacity of barrage in relation to flood intensities developed over a 100-year return period. The aging process along with inadequate/deferred maintenance had contributed to a general deterioration of different components of the structure.

The poor structural state of the headworks has been documented to be poor in June 1998, due to inattention, lack of interest, and the operations of the headworks has suffered. Every September when the flood level rise and India releases a large amount of water, it creates havoc in areas downstream from the head works.

A feasibility study and detailed designs was prepared in 2008 to rehabilitate the Headworks. However due to lack of interest, inefficiency at the government level and absence of confidence/trust of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) has contributed to postpone the rehabilitation. World Bank (WB) has given verbal assurance for financing the rehabilitation of Islam headworks but it would be only after rehabilitation of another barrage (Jinnah). More recently the Punjab government has obtained assurances from the World Bank and the Provincial Government of Shahbaz Sharif has begun to take interest in rehabilitation of the headworks. 2013 floods which caused a significant damage throughout Punjab may have been an impetus in leading to this more proactive policy.

According to a 2011 report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Riaz Missen|title=Sutlej flows down to Bahawalpur but with poisonous waters|url=http://weeklypulse.org/details.aspx?contentID=967&amp;storylist=16|dead-url=yes|accessdate=27 May 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150203071716/http://weeklypulse.org/details.aspx?contentID=967&amp;storylist=16|archivedate=2015-02-03|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; River Sutlej at this point is the most polluted river in South Asia. The combined unregulated discharge of Urban and Industrial waste during its course through India and later Pakistan is the most likely source of this problem. 

This barrage is a tourist site for those who want to visit nearby restaurants that sell fresh fish. Most of the tourist are from nearby towns. However it can be developed into a eco-tourism site for those who are interested in study of the hydrology of Indus basin and the effect of shortage of water in this part of the world. The desertification of the area from the nearby Choolistan desert is an interesting phenomenon and the pollution of the river from upstream industry in India is a cause of concern.

'''John Thomas Grinder, Jr.'''&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/688225&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɪ|n|d|ər}} {{respell|GRIN|dər}}; born January 10, 1940) is an American [[linguist]], author, management consultant, trainer and speaker. Grinder is credited with co-creating [[Neuro-linguistic programming]], with [[Richard Bandler]]. He is co-director of Quantum Leap Inc., a management consulting firm founded by his partner [[Carmen Bostic St. Clair]] in 1987 (Grinder joined in 1989). Grinder and Bostic St. Clair also run workshops and seminars on NLP internationally.

==Life and career==
Grinder graduated from the [[University of San Francisco]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[psychology]] in the early 1960s. Grinder then entered the [[United States Army]] and served as a captain in the [[United States Army Special Forces|US Special Forces]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]]; following this he went on to work for a US [[intelligence agency]]. In the late 1960s, he returned to college to study [[linguistics]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.ucsd.edu/who/alumni.html#1972 Linguistics dissertations at UCSD, 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation, titled ''On Deletion Phenomena in English'', was published by Mouton in 1976.&lt;ref name=deletion&gt;{{cite journal

In the early 1970s, Grinder worked in [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]]'s laboratory at [[Rockefeller University]].&lt;ref name="nlpu"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Bio of John Grinder | publisher = [[NLP University]] | accessdate = 2007-01-26 | url = http://www.nlpu.com/grindbio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his doctorate, Grinder took a full-time position as an assistant professor in the linguistics faculty at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UCSC). He engaged in undergraduate teaching, graduate teaching, and research. His research focused on [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theories of [[transformational grammar]] specializing in [[syntax]] and deletion phenomena. He published several research papers with [[Paul Postal]] on the syntactical structures relating to "missing antecedents"&lt;ref name="Grinder &amp; Postal 1971"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Edward Klima]], doctoral adviser to both Postal and Grinder at UCSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.ucsd.edu/who/alumni.html UCSD 1972 alumni]&lt;/ref&gt; became involved in the early development of [[generative semantics]].

Grinder co-authored, with [[Suzette Haden Elgin|Suzette Elgin]], a linguistics text book titled ''A Guide to Transformational Grammar: History, Theory, Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;Elgin has since published various poems and short stories; she is also known for her non-fiction series ''Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense'' series. e.g. Elgin, S.

==Development of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)==

In 1972 (during Grinder's stint at [[University of California|UCSC]]) [[Richard Bandler]], an undergraduate student of psychology, approached him for assistance in specific aspects of [[Modeling (NLP)|modeling]] [[Gestalt therapy]]. Bandler, along with good friend Frank Pucelik, had spent much time recording and editing recordings of [[Fritz Perls]] (founder of [[Gestalt therapy]]) and had learned Gestalt therapy implicitly during intense group sessions. After some time, Grinder was invited to participate in group discussions. Although at first Grinder sat quietly, he eventually approached Bandler and Pucelik with some observations and questions. Grinder left a lasting impression on Pucelik and was later dubbed 'the real genius'.&lt;ref name="chrismorris.com"&gt;http://chrismorris.com/blog/2010/09/frank-pucelik-and-the-early-days-of-nlp/&lt;/ref&gt; Bandler and Pucelik invited Grinder to team up, eventually creating a very close group. Although Bandler, Grinder and Pucelik were the main driving force, there were several other students at the university who contributed ‘a hell of a lot’ according to Pucelik.&lt;ref name="chrismorris.com"/&gt; In the end, hours of unpaid research significantly aided the formation of Meta - modern day NLP.

From there Grinder and Bandler modelled the various cognitive behavioral patterns of therapists such as Perls, a leading figure in family therapy [[Virginia Satir]] and later the leading figure in [[hypnosis]] in [[psychiatry]] [[Milton Erickson]]. As a result, ''The Structure of Magic'' Volumes I &amp; II (1975, 1976), ''Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson'', Volumes I &amp; II (1975, 1977) and ''Changing With Families'' (1976) were published. This work formed the basis of the [[methodology]] that became the foundation of [[neuro-linguistic programming]].

The trio began hosting seminars and practice groups. These served as a place to practice and test their newly discovered patterns while allowing them to transfer the skills to the participants. Several books were published based on transcripts of their seminars, including ''Frogs into Princes'' (1979).  During this period, a creative group of students and psychotherapists were asked to join including Robert Dilts, [[Leslie Cameron-Bandler]], Judith DeLozier, Stephen Gilligan and David Gordon (All of whom are considered the second generation of co-developers; recruited by Bandler, Grinder and Pucelik after the original team graduated from university).

In the 1977, Bandler requested that Pucelik be removed from the group for personal reasons - which was agreed to by immediate mutual consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlpacademy.co.uk/articles/view/frank_pucelik_-_his_view_on_nlps_beginnings/&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't long after that that Bandler, Grinder and their group of associates split acrimoniously, and stopped working together. Following this, many members of their group went out on their own and took NLP in their own directions. Some of Bandler and Grinder's books went out of print for a while due to legal problems between the co-authors. ''Structure I &amp; II'', and ''Patterns I &amp; II'' – considered{{by whom|date=December 2010}} the foundation of the field – were later republished. Bandler attempted to claim legal ownership of the term Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP); however, it was eventually deemed to be a generic term, and could therefore not be trademarked. Grinder and Bandler settled their claims around 2001, clearing a platform for the future development of NLP as a legitimate field of endeavor.&lt;ref name="whisperingapx"&gt;(See Appendix of ''Whispering in the Wind''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New code of NLP===
{{main|New Code of NLP}}
Between 1982 and 1987, strongly influenced by anthropologist and systems theorist [[Gregory Bateson]], who had a strong focus on ecology as a psychological construct, Grinder and Judith DeLozier collaborated to develop the "[[New Code of NLP]]". (Grinder and Bateson had met during their affiliation with [[Kresge College]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] during the 1970s.) Grinder and Delozier presented an aesthetic framework for the "classic code" of NLP that explicates the involvement of ecology and the [[unconscious mind]] in change-work. "[[Ecology]]" in NLP involves respecting the integrity of a system as a whole when assessing a change to that system; the "system" in this case comprises a person's model of the world and the consequences of that model in the person's environment. Practically speaking, this consideration entails asking questions like "What are the intended effects of this change? What other effects might this change have, and are those effects desirable? Is this change still a good idea?"

The seminars{{which|date=November 2010}} were transcribed{{By whom|date=April 2011}} and published in 1987 as ''Turtles All the Way Down; Prerequisites to Personal Genius''.

John Grinder and Carmen Bostic St Clair have further developed The New Code of NLP. (Bostic St Clair founded{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Quantum Leap Inc., a cultural-change consultancy firm.) {{As of| 2014}} Grinder and Bostic St Clair continue to present public seminars on NLP internationally. In 2001, Grinder (with Bostic St Clair) published ''Whispering in the Wind'' with a "set of recommendations as to how specifically NLP can improve its practice and take its rightful place as a scientifically based endeavor with its precise focus on modeling of the extremes of human behavior: excellence and the high performers who actually do it".&lt;ref name="whispering"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Grinder has since begun to strongly encourage the field to make a recommitment to what he considers the core activity of NLP: modeling.

'''Ketosis-prone diabetes''' or KPD is an intermediate form of diabetes that has some characteristics of [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1]] and some of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]] diabetes.  However, it is distinct from [[latent autoimmune diabetes of adults]], a form of type 1 sometimes referred to as type 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;''There is clearly a spectrum of clinical phenotypes among patients with islet autoantibodies who do not present with ketosis, including those termed “latent autoimmune diabetes in adults” (LADA) (30), “type 1.5 diabetes” (31,32,33), and “slowly progressing type 1 diabetes” (34). A similar spectrum exists in KPD that includes the very different phenotypes of A+β− and A+β+ KPD. A+β− KPD is synonymous with classic, early onset autoimmune type 1 diabetes; A+β+ KPD may overlap with LADA. However, there are differences between LADA, as recently defined by the Immunology of Diabetes Society, and A+β+ KPD patients; most importantly, the definition of LADA excludes patients who require insulin within the first 6 months after diagnosis, whereas the majority (90%) of A+β+ KPD patients present with DKA as the first manifestation of diabetes and therefore require insulin at the start.'' {{Cite journal|author1=Balasubramanyam, A. |author2=Nalini, R. |author3=Hampe, C.

'''Lauriston S. Taylor''' (1 June 1902 – 26 November 2004) was an American physicist known for his work in the field of radiation protection and measurement.

==Career==
He established standards for X-ray radiation exposure for the first time in the 1920s, which eventually led to a group of government organizations that set the standards over the next 50 years. Taylor remained active in debates about radiation exposure into his 80s, often advocating the viewpoint that small doses of radiation were not important.

==Accolades==
He served as president of the [[Health Physics Society]] (HPS) from 1958 to 1959. He was a recipient of the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]], and the Presidential [[Bronze Star]] (then the highest military award that could be given to a civilian).&lt;ref&gt;[[Health Physics Society]], [http://hps.org/aboutthesociety/people/inmemoriam/LauristonTaylor.html In Memoriam: Lauriston S. Taylor]. Retrieved 25 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vignettes of early radiation workers==
In 1977 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] initiated a series of 25 [[Interview|recorded interviews]] with early radiation workers to provide an historical overview of their research and discoveries primarily in the fields of [[medical physics]], [[radiation]], and [[radiobiology]]. Lauriston S. Taylor moderated the series and also was an interview subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Taylor, Lauriston S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6698">Invertebrates are very common vectors of disease. A vector is an organism which spreads disease from one host to another. Invertebrates spread bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens by two main mechanisms. Either via their bite, as in the case of malaria spread by mosquitoes, or via their faeces, as in the case of Chagas' Disease spread by Triatoma bugs or epidemic typhus spread by human body lice.

Many invertebrates are responsible for transmitting diseases. Mosquitoes are perhaps the best known invertebrate vector and transmit a wide range of tropical diseases including malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever. Another large group of vectors are flies. Sandfly species transmit the disease leishmaniasis, by acting as vectors for protozoan ''Leishmania'' species, and tsetse flies transmit protozoan trypansomes (''Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'' and ''Trypansoma brucei rhodesiense'') which cause African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ticks and lice form another large group of invertebrate vectors. The bacterium ''Borrelia burgdorferi'', which causes Lyme Disease, is transmitted by ticks and members of the bacterial genus ''Rickettsia'' are transmitted by lice. For example, the human body louse transmits the bacterium ''Rickettsia prowazekii'' which causes epidemic typhus.

Although invertebrate-transmitted diseases pose a particular threat on the continents of Africa, Asia and South America, there is one way of controlling invertebrate-borne diseases, which is by controlling the invertebrate vector. For example, one way of controlling malaria is to control the mosquito vector through the use of mosquito nets, which prevent mosquitoes from coming into contact with humans.

This is a '''list of diseases spread by invertebrates'''.

'''Mobile Crisis''', or '''Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team (MCRRT)''', is a [[mental health]] service in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] (typically operated by  hospital or community mental health agency) which services the community by providing immediate response emergency mental health evaluations. Evaluations are often requested by hospital [[Emergency department|emergency rooms]], but can also be requested by [[Intensive care medicine|ICUs]], CCUs, jails, nursing homes, police, or EMS. These services are often available on a 24-hour basis.

Mobile Crisis evaluations are typically requested due to a reasonable expectation of self-inflicted harm to the client, but can also be requested due to a reasonable expectation of the client's intent to harm another person. In addition to Suicidal/Homicidal Ideation or gestures, an assessment may be requested due to a person exhibiting signs of psychosis, grave alien, or altered mental status believed not to have an organic etiology. Criteria for requesting a Mobile Crisis assessment varies depending upon individual mental health agencies and entities that regulate mental health services, as well as statues created via legislative assemblies. An assessment may be requested for situations involving [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and drugs (where there is not a mental health component), or "routine" evaluations requested where there is not a reasonable expectation of harm to the client or another individual, as long as psychopathology is not otherwise ruled out.

The Mobile Crisis clinician has typically obtained her/his [[Master's degree]] in a mental health-related field (such as [[social work]], [[mental health counseling]], or [[counseling psychology]]). The clinician performs the evaluation based on standard models of mental status examination (alert and oriented, mood, thought process, affect, etc.), and assigns a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-5]] (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, Fifth Edition) diagnosis if this falls within their scope of practice.  After completing the evaluation, the clinician makes a disposition, or placement, decision for the client. Placements can include involuntary in-patient hospitalization, voluntary in-patient hospitalization, or discharge to home with out-patient referrals. Following disposition, the Mobile Crisis unit can be expected to follow up with the client within a few days.

Founded by [[Hiker Chiu]] in 2008, '''Oii-Chinese''' (國際陰陽人組織 — 中文版) is an [[intersex]] advocacy and support group and the Chinese language affiliate of [[Organisation Intersex International]]. Oii-Chinese is active in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other areas in East Asia.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2013/11/27/2003577754/ | title = Neither here, nor there | work = [[Taipei Times]] | date = November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and activities ==

The organisation aims to end "normalising" surgeries on intersex children, promote awareness of intersex issues, and improve government recognition of gender. Chiu says that surgical "normalisation" practices began in Taiwan in 1953. As part of this mission, Chiu started a "free hugs with intersex" campaign at Taipei's LGBT Pride Parade in 2010. The organisation also gives lectures and lobbies government.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-136232 | title = 擁抱陰陽人 系列2：停止矯正手術 陰陽兒不是異形 | work = Lihpao Daily | date = 23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/taiwan-allows-legal-gender-changes-without-transitioning091213 | title = Taiwan to allow legal gender changes without transitioning | work = [[Gay Star News]] | date = 9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2013/new/nov/3/today-o2.htm | title = Germany recognises gender 'X' | work = [[Liberty Times]] | date = November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.rti.org.tw/english/2011/01/20/intersex-hiker-chius-story/ | title = Intersex: Hiker Chiu’s story | work = [[Radio Taiwan International]] | date = January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament''' ('''OPLL''') is a process of [[fibrosis]], [[calcification]], and [[ossification]] of the [[posterior longitudinal ligament]] of the spine, that may involve the spinal dura.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/474019573|title=Handbook of neurosurgery|last=Greenberg|first=Mark|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Thieme|year=|isbn=1588904571|location=|pages=|oclc=474019573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once considered a disorder unique to people of Asian heritage, it is now recognized as an uncommon disorder in a variety of patients with [[myelopathy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belanger|first=Theodore|year=2005|title=Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament|url=http://journals.lww.com/jbjsjournal/pages/default.aspx|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|volume=87|pages=610–615|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes of OPLL are unknown. However, genetic and environmental factors appear to play a role in pathogenesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; OPLL may also be associated with [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belanger|first=T.

== Diagnosis ==
Myeolography, including post-myelographic CT is likely the most effective imaging study an accurate diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Surgical management options include extensive cervical [[laminectomy]] with or without an additional posterior [[arthrodesis]], anterior decompression and arthrodesis, and posterior cervical laminoplasty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Treatment decisions can be made based on a grading systems devised by Hirabayashi et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirabayashi|first=K.|last2=Watanabe|first2=K.|last3=Wakano|first3=K.|last4=Suzuki|first4=N.|last5=Satomi|first5=K.|last6=Ishii|first6=Y.|date=1983-10-01|title=Expansive open-door laminoplasty for cervical spinal stenotic myelopathy|journal=Spine|volume=8|issue=7|pages=693–699|issn=0362-2436|pmid=6420895}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented by the Nurick myelopathy classification system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NURJCK|first=S.|date=1972-01-01|title=THE PATHOGENESIS OF THE SPINAL CORD DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/95.1.87|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=95|issue=1|pages=87–100|doi=10.1093/brain/95.1.87|issn=0006-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Most patients suffer from only mild symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Symptoms typically last approximately 13 months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Of patients without myelopathy at initial presentation, only 29% of them will develop myelopathy within 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsunaga|first=Shunji|last2=Sakou|first2=Takashi|last3=Taketomi|first3=Eiji|last4=Komiya|first4=Setsuro|date=2004-03-01|title=Clinical course of patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a minimum 10-year cohort study|url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/spi.2004.100.3.0245|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine|volume=100|issue=3|pages=245–248|doi=10.3171/spi.2004.100.3.0245|issn=1547-5654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Metsu, Gabriël - L'Apothicaire - c. 1651-1667.jpg|thumb|The Apothecary or The Chemist by [[Gabriël Metsu]] (c. 1651–67)]]

'''Pharmacy''' is the science and technique of preparing and dispensing [[drug]]s. It is a [[health profession]] that links [[health science]]s with [[chemistry|chemical science]]s and aims to ensure the safe and effective use of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.

The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as [[compounding]] and dispensing medications, and it also includes more modern services related to [[health care]], including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information. [[Pharmacist]]s, therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize use of medication for the benefit of the patients.

An establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a ''pharmacy'' (this term is more common in the United States) or a ''chemist's'' (which is more common in Great Britain). In the United States and Canada, ''drugstores'' commonly sell medicines, as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery, [[cosmetics]], [[office supplies]], [[toy]]s, hair care products and [[magazine]]s and occasionally refreshments and groceries.

In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the pharma may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacology]], prior to the formulation of the scientific method.

==Disciplines==
[[Image:42-aspetti di vita quotidiana, medicine,Taccuino Sanitatis, .jpg|thumb|Pharmacy, [[tacuinum sanitatis]] casanatensis (14th century)]]
The field of pharmacy can generally be divided into three primary disciplines:
*[[Pharmaceutics]] 
*[[Medicinal Chemistry]] and [[Pharmacognosy]]
*Pharmacy Practice

The boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut.
Often, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology.

[[Pharmacology]] is sometimes considered as the 4th discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline.

[[Pharmacoinformatics]] is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety.

==Professionals==
The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2011/en/index.html ''World Health Statistics 2011''] - Table 6: Health workforce, infrastructure and essential medicines. Geneva, 2011. Accessed 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacists===
{{Main article|Pharmacist}}
[[File:Farmacia conventuale Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|Convent pharmacy exhibited at the [[Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] of Milan.]]

Pharmacists are [[healthcare profession]]als with specialised education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal [[health]] outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be [[small business|small-business]] proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimisation of a drug treatment for an individual.

Pharmacists are represented internationally by the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP). They are represented at the national level by [[professional body|professional organisations]] such as the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] in the UK, [[Pharmacy Guild of Australia]] (PSA), [[Canadian Pharmacists Association]] (CPhA), [[Indian Pharmacist Association]] (IPA), [[Pakistan Pharmacists Association]] (PPA), and [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA), ''See also: [[List of pharmacy associations]].''

In some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and [[ethics]] of the profession.

In the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] include: cardiovascular, [[infectious disease]], [[oncology]], pharmacotherapy, nuclear, [[nutrition]], and [[psychiatry]].&lt;ref&gt;Board of Pharmacy Specialties, [http://www.bpsweb.org/03_Specialties_Current.html, Current Specialties]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The [[American Board of Applied Toxicology]] certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].

===Pharmacy technicians===
{{Main article|Pharmacy technician}}
Pharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.

A Pharmacy Technician in the UK has recently been referred to by some as a professional. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy premises.

In the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications.

== Education Requirements ==
There are different requirements of schooling based on the area of pharmaceuticals a student is seeking. In the United States, the general pharmacist will attain a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (Pharm.D.). The Pharm.D. can be completed in a minimum of six years, which includes two years of pre-pharmacy classes, and four years of professional studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/Pharmacist_Certification_and_Course_Requirements_FAQs.html|title=Pharmacist Certification and Course Requirements|last=|first=|date=2013-2018|website=Learn.org|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After graduating pharmacy school, it is highly suggested that the student go on to complete a one or two year residency, which provides valuable experience for the student before going out independently to be a generalized or specialized pharmacist. 

The curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.ku.edu/sites/pharmacy.ku.edu/files/files/student%20handbooks/2017-2018%20Student%20Handbook%20v2017_08_18.pdf|title=Pharmacy Student handbook 2017-2018|last=|first=|date=August 2017|website=KU Pharmacy|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=no|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; created for a Pharm.D. is made up of 208-credit hours. Of the 208-credit hours, 68 are transferred-credit hours, and the remaining 140-credit hours are completed in the professional school. There are a series of required standardized tests that students have to pass throughout the process of pharmacy school. The standardized test to get into pharmacy school is called the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT). In a student's third professional year in pharmacy school, it is required to pass the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA). Once the Pharm.D. is attained after the fourth year professional school, the student is then eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE) to work as a professional pharmacist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.ku.edu/sites/pharmacy.ku.edu/files/files/student%20handbooks/2017-2018%20Student%20Handbook%20v2017_08_18.pdf|title=Pharmacy Student Handbook 2017-2018|last=|first=|date=August 2017|website=KU Pharmacy|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main article|History of pharmacy|List of pharmacists}}
[[File:Legenogapotekeren.jpg|thumb|Physician and Pharmacist, illustration from ''Medicinarius'' (1505) by [[Hieronymus Brunschwig]].]]
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Scientific chemistry and pharmacy.jpg|thumb|Pharmacy in medieval [[Muslim world]].]] --&gt;

The earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', an Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic treatise]] attributed to [[Sushruta]] in the 6th century BC. However, the earliest text as preserved dates to the 3rd or 4th century AD.

Many [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] (late 6th millennium BC – early 2nd millennium BC) cuneiform [[clay tablet]]s record prescriptions for medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=John K. Borchardt |year=2002 |title=The Beginnings of Drug Therapy: Ancient Mesopotamian Medicine |journal=Drug News &amp; Perspectives |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=187–192 |issn=0214-0934 |pmid=12677263 |doi=10.1358/dnp.2002.15.3.840015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the ''[[Ebers Papyrus]]'' of 1550 BC, and the ''[[Edwin Smith Papyrus]]'' of the 16th century BC.

[[File:Dioscorides De Materia Medica Byzantium 15th century.jpg|thumb|Dioscorides, ''[[Materia Medica|De Materia Medica]]'', Byzantium, 15th century]]
In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Diocles of Carystus]] (4th century BC) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants. He wrote several treatises on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kremers, Glenn Sonnedecker (1986). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r__FmMNS7qIC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Kremers and Urdang's History of pharmacy]''". Amer. Inst. History of Pharmacy. p.17.
{{ISBN|0931292174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek physician [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] is famous for writing a five volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' (''Concerning medical substances'') was used a basis for many medieval texts, and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

[[Pharmacy in China]] dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the ''Shennong Bencao Jing'' (''The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic''), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the [[Han dynasty]] and was attributed to the mythical [[Shennong]]. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript "Recipes for 52 Ailments", found in the [[Mawangdui]], sealed in 168 BC. 

In Japan, at the end of the [[Asuka period]] (538–710) and the early [[Nara period]] (710–794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected.  The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the [[Taihō Code]] (701) and re-stated in the [[Yōrō Code]] (718).  Ranked positions in the pre-[[Heian period|Heian]] Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868).  In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists—and even pharmacist assistants—were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834) ''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a stone sign for a pharmacy with a tripod, a mortar, and a pestle opposite one for a doctor in the Arcadian Way in Ephesus near Kusadasi in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/tsechien/ephesus_ has photos]&lt;/ref&gt;  The current Ephesus dates back to 400 BC and was the site of the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the world.

In [[Baghdad]] the first pharmacies, or drug stores, were established in 754,&lt;ref name=Hadzovic&gt;

The advances made in the Middle East in [[botany]] and [[chemistry]] led [[medicine in medieval Islam]] substantially to develop [[pharmacology]]. [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi]] (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and [[distillation]]. His ''Liber servitoris'' is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were [[compounding|compounded]] the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. [[Al-Biruni]] (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled ''Kitab al-Saydalah'' (''The Book of Drugs''), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. [[Avicenna]], too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Of great impact were also the works by [[Masawaih al-Mardini|al-Maridini of Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]], and [[Ibn al-Wafid]] (1008–1074), both of which were printed in [[Latin]] more than fifty times, appearing as ''De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus'' by '[[Mesue]]' the younger, and the ''Medicamentis simplicibus'' by '[[Abenguefit]]'. [[Peter of Abano]] (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title ''De Veneris''. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote ''The foundations of the true properties of Remedies'', amongst others describing [[arsenious oxide]], and being acquainted with [[silicic acid]]. He made clear distinction between [[sodium carbonate]] and [[potassium carbonate]], and drew attention to the poisonous nature of [[copper]] compounds, especially copper [[vitriol]], and also [[lead]] compounds. He also describes the [[Distilled water|distillation of sea-water]] for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Levey M. (1973), ‘ Early Arabic Pharmacology’,  E. J. Brill; Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=September 2010}}

In [[Europe]] pharmacy-like shops began to appear during the 12th century. In 1240 emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederic II]] issued a decree by which the physician's and the apothecary's professions were separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.swipnet.se/PharmHist/Apotek/gamla_apotek_en.html History of Pharmacy Web Pages - Sweden´s oldest pharmacies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623180025/http://home.swipnet.se/PharmHist/Apotek/gamla_apotek_en.html |date=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The first pharmacy in Europe (still working) was opened in 1241 in [[Trier]], [[Germany]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/in_mow/classes_stud/uk/pharm/prov_pharm/ntn/%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0/1/%E2%84%96%2004.%20The%20History%20of%20Pharmacy%20Eminent%20Scientists.htm|title=The History of Pharmacy.

[[Image:Raeapteek sign.jpg|thumb|250px|Sign of the [[Raeapteek|Town Hall Pharmacy]] in [[Tallinn]], operating continuously from at least 1422]]
In Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422.
The oldest is claimed to have been set up in 1221 in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy, which now houses a perfume museum. The medieval [[Esteve Pharmacy]], located in [[Llívia]], a Catalan enclave close to [[Puigcerdà]], also now a museum, dates back to the 15th century, keeping [[albarello]]s from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs.

==Practice areas==
Pharmacists practice in a variety of areas including community pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, extended care facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and regulatory agencies. Pharmacists themselves may have expertise in a [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]].

===Community pharmacy===

[[Image:Selvvalg.jpg|thumb|right|Modern pharmacy in Norway]]
{{See also|Community pharmacy|Pharmacy automation}}

A ''pharmacy'' (commonly the ''chemist'' in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]; or ''drugstore'' in [[North America]]; ''retail pharmacy'' in industry terminology; or [[Apothecary]], historically) is the place where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy. It is the community pharmacy where the dichotomy of the profession exists&amp;mdash;health professionals who are also retailers.

[[Community pharmacy|Community pharmacies]] usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim]] pharmacists in [[Baghdad]] in 754.&lt;ref name=Hadzovic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2004 (3), pp. 3-9 [8].&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained [[pharmacy technician]]s while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients. Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.

Pharmacies are typically required to have a pharmacist on-duty at all times when open. It is also often a requirement that the owner of a pharmacy must be a registered pharmacist, although this is not the case in all jurisdictions, such that many [[retailer]]s (including [[supermarket]]s and [[Discount retail store|mass merchandiser]]s) now include a pharmacy as a department of their store.

Likewise, many pharmacies are now rather grocery store-like in their design. In addition to medicines and prescriptions, many now sell a diverse arrangement of additional items such as [[cosmetics]], [[shampoo]], [[office supplies]], [[confections]], [[snack foods]], [[durable medical equipment]], [[greeting cards]], and provide [[photo processing]] services.

===Hospital pharmacy===
{{Main article|Hospital pharmacy}}
Pharmacies within [[hospitals]] differ considerably from community pharmacies. Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues whereas pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues.

Because of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and [[patient compliance]] issues (in the hospital and at home) many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.  For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, [[emergency medicine]], toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain  management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.

Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine.  Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN), and other medications given intravenously.  This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of products, and adequate facilities.  Several hospital pharmacies have decided to [[outsource]] high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology, combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety, make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible.

===Clinical pharmacy===
{{Main article|Clinical pharmacy}}
[[Pharmacists]] provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;American College of Clinical Pharmacy. [http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/commentaries/Clinpharmdefnfinal.pdf The definition of clinical pharmacy]. Pharmacotherapy 2008;28(6):816-817.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clinical pharmacist]]s care for patients in all [[health care]] settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside [[hospital]]s and [[clinic]]s. Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with [[physician]]s and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the [[Interdisciplinary team approaches to health care|interdisciplinary approach to patient care]]. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection.

The clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Burke JM, Miller WA, Spencer AP, etal | year = 2008 | title = Clinical pharmacist competencies | url = http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/whitePapers/CliniPharmCompTFfinalDraft.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 806–815 | doi=10.1592/phco.28.6.806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambulatory care pharmacy===
Since the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in office visits to manage chronic disease states.

In the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states such [[North Carolina]] and [[New Mexico]] these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15719585 | year = 2005 | last1 = Knapp | first1 = KK | last2 = Okamoto | first2 = MP | last3 = Black | first3 = BL | title = ASHP survey of ambulatory care pharmacy practice in health systems--2004 | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 274–84 | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification. The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpsweb.org/news/pr_041911.cfm BPS Approves Ambulatory Care Designation; Explores New Specialties in Pain and Palliative Care, Critical Care and Pediatrics ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compounding pharmacy===
{{Main article|Compounding}}
Compounding is the practice of preparing drugs in new forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated [[lollipop]] that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead.

Another form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[Nurse Practitioner]], or [[clinical pharmacist practitioner]]. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy.

Compounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies.

===Consultant pharmacy===
{{Main article|Consultant pharmacist}}
Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. "cognitive services") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in [[nursing home]]s, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, [http://www.ascp.com/about/ascpfactsheet.cfm Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily [[Omnicare]], [[Kindred Healthcare]] and [[PharMerica]]). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.

The main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990.&lt;ref name="Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Strand LM |title=Pharmaceutical care and patient outcomes: notes on what it is we manage |journal=Top Hosp Pharm Manage. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=77–84 |year=1990 |pmid=10128568 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Responsibilities in pharmaceutical care"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hepler CD, Strand LM |title=Opportunities and responsibilities in pharmaceutical care |journal=Am J Hosp Pharm |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=533–43 |year=1990 |pmid=2316538 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet pharmacy===
{{Main article|Online pharmacy}}
[[File:Mail order pharmacy dispensers.jpg|right|thumb|Canisters of pills from a mail order pharmacy.]]
Since about the year 2000, a growing number of [[Internet]] pharmacies have been established worldwide.  Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by [[Bricks and mortar business|brick-and-mortar]] community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door.  The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. Internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound.

While most Internet pharmacies sell [[prescription drug]]s and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.  Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the "inconvenience" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForHealthProfessionals/UCM330640.pdf Protecting Patients from Counterfeit and Other Substandard Drugs/Supply Chain Threats]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain [[controlled substances]] (e.g., [[Vicodin]], generically known as [[hydrocodone]]) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship.  There are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a "patient" s/he has never met.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship.  The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid.  Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship.

Canada is home to dozens of licensed Internet pharmacies, many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers, who pay one of the world's highest drug prices.&lt;ref&gt;London Free Press Regional News Archive, [http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html Canada Internet Pharmacy Merged In $3.8 Million Deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022604/http://canada.regional-news.org/2005-11-canada-internet-pharmacy-merged-in-38-million-deal.html |date=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many consumers in the US and in other countries with high drug costs, have turned to licensed Internet pharmacies in India, Israel and the UK, which often have even lower prices than in Canada.

In the [[United States]], there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from [[Canada]] and other countries, in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers.  There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.

===Veterinary pharmacy===
{{Main article|Veterinary pharmacy}}
Veterinary pharmacies, sometimes called ''animal pharmacies'', may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals.  Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on [[veterinary medicine]], are often very different from those related to people, veterinary pharmacy is often kept separate from regular pharmacies.

===Nuclear pharmacy===
{{Main article|Nuclear pharmacy}}
Nuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients.

===Military pharmacy===
Military pharmacy is an entirely different working environment due to the fact that technicians perform most duties that in a civilian sector would be illegal.  State laws of Technician  patient counseling and medication checking by a pharmacist do not apply.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Pharmacy informatics===
{{Main article|Pharmacy informatics}}
Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science.  Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for [[health informatics|healthcare information technology]] vendor companies.  As a practice area and specialist domain, pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals. Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment and optimization.

===Specialty pharmacy===
{{main article|Specialty pharmacy}}
Specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;NBCH Action Brief: Specialty Pharmacy.

Accessed 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, D. Specialty Pharmacy Continuum [http://www.specialtypharmacycontinuum.com/ViewArticle.aspx?d=Policy&amp;d_id=498&amp;i=August+2012&amp;i_id=878&amp;a_id=21466 ''Carving a Specialty Niche Within the ACO Model."] Volume 1 (Summer Issue). August, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shane|first1=RR|title=Translating health care imperatives and evidence into practice: the "Institute of Pharmacy" report.|journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy|date=15 August 2012|volume=69|issue=16|pages=1373–83|pmid=22855102|doi=10.2146/ajhp120292}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Health Care Cost Drivers: Spotlight on Specialty Drugs|url=http://www.calhealthplans.org/pdfs/CAHPSpecialtyRx_Fact%20Sheet_Final_082914.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the demand for clinicians who can properly manage these specific patient populations, the Specialty Pharmacy Certification Board has developed a new certification exam to certify specialty pharmacists. Along with the 100 question computerized multiple-choice exam, pharmacists must also complete 3,000 hours of specialty pharmacy practice within the past three years as well as 30 hours of specialty pharmacist continuing education within the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spcboard.org/certification/eligibility-requirements/ Specialty Pharmacy Certification Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmaceutical sciences==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2017}}
The pharmaceutical sciences are a group of [[interdisciplinary]] areas of study concerned with the design, action, delivery, and disposition of [[drugs]]. They apply knowledge from [[chemistry]] ([[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]], [[physical chemistry|physical]], [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[analytical chemistry|analytical]]), [[biology]] ([[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[cell biology]], and [[molecular biology]]), [[epidemiology]], [[statistics]], [[chemometrics]], [[Applied mathematics|mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemical engineering]].&lt;ref name="PharmSciIntro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaps.org/intropharmsci/ |title=Introduction to Pharmaceutical Science |author=American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists |accessdate=30 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pharmaceutical sciences are further subdivided into several specific [[Specialty (medicine)|specialties]], with four main branches:

*'''[[Pharmacology]]''': the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on [[human beings]].
**'''[[Pharmacodynamics]]''': the study of the cellular and molecular interactions of drugs with their [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. Simply "What the drug does to the body" &lt;ref&gt;Lees P, Cunningham FM, Elliott J (2004). "Principles of pharmacodynamics and their applications in veterinary pharmacology". J. Vet. Pharmacol. Ther. 27 (6): 397–414. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2885.2004.00620.x. {{PMID|15601436}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''[[Pharmacokinetics]]''': the study of the factors that control the concentration of drug at various sites in the body. Simply "What the body does to the drug"
**'''[[Toxicology|Pharmaceutical toxicology]]''': the study of the harmful or toxic effects of drugs.
**'''[[Pharmacogenomics]]''': the study of the [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]] of characteristic patterns of interaction between drugs and organisms &lt;ref&gt;Ermak, Gennady (2015). Emerging Medical Technologies. World Scientific. {{ISBN|978-981-4675-80-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''[[Pharmaceutical chemistry]]''': the study of [[drug design]] to optimize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of new [[Small molecule|drug molecules]] ([[Medicinal Chemistry]]).
*'''[[Pharmaceutics]]''': the study and design of [[drug formulation]] for optimum [[drug delivery|delivery]], [[Chemical stability|stability]], pharmacokinetics, and [[Compliance (medicine)|patient acceptance]]&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, edited by Gilbert S. Banker, Christopher T. (2002). Modern Pharmaceutics, 1 (5th ed.). Hoboken: Informa Healthcare. {{ISBN|0824744691}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*'''[[Pharmacognosy]]''': the study of medicines derived from natural sources &lt;ref&gt;American Society of Pharmacognosy&lt;/ref&gt;.
As new discoveries advance and extend the pharmaceutical sciences, subspecialties continue to be added to this list. Importantly, as [[knowledge]] advances, boundaries between these specialty areas of pharmaceutical sciences are beginning to blur. Many fundamental concepts are common to all pharmaceutical sciences. These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of [[pharmaceutical research]] and [[drug therapy]].

==Society and culture==

===Etymology&lt;!--Linked from 'Pharmacology' and 'Pharmakos'--&gt;===
The word ''pharmacy'' is derived from [[Old French]] ''farmacie'' "substance, such as a food or in the form of a medicine which has a laxative effect" from [[Medieval Latin]] ''pharmacia'' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''pharmakeia'' ({{lang-grc-gre|φαρμακεία}}) "a medicine", which itself derives from ''pharmakon'' ({{lang|grc|φάρμακον}}), meaning "drug, [[poison]], [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pharmacy Pharmacy (n.) - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|fa/rmakon|φάρμακον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Its earliest attested form in Greek could be the [[Mycenaean Greek|Mycenaean]] {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀔𐀒}}, ''pa-ma-ko'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script and found on the [[Pylos|PY]] Un 1314 tablet; this tablet is also found listed as PY Vn 1314 or PY Sb 1314.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PY 1314 Vn + frr.

Word study tool of ancient languages|title=The Linear B word pa-ma-ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (which is etymologically related to ''[[pharmakos]]'').

===Separation of prescribing and dispensing===
{{main|Separation of prescribing and dispensing}}
Separation of prescribing and dispensing, also called dispensing separation, is a practice in [[medicine]] and pharmacy in which the [[physician]] who provides a [[medical prescription]] is independent from the  [[pharmacist]] who provides the [[prescription drug]].

In the [[Western world]] there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.

In contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces [[conflict of interest in the healthcare industry]], [[unnecessary health care]], and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.

===The future of pharmacy===
In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the [[health care system]]. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.&lt;ref&gt;American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/position/pos029.pdf Evidence of the Economic Benefit of Clinical Pharmacy Services:  1996–2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Medication Therapy Management]] (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients.  Such services include the thorough analysis of all medication ([[prescription medication|prescription]], non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual.  The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;American Pharmacy Student Alliance (APSA){{Unreliable source?|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in [[Australia]] receive remuneration from the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of [[pharmacy education]]. They are also being paid for by the government for [[medicine use review]]s. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or [[clinical pharmacy]] has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.&lt;ref name="Clinical Pharmacy Defined"&gt;American College of Clinical Pharmacy, [http://www.accp.com/clinical_pharmacy.php Clinical Pharmacy Defined]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (Pharm.

In addition, [[consultant pharmacist]]s, who traditionally operated primarily in [[nursing home]]s are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of "senior care pharmacy."&lt;ref&gt;[[American Society of Consultant Pharmacists]], [http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ What is a Senior Care Pharmacist?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023213917/http://www.ascp.com/consumers/what/ |date=23 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives. There is enough evidence to show that integrated pharmacy based initiatives significantly impact adherence for chronic patients. For example, a study published in NIH shows "pharmacy based interventions improved patients' medication adherence rates by 2.1 percent and increased physicians' initiation rates by 38 percent, compared to the control group".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Troyen A.|last2=Dollear|first2=Timothy J.|last3=Hu|first3=Min|last4=Matlin|first4=Olga S.|last5=Shrank|first5=William H.|last6=Choudhry|first6=Niteesh K.|last7=Grambley|first7=William|date=2012-01-01|title=An integrated pharmacy-based program improved medication prescription and adherence rates in diabetes patients|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=31|issue=1|pages=120–129|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0931|issn=1544-5208|pmid=22232102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
The two [[symbol]]s most commonly associated with pharmacy in English-speaking countries are the [[mortar and pestle]] and the ℞ (''[[℞|recipere]]'') character, which is often written as "Rx" in typed text. The [[show globe]] was also used until the early 20th century. Pharmacy organizations often use other symbols, such as the [[Bowl of Hygieia]] which is often used in the [[Netherlands]], [[conical measure]]s, and [[caduceus]]es in their [[logos]]. Other symbols are common in different countries: the green [[Greek cross]] in [[France]], [[Argentina]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[India]], the increasingly rare [[Gaper]] in the [[Netherlands]], and a red stylized letter A in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] (from ''Apotheke'', the [[German language|German]] word for pharmacy, from the same [[Greek language|Greek]] root as the [[English language|English]] word '[[apothecary]]').

'''Phytochemicals''' are chemical compounds produced by plants, generally to help them thrive or thwart competitors, predators, or pathogens. The name comes {{ety|gre|''[[wikt:φυτόν|φυτόν]]'' (phyton)|plant}}. Some phytochemicals have been used as [[poison]]s and others as [[traditional medicine]].

As a term, ''phytochemicals'' is generally used to describe plant compounds that are under research with unestablished effects on health and are not scientifically defined as [[essential nutrients]]. Regulatory agencies governing food labeling in Europe and the United States have provided guidance for industry limiting or preventing [[health claim]]s about phytochemicals on food [[Nutrition facts label|product or nutrition labels]].

Without specific knowledge of their cellular actions or mechanisms, phytochemicals have been used as [[poison]] and in [[traditional medicine]]. For example, [[salicin]], having [[anti-inflammatory]] and [[analgesic|pain-relieving]] properties, was originally extracted from the bark of the white [[willow tree]] and later synthetically produced to become the common, [[over-the-counter]] drug, [[aspirin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, have been specifically discouraged from food labeling in Europe and the United States because there is no evidence for a [[causality|cause-and-effect]] relationship between dietary polyphenols and inhibition or prevention of any disease.&lt;ref name=EFSA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= New Roles for Polyphenols.

Among carotenoids such as the [[tomato]] phytochemical, [[lycopene]], the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] found insufficient evidence for its effects on any of several cancer types, resulting in limited language for how products containing lycopene can be described on labels.&lt;ref name="fda-lycopene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm072760.htm|title=Qualified Health Claims: Letter Regarding "Tomatoes and Prostate, Ovarian, Gastric and Pancreatic Cancers (American Longevity Petition)" (Docket No. 2004Q-0201)|publisher=Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US Food and Drug Administration |author=Schneeman BO|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A converse exists in the case of [[carotenoids]], such as [[lycopene]] present in [[tomato]]es, which may remain stable or increase in content from cooking due to liberation from cellular membranes in the cooked food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11982434 |year=2002 |last1=Dewanto |first1=V |last2=Wu |last3=Adom |last4=Liu |title=Thermal processing enhances the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing total antioxidant activity |volume=50 |issue=10 |pages=3010–4 |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |doi=10.1021/jf0115589 |first2=X |first3=KK |first4=RH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food processing techniques like mechanical processing can also free carotenoids and other phytochemicals from the food matrix, increasing dietary intake.&lt;ref name=palermo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In some cases, processing of food is necessary to remove phytotoxins or antinutrients; for example societies that use [[cassava]] as a staple have traditional practices that involve some processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.), which are necessary to avoid getting sick from [[Glycoside#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]] present in unprocessed cassava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contents: Roots, tubers, plantains and bananas in human nutrition|date=1990|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0207e/T0207E00.htm#Contents}} [http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0207e/T0207E08.htm#Cassava%20toxicity Chapter 7: Cassava toxicity]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pole dance''' combines [[dance]] and [[acrobatics]] centered on a vertical pole. This performance art form takes place not only in [[gentleman's club]]s as [[erotic dance]], but has also recently gained popularity as a mainstream form of fitness, practiced by many enthusiasts in gyms and in dedicated dance studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pole Dancing, Empowerment, and Embodiment|last=Holland|first=Samantha|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur and professional pole dancing competitions are held in countries around the world.

Pole dance requires significant muscular endurance and coordination (as well as sensuality, in exotic dancing). Today, pole performances by exotic dancers range from basic spins and [[striptease]] in more intimate clubs, to athletic moves such as climbs and body inversions in the "stage heavy" clubs of Las Vegas and Miami. Dancer Remy Redd at the King of Diamonds, for example, is famous for flipping herself upside down into a split and hanging from the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cavr2t2vGvk|title=Remy Redd Amazing King Of Diamonds Stripper Pole Dance|first=|last=MiamiNewTimesLLC|date=9 August 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pole dance requires significant strength and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wendiegoneferal.com/?p=603 Pole dance requirements] Wendiegoneferal.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Upper body and [[core strength]] are required to attain proficiency, proper instruction, and rigorous training is necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbur.org/2010/04/02/pole-dance |title=Pole Dancing Is Empowering Performance Art |author=Karen Given |date=2010-04-02 |website= |publisher=wbur.org |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16736937 | work=BBC News | title=Chinese dreamer swaps army for pole-dancing | date=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Since the mid 2000s, promoters of pole dance fitness competitions have been trying to change peoples' perception of pole dance to include pole fitness as a non-sexual form of dance and acrobatics, and are trying to move pole into the Olympics as [[pole sports]].

Pole dance is regarded as a form of exercise&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/pole-dancing-strippers-anymore/story?id=10168196Pole dancing: It's not just for strippers anymore] ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used as both an [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] workout.

== History ==
[[File:StarrKneeHold2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pole dancer performing]]
[[File:Streetpoleplaca.jpg|thumb|Pole dancer using a street pole]]

The use of pole for sports and exercise has been traced back at least eight hundred years to the traditional Indian sport of [[mallakhamb]], which utilizes principles of endurance and strength using a wooden pole, wider in diameter than a modern standard pole. The Chinese pole, originating in India, uses two poles on which men would perform "gravity defying tricks" as they leap from pole to pole, at approximately twenty feet in the air, further information can be seen in the old vintage documentary series of mallakhamb, by yasho purush film on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EICkwimL3AI|title=The Complete Guide of Indian Pole Gymnastics / All About Mallakhamb 1|date=11 May 2010|work=YouTube|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pole dance in America has its roots in the "Little Egypt" traveling sideshows of the 1890s, which featured sensual "Kouta Kouta" or "Hoochie Coochie" belly dances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=The "Kouta-Kouta" and the "Coochie-Coochie - a History and Etymology of the "Hoochie Coochie" Dance|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-kouta-kouta-and-coochie-coochie.html|date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed mostly by [[Ghawazi]] dancers making their first appearance in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stencell|title=Girl Show: Into the Canvas World of Bump and Grind|publisher=ECW Press|pages=5–12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dXIZbIKMUesC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=%22hoochie+coochie%22+%22New+York+Journal#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hoochie%20coochie%22%20%22New%20York%20Journal&amp;f=false|isbn=9781550223712|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an era where women dressed modestly in corsets, the dancers, dressed in short skirts and richly adorned in jewelry, caused quite a stir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholas|title=The Modern Girl: Feminine Modernities, the Body, and Commodities in the 1920s|publisher=University of Toronto Press, 2015|isbn=978-1442626041|pages=126|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dsBtBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=hoochie%20coochie%20dances%2020s&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=hoochie%20coochie%20dances%2020s&amp;f=false|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Michelle|title=Hoochie Coochie: The Lure of the Forbidden Belly Dance in Victorian America|url=http://www.readex.com/blog/hoochie-coochie-lure-forbidden-belly-dance-victorian-america|website=Readex|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, dancers introduced pole by sensually gyrating on the wooden tent poles to attract crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=Kerry|title=Femininity, Feminism and Recreational Pole Dancing|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0874CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT37&amp;lpg=PT37&amp;dq=when+did+hoochie+coochie+dances+use+pole#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20did%20hoochie%20coochie%20dances%20use%20pole&amp;f=false|isbn=9781317649175|date=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the pole dancing moved from tents to bars, and combined with burlesque dance. Since the 1980s, pole dancing has incorporated athletic moves such as climbs, spins, and inversions into [[striptease]] routines, first in Canada and then in the United States.  In the 1990s, pole dancing commenced to be taught as an art by Fawnia Mondey, a Canadian who moved to Las Vegas, US. She created the first pole training video to use in fitness exercises.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Since then, pole dancing classes have become a popular form of recreational and competitive sport, practiced and performed in a variety of sexual, non-sexual, and athletic settings.

K.T. Coates, a famed competitive pole dancer, and the [[International Pole Sports Federation]], are currently promoting a campaign to include competitive pole dance in the Olympics and an application was made to the International Olympic Committee to recognise pole as a sport in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;IPSF: [http://www.polesports.org/news/20-09-16-ioc-application/ IOC Application].  September 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous competitions exist, including the World Pole Sport Championship, U.S. Pole Federation Championship, Pole Art, Miss Pole Dance America, and the International Pole Masters Cup Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polechampionship.com/history/ |title=History – International Pole Championship |publisher=Polechampionship.com |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306142527/http://polechampionship.com/history/ |archive-date=2013-03-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The pole ==

=== Standard pole ===
The standard '''dance pole''' typically consists of a hollow chrome, [[steel]], or [[brass]] pole with a circular cross section, running from floor to ceiling. Affixing at the ceiling gives more stability, but is not always realized, especially at night clubs with higher ceilings or at transportable devices.&lt;ref name="basicinvert78"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Main Types of Dancing Poles - The Complete Dance Pole Guide |url=https://www.basicinvert78.com/main-types-dancing-poles/ |website=Basicinvert78 |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries,&lt;ref name="aerialamy" /&gt; including the United States, the diameter is usually 50&amp;nbsp;mm (2&amp;nbsp;inches), or the now more popular 45&amp;nbsp;mm (1.75 inches), allowing it to be gripped comfortably with one hand. In Asia, the diameter is usually 45&amp;nbsp;mm or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiapolechampionship.com/rules/|title=RULES|website=asia pole championship|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia a 38&amp;nbsp;mm pole is popular.&lt;ref name="aerialamy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Buying a pole: Thickness |url=http://aerialamy.com/blog/2011/12/09/buying-a-pole-thickness/ |website=Aerial Amy |accessdate=14 August 2018 |date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of different dance pole types to suit different performance situations. Dance poles can be permanent or portable, be different sizes, have spinning and/or static modes and they have different coatings or made from different materials.&lt;ref name="basicinvert78" /&gt;

Dance poles that are permanent are fixed to the ceiling supported by a beam located the roof and they are fixated to the floor by different brackets and bearings. The way poles are fixed to the ceiling and the floor varies by which pole brand is purchased. Portable poles are attached to a base or a portable stage and do not need to be attached to the ceiling. These poles can easily be removed, dismantled and transported into cases to different locations.&lt;ref name="basicinvert78" /&gt;

Poles come in a variety of diameters – 50&amp;nbsp;mm, 48&amp;nbsp;mm, 45&amp;nbsp;mm, 42&amp;nbsp;mm, 40&amp;nbsp;mm and 38&amp;nbsp;mm. Diameters normally depend on personal preferences and what the pole will be used for e.g. competitions or studio use.&lt;ref name="aerialamy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Determining What Pole Dancing Pole Size Is Best For You |url=https://polefitnessdancing.com/determining-what-pole-dancing-pole-size-is-best/ |website=The Pole Dance Fitness Oasis |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance poles have two different modes, spinning and static. The spinning mode is when the pole uses ball bearings to spin. This mode can be used to complete more experienced pole moves, make moves easier to complete and to add a more dramatic effect to the move. Most spinning poles can be fixed to static too. The static mode is when the pole cannot rotate and is in a fixed position. The static mode is regularly used when pole dancing is first taught as beginners have little confidence.&lt;ref name="basicinvert78" /&gt;

Poles come in a variety of materials and coatings where each material possesses its own properties, advantages and disadvantages. The materials poles are made of are brass, titanium – gold, stainless steel and chrome.&lt;ref name="basicinvert78" /&gt; The brass and titanium – gold poles are gold in colour and are used to enhance the grip between the pole and the dancer, these poles are normally used by more advanced dancers.  The stainless steel poles aren’t as popular as the other types as they do not have the finest grip however, they are used by dancers who have sensitive skin. The chrome poles are silver in colour and are most popular amongst beginners. The finishes some dance poles may possess are silicone sleeves and powder coatings. Silicone sleeves can provide maximum grip, however, there are safety precautions dancers must take and consider before using silicone sleeves. These measures can include a great amount of clothing to be worn by the dancer and only static moves can be performed. Poles that are coated in powder can provide the best friction and maximum grip for dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dancepolesreviews.com/how-to-choose-the-right-dance-poles/|title=How To Choose The Right Dance Poles {{!}} Dance Poles Reviews|date=2012-02-07|newspaper=Dance Poles Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polemotion.com/pages/pole-dance-pole-buying-guide|title=Pole dance pole buying guide – Pole Motion|website=www.polemotion.com|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products such as chalk, "Dry Hands" or "iTac" may be used to help "stick" to the pole.  Competitions can limit which products performers use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polesports.org/competitions/approved-grips/|title=Grip Products Approved for Pole Sports by the IPSF|website=www.polesports.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Show pole ===
There are now poles available for use in clubs that provide visual effects. These poles are made with clear [[plastic]]s and contain water, glitter, and special reflective materials which stand out when used in conjunction with [[strobe light]]ing, as well as lighting hidden in their base joists. However,  these poles are not favorable to a dancer wanting to achieve better pole tricks, as they bend slightly and have a tendency to create a friction burn when slid down with any sort of speed.

== As exercise ==

Pole dancing has gained popularity as a form of [[exercise]] with increased awareness of the benefits to general strength and [[Physical fitness|fitness]]. These forms of exercise increases core and general body strength by using the body itself as resistance, while toning the body as a whole. A typical pole dance exercise regimen in class begins with [[strength training]], dance-based moves, [[Squat (exercise)|squats]], [[push-up]]s, and [[sit-up (exercise)|sit-ups]] and gradually works its way up to the spins, climbs and inversions which are the métier of the exercise.
Pole dancing is also generally reported by its schools to be empowering for women in terms of building [[self-confidence]], in terms of which its erotic components are still the subject of some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polestory.blogspot.com/2013/12/you-keep-your-rules-ill-keep-my-gluteal.html?fb_action_ids=10152032970783950&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=[240711036091036]&amp;action_type_map=[%22og.likes%22]&amp;action_ref_map=|title=The Pole Story|author=Claire Griffin Sterrett|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2015|date=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists argue that sexualized dancing of this kind cannot be seen as empowering because the choice to participate is not made in freedom from constraining power structures, especially given the performative aspect of many classes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

A growing number of men are incorporating pole dancing into their fitness programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Amanda |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_482709.html |title=Pole dancing for men? |publisher=Straitstimes.com |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia, the UK and the US, dance studios are beginning to offer classes just for men. And in China, 2007's National Pole Dancing competition was won by a man. Dance instructor Zhang Peng, 23, beat a host of women dancers to the top prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20081201-104787.html |title=Watch out, men on poles |publisher=Asiaone.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recreational pole for men and women ==

Since 2003,{{explain|date=November 2018}} pole dancing has been transitioning from an exotic performance to a recreational activity. Pole dancing as a sport differs from pole dancing as a recreation as recreational pole dancing is undertaken mainly for enjoyment rather than fitness. Recreational pole dancing can be seen as empowering to women as it can make women feel positively about themselves. This is because pole dancing builds confidence, power and is a way to express one’s self. When pole dancing is undertaken for enjoyment the idea of an exotic performance specifically for titillation is enhanced. Whilst undertaking pole class women will learn a variety of different ways to use the pole to execute spins, tricks, climbs and hangs. Check all studios' credentials before committing to a pole dance studio. It is common knowledge that as the difficulty of tricks and spins increase, so do the levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donaghue|first=Ngaire|last2=Kurz|first2=Tim|last3=Whitehead|first3=Kally|date=2011-11-01|title=Spinning the pole: A discursive analysis of the websites of recreational pole dancing studios|url=http://fap.sagepub.com/content/21/4/443|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=443–457|doi=10.1177/0959353511424367|issn=0959-3535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Kally|last2=Kurz|first2=Tim|date=2009-05-01|title='Empowerment' and the Pole: A Discursive Investigation of the Reinvention of Pole Dancing as a Recreational Activity|url=http://fap.sagepub.com/content/19/2/224|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=224–244|doi=10.1177/0959353509102218|issn=0959-3535|hdl=10871/11306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitions ==

Pole dance competitions began in the United States with the Deja Vu chain of strip clubs in 1991 with an event called the Po'Lympics which was held annually throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Showgirls Magazine December 1998 page 58&lt;/ref&gt; These competitions led to the creation of numerous other competitions that followed, both in the strip club industry and fitness.

A wide range of amateur and professional competitions are held in many countries around the world. They are strictly non-nude and focus on pole dance as an athletic and artistic form of dance and fitness. The first "Miss Pole Dance World" competition was held in November 2005 in Amsterdam and [[Elena Gibson]] from the UK won the championship.  The following day Elena was disqualified by the organizer John Benner amongst much controversy and the title went to the runner up Reiko Suemune from [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A group of advocates even pushed for pole dance to be represented as a test event in the 2012 London Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2010/02/23/2010-02-23_pole_dancing_could_be_recognized_as_a_sport_and_headed_to_the_olympics_.html |title=Pole dancing could be recognized as a sport and headed to the Olympics |author=Rosemary Black |date=2010-02-23 |website= |publisher=nydailynews.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhsjacket.com/node/420 |title=Recognize Pole Dancing as New Olympic Sport |publisher=Bhsjacket.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since this is a relatively new trend, there is no standardized scoring for competitions and technique descriptions vary among clubs in different regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?id=4935278 |title=Get ready sports fans, pole dancers eye Olympics |publisher=ESPN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story utilized the hashtag "yes a stripper" in support of the origins of pole dance. On the social media platform Instagram, some pole dancers try to differentiate between their exercise method, and the origin of the method, by using "not a stripper" as a hashtag. The hashtag can be viewed as derogatory, and pole dancing strippers utilize "yes a stripper" as a defense against the denigration of their style of dance, which is created and used in strip clubs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7055">{{main article | Reproductive rights}}'''Pregnant patients rights''' refers to the choices and legal rights available to a mother experiencing pregnancy or childbirth. Specifically those under medical care within a medical establishment or those under the care of a medical professional regardless of location ( under care of paramedics at home, family doctor via phone, etc. ).

There are many debates that arise from pregnancy rights, ranging from whether or not [[Assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatments]] are ‘right’ or whether using [[surrogate mothers]] is wrong. It comes down to the mother’s right. As a woman, there are more challenges than just the fundamentals of the decisions surrounding their pregnancy. [[Maternity leave]], parental leave and the time allotted for these leaves varies from company to company.&lt;ref name=babycenter&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.babycenter.ca/pregnancy/work/maternityrights/ | title=Your pregnancy rights | year=2012 | accessdate=May 11, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) gathered in [[Cairo]] in September 1994 to discuss and “formulate a consensus position on population and development for the next 20 years”.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2137493 | title=The Cairo conference on population and development: A new paradigm?. | author=McIntosh, C. A., &amp; Finkle, J. L. | journal=Population and Development Review | year=1995 | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=223–260 | doi=10.2307/2137493}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the other goals was to make education and medical services available to women while they are pregnant, and when the time comes, have delivery options available. A main concern has always been [[postnatal]] care; people think that the hardest part is the birth of the child but there are so many additional concerns once the child is born and brought into this world. Complications both prior to pregnancy, during delivery, and after delivery are a potential concern in all births, the ICPD talked about enhancing the available support for all women.&lt;ref name=McIntosh/&gt; Pregnancy rights throughout the world are not going to be the same in every single place but the ICPD is aiming to eliminate discrimination during pregnancy and make all pregnant patients’ rights available to everyone.

Nurses and patients sometimes run into troubles because their opinions will often vary in what they think should be done in terms of termination or pre/post natal care.&lt;ref name=kane&gt;{{cite journal | title=Conscientious objection to termination of pregnancy: the competing rights of patients and nurses | author=Kane, R. | journal=Journal of Nursing Management | year=2009 | volume=17 | issue=7 | pages=907–912 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2834.2008.00888.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Kane, 2009 states “The NMC code of professional conduct states that: ‘you must make the care of people your first concern”’ enforcing that the nurses opinions really should be kept to themselves so as to not influence the decision of the patients.

== Rights in Australia ==
In Australia pregnant women have the same rights as any other member of society. However, they do have some extra rights when it comes to their rights in the workforce.

=== Pregnant women' rights in the workforce ===
Under the Fair Work Act 2009 section &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2009A00028|title = Federal Register of Legislation|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; pregnant women are still entitled to the same amount of sick leave as any other individual as being pregnant does not classify as an illness. A Pregnant woman however is able to take unpaid leave for "special maternity leave", this is maternity leave that she can take if she has a pregnancy related illness or the pregnancy ends any time after the first trimester due to a miscarriage, a stillbirth or a termination.

'''Safe jobs''' is when the women moves to a safer job while being because her original job is dangerous to her and the baby. She will need to provide evidence that she can still work but unable to perform the original tasks and how long she shouldn't work in her job for. An example for proving these would be with a medical certificate. In the circumstances where there is no safer jobs to offer the women can take no safe jobs leave. The employee takes paid leave if she is entitled to unpaid parental leave and unpaid leave if she is not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Discrimination''' in the workforce against pregnant women is illegal. This means that she can not be fired, lose hours, demoted and treated differently because of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A01186|title = SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) ACT 2003 No. 103, 2003|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminating the pregnancy ==
In Australia the laws on termination change between each state and territory. In Western Australia termination is considered lawful up until 20 weeks of pregnancy. A termination after 20 weeks can only be undertaken if there is two medical practitioners from a panel of six that agree that the women or the fetus has or will have a serious medical condition if the pregnancy continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp9899/99rp01|title = Abortion Law in Australia|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immunisation ==
During pregnancy, women have the right to seek getting immunised with the influenza vaccine "Flu Shot" and the adult dTpa vaccine (pertussis). Both of these vaccines are recommended however it is up to the individual whether or not to go ahead with the vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/pregnant-women|title = Immunise Australia Program|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:S S Hope.jpg|thumb|The Hospital ship SS Hope]]
'''Project HOPE''' ('''H'''ealth '''O'''pportunities for '''P'''eople '''E'''verywhere) is an international health care organization founded in the United States in 1958.  Its most visible project was the [[SS Hope|SS ''HOPE'']], the first peacetime [[hospital ship]] (converted from the [[USS Consolation (AH-15)|USS ''Consolation'' (AH-15)]]).  The SS ''HOPE'' was retired in 1974, after sailing to [[Indonesia]], [[South Vietnam]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guinea]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Colombia]], Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]), [[Tunisia]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Brazil]].  On these voyages doctors, nurses, and technical staff provided medical care and training to people in each country visited.

The SS ''HOPE'' was not replaced, and emphasis switched entirely to land-based operations. Today there are organizations in [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], in addition to the original organization in the [[United States]]. 
Project HOPE helps different developing countries in efforts to eradicate infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. They also help educate parents on how to prevent and treat diseases for their children and themselves, and also train health professionals. 
Project HOPE also sets up village health banks, which give small loans to women so they can improve their health and family's health. The village health banks also educate women on health.

Project HOPE is headquartered at [[Carter Hall (Millwood, Virginia)|Carter Hall]] in [[Millwood, Virginia]].

==Mission==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Project HOPE works to achieve sustainable advances in health care around the world by implementing health education programs and providing humanitarian assistance in areas of need. Project HOPE is unique among international organizations in that we have always worked across the health spectrum in a wide variety of settings, from the family and community levels to the tertiary care level, training traditional birth attendants and community health volunteers where resources are limited and cardiac surgeons and biomedical engineers where technology is appropriate. Project HOPE addresses infectious diseases, health professional education, women's and children's health, humanitarian assistance, and the need for health systems and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projecthope.org/site/PageServer?pagename=our_work Project HOPE: Our Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211195607/http://www.projecthope.org/site/PageServer?pagename=our_work |date=2010-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the establishment of the Manx Health Service in 1948 it was a voluntary hospital.  Medical care was provided, apart from specialist services, by the local general practitioners and paid for by a beddage fund.  At that time it had a modern and well-equipped operating theatre and in the year to October 1947, 203 operations were performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gellion |first1=Donald |title=Birth of a Service |date=2008 |location=Isle of Man |url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/nhs2008/ch07.htm |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristofer is working as a [[security guard]]. He was fired from the [[freight ship]] on which he worked when he was caught [[smuggling]] [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. Faced with money problems, he is tempted to accept the help of his friend, Steingrimur, who manages to pull some strings to get his old job back aboard the ''MV Dettifoss''. He decides to take his chances one last time on a tour to [[Rotterdam]] to bring alcohol back on the return journey to Iceland. While in Rotterdam, his brother-in-law Arnor steals the money intended for the alcohol purchase, and buys [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] with it. The alcohol sellers force Kristofer to take part in a violent art theft; he escapes in the confusion during a shootout with the police.

Meanwhile, back in Iceland, Kristofer's wife Iris is threatened by three men, who trash her flat and then her place of work. She accepts Steingrimur's offer to stay with him until Kristofer returns. Steingrimur, with whom she was once involved, tries to seduce her, and as she tries to escape, he knocks her unconscious and, thinking that he has killed her, attempts to dispose of her body.

The ''Detttifoss'' returns. Customs search the vessel, but no contraband is found. Arnor believes that Kristofer has thrown the ecstasy and the alcohol overboard and attempts to escape from the gangsters expecting the consignment. Kristofer has planted the ecstasy in the car of the captain of the ''Dettifoss'', and sets up the gangsters to be intercepted at the captain's house. Iris survived Steingrimur's attack, and Kristofer locates her just as Steingrimur is attempting to bury her in concrete at the construction site he works at. Out at sea, Kristofer's friends locate the alcohol.

'''Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center''' is a 617-bed acute care hospital located on Woodland Street in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. The hospital was established in 1897 by the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambery|Sisters of Saint Joseph of Chambéry]].&lt;ref name=glance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintfranciscare.com/Saint_Francis_at_a_Glance/Saint_Francis_at_a_Glance.aspx|title=Saint Francis at a Glance|publisher=Saint Francis Care|accessdate=2008-07-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511091731/http://www.saintfranciscare.com/Saint_Francis_at_a_Glance/Saint_Francis_at_a_Glance.aspx|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 617 beds and 65 bassinets, it is the largest Catholic hospital in [[New England]].&lt;ref name="nyt112298"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E5D71430F931A15752C1A96E958260|title= The View From/St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford; How Art, and an Artist, Join in the Healing Process|last=Ryan|first=Bill|date=22 November 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Francis has been affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital since 1990. This was the first recorded instance of collaboration between a Catholic hospital and a Jewish hospital in United States.&lt;ref name=glance/&gt; The two institutions formalized the corporate merger in 1995. In addition, the hospital maintains affiliations with [[St. Mary's Hospital (Waterbury)|Saint Mary's Hospital]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], which is independently licensed. Saint Francis, a regional referral center, has major clinical concentrations in [[cardiology]], [[oncology]], [[orthopedics]], women's services and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].

In 2008, they broke ground on the ten story addition, the John T. O'Connell Tower. Opened in March 2011, this addition included 19 replacement operating rooms, 72 replacement medical/surgical patient beds, and a [[Helipad]] on the roof of the building. It includes six orthopedic operating rooms and sixty-three replacement inpatient orthopedic beds for the Connecticut Joint Replacement Institute. Also featuring an enlarged emergency department, expanding the treatment area from forty-nine to sixty-eight treatment bays and increasing space for ambulances from six to ten parking spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stfranciscare.org/body.aspx?id=7563 |title=SAINT FRANCIS BREAKS GROUND FOR JOHN T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Sulfur water''' (or '''sulphur water''') is a condition where the running water contains a high amount of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas that escapes into the air when the plumbing line is opened, giving a distinct "rotten egg" smell.  

==Cause and treatment==
The condition indicates a high level of [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] in the water supply. This may be due to the use of well water, poorly treated city water, or water heater contamination.

Various methods exist to treat sulfur in water. These methods include
# Use of a [[Carbon_filtering|Carbon Filter]] (useful for very small amounts of hydrogen sulfide)
# Filtering the water through a canister of manganese oxide coated [[Greensand]]
# [[Water_aeration|Aeration]] of the water
# Treating the water with [[Water_chlorination|chlorine]] (can be used to treat large amounts of hydrogen sulfide)

==Health==
Bathing in water high in sulfur or other minerals for its presumed health benefits is known as [[balneotherapy]].

===Concerns===
According to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drinking water with high levels of sulfate can cause diarrhea, especially in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cervin|first1=Michael|title=Sulfur Springs: To Soak or not to Soak?|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/08/sulfur-springs-to-soak-or-not-to-soak/|accessdate=24 February 2015|agency=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|17th–18th centuries||Hospital care is provided by the [[Dutch East India Company]], colonial governments, and Christian missions. Traditional healers, European trained doctors, missionaries, and other health providers offer a mix of services.&lt;ref name="The health and health system of South Africa: historical  roots of current public health challenges"&gt;{{cite web|title=The health and health system of South Africa: historical  roots of current public health challenges|url=http://depts.washington.edu/sphnet/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Coovadia.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|19th century||Medically trained doctors become mainstream. Indigenous and traditional healers are marginalized. Orthodox medicine becomes a professional practice with training of nurses and doctors. By mid-century, hospitals are present in most major centers. Epidemics of [[syphilis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[bubonic plague]], [[yellow fever]], [[typhus]], [[cholera]], soil parasites, and malnutrition hit South Africa.&lt;ref name="The health and health system of South Africa: historical  roots of current public health challenges" /&gt;
|-
|1910–1948||The [[Union of South Africa]] is established. Health services are fragmented among the four provinces. Poor urban working and living conditions with diseases are caused by overcrowding, poor sanitation and diets, stress, and social disintegration follow consolidation of racial segregation. Syphilis, tuberculosis, malaria and venereal diseases continue to spread.&lt;ref name="The health and health system of South Africa: historical  roots of current public health challenges" /&gt;
|-
|1948–1994||[[Apartheid]] years. Non-communicable diseases rise in white people and poverty-related diseases persist in black people. Tuberculosis rates and deaths are much higher in black and coloured populations than among whites. Health services in [[bantustan]]s are systematically underfunded.&lt;ref name="The health and health system of South Africa: historical  roots of current public health challenges" /&gt;
|-
|1994–present||Post-apartheid democracy. Today, the public system serves the vast majority of the population, but it still remains underfunded and understaffed. The wealthiest 20% of the population use the private system and are far better served.&lt;ref name="The health and health system of South Africa: historical  roots of current public health challenges" /&gt; Diseases of poverty, non-communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS comprise a huge burden for South Africa.

Penguin, {{ISBN|978-1-59257-327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years of its launch, Today had become the largest selling over-the-counter female contraceptive in the United States, and was soon rolled out into other markets.&lt;ref name="day1985"&gt;Day, Kathleen (January 22, 1985).

==History==

The Today sponge dates back to 1976 when it was created by Bruce Ward Vorhauer.&lt;ref name="emmons1993"&gt;Emmons, Steve (February 15, 1993). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/2141723.html?dids=2141723:2141723&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+15%2C+1993&amp;author=Emmons%2C+Steve&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=The+final+fall&amp;pqatl=google The final fall.] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Vorhauer struggled for seven years to get the device approved and on the market. Following FDA approval,&lt;ref name="fda1983"&gt;FDA's approval of the Today contraceptive sponge:
hearing before a subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations, House of Representatives, Ninety-eighth Congress, first session, July 13, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; the brand was rolled out in June 1983.&lt;ref name="granelli1983"&gt;Granelli, James S.

''Adv Contracept.'' 1987 Jun;3(2):125-31. {{PMID|2820207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Today sponge also broke the barrier in several markets for [[advertising]] contraceptive devices. 

The Today sponge "was manufactured until 1995, when FDA imposed new manufacturing standards."&lt;ref name="Schuiling2006"&gt;Schuiling, Kerri Durnell and Likis, Frances E. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kuxgckq7HeQC&amp;pg=PA187] Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, {{ISBN|978-0-7637-4717-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product had several setbacks while marketed, including a link to [[toxic shock syndrome]].&lt;ref name="ap1983"&gt;[[Associated Press]] (December 7, 1983).

Almost the entire content of the facility was moved to the [[Whitehall-Robbins]] facility in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]] from its original California home.  The sponge was removed from the U.S. market in 1994 after problems were found at the facility related to the [[deionized water]] system.  The water system, which was originally sized for much larger production, could not produce the small amounts of deionized water required for this one product and became repeatedly contaminated. Based on slumping sales and to avoid any further FDA issues, Wyeth stopped selling the sponge rather than move production or modify its plant.  

In 1998, Allendale Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to the Today sponge and it was once again available.&lt;ref name="rosenthal2003"&gt;Rosenthal MS (2003). ''The Gynecological Sourcebook,'' p. 144. [[McGraw-Hill]], {{ISBN|978-0-07-140279-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; New FDA standards for manufacturing and record-keeping forced repeated delays, but the Today sponge was finally re-introduced in Canada in March 2003, and in the U.S. in September 2005.  In January 2007, Allendale Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Synova Healthcare, Inc.&lt;ref name="george2007"&gt;{{cite news |last=George |first=John |title=Synova Healthcare finds company worthy of purchase |work=Philadelphia Business Journal |date=2007-01-16 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2007/01/15/daily9.html |accessdate=2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007 Synova filed for bankruptcy reorganization;&lt;ref name="SYNOVA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Synova Healthcare, maker of contraceptive sponge filed for bankruptcy |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2007/12/17/daily28.html | date=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 the manufacturing rights to the Today sponge were purchased by [[Alvogen]]. In mid May 2009, Mayer Laboratories, Inc. the distributor of the Today Vaginal Contraceptive Sponge for the US, Canada and the EU, announced the Today Sponge had been re-launched in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite web |title=Today Sponge Returns To Store Shelves |work=Mayer Laboratories, Inc. |year=2009 |url=http://www.todaysponge.com/email-consumer |accessdate=2009-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

A 1995 ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode, "[[The Sponge]]", revolved around Elaine's attempts to procure her favorite form of birth control, the discontinued Today sponge, and her rationing them based on whether a potential partner was "sponge-worthy".&lt;ref name="lavery2006"&gt;Lavery, David and Sara Lewis Dunne (2006). ''Seinfeld, master of its domain: revisiting television's greatest sitcom'', p. 247. Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1803-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later revisited in the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] when the pharmacist testifies against Elaine for buying a case of sponges.

In India, each year, approx. 220,000 deaths are reported due to Tuberculosis. Between 2006 and 2014, the disease cost Indian economy USD 340 billion.

India bears a disproportionately large burden of the world's tuberculosis rates, as it continues to be the biggest health problem in India. It remains one of the largest on India's [[health]] and wellness scale. India is the highest TB burden country with '''[[World Health Organization]]''' (WHO) statistics for 2011 giving an estimated incidence figure of 2.2 million cases of TB for India out of a global incidence of 9.6 million cases.&lt;ref&gt;TB Statistics for India.

This issue of [[drug-resistant]] TB began with [[MDR-TB]], and moved on to [[XDR-TB]]. Gradually, the most dangerous form has situated itself in India as TDR-TB.

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"Within India, the Journal—using government data obtained through the '''[[Right to Information Act]]'''—has reported that India's drug-resistance rate is likely much higher than the 2% to 3% of TB cases reported to the [[WHO]]"''&lt;ref name="Anand &amp; McKay 2012"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;. In India, TB is responsible for the death of every third AIDS patient.

Tuberculosis is one of India's major public health problems. According to WHO estimates, India has the world's largest tuberculosis epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. Global tuberculosis control. WHO report. WHO/HTM/TB/2006.362. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many research studies have shown the effects and concerns revolving around TDR-TB, especially in India; where social and economic positions are still in progression. In Zarir Udwadia’s report originated from the [[Hinduja Hospital]] in [[Mumbai]], India explicitly discusses the drug-resistant effects and results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech-2012-201640 |pmid=23155059 |title=Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) in India: Every dark cloud has a silver lining |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=471–472 |year=2013 |last1=Udwadia |first1=Zarir |last2=Vendoti |first2=Deepesh }}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment was conducted in January, 2012 on four patients to test how accurate the “new category” of TDR-TB is. These patients were given all the first-line drugs and second-line drugs that usually are prescribed to treat TB, and as a result were resistant to all. As a response, the government of India had stayed in denial, but [[WHO]] took it as a more serious matter and decided that although the patterns of drug-resistance were evident, they cannot rely on just that to create a new category of TDR-TB.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Paul Nunn, coordinator of WHO's STOP TB department in Geneva, described the cases as “a wake up call for countries to accelerate provision of proper care, particularly for multi drug-resistant patients”''.&lt;ref name=fb&gt;https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1680306518662783&amp;id=100000503523412{{full|date=August 2018}}{{MEDRS|date=August 2018}}{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Symptoms==
The bacterium that causes TB is called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Inactive tuberculosis means that one can even unconsciously and unknowingly acquire the bacteria for tuberculosis within them but not even know about it because it is ''inactive''. Whereas, [[active tuberculosis]] is the start of the bacteria developing, and the signs and symptoms begin to be visible. This is when tuberculosis is ''active'' within you, and is a serious issue leading to even more serious results. Although the TB bacteria can infect any organ (e.g., kidney, lymph nodes, bones, joints) in the body, the disease commonly occurs in the lungs.&lt;ref name="C-Health"/&gt; Around 80% of all TB cases are related to pulmonary or lung.

Common symptoms include:
*[[coughing]] that lasts longer than 3 weeks with green, yellow, or [[bloody sputum]]
*[[weight loss]]
*[[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]
*[[fever]]
*[[night sweats]]
*[[chills]]
*[[chest pain]]
*[[shortness of breath]]
*[[loss of appetite]]

==Causes==
There is a specific [[bacterium]] that evolves inside the body to result in tuberculosis, known as '''[[mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'''. This bacterium is only spread throughout the body when a person has an active TB infection. One of many causes of acquiring TB is living a life with a weak [[immune system]]; everything becomes fragile, and an easy target. That is why babies, children and senior adults have a higher risk of adapting TB.&lt;ref name="C-Health"/&gt; The bacterium spreads in the [[air sacs]], and passes off into the [[lungs]], resulting in an infected immune system.

In addition, coughing, sneezing, and even talking to someone can release the mycobacterium into the air, consequently affecting the people breathing this air. It has been stated that your chances of becoming infected are higher if you come from – or travel to – certain countries where TB is common, and where there is a big proportion of homeless people.&lt;ref name="C-Health"/&gt; India, being the largest country with diagnosed patients, falls under this cause because it stands recognized as consuming a higher chance of gaining TB.

Those listed are all the bodily and personal causes of acquiring TB, but tuberculosis in India is rich in its high rates because of the [[pollution]] dispersed throughout the country. Pollution causes many effects in the air the people breathe there, and since TB can be gained through air, the chances of TB remain high and in a consistent movement going uphill for India.

Another major cause for the growth of TB in India has to do with it currently still standing as a [[developing country]]. Because its economy is still developing, the citizens are still fighting for their rights, and the structure of the country lies in poor evidence that it is not fit as other countries still. TB rises high in India because of the majority of people not being able to afford the treatment drugs prescribed to diagnosed patients. ''“At present, only the 1.5 million patients already under the Indian government's care get free treatments for regular TB. That leaves patients who seek treatment in India's growing private sector to buy drugs for themselves, and most struggle to do that, government officials say.”''&lt;ref name="Anand &amp; McKay 2012"/&gt; Consequently, high priced treatment drugs and the struggles of “poor patients” also brawl through the poor treatment they receive in response to acquiring TB. ''“It is estimated that just 16% of patients with drug-resistant TB are receiving appropriate treatment”''.&lt;ref name=Rowland2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2012.9797 |title=Totally drug-resistant TB emerges in India |journal=Nature |year=2012 |last1=Rowland |first1=Katherine }}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this huge problem, India has instated a new program to try to provide free drugs to all those infected in the country.&lt;ref name="Anand &amp; McKay 2012"/&gt; Lastly, as high pricing is linked to the economic standings of India, which is linked to poor treatment, it all underlines the lack of education and background information practitioners and professionals hold for prescribing drugs, or those private [[therapy]] sessions. A study conducted in Mumbai by Udwadia, Amale, Ajbani, and Rodrigues, showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cid/cir889 |pmid=22190562 |title=Totally Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in India |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=579–581 |year=2011 |last1=Udwadia |first1=Z. F |last2=Amale |first2=R. A |last3=Ajbani |first3=K. K |last4=Rodrigues |first4=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diagnosis'''

=== Testing for pulmonary TB ===
Any person who has signs and symptoms suggestive of TB including a cough for more than 2 weeks, significant weight loss, haemoptysis (coughing blood) etc. and any abnormality in a chest radiograph should be evaluated to find out if they have TB.

Children with a persistent fever and/or cough for more than 2 weeks, children who have a loss of weight or no weight gain, and/or children who are household contacts of people who have already been diagnosed as having pulmonary TB must be evaluated for TB.

=== Screening for TB ===
People living with HIV (PLHIV), people who are malnourished, who have diabetes or cancer, and people on steroid therapy should be regularly screened for signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. Enhanced case finding should be undertaken in certain “high risk” populations such as healthcare workers, prisoners, slum dwellers. There should also be enhanced case finding in certain occupational groups such as mineworkers, as in some countries such as South Africa, there is known to be a high level of TB among miners.Enhanced case finding means having a high level of suspicion for TB in all encounters. Then excluding TB (or indeed identifying TB) using a combination of clinical queries, radiographic and microbiologic testing.

There are a number of diagnostic TB tests currently available.

=== Microbiological confirmation on sputum ===
All patients who have presumptive (that is are presumed to have) TB and who are capable of producing sputum, should undergo a sputum test for rapid microbiological diagnosis of TB. These are  two type of test 1) by LJ (solid) Method 2) MGIT (liquid) Method

=== Chest X-ray as a screening tool ===
Where available chest X-ray should be used as a screening tool.

=== Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CB NAAT) ===
The CB NAAT is known as the GeneXpert in most countries other than India. This is the preferred first diagnostic test in children and people with TB and HIV co-infection.

== Sputum Samples ==
Sputum tests are very important in diagnosing TB, so paying attention to the detail of collecting a good sputum sample is very important. A number of studies have looked at this, and the general view is that two samples are almost as good as three samples.

Binocular microscopes are used for testing TB samples and the diagnosis of TB in India

Methods of testing using sputum samples include sputum smear microscopy (both conventional and fluorescent), culture (on solid or liquid media) commercial line probe asssay (LPA) or CB-NAAT.  With the advent of CB_NAAT the sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnosis from sputum, has increased to approximately the levels seen in solid-media sputum culture, but of course the time scales, at just a few hours, are very much shorter with CB-NAAT.

== RNTCP Laboratory Network ==
The RNTCP (Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) has established a network of laboratories where TB tests can be done to diagnose people who have TB. There are also tests that can be done to determine whether a person has drug resistant TB.

The laboratory system comprises National Reference Laboratories (NRLs), state level Intermediate Reference Laboratories (IRLs), Culture &amp; Drug Susceptibility Testing (C &amp; DST) laboratories and Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs). Some of Private lab also Accredited for Culture &amp; Drug Susceptibility Testing for M.tuberculosis (I.e Microcare Laboratory &amp; tuberculosis Research Centre, Surat)

==Treatment==
India has a large burden of the world's TB, one that this developing country can ill afford, with an estimated economic loss of US $43 billion and 100 million  lost annually directly due to this disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/thoraxjnl-2012-201663 |pmid=22427352 |title=MDR, XDR, TDR tuberculosis: Ominous progression |journal=Thorax |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=286–288 |year=2012 |last1=Udwadia |first1=Zarir F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Therapy|Treatment]] in India is on the rise just as the disease itself is on the rise. To prevent spreading TB, it's important to get treatment quickly and to follow it through to completion by your doctor. This can stop transmission of the bacteria and the appearance of [[antibiotic-resistant]] [[strain (biology)|strains]]. It is a knowingly fact that bacterial [[infections]] require [[antibiotics]] for treatment and prevention, thus, commonly you will see that patients diagnosed with tuberculosis have certain pills and antibiotics carried around with them. The antibiotics most commonly used include [[isoniazid]], [[rifampin]], [[pyrazinamide]], and [[ethambutol]]. It is crucial to take your medication as instructed by your doctor, and for the full course of the treatment (months or years). This helps to ward off types of TB [[bacteria]] that are antibiotic-resistant, which take longer and are more difficult to treat.&lt;ref name="C-Health"/&gt; In India’s case, the particular type of TB infections are majority resistant to regular antibiotic treatment (MDR-TB, XDR-TB, TDR-TB), therefore, not one or two medications will help, rather a combination of different medications must be taken for over a course of 18–24 months, depending on how deep the infection is. Since the 1960s, two drugs — [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampicin]] — have been the standard TB treatment.&lt;ref name=Rowland2012/&gt; In addition to antibiotics, a [[vaccine]] is available to limit the spread of bacteria after TB infection. The vaccine is generally used in countries or communities where the risk of TB infection is greater than 1% each year,&lt;ref name="C-Health"/&gt; thus, the country of India; whose TB infection rate is at a peak (world’s third highest TB infected country), and is consistently growing, and giving 20% of the world’s diagnosed patients a home.&lt;ref name=Rowland2012/&gt; At present the anti TB treatment offered in public and private sector in India is not satisfactory and needs to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Mishra G, Mulani J. Tuberculosis Prescription Practices In Private And Public Sector In India. NJIRM. 2013; 4(2): 71-78.Available online at http://www.scopemed.org/?mno=36915. Accessed on 6/5/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Today India's TB control program needs to update itself with the international TB guidelines as well as provide an optimal anti TB treatment to the patients enrolled under it or it will land up being another factor in the genesis of drug resistant tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.20529/IJME.2014.013 |pmid=24509111 |title=XDR-TB: An outcome of programmatic management of TB in India |journal=Indian Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=47–52 |year=2014 |last1=Mishra |first1=Gyanshankar |last2=Ghorpade |first2=S. V |last3=Mulani |first3=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government’s Revised National TB Control Programme ('''[[RNTCP]]''') started in India during 1997. The program uses the WHO recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short Course ('''[[DOTS]]''') strategy to develop ideas and data on TB treatment. This group’s initial objective is to achieve and maintain a TB treatment success rate of at least 85% in India among new patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scidev.net/tb/facts{{full|date=August 2018}}{{dead link|date=August 2018}}{{rs|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''“In 2010 the RNTCP made a major policy decision that it would change focus and adopt the concept of Universal Access to quality diagnosis and TB treatment for all TB patients”''.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; By doing so, they extend out a helping hand to all people diagnosed with TB, and in addition, provide better quality services and improve on therapy for these patients.

Treatment recommendations from Udwadia, et al. suggest that patients with TDR-TB only be treated ''“within the confines of government sanctioned DOTS-Plus Programs to prevent the emergence of this untreatable form of tuberculosis”''.&lt;ref name=Rowland2012/&gt; As this confirming result of hypothesis is at a conclusion by Udawadai, et al., it is given that the new Indian government program will insist on providing drugs free of charge to TB patients of India, for the first time ever.&lt;ref name="Anand &amp; McKay 2012"/&gt;

==Tuberculosis Association of  India==
The Tuberculosis Association of India is a voluntary organization. It was set up in February,  1939. It is also affiliated to the Govt. of India &amp; is working with TB Delhi center.&lt;ref&gt;http://tbassnindia.org/home.html&lt;/ref&gt;
