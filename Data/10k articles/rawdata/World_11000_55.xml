The '''2017 [[Quidditch Premier League]] season''' was the league's first, and was contested by eight teams over the course of the 2017 summer. The eight teams were split into two divisions, with the North Division composed of the Northern Watch, Yorkshire Roses, East Midlands Archers, and West Midlands Revolution, and the South Division composed of the London Monarchs, Southeast Knights, Southwest Broadside, and Eastern Mermaids.

During the regular season, each division held three 'fixtures', which saw each team in that division attend and participate in round robin games. In total, teams played 12 games each during the regular season, with a total of 36 games played in total. Based on the results of those fixtures, the teams were seeded for the QPL Championship, which all eight qualified for. The championship was decided with a series of double-elimination matches, with eliminated teams going on to contest the lower places of the standings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="964">The '''Abrincatui''' were a [[Gaul|Gallic]] tribe ([[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] iv. 18), not mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]], whose frontier was near the [[Curiosolites]]. Their town [[Ingena (Gaul)|Ingena]], called ''Abrincatae'' in the [[Notitia dignitatum]], has given its name to the modern [[Avranches]]; and their territory would probably correspond to the division of [[Avranchin]]. The Abrincatui became a client tribe of the Venelli until the Roman occupation in BC 49, when they were separated.&lt;ref name="Mountain1998"&gt;{{citation|author=Harry Mountain|title=The Celtic Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTbc1GIAwcIC&amp;pg=PA115|year=1998|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-58112-890-1|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Air Dabia''' was a short-lived [[The Gambia|Gambian]] airline which flew between 1996 and 1998; it had a three-ship fleet (one [[Boeing 747]], notable as being the airframe involved in the [[United Airlines Flight 811]] decompression incident, and two [[Boeing 727]] aircraft).  It was run by alleged fraudster [[Foutanga Babani Sissoko]], whose conspicuous personal wealth had murky origins. In its short period of operation, there were allegations from numerous employees of excessive hours, improper rest provisions for crews (being expected to sleep on aircraft between trips) and pay discrepancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Baba Chronicles |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/the-baba-chronicles-6360429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=The Baba Chronicles Part 2 | url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/the-baba-chronicles-part-2-6360321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Sissoko was allegedly involved in bank fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-42878021|title=The playboy who got away with $242m|date=16 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Baba Chronicles |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/the-baba-chronicles-6360429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=The Baba Chronicles Part 2 | url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/the-baba-chronicles-part-2-6360321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It transported pilgrims from [[Mali]] to [[Mecca]], and Malian refugees from [[Brazzaville]].

The 747, C5-FBS, was abandoned at [[Plattsburgh International Airport]] and scrapped in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planepictures.net/netshow.php?id=5451 |title=Photo Air Dab}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Airfleets.net"&gt;{{cite web |title=Boeing 747 - MSN 19875 - C5-FBS |url=https://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b747-19875.htm |website=airfleets.net |accessdate=22 July 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apostolic Administration of Southern Albania''' ({{lang-sq|Administratura Apostolike e Shqiperisë së Jugut}}, {{lang-la|Administratio Apostolica Albaniae Meridionalis}}, [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Albania Meridionale'') is an [[apostolic administration]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Albania]], covering the southern regions of the country. It has jurisdiction over all Catholics on its territory, both of [[Latin Rite|Latin]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-32-1940-ocr.pdf Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 32 (1940)], p. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[suffragan]] to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tiranë–Durrës]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/2005/febbraio%202005.pdf Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 97 (2005)], p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; Its see is [[Pro-Cathedral]] of St. Mary and St. Louis ({{lang-sq|Kisha e Shën Maria dhe Shën Luigji}}) in [[Vlorë]].

It is claimed that Apostolic Administration of Southern Albania constitutes the only component of the particular (''sui juris'') [[Albanian Greek Catholic Church]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Such claims have been questioned by some leading Eastern Catholic experts.{{sfn|Galadza|2007|pp=293}}

== History ==
[[File:Lagekarte Apostolische Administratur Südalbanien.png|thumb|200px|right|Territory of the Apostolic Administration of Southern Albania]]
On November 11, 1939, the Holy See issued the [[papal bull]] ''Inter regiones'', establishing the ''Apostolic Administration of Southern Albania''. Initially, it was created as a regular [[apostolic administration]], for all Catholics in southern regions of Albania, both of [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] rites. Its territory was detached from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Durrës]], and initially covered districts of Elbassan, Korca, Berat, Valona and Argyrocastro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-32-1940-ocr.pdf Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 32 (1940)], p. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 25, 2005, it is suffragan to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tiranë-Durrës]], within the newly created metropolitan province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/2005/febbraio%202005.pdf Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 97 (2005)], p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Research and Development on Information Technology and Telecommunication''', formerly known as '''INIMA''' or '''Institute of Informatics and Applied Mathematics''' is a research institute on technology in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]], affiliated since 2007 with the [[Polytechnic University of Tirana]]. It was founded in 1986 on the basis of the Center of Computational Mathematics (QMLL). The latter former was founded in 1971, depending from [[Tirana University]] (UT) and, in 1973, when the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]] was founded, became one of the scientific institutions the Academy was composed of.

Having some of the most prominent experts in [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and [[applied mathematics]], INIMA has played a prime hand role in all informatics developments in Albania, in introduction of modern methods and technologies in different domains of Albanian reality such as: economics, engineering, geology&amp;mining, medicine and health care, farming, animal breeding, etc.; in the preparation of new specialists as well as in offering different scientific services, installation and maintenance of computer systems, etc.

In 2007, with a Council of Ministers decision (#146 dated 28 March 2007), INIMA was dissolved and restructured as part of the Polytechnic University of Tirana. INIMA was renamed to "Centre for Research and Development on Information Technology and Telecommunication" (after [[Cabinet of Albania|Council of Ministers]]' decision #824 dated 05.12.2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://itc.upt.al/qkzh.html About us (in Albanian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Constitution of Yemen''' was [[ratified]] by popular [[referendum]] on May 16, 1991.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Yemen.pdf Country profile: Yemen].

Due to the [[2011–2012 Yemeni revolution]], President [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Al-Hadi]] was expected to draft a new constitution in the 2012-2014 period.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Al-Haj [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42003348/ns/world_news/ Yemen leader proposes drawing up new constitution], Associated Press, March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, a committee had drafted a new constitution however both the [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|GPC]] and [[Houthi]] members of the National Authority for Monitoring the Implementation of [[National Dialogue Conference|NDC]] Outcomes have refused to vote on this draft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yementimes.com/en/1852/news/4814/Houthis-and-GPC-refuse-to-vote-on-constitution.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This will most likely delay a planned referendum on the new constitution, and therefore the next [[Next Yemeni presidential election|presidential]] and [[Next Yemeni parliamentary election|parliamentary]] elections, which have been delayed until the referendum can go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/01/21/215244/yemens-national-dialogue-ends.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Croatian Province of the Society of Jesus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska pokrajina Družbe Isusove}}) is a province of the [[Society of Jesus]], or the Jesuits, of the [[Catholic Church]] which is active in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. 

The Society of Jesus runs a faculty of philosophy at the [[University of Zagreb]] (separate from the main, secular faculty of philosophy) as well as the Student Catholic Centre within the [[Archdiocese of Zagreb]]. It has parishes in [[Rijeka]] and [[Zagreb]]. 

The Province also maintains residences in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Ohrid]], Macedonia where they provide religious education to seminarians in the local dioceses.

The '''Diocese of Argyll''' was an ecclesiastical territory or [[diocese]] of Scotland in the [[Middle Ages in Scotland|Middle Ages]]. The Diocese was led by the [[Bishop of Argyll]], and was based at [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore]].

During the [[Scottish Reformation]], the majority of the Scottish [[established church]] broke communion with the [[Pope]]. The establishment oscillated for a number of years over the question of whether to retain the order of [[bishop]]s as leaders in the church, as the [[Church of England]] had done. Eventually the [[presbyterianism|presbyterians]], those who do not have bishops, became the majority of the establishment and the post-Reformation [[Church of Scotland]]. However, the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] continued to appoint bishops for the ancient dioceses of Scotland. In 1688, the diocese was held with the [[Diocese of Ross (Scotland)|Diocese of Ross]] because of a shortage of bishops in the Episcopal Church. This union often included the dioceses of [[Diocese of Moray|Moray]] or [[Diocese of Caithness|Caithness]] through the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1819, the ancient [[Diocese of the Isles]] was added, and, in 1847, Alexander Ewing became the first Bishop of Argyll and the Isles. In 1878, the Roman Catholic Church founded a new diocese of the same name. Both the Episcopal and Catholic dioceses are now based in [[Oban]].

[[Image:A Vision of Fiammetta by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''[[A Vision of Fiammetta]]'' di [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]]]

'''''Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta''''', or '''''The Elegy of Lady Fiammetta''''' in English, is a [[novel]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] writer [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], probably written between 1343 and 1344. Written in the form of a first-person confessional monologue, it describes the protagonist, [[Fiammetta]]'s, passion for Panfilo, a Florentine merchant, and takes place in [[Naples]]. It has been characterised as the first [[psychological novel]] in Western literature. It consists of a prologue and nine chapters.

==Plot==
Lady Fiammetta recounts her tragic love affair with Panfilo, offering it as a warning to other women. Lady Fiammetta and Panfilo quickly fall in love and have an affair, only to have it end when Panfilo returns to [[Florence]].

Although he promises to return to Naples, she eventually realizes that he has another lover in Florence. The narrative revolves around Fiammetta's jealousy and despair caused by the affair, rather than the development of her relationship with Panfilo. She eventually considers suicide, but her nurse stops her. Her hopes in the end are bolstered by the news that Panfilo may be coming back to Naples after all.

==Translations==
Two translations of Boccaccio's ''Elegia'' have come out in recent years. The two translations differ in their principles of translation and their Italian texts. ''The Elegy of Madonna Fiammetta Sent by Her to Women in Love'', by Roberta L. Payne and Alexandra Hennessey Olsenhope, is aimed at a popular audience. The Mariangela Causa-Steindler and Thomas Mauch translation, ''The Elegy of Lady Fiammetta'', is more scholarly.

==See also==
*[[Juan de Flores]] wrote a sentimental novel, ''Grimalte y Gradissa'', which presents itself as a kind of sequel to the ''Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta''.

[[File:Gondwana 420 Ma.png|thumb|Gondwana 420 million years ago. View centered on the South Pole.]]
'''Gondwana''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɡ|ɒ|n|d|ˈ|w|ɑː|n|ə}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gondwana|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gondwana|website= [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]|publisher= Lexico Publishing Group|access-date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Gondwanaland''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Gondwanaland|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gondwana|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]]|access-date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[supercontinent]] that existed from the [[Neoproterozoic]] (about 550 million years ago) until the [[Carboniferous]] (about 320 million years ago). It was formed by the [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of several [[craton]]s. Eventually, Gondwana became the largest piece of [[continental crust]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era, covering an area of about {{Convert|100,000,000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Carboniferous, it merged with [[Euramerica]] to form a larger supercontinent called [[Pangaea]]. Gondwana (and Pangaea) gradually broke up during the [[Mesozoic]] Era. The remnants of Gondwana make up about two-thirds of today's continental area, including [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], and the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

The formation of Gondwana began {{Circa}}&amp;nbsp;{{Ma|800|650|{{Abbr|Ma|million years ago}}}} with the [[East African Orogeny]]&amp;nbsp;– the collision of India and Madagascar with East Africa&amp;nbsp;– and was completed {{Circa}} {{Ma|600|530|Ma}} with the overlapping [[Brasiliano orogeny|Brasiliano]] and [[Kuunga orogeny|Kuunga]] orogenies&amp;nbsp;– the collision of South America with Africa and the addition of Australia and Antarctica, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of concept==
The continent of Gondwana was named by Austrian scientist [[Eduard Suess]], after the [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana region]] of central [[India]] which is derived from [[Sanskrit]] for "forest of the [[Gondi people|Gonds]]". The name had been previously used in a geological context, first by [[Henry Benedict Medlicott|H.B. Medlicott]] in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suess|1885|p=768}}: [https://archive.org/stream/dasantlitzderer02suesgoog#page/n760/mode/1up "Wir nennen es Gondwána-Land, nach der gemeinsamen alten Gondwána-Flora, … " (We name it Gondwána-Land, after the common ancient flora of Gondwána …)]&lt;/ref&gt; from which the Gondwana sedimentary sequences ([[Permian]]-[[Triassic]]) are also described.
The term "Gondwanaland" is preferred by some scientists in order to make a clear distinction between the region and the supercontinent.&lt;ref name="McL-2001-p272"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLoughlin|2001|loc=Gondwana or Gondwanaland?, pp. 272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Kuunga2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Eastern Gondwana.  {{Ma|620|550|Ma}} post-collisional extension of the East African Orogeny in blue and {{Ma|570|530|Ma}} collisional metamorphism of the Kuunga orogeny in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|2003|loc=Fig. 10, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The assembly of Gondwana was a protracted process  during the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic, which however remains incompletely understood because of the lack of paleo-magnetic data.  Several [[Orogeny|orogenies]], collectively known as the [[Pan-African orogeny]], led to the amalgamation of most of the continental fragments of a much older supercontinent, [[Rodinia]].  One of those orogenic belts, the [[Mozambique Belt]], formed {{Ma|800|650|Ma}} and was originally interpreted as the [[Suture (geology)|suture]] between East (India, Madagascar, Antarctica, and Australia) and West Gondwana (Africa and South America). Three orogenies were recognized during the 1990s: the [[East African Orogeny]] ({{Ma|650|800|Ma}}) and [[Kuunga orogeny]] (including the [[Malagasy Orogeny]] in southern Madagascar) ({{Ma|550|Ma}}) – the collision between East Gondwana and East Africa in two steps, and the [[Brasiliano orogeny]] ({{Ma|660|530|Ma}}) – the succesive collision between South American and African [[craton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|loc=Introduction, pp. 223–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stages of Gondwanan assembly overlapped with the opening of the [[Iapetus Ocean]] between [[Laurentia]] and western Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miashita|Yamamoto|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this interval, the [[Cambrian explosion]] occurred.
Laurentia was docked against the western shores of a united Gondwana for a short period near the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary, forming the short-lived and still disputed supercontinent [[Pannotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mozambique Ocean]] separated the [[Congo Craton|Congo]]–[[Tanzania Craton|Tanzania]]–[[Bangweulu Block]] of central Africa from Neoproterozoic India (India, the [[Antongil]] Block in far eastern Madagascar, the [[Seychelles]], and the Napier and Rayner Complexes in [[East Antarctica]]). The [[Azania]] continent&lt;ref&gt;Defined but not named in {{Harvnb|Collins|Pisarevsky|2005}}: "Azania" was a Greek name for the East African coast&lt;/ref&gt; (much of central [[Madagascar]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and parts of [[Yemen]] and Arabia) was an island in the Mozambique Ocean.

The Australia/[[East Antarctic Shield|Mawson]] continent was still separated from India, eastern Africa, and Kalahari by {{Circa}} {{Ma|600|Ma}}, when most of western Gondwana had already been amalgamated. By {{Circa}} 550&amp;nbsp;Ma, India had reached its Gondwanan position, which initiated the Kuunga orogeny (also known as the Pinjarra orogeny). Meanwhile, on the other side of the newly forming Africa, Kalahari collided with Congo and Rio de la Plata which closed the [[Adamastor Ocean]].  {{Circa}} 540–530&amp;nbsp;Ma, the closure of the Mozambique Ocean brought India next to Australia–East Antarctica, and both North and South China were located in proximity to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008|loc=The birth of Gondwanaland (600–530 Ma), p. 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Positions of ancient continents, 550 million years ago.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Plate reconstruction|Reconstruction]] showing final stages of assembly of Gondwana, 550 Mya]]
As the rest of Gondwana formed, a complex series of orogenic events assembled the eastern parts of Gondwana (eastern Africa, Arabian-Nubian Shield, Seychelles, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, East Antarctica, and Australia) {{Circa}} {{Ma|750|530|Ma}}. First the Arabian-Nubian Shield collided with eastern Africa (in the Kenya-Tanzania region) in the [[East African Orogeny]] {{Circa}}{{Ma|750|620|Ma}}. Then Australia and East Antarctica were merged with the remaining Gondwana {{Circa}} {{Ma|570|530|Ma}} in the [[Kuunga Orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|2003|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Malagasy orogeny at about 550–515&amp;nbsp;Mya affected Madagascar, eastern East Africa and southern India. In it, Neoproterozoic India collided with the already combined Azania and Congo–Tanzania–Bangweulu Block, suturing along the [[Mozambique Belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grantham|Maboko|Eglington|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Convert|18000|km|abbr=on}}-long [[Terra Australis Orogen]] developed along Gondwana's western, southern, and eastern margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cawood|2005|loc=Definition and Tectonic Framework, pp. 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proto-Gondwanan Cambrian arc belts from this margin have been found in eastern Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Antarctica.  Though these belts formed a continuous arc chain, the direction of subduction was different between the Australian-Tasmanian and New Zealand-Antarctica arc segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Münker|Crawford|2000|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peri-Gondwana development: Paleozoic rifts and accretions ==
A large number of terranes were accreted to Eurasia during Gondwana's existence but the Cambrian or Precambrian origin of many of these terranes remains uncertain.  For example, some Palaeozoic terranes and microcontinents that now make up Central Asia, often called the "Kazakh" and "Mongolian terranes", were progressively amalgamated into the continent [[Kazakhstania]] in the Late Silurian.  Whether these blocks originated on the shores of Gondwana is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Marginal microcontinents and terranes, p. 1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Early Palaeozoic the [[Armorican terrane]], which today form large parts of France, was part of either Peri-Gondwana or core Gondwana; the Rheic Ocean closed in front of it and the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean opened behind it.  Precambrian rocks from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] suggest it too probably formed part of core Gondwana before its detachment as an [[orocline]] in the [[Variscan orogeny]] close to the Carboniferous–Permian boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Southern Europe, pp. 1008–1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South-east Asia is made of Gondwanan and [[Cathaysia]]n continental fragments that were assembled during the Mid-Palaeozoic and Cenozoic.  This process can be divided into three phases of rifting along Gondwana's northern margin: firstly, in the Devonian, [[North China (continent)|North]] and [[South China (continent)|South China]], together with [[Tarim Block|Tarim]] and [[Quidam terrane|Quidam]] (north-western China) rifted, opening the Palaeo-Tethys behind them.  These terranes accreted to Asia during Late Devonian and Permian.  Secondly, in the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian, [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian terranes]] opened Meso-Tethys Ocean; [[Sibumasu]] and [[Qiantang terrane|Qiantang]] were added to south-east Asia during Late Permian and Early Jurassic.  Thirdly, in the Late Triassic to Late Jurassic, [[Lhasa terrane|Lhasa]], [[West Burma]], [[Woyla]] terranes opened the Neo-Tethys Ocean; Lhasa collided with Asia during the Early Cretaceous, and West Burma and Woyla during the Late Cretaceous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLoughlin|2001|loc=Cimmerian terranes, p. 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gondwana's long, northern margin had remained a mostly passive margin throughout the Palaeozoic.  The Early Permian opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean along this margin produced a long series of terranes, many of which were and still are being deformed in the [[Geology of the Himalaya|Himalaya Orogeny]].  From Turkey to north-eastern India: the Taurides in southern Turkey; the Lesser Caucasus Terrane in Georgia; the Sanand, Alborz, and Lut terranes in Iran; the Mangysglak or Kopetdag Terrane in the Caspian Sea; the Afghan Terrane; the Karakorum Terrane in northern Pakistan; and the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in Tibet.  The Permian–Triassic widening of the Neo-Tethys pushed all these terranes across the Equator and over to Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=South-central and eastern Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southwestern accretions===

==Gondwana as part of Pangaea: Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic==
[[File:Laurasia-Gondwana.svg|thumb|Gondwana formed part of Pangaea for {{Circa}} 150&amp;nbsp;Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Pangaea}}
Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] formed the Pangaea supercontinent during the Carboniferous.  Pangaea began to break up in the Mid-Jurassic when the [[Central Atlantic magmatic province|Central Atlantic opened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Van Der Voo|2002|loc=Data selection and reconstruction fits, p. 772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western end of Pangaea, the collision between Gondwana and Laurasia closed the [[Rheic Ocean|Rheic]] and [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Palaeo-Tethys]] oceans.  The obliquity of this closure resulted in the docking of some northern terranes in the [[Marathon Uplift|Marathon]], [[Ouachita orogeny|Ouachita]], [[Alleghanian orogeny|Alleghanian]], and [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan]] orogenies, respectively.  Southern terranes, such as [[Chortis Block|Chortis]] and [[Oaxaca Terrane|Oaxaca]], on the other hand, remained largely unaffected by the collision along the southern shores of Laurentia.  Some Peri-Gondwanan terranes, such as [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and [[Florida]], were buffered from collisions by major promontories.  Other terranes, such as [[Carolina terrane|Carolina]] and [[Meguma terrane|Meguma]], were directly involved in the collision.  The final collision resulted in the Variscan-[[Appalachian Mountains]], stretching from present-day Mexico to southern Europe. Meanwhile, [[Baltica]] collided with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstania]] which resulted in the [[Uralian orogeny]] and [[Laurasia]].  Pangaea was finally amalgamated in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, but the oblique forces continued until Pangaea began to rift in the Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Assembly of Western Pangaea: Carboniferous–Permian, pp. 453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eastern end collisions occurred slightly later.  The [[North China Craton|North China]], [[South China Craton|South China]], and [[Indochina Block|Indochina]] blocks rifted from Gondwana during the middle Paleozoic and opened the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]].  North China docked with Mongolia and Siberia during the Carboniferous–Permian, followed by South China.  The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian]] blocks then rifted from Gondwana to form the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Palaeo-Thethys]] and [[Tethys Ocean|Neo-Tethys]] oceans in the Late Carboniferous, and docked with Asia during the Triassic and Jurassic.  Western Pangaea began to rift while the eastern end was still being assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Assembly of Eastern Pangaea: Late Permian–Jurassic, p. 454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of Pangaea and its mountains had a tremendous impact on global climate and sea levels, which resulted in glaciations and continent-wide sedimentation.  In North America, the base of the [[Absaroka sequence]] coincides with the Alleghanian and Ouachita orogenies and are indicative of a large-scale change in the mode of deposition far away from the Pangaean orogenies.  Ultimately, these changes contributed to the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] and left large deposits of hydrocarbons, coal, evaporite, and metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Summary: significance of Pangaean events, pp. 454–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break-up of Pangaea began with the [[Central Atlantic magmatic province]] (CAMP) between South America, Africa, North America, and Europe.  CAMP covered more than seven million square kilometres over a few million years, reached its peak at {{Circa}} {{Ma|200|Ma}}, and coincided with the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marzoli|Renne|Piccirillo|Ernesto|1999|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reformed Gondwanan continent was not precisely the same as that which had existed before Pangaea formed; for example, most of [[Florida]] and southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]] is underlain by rocks that were originally part of Gondwana, but this region stayed attached to North America when the [[Atlantic Ocean#Central Atlantic|Central Atlantic opened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Gondwana Remnants in Alabama And Georgia: Uchee Is An 'Exotic' Peri-Gondwanan Arc Terrane, Not Part Of Laurentia | publisher = ScienceDaily | date = February 4, 2008 | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212810.htm | access-date=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break-up==
===Mesozoic===
Antarctica, the centre of the supercontinent, shared boundaries with all other Gondwana continents and the fragmentation of Gondwana propagated clockwise around it.  The break-up was the result of one of the Earth's most extensive [[large igneous province]]s {{Circa}} {{Ma|200|170|Ma}}, but the oldest [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] between South America, Africa, and Antarctica are found in what is now the southern [[Weddell Sea]] where initial break-up occurred during the Jurassic {{Circa}} {{Ma|160|180|Ma}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jokat|Boebel|König|Meyer|2003|loc=Introduction, pp. 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gondwana began to break up in the early [[Jurassic]] following the extensive and fast emplacement of the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] [[flood basalt]]s {{Circa}} {{Ma|184|Ma}}.  Before the Karoo plume initiated rifting between Africa and Antarctica, it separated a series of smaller continental blocks from Gondwana's southern, Proto-Pacific margin (along what is now the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]): the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], [[Marie Byrd Land]], [[Zealandia]], and [[Thurston Island]]; the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains]] (in Antarctica) were rotated 90° in opposite directions; and South America south of the [[Gastre Fault]] (often referred to as [[Tectonic evolution of Patagonia|Patagonia]]) was pushed westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Encarnación|Fleming|Elliot|Eales|1996|loc=Early rifting and Gondwana breakup, pp. 537–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the Africa-Antarctica break-up can be studied in great detail in the fracture zones and magnetic anomalies flanking the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royer|Patriat|Bergh|Scotese|1988|loc=Figg. 7 a–j, pp. 248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Madagascar block and the [[Mascarene Plateau]], stretching from the [[Seychelles]] to [[Réunion]], were broken off India; elements of this breakup nearly coincide with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The India–Madagascar–Seychelles separations appear to coincide with the eruption of the [[Deccan Traps|Deccan basalts]], whose eruption site may survive as the [[Réunion hotspot]].  The Seychelles and the [[Maldives]] are now separated by the [[Central Indian Ridge]].

During the initial break-up in the Early Jurassic a [[transgression (geology)|marine transgression]] swept over the [[Horn of Africa]] covering Triassic [[planation surface]]s with [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], [[shale]], [[marl]]s and [[evaporite]]s.&lt;ref name=Abbate2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbate |first=Ernesto|last2=Bruni |first2=Piero|last3=Sagri |first3=Mario |date=2015|editor-last=Billi|editor-first=Paolo |title=Landscapes and Landforms of Ethiopia |chapter=Geology of Ethiopia: A Review and Geomorphological Perspectives|series=World Geomorphological Landscapes |location= |publisher= |pages=33–64 |isbn=978-94-017-8026-1 |author-link= |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-8026-1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coltortietal2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coltorti |first1=M. |last2=Dramis |first2=F.|last3=Ollier |first3=C.D.|author-link3=Cliff Ollier |date=2007 |title=Planation surfaces in Northern Ethiopia |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=89 |issue= |pages=287–296 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The [[Atlantic Ocean#South Atlantic|opening of the South Atlantic Ocean]] divided West Gondwana (South America and Africa), but there is a considerable debate over the exact timing of this break-up.  Rifting propagated from south to north along Triassic–Early Jurassic lineaments, but intra-continental rifts also began to develop within both continents in Jurassic–Cretaceous sedimentary basins; subdividing each continent into three sub-plates.  Rifting began {{Circa}} {{Ma|190|Ma}} at Falkland latitudes, forcing Patagonia to move relative to the still static remainder of South America and Africa, and this westward movement lasted until the Early Cretaceous {{Ma|126.7|Ma}}.  From there rifting propagated northward during the Late Jurassic {{Circa}} {{Ma|150|Ma}} or Early Cretaceous {{Circa}} {{Ma|140|Ma}} most likely forcing dextral movements between sub-plates on either side.  South of the [[Walvis Ridge]] and [[Rio Grande Rise]] the [[Paraná and Etendeka traps|Paraná and Etendeka magmatics]] resulted in further ocean-floor spreading {{Circa}} {{Ma|130|135|Ma}} and the development of rifts systems on both continents, including the [[West and Central African Rift System|Central African Rift System]] and the [[Central African Shear Zone]] which lasted until {{Circa}} {{Ma|85|Ma}}.  At Brazilian latitudes spreading is more difficult to assess because of the lack of palaeo-magnetic data, but rifting occurred in Nigeria at the [[Benue Trough]] {{Circa}} {{Ma|118|Ma}}.  North of the Equator the rifting began after {{Ma|120.4|Ma}} and continued until {{Circa}} {{Ma|100|96|Ma}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|Müller|Zahirovic|Gaina|2012|loc=South Atlantic, pp. 217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Andean orogeny====
The first phases of [[Andean orogeny]] in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Early Cretaceous]] were characterized by [[extensional tectonics]], [[rift]]ing, the development of [[back-arc basin]]s and the emplacement of large [[batholith]]s.&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramos|2009|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46&gt;{{Harvnb|Charrier|Pinto|Rodríguez|2006|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is presumed to have been linked to the subduction of cold [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; During the mid to [[Late Cretaceous]] (ca. 90 million years ago) the Andean orogeny changed significantly in character.&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; Warmer and younger oceanic lithosphere is believed to have started to be subducted beneath South America around this time. Such kind of subduction is held responsible not only for the intense contractional [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] that different lithologies were subject to, but also the [[mountain building|uplift]] and [[erosion]] known to have occurred from the Late Cretaceous onward.&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; [[Plate tectonics|Plate tectonic]] reorganization since the mid-Cretaceous might also have been linked to the [[rift|opening]] of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009/&gt; Another change related to mid-Cretaceous plate tectonic changes was the change of subduction direction of the oceanic lithosphere that went from having south-east motion to having a north-east motion at about 90 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Hoffmannetal2006&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffmann-Rothe|Kukowski|Dresen|Echtler|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While subduction direction changed it remained oblique (and not perpendicular) to the coast of South America, and the direction change affected several [[subduction|subduction zone]]-parallel faults including [[Atacama Fault|Atacama]], [[Domeyko Fault|Domeyko]] and [[Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault|Liquiñe-Ofqui]].&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffmannetal2006/&gt;

===Cenozoic===
The [[Indian subcontinent]] began to collide with Asia {{Circa}} {{Ma|70|Ma}} since when more than {{Convert|1400|km|abbr=on}} of crust has been absorbed by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]]-[[Tibet]]an orogen.  During the Cenozoic the orogen resulted in the construction of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] between the Tethyan Himalayas in the south and the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yin|Harrison|2000|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, South America was connected to North America via the [[Isthmus of Panama]], cutting off a circulation of warm water and thereby making the [[Arctic]] colder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luyendyk|Forsyth|Phillips|1972|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allowing the [[Great American Interchange]].

The breakup of Gondwana can be said to continue in eastern Africa at the [[Afar Triple Junction]], which separates the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]], [[Nubian Plate|Nubian]], and [[Somali Plate|Somali]] plates, resulting in rifting in the [[Red Sea]] and [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jestin|Huchon|Gaulier|1994|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia–Antarctica separation====
In the Early [[Cenozoic]] Australia was still connected to Antarctica {{Circa}} 35–40° south of its current location and both continents were largely unglaciated.  A rift between the two developed but remained an embayment until the Eocene-Oligocene boundary when the Circumpolar Current developed and the glaciation of Antarctica began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2006|loc=Palaeogeography, pp. 538–539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia was warm and wet during the Palaeocene and dominated by rainforest.  The opening of the Tasman Gateway at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary ({{Ma|33|Ma}}) resulted in abrupt cooling but the Oligocene became a period of high rainfall with swamps in southeast Australia.  During the Miocene a warm and humid climate developed with pockets of rainforests in central Australia but before the end of the period colder and drier climate severely reduced this rainforest.  A brief period of increased rainfall in the Pliocene was followed by drier climate which favoured grassland.  Since then the fluctuation between wet interglacial periods and dry glacial periods has developed into the present arid regime.  Australia has thus experienced various climate changes over a 15 million year period with a gradual decrease in precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2006|loc=Conclusions, pp. 557–558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tasman Gateway between Australia and Antarctica began to open {{Circa}} {{Ma|40|30|Ma}}.  Palaeontological evidences indicate the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC) was established in the Late Oligocene {{Circa}} {{Ma|23|Ma}} with the full opening of the [[Drake Passage]] and the deepening of the Tasman Gateway.  The oldest oceanic crust in the Drake Passage, however, is {{Ma|34|29|Ma}}-old which indicates spreading between the Antarctic and South American plates began near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagabrielle|Goddéris|Donnadieu|Malavieille|2009|loc=Timing of opening of the Drake Passage region, pp. 198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Deep sea environments in [[Tierra del Fuego]] and the [[North Scotia Ridge]] during the Eocene and Oligocene indicate a "Proto-ACC" opened during this period.  Later, {{Ma|26|14|Ma}}, a series of events severally restricted the Proto-ACC: change to shallow marine conditions along the North Scotia Ridge; closure of the Fuegan Seaway, the deep sea that existed in Tierra del Fuego; and uplift of the Patagonian Cordillera.  This, together with the reactivated [[Iceland plume]], contributed to global warming.  During the Miocene, the Drake Passage began to widen and as water flow between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] increased, the renewed ACC resulted in cooler global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagabrielle|Goddéris|Donnadieu|Malavieille|2009|loc=Conclusions, p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Eocene the northward movement of the Australian Plate has resulted in an [[arc-continent]] collision with the [[Philippine Sea Plate|Philippine]] and [[Caroline Plate|Caroline]] plates and the uplift of the [[New Guinea Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|Hall|2003|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Oligocene to the late Miocene, the climate in Australia, dominated by warm and humid rainforests before this collision, began to alternate between open forest and rainforest before the continent became the arid or semiarid landscape it is today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Travouillon|Legendre|Archer|Hand|2009|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dryandra formosa-IMG 0335.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Banksia]]'', a [[Grevilleoideae|grevilleoid]] Proteaceae, is an example a plant with a Gondwanan distribution]]
The adjective "Gondwanan" is in common use in [[biogeography]] when referring to patterns of distribution of living organisms, typically when the organisms are restricted to two or more of the now-discontinuous regions that were once part of Gondwana, including the [[Antarctic flora]].&lt;ref name="McL-2001-p272" /&gt; For example, the plant family [[Proteaceae]], known from all continents in the Southern Hemisphere, has a "Gondwanan distribution" and is often described as an archaic, or [[relict]], lineage.  The distributions in Proteaceae is, nevertheless, the result of both Gondwanan rafting and later oceanic dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Weston|Rutschmann|Sauquet|2007|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cambrian diversification===
During the [[Silurian]] Gondwana extended from the Equator (Australia) to the South Pole (North Africa and South America) whilst Laurasia was located on the Equator opposite to Australia.  A short-lived [[Late Ordovician glaciation]] was followed by a Silurian [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|Hot House]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=SILURIAN: terrestrial life appears in the tropics, p. 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician extinction]], which resulted in 27% of marine invertebrate families and 57% of genera going extinct, occurred during this shift from Ice House to Hot House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=The First Extinction, p. 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Ordovician ''[[Cooksonia]]'', a slender, ground-covering plant, became the first vascular plant to establish itself on land.  This first colonisation occurred exclusively around the Equator on landmasses then limited to Laurasia and, in Gondwana, to Australia.  In the Late Silurian two distinctive linages, [[Zosterophyllopsida|zosterophylls]] and [[Rhyniopsida|rhyniophytes]], had colonised the tropics.  The former evolved into the [[Lycopodiopsida|lycopods]], that were to dominate the Gondwanan vegetation over a long period, whilst the latter evolved into [[Equisetum|horsetails]] and [[gymnosperm]]s.  Most of Gondwana was located far from the Equator during this period and remained a lifeless and barren landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=The Silurian revolution, p. 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Gondwana drifted north during the [[Devonian]] which brought Gondwana and Laurasia close together.  Global cooling contributed to the [[Late Devonian extinction]] (19% of marine families and 50% of genera went extinct) and glaciation occurred in South America.  Before Pangaea had formed terrestrial plants, such as [[pteridophyte]]s, began to diversify rapidly resulting in the colonisation of Gondwana.  The [[Baragwanathia]] Flora, found only in the [[Yea Flora Fossil Site|Yea Beds]] of Victoria, Australia, occurs in two strata separated by {{Convert|1700|m|abbr=on}} or 30&amp;nbsp;Ma; the upper assemblage is more diverse and includes Baragwanathia, the first primitive [[herbaceous]] lycopod to evolve from the zosterophylls.  During the Devonian [[Lepidodendron|giant club mosses]] replaced the Baragwanathia Flora, introducing the first trees, and by the Late Devonian this first forest was accompanied by the [[progymnosperm]]s, including the first large trees ''[[Archaeopteris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=DEVONIAN: colonising Gondwana; The Second Extinction; Global colonisation of plants, pp. 151, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Late Devonian extinction probably also resulted in [[Osteolepiformes|osteolepiform]] fishes [[Evolution of tetrapods|evolving into the amphibian tetrapods]], the earliest land vertebrates, in Greenland and Russia.  The only traces of this evolution in Gondwana are amphibian footprints and a single jaw from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=Amphibian prelude, p. 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure of the Rheic Ocean and the formation of Pangaea in the Carboniferous resulted in the rerouting of ocean currents which initiated an Ice House period.  As Gondwana began to rotate clockwise, Australia shifted south to more temperate latitudes.  An ice cap initially covered most of southern Africa and South America but began to spread to eventually cover most of the supercontinent, save for northern-most Africa-South America and eastern Australia.  Giant lycopod and horsetail forests continued to evolve in tropical Laurasia together with a diversified assemblage of true insects.  In Gondwana, in contrast, ice and, in Australia, volcanism decimated the Devonian flora to a low-diversity seed fern flora&amp;nbsp;– the pteridophytes were increasingly replaced by the gymnosperms which were to dominate until the Mid-Cretaceous.  Australia, however, was still located near the Equator during the Early Carboniferous and during this period [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl]] and [[Lepospondyli|lepospondyl]] amphibians and the first [[amniote]] reptilians evolved, all closely related to the Laurasian fauna, but spreading ice eventually drove these animals away from Gondwana entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=CARBONIFEROUS: competing with ice, pp. 153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gondwana ice sheet melted and sea levels dropped during the Permian and Triassic global warming.  During this period, the extinct [[Glossopteridales|glossopterids]] colonised Gondwana and reached peak diversity in the Late Permian when coal-forming forests covered much of Gondwana.  The period also saw the evolution of [[Voltziales]]; one of the few plant orders to survive the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|end-Permian extinction]] (57% of marine families and 83% of genera went extinct) which came to dominate in the Late Permian and from whom true conifers evolved.  Tall lycopods and [[Equisetopsida|horsetails]] dominated the wetlands of Gondwana in the Early Permian.
Insects co-evolved with glossopterids across Gondwana and diversified with more than 200 species in 21 orders by the Late Permian, many known from South Africa and Australia.  Beetles and cockroaches remained minor elements in this fauna.  [[Tetrapod]] fossils from the Early Permian have only been found in Laurasia but they became common in Gondwana later during the Permian.  The arrival of the [[therapsid]]s resulted in the first plant-vertebrate-insect ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=PERMIAN: the glossopterid empire, pp. 153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern diversification===
During the Mid- to Late Triassic hot house conditions coincided with a peak in biodiversity&amp;nbsp;— the end-Permian extinction was enormous and so was the radiation that followed.  Two families of conifers, [[Podocarpaceae]] and [[Araucariaceae]], dominated Gondwana in the Early Triassic, but ''[[Dicroidium]]'', an extinct genus of fork-leaved seed ferns, dominated woodlands and forests of Gondwana during most of the Triassic.  Conifers evolved and radiated during the period with six of eight extant families already present before the end of it.  [[Bennettitales]] and [[Pentoxylales]], two now extinct orders of gymnospermous plants, evolved in the Late Triassic and became important in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.  It is possible that gymnosperm biodiversity surpassed later angiosperm biodiversity and that the evolution of angiosperms began during the Triassic but, if so, in Laurasia rather than in Gondwana.  Two Gondwanan classes, [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]] and [[Equisetopsida|sphenophytes]], saw a gradual decline during the Triassic while ferns, though never dominant, managed to diversify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=TRIASSIC: the gymnosperm heyday, pp. 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief ice house of the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] had a dramatic impact on dinosaurs but left plants largely unaffected.  The Jurassic was mostly a hot house and while vertebrates managed to diversify in this environment, plants have left little evidence of such development, with the exception of [[Cheirolepidiaceae|Cheiroleidiacean]] conifers and [[Caytoniales]] and other groups of seed ferns.  In terms of biomass the Jurassic flora was dominated by conifers families and other gymnosperms that had evolved during the Triassic.  The [[Pteridophyte]]s, that had dominated during the Palaeozoic, were now marginalised, except for ferns.  In contrast to Laurentia, very few insect fossils have been found in Gondwana to a large extent because of widespread deserts and volcanism.  While plants had a cosmopolitan distribution, dinosaur evolved and diversified in a pattern that reflects  the Jurassic break-up of Panagaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=JURASSIC: volcanism, conifers and bennettitaleans, pp. 156, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cretaceous saw the arrival of the [[angiosperm]]s, or flowering plants, a group that probably evolved in western Gondwana (South America-Africa).  From there the angiosperms diversified in two stages: the [[Monocotyledon|monocots]] and [[magnoliids]] evolved in the Early Cretaceous followed by the [[Hamamelidaceae|hammamelid]] [[Dicotyledon|dicots]].  By the Mid-Cretaceous angiosperms constituted half of the flora in northeastern Australia.  There is, however, no obvious connection between this spectacular angiosperm radiation and an extinction event nor vertebrate/insect evolution.  Insect orders associated with pollination, such as [[beetle]]s, [[Fly|flies]], [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], and [[Hymenoptera|wasps, bees, and ants]], radiated continuously from the Permian-Triassic long before the arrival of the angiosperms. Well-preserved insect fossils have been found in the lake deposits of the [[Santana Formation]] in Brazil, the [[Koonwarra, Victoria#Koonwarra fossil bed|Koonwarra Lake fauna]] in Australia, and the [[Orapa diamond mine]] in Botswana.&lt;ref name="And-Cretaceous"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=CRETACEOUS: of flowers and pollination, pp. 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dinosaurs continued to prosper but, as the angiosperm diversified, conifers, bennettitaleans and pentoxylaleans disappeared from Gondwana {{Circa}} 115&amp;nbsp;Ma together with the specialised herbivorous [[ornithischia]]ns whilst generalist browsers such as several families of [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]] [[Saurischia]] prevailed.  The [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] killed off all dinosaurs except birds, but plant evolution in Gondwana was hardly affected by the event.&lt;ref name="And-Cretaceous" /&gt;
[[Gondwanatheria]] is an extinct group of non-[[theria]]n mammals with a Gondwanan distribution (South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, and Antarctica) during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurovich|Beck|2009|loc=Introduction, pp. 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Xenarthra]] and [[Afrotheria]], two placental clades, are of Gondwanan origin and probably began to evolve separately {{Circa}} {{Ma|105|Ma}} when Africa and South America separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodburne|Rich|Springer|2003|loc=Gondwana and early mammal evolution, p. 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nothofagus demis.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The plant genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' illustrates Gondwanan distribution, having originated in the supercontinent and existing in present-day Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and South America's [[Southern Cone]]. Fossils have also recently been found in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|HaoMin|ZheKun|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[laurel forest]] of Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand have a number of other related species of the [[laurissilva]] de Valdivia, through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]] as gymnosperms and deciduous angiosperm'' Nothofagus''. ''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'' is called the bay of New Zealand, ''[[Laurelia novae-zelandiae]]'' belongs to the same genus ''[[Laurelia]]''. The sempervirens [[tree]] [[niaouli]] grows in Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand.  New Caledonia and New Zealand ecoregions became separated from Australia by [[continental drift]] 85 million years ago. The islands still retain plants that originated in Gondwana and spread to the Southern Hemisphere continents later. However, strong evidence exists of [[glaciation]] during the [[Carboniferous]] to [[Permian]] time, especially in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">The '''Grovii''' were an ancient tribe in Coastal Northern [[Portugal]], in the province of [[Minho Province|Minho]] and spreading into modern day [[Galicia (Spain)]]. The Grovii dwelt in the coast near the rivers "Avo" (the Ave river), [[Cávado river|Celadus]], [[Neiva river|Nebis]], [[Minho river|Minius]] and the  [[Limia (river)|Oblivion]]. The [[Lérez|Laeros]] and the [[Ulla (river)|Ulla]] rivers where in the North reach of this people.

Its main god was [[Turiacus]], unlike the nearby Castro culture tribes, whose main deity was [[Cosus]]. [[Pomponius Mela]] stated that all the populi were Celtic, excepting for the Grovii. Pliny also rejected that the Grovii were Celtic, he considered them to have a Greek origin. They cooperated with the local Gallaeci tribes as seen in the aftermatch of [[Viriatus]] death. These with the [[Gallacian|Callacian]] tribes and following Celtic ways, with their women, wanted revenge from the death of Viriatus. They attacked the Roman settlements in Lusitania, gaining momentum with the support of other tribes along the way, reaching the south of the Peninsula, near modern [[Andalusia]]. Endangering Roman rule in large stretches of Hispania. The leading Gallaeci cities of Avobriga and Lambriaca were located near the Grovii lands.&lt;ref name="galeg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Don José de Santiago y Gómez|title=Historia de Vigo y Su comarca |publisher=Imprenta y Lotografía Del Asilo De Huérfanos Del Sagrado Corázon de Jesús|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2928">The '''Houthem Formation''', named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] town of [[Houthem (Netherlands)|Houthem]], is a [[formation (stratigraphy)|geological formation]] that [[outcrop|crops out]] in the south of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]]. It has also been found in [[Boring (earth)|borings]] in the northeastern part of the [[Campine Basin]]. The formation consists of [[limestone|calcareous]] [[sandstone]] and was formed about 60 million years ago, in the [[Paleocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]].

==Lithology==
The Houthem Formation consists of maximally 30 metres of light grey to light yellow calcareous [[arenite]]s. The arenite can contain calcareous [[concretion]]s, [[fossil]]s and [[hardground]]s with shell fragments. At other places lenses of [[boundstone (rock)|boundstone]] occur, formed by [[red algae]]. 

The hardgrounds make it possible to subdivide the formation into three [[member (stratigraphy)|members]]: the [[Geleen Member]], the [[Bunde Member]] and the [[Geulhem Member]].

==Stratigraphy==
Dutch stratigraphers see the Houthem Formation as the youngest formation of the [[Chalk Group]], because it has a similar lithology with the older formations in this group. Belgian stratigraphers see it as part of the [[Hesbaye Group]], which contains Paleocene formations.

The base of the Houthem Formation is in the [[Vroenhoven Horizon]], probably the Dutch and Belgian equivalent of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). Below the Houthem Formation is the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Maastricht Formation]]. In the Campine Basin the Houthem Formation is overlain by the Paleocene [[Opglabbeek Formation]] ([[clay]] and [[sand]]) and the [[Heers Formation]] ([[marl]]).

'''Høgnorsk''', meaning "'''High Norwegian'''", is a term for varieties of the [[Norwegian language]] form [[Nynorsk]] that reject most of the official reforms that have been introduced since the creation of [[Landsmål]]. Høgnorsk typically accepts the initial reforms that, among other things, removed certain silent letters of [[etymology|etymological]] origin, while keeping most of the Landsmål grammar intact.

Professor [[Torleiv Hannaas]] is often credited for introducing the term 'Høgnorsk' in an article in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aasentunet.no/default.asp?menu=1158&amp;id=2957 |title=Høgnorsk eller flatnorsk? |last=Hannaas |first=Torleiv |authorlink=Torleiv Hannaas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206142333/http://www.aasentunet.no/default.asp?menu=1158&amp;id=2957 |archive-date=2012-02-06 |language=no |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it analogously to [[High German languages|High German]] (''Hochdeutsch''),&lt;ref&gt;''Hochdeutsch'' is the linguistic term for the southern and central dialects of German, spoken in the more mountainous parts of the German language area, in contrast to [[Low German]] (''Plattdeutsch'' or ''Niederdeutsch'') spoken mainly in the [[North German Plain]]. However, non-scientifically, ''Hochdeutsch'' (unlike its English equivalent "High German") is the common word for "Standard [[German language|German]]". Scientific German term for Standard German are ''Neuhochdeutsch'' ("New High German") or ''Standarddeutsch'' ("Standard German").&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that [[Ivar Aasen]], the creator of [[Nynorsk]] orthography, had especially valued the dialects of the mountainous areas of middle and western Norway, as opposed to the dialects of the lowlands of eastern Norway, which Hannaas called ''flatnorsk'' (Flat Norwegian, like ''Plattdeutsch''). 

The written High Norwegian language is a tradition originating from the first version of the New Norwegian written language (then called Landsmål), as it was built by Ivar Aasen and later used by classical New Norwegian authors as [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]], [[Arne Garborg]], [[Olav Nygard]] and [[Olav H. Hauge]].

The Høgnorsk movement grew out of opposition to the official [[Samnorsk]] policy which aimed at leveling out the differences between Nynorsk and the other main variety of Norwegian language, [[Bokmål]]. Reforms to this end were carried through in 1938 and 1959. Initially there was considerable [[Norwegian language struggle|resistance]] against these reforms, but the resulting standard is now widely accepted. Høgnorsk is currently supported by [[Ivar Aasen-sambandet]] and the activists behind Målmannen, but has relatively few active users.

The basis for the High Norwegian language direction, is a wish to preserve the New Norwegian written language as an independent language, free of the strong influence from Bokmål that today's New Norwegian has.

[[Seweryn Blumsztajn]], [[Teresa Bogucka]], [[Jan Gross]], [[Irena Grudzińska]], [[Irena Lasota]], [[Jan Lityński]], [[Adam Michnik]], [[Henryk Szlajfer]], [[Barbara Toruńczyk]], and more. Also, with the time passing, some young academic instructors were included, e.g. [[Jakub Karpiński]], [[Jadwiga Staniszkis]], [[Andrzej Zabłudowski]], ...

The group came into existence at the time when somewhat older dissidents, [[Jacek Kuroń]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] were in prison. Once these two were released, they became again something of guides for the rebellious students, and the two were considered ''Komandosi'' too (in a somewhat wider sense).

The name was popular due to the way in which the students interfered and came to control classroom discussions at [[University of Warsaw]] on topics which were politically charged from the point of view of standard communist propaganda of the era. The name was introduced however by an academic instructor who actively opposed the dissident students (as explained at court by Severyn Blumsztajn during a post-March68 trial of Seweryn Blumsztain and Jan Lityński)--ironically, the name was meant to sound derogatory.

During the [[1968 Polish political crisis|March '68 events]] many of the members of the group were arrested and tried on trumped up charges by the communist authorities. Michnik was sentenced to three years in prison, Kuroń three and a half, Lityński to two and a half, Blumsztajn to two, ...

'''Kopytka''', '''''kapytki''''' (literally "little hooves") are a kind of [[potato]] [[dumpling]] in [[Polish cuisine|Polish]], [[Cuisine of Belarus|Belarusian]], and [[Lithuanian cuisine|Lithuanian]] cuisines. They are similar to Italian [[gnocchi]] and German [[Schupfnudel]].

== Preparation and serving ==
The typical ingredients are boiled [[potato]]es and [[flour]], but may also include [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[salt]], and  other [[seasoning]]. The Polish dish is usually cooked in salted water, whereas in Belarusian and Lithuanian cuisines kapytki is baked first, then stewed or boiled in water.

Kopytka can be either a main dish or served on the side. Kopytka can be served savoury (baked with [[cheese]], fried [[bacon]], fried [[onion]], or with a variety of sauces such as [[goulash]] or [[mushroom sauce]]); they can also be served sweet (with melted [[butter]] and [[sugar]], [[cinnamon]], or sweetened [[Quark (dairy product)|quark]]), or sugar with sour cream.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''kopytka'' [''kopyto'' "hoof", ''kopytko'' "little hoof", neuter singular nouns] is [[Polish language|Polish]] for "little hooves," such as those of a small hoofed animal (for example, a [[goat]]). ''Kapytki'' is the [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] word for the same concept. Both refer to the structure of these dumplings, which are formed in the shape of hooves.

The British '''National GPS Network''', known as OS Net, is a network of global navigation satellite system [[GNSS]] base stations covering [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordnance Survey OS Net|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-net/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed by [[Ordnance Survey]].

It provides access to a stable, national coordinate reference system (through downloaded GNSS data) that allows highly accurate location to be determined using suitable equipment, and is used in surveying, construction and [[precision agriculture]] industries, among other uses. The use of ground-based stations makes this system more accurate than satellite based [[GPS]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=The Royal Institute of Navigation|journal=Journal of Navigation|date=September 2000|volume= 53|issue= 03 / September 2000|pages=397–402| title=Great Britain's Ordnance Survey National GPS Network |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=58961|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a single receiver, without any additional corrections, a civilian user can achieve a positional accuracy equal to 5&amp;nbsp;m – 10&amp;nbsp;m 95% of the time, and a height accuracy of 15&amp;nbsp;m – 20&amp;nbsp;m 95% of the time. Combined with data or corrections from a service such as OS Net, a positional accuracy of 1 – 2&amp;nbsp;cm is achievable, depending on the equipment used and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordnance Survey OS Net and GNSS FAQs|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/navigation-technology/os-net/gnss-positioning-services.html?q=afaq1#faq1|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penna|first1=N.T.|last2=Bingley|first2=R.M.|last3=Dodson|first3=A.H|title=Single Receiver Heighting Using The Active Stations of the National GPS Network of Great Britain|journal=Survey Review|date=January 2002|volume=36|issue=283|pages=340–350|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~iszgwr/PDF%20of%20Rngps10a/09%20RMBGWR/OSfbmpub.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2015|doi=10.1179/003962602791483280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}
A '''pirate television''' station is a [[broadcast television]] station that operates without a [[broadcast license]].  Like its counterpart [[pirate radio]], the term pirate TV lacks a specific universal interpretation. It implies a form of [[broadcasting]] that is unwelcome by the licensing authorities within the territory where its [[signal (electronics)|signals]] are received, especially when the country of [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is the same as the country of reception. When the area of transmission is not a country, or when it is a country and the transmissions are not illegal, those same broadcast signals may be deemed illegal in the country of reception. Therefore, "pirate TV" can mean many things to many people. Pirate [[television station]]s may also be known as "bootleg TV", or confused with licensed [[low-power broadcasting]] (LPTV) or [[amateur television]] ATV services.

==History==
Pirate Television stations are not as abundant in the United States or UK as pirate radio stations are. Only since 2004 has the technology for pirate television stations become easier to obtain and construct, due to advances in technologies and the availability of equipment.

The first pirate TV station in the US was Lanesville TV, launched in 1972, the broadcast station of video pioneers, the [[Videofreex]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skipblumberg.com/website/Bio_files/VideoPioneerSBJFVInt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1978, a weekend broadcast on Channel 7 in [[Syracuse, NY]] called "Lucky 7" captured headlines across the nation. "[[Lucky 7 (pirate TV station)|Lucky 7]]" broadcast episodes of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the [[pornographic movie]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and [[Behind the Green Door]]. The source of the transmission was not identified, but it was speculated in an article in the ''New York Times'' that the signal may have been transmitted from the area of [[Syracuse University]], as the signal was strongest in that area.&lt;ref&gt;"F.C.C Hunts an Illicit TV Station That Pirated Some Notable Shows.", The New York Times, April 19, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
There are several techniques for pirate TV broadcasting, most of which have been made very difficult, or obsolete, by better security measures and the move to [[digital television]].

===Relay hijack (analogue)===
Many analogue relay transmitters would "listen" to a more powerful main transmitter and relay the signal verbatim. If the main transmitter ceases broadcasting (for example, if a channel closes down overnight) then a pirate signal on the same frequency as the main transmitter could cause the relay to "wake up" and relay unauthorized programming instead. Typically this would be done by outputting a very weak RF signal within the immediate vicinity of the relay: for example, a video cassette recorder (such as a 12v system designed for use in trucks) sending its signal to a home-made antenna pointed at the relay. As the pirate signal is relatively weak, the source can be difficult to locate if it is well hidden.

A significant benefit of this attack is that the potential viewers do not have to re-tune their televisions to view the content. The content simply appears on an existing channel, after close-down.

This attack is generally now prevented by the channels broadcasting 24 hours per day (e.g. showing [[test card]]s instead of closing down), by using satellite feeds instead of repeating terrestrial signals, by electronic security to lock the relay to the authorised source, or by the switch to digital television.

Unsecured analogue satellite transponders have also been reported to have been hijacked in a similar manner.

===Source hijack (analogue or digital)===
In this scenario, a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] is performed upon the source material, such that authorized official transmissions are fed with unauthorized programming from the central studio or play-out facility. For example, a link feed (e.g. outside broadcast) is hijacked by a stronger pirate signal, or pre-recorded media (such as videotapes or hard drives) are swapped over for unauthorised content. This attack would generally have to be performed by an [[insider]] or by gaining access to studio facilities by [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]].

===Unauthorized transmitter (analogue)===
As with most [[pirate radio]] stations, reasonably powerful VHF/UHF transmitters can be built relatively easily by any sufficiently experienced electronics hobbyist, or imported from a less strict country. The primary challenge to this technique is finding a suitable yet inconspicuous vantage point for the transmission antenna, and the risk of getting caught. If the pirate signal is strong enough to be received directly, it will also be strong enough to be tracked down.

===Unauthorized multiplex (digital)===
The advent of [[digital television]] makes pirate television broadcasting more difficult. Channels are broadcast as part of a [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] that carries several channels in one signal, and it is almost impossible to insert an unauthorized channel into an authorized multiplex, or to re-activate an off-air channel. In order to broadcast an unauthorized digital TV channel, not only must the perpetrator build or obtain a VHF/UHF transmitter, he must also build or obtain, and configure, the equipment and software to digitally encode the signal and then create a stand-alone multiplex to carry it.

In Spain, in major provincial capital cities, usually operates one or more than one pirate TV digital multiplex. Some multiplexes started to operate after digital switch-over migrating pirate channels from analogue pirate television to DVB-T digital multiplexes.

Since shortly after digital switch-over and still today in secondary cities, some channels broadcast by means of a DVB-T transmitter with four analog input sources (in this case, four tuned satellite receivers connected by composite video cable) and then to amplifier, and digital signal is feed to antenna or tower. This method is the one used by most pirate TV channels. However, over the years and due to economic returns, some have begun broadcasting almost professionally. New equipment that they have been installing since three years ago allows remultiplexing of DVB-S programs into DVB-T multiplexes and most parameters can be configured at will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1367929#p1367929 Canales piratas en la TDT - Mundoplus]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, its number has been increasing in Madrid and in Valencia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondigital.cat/forum/viewtopic.php?p=87213#87213 TDT País Valencià - MónDigital]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, and, as of March 2016, there are more than ten DVB-T pirate multiplex in Madrid metropolitan area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1364359#p1364359 Canales piratas en la TDT - Mundoplus]&lt;/ref&gt; transmitting without authorization with programming ranging from [[divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_videncia.php Las emisiones ilegales en TDT: esoterismo y teleayuda 24 horas - Mondoplus]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fundamentalist Christian]] to [[community television]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_locales.php Las emisiones ilegales en TDT: televisiones locales - Mundoplus]&lt;/ref&gt; (which isn't regulated in Spain as of 2016).

In other countries, there are reports of pirate TV digital multiplexes, but they are very rare and usually suspected to have been false reports, mistaking [[signal overspill|overspill]] from authorized multiplexes in neighboring regions or nearby foreign countries. Viewing numbers may be much smaller than analogue pirate TV since re-tuning a digital television may be an entirely automated process which may ignore unauthorized multiplexes, or place such channels in an obscure section of the [[electronic program guide]].

*'''TV Randers Syd''' - [[Randers]], [[Denmark]]. Operated during 1981 and 1982. It was mostly broadcasting TV shows with music and entertainment recorded from German and Swedish TV channels and American movies. After two years of broadcasting the pirate was found in the suburb of [[Vorup]] and the station was closed by the authorities.&lt;ref name="danskradio.dk/tv.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danskradio.dk/tv.html|title=Dansk Radio - Æterbølgernes historie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''WGUN''' - Mentioned in an article by Shannon Huniwell in ''[[Popular Communications]]'' magazine, this was a short-lived pirate station in the [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] area that broadcast on channel 45 during the late 1970s. The sole broadcast consisted of a water pistol with "WGUN 45 TV" in cut out letters mounted on a phonograph turntable with audio from "an unmercifully scratchy [[Baja Marimba Band]] album". The station was located by radio station technicians after being informed by the mother of a young viewer who found the station while tuning the UHF TV band. When asked, the young unnamed pirate stated he purchased the transmitter, an EMC Model TXRU-100 UHF transmitter, at a rummage sale from a church that had intended to start a UHF-TV station. Upon being informed that his broadcasts were illegal, the station was shut down. The transmitter was reportedly re-sold at a yard sale.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Communications'' July 2009, pp. 73-74, "The Church Rummage Sale UHF Television Station and Other Minor TV Tales"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[W10BM]]''' - [[Morehead, Kentucky]], United States - Originally a licensed [[LPTV]] station on VHF channel 10, it is presently operating on a canceled license, making it a pirate broadcaster.

During the 1980s, large numbers of pirate TV stations operated in Italy, Greece, Spain and Israel. Subsequent legislation lead to the licensing of many of these stations and the closure of (most of) the remainder.

=== Proposed stations ===
* '''Caroline TV''' - Advertised in 1970, this was to have been a project related to [[Radio Caroline]], which at the time was off the air. Artwork showing the proposed station's identification graphics were released, but the station, which was to be broadcast from an airplane (similar to [[Stratovision]]), never materialized, although there is a website called www.radiocarolinetv.co.uk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/VOLUME05/LodgeUK.shtml|title=Inside Radio Caroline|author=Hans Knot|work=rug.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/CAR/car05.shtml|title=More Caroline cut-outs: March 1968 - September 1972|author=Hans Knot|work=rug.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''City TV''' - Was to have broadcast from a decommissioned minesweeper offshore of England. Plans for the station were announced on 8 June 1965, and was to have broadcast on VHF channel 3, but the station never materialized.&lt;ref name="bvws.org.uk"/&gt; It is not to be confused with the later [[CityTV]] in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, which began operation in 1972 and are fully licensed and legal full-power stations.
* '''Sealand Television''' - Was to have broadcast on Channel 28 from the [[Principality of Sealand]], a [[micronation]] established on a World War Two gunnery platform off the coast of Essex, England. The station, which was announced to start in September 1987, was to have been financed by Wallace Kemper, who was facing fraud and conspiracy charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amfm.org.uk/tx/tx15/news.html|title=News - Radio Today #15: August 1987 - AM/FM|work=amfm.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshore-manual.com/taxhavens/IsleofMan.html|title=-- Offshore Manual - We walk the walk, and talk the talk! --|work=offshore-manual.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tower TV''' - Was to have broadcast from Sunk Head Fort, 14 miles offshore of Essex, England. Reportedly held a test transmission at 4:20 AM on Tuesday 9 November 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobleroi.co.uk/ScrapBook/Tower_2/Tower_2.html|title=Radio Tower 2|work=bobleroi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this station had gone on air it would have probably caused interference with a legitimate transmitter at Peterborough on the same frequency.

'''Paudie "Podge" Doran''' (born 10 August 1992) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[hurling|hurler]] who plays as a right corner-forward for the [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] senior team.

==Playing career==

===Minor and under-21===
Doran enjoyed playing for both grades since he made his debut in 2009 but the years proved little success as he was faced by defeats in the hands of Kilkenny and Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/wexford/MessagePage.aspx?PageNumber=1&amp;TopicID=68074.html|title=Senior hurling panel 2012|date=27 August 2011|publisher=Hoganstand|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior===
Doran made his senior debut on June 8, 2013 in the Leinster Quarter-Final against [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] at a very sunny soaked [[Wexford Park]] as a sub with the game being quite one sided during the first period the game ended level.
The replay was played in [[Parnell Park]] the weekend after but proved little success for Doran and [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] as they suffered a defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/hurling/2013/0608/455402-wexford-v-dublin/.html |title=Wexford and Dublin must do it again |date=9 June 2013 |work=RTÉ Sport |accessdate=20 February 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3389">'''Radio RSA: The Voice of South Africa''' was the [[international broadcasting]] service of the Republic of [[South Africa]].  It was run by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] from its inception on 1 May 1966 until its demise in 1992 following the end of the [[apartheid]] era. Radio RSA broadcast news and opinion programming that was mostly pro-government, and the message of its broadcasts reflected those views. Following the fall of the apartheid government, the service was renamed [[Channel Africa]].

==Management==
Radio RSA, as part of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, was originally part of the Department of Information, which was established after the 1948 National Party victory. The Department of Information’s task was to promote the image of South Africa internationally and reduce criticism of apartheid. After the [[Muldergate scandal]] of the late 1970s, the functions of the Department of Information were split. The Department of Foreign Affairs took over control of Radio RSA.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, Robert Britt. ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NcQZ1D366t8C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=Communication%20and%20Democratic%20Reform%20in%20South%20Africa&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Communication and Democratic Reform in South Africa]''. 2001, page 287&lt;/ref&gt; The annual budget was about 20 million rands. 

In 1976, Radio RSA transmitted for 36 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Van der Merwe., The Environment of South African Business. 1976, Maskew Miller. {{ISBN|0-623-00948-X}}, page 35&lt;/ref&gt; Radio RSA broadcast in 12 languages in 1976 &lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Mara. Facts About the World's Nations. 1999, H.W. Wilson. {{ISBN|0-8242-0955-9}}, p. 863&lt;/ref&gt; including English, French, Portuguese, and Afrikaans. In 1984, 11 languages were broadcast.&lt;ref&gt; Roberts, Steven. 
International Directory of Telecommunications: Market Trends, Companies. 1984, Longman. {{ISBN|0-582-90021-2}}. p 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The studios of Radio RSA were initially located at Broadcast House, Commissioner Street in Johannesburg, relocating to Auckland Park in 1976. Additional facilities were located in Bloemendal near [[Meyerton, Gauteng]]. 

Transmitters operated at 100, 250 and 500 kW power.

==Identification==
The station identification in English was “"This is Radio RSA, the Voice of South Africa, from Johannesburg", with similar announcements in other languages: "Ici R. RSA, la Voix de l'Afrique de Sud". &lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Oluf Lund. World Radio and TV Handbook: 1978 edition, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Radio TV Handbook, 1992 edition, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, following the fall of apartheid and the election of an ANC government, the service was renamed [[Channel Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6cRzAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Channel+Africa+replaced+the+station+Radio+RSA+in+1992%22&amp;dq=%22Channel+Africa+replaced+the+station+Radio+RSA+in+1992%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn8tSe44bRAhWdelAKHee1AwYQ6AEIHDAA ''South Africa Yearbook''], South African Communication Service, 1995, page 292&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the Republic of the Congo}}

A '''presidential election''' was held in the [[Republic of the Congo]] on 10 March 2002. This followed the country's second [[Republic of the Congo Civil War (1997-99)|civil war (1997-1999)]], which returned [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] to power, and a subsequent transitional period, in which a new constitution was written and [[Republic of the Congo constitutional referendum, 2002|approved by referendum]] in January 2002.

The election lacked meaningful opposition participation, as the main opposition leaders&amp;mdash;particularly former President [[Pascal Lissouba]] of the [[Pan-African Union for Social Democracy]] (UPADS) and former Prime Minister [[Bernard Kolélas]] of the [[Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development]] (MCDDI)&amp;mdash;were in exile, prevented from returning to Congo by legal convictions and sentences that were handed down ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''. The only important opposition figure left to contest the election was former Prime Minister [[André Milongo]] of the [[Union for Democracy and the Republic (Congo)|Union for Democracy and the Republic]] (UDR), but he withdrew a few days before the election, claiming that it would be fraudulent.

Sassou Nguesso, standing as the candidate of his own [[Congolese Labour Party]] (PCT) and a coalition, the [[United Democratic Forces (Congo)|United Democratic Forces]] (FDU), was overwhelmingly elected, receiving nearly 90% of the vote against a field of minor challengers. He was sworn in on 14 August 2002 in a ceremony at the Palace of Congress in [[Brazzaville]] in the presence of seven other African heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Songo, [http://www.congopage.com/article479.html "Le putschiste Sassou devient officiellement "président élu""], Congopage.com, August 14, 2002 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisional results were announced by the Minister of the Interior, [[Pierre Oba]], on 13 March 2002; final results, which were only slightly different from the provisional results, were proclaimed by the Supreme Court on 29 March. There were 1,733,943 registered voters at the time of the election, 1,295,319 of whom voted. 92,706 votes were invalid, leaving 1,202,611 valid votes. 1,075,247 of those votes went to Sassou Nguesso.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120226070154/http://www.brazzaville-adiac.com/index.php?action=depeche&amp;dep_id=713&amp;oldaction=liste&amp;regpay_id=0&amp;them_id=0&amp;cat_id=0&amp;ss_cat_id=0&amp;LISTE_FROM=60&amp;select_month=0&amp;select_year=0 "La Cour suprême du Congo proclame les résultats définitifs du scrutin présidentiel"], ''Les Dépêches de Brazzaville'', 29 March 2002 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terry Jean Wilson''' (born 1954) is an international leader in the study of present-day [[tectonics]] in [[Antarctica]]. She has led large, international efforts, such as Polar Earth Observing Network (POLENET),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polenet.org|title=POLENET: The Polar Earth Observing Network - Investigating the polar regions from the inside out|last=|first=|date=|website=www.polenet.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to investigate the interactions between the [[Crust (geology)|earth's crust]] and the [[cryosphere]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthsky.org/earth/scientists-track-changes-in-antarctic-ice-sheet|title=Terry Wilson tracks changes in Antarctic ice sheet {{!}} EarthSky.org|website=earthsky.org|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/science/contenthandler.cfm?id=1453|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica - POLENET (page 1)|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natureworldnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/5276/20131211/antarctica-sliding-sideways-due-ice-loss.htm|title=Antarctica is Sliding Sideways Due to Ice Loss|date=2013-12-11|website=Nature World News|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Wilson received her BS from the [[University of Michigan]] and Ph.D from [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont Doherty Geological Observatory]] and Columbia University in 1983.

The '''Unity Movement for Democracy''' ({{lang-pt|Movimento de Unidade para a Democracia}}, '''MUD''') was a political party in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The MUD was established on 6 June 1990 by [[Filinto Vaz Martins]], a former member of the ruling [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]], and was the second party established after multi-party democracy was introduced.&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p281&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the [[Union for Change]] alliance, which won six seats in the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1994|1994 general elections]], although MUD did not receive any of the seats.&lt;ref name=M2&gt;Mendy, p282&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union for Change was reduced to three seats in the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1999–2000|1999–2000 general elections]], and lost them all in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]], after which the MUD became inactive.&lt;ref name=M2/&gt;

"'''Wind of Change'''" is a [[power ballad]] by the German [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], recorded for their eleventh [[studio album]], ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' (1990). The song was composed and written by the band's lead singer [[Klaus Meine]] and produced by [[Keith Olsen]] and the band. It was released as the album's third single in January 1991 and became a worldwide hit, just after [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|the failed coup]] that would eventually lead to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. The song topped the charts in Germany and across Europe and peaked at number four in the United States on August 31, 1991 and number two in the United Kingdom.  It later appeared on the band's 1995 live album ''[[Live Bites]]'', their 2000 album with the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]], ''[[Moment of Glory]]'', and on their 2001 [[acoustic music|unplugged]] album ''[[Acoustica (Scorpions album)|Acoustica]]''. 
With estimated sales of 14 million copies sold worldwide, "Wind of Change" is one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/vermischtes/journal/thema/article1210581/Der-Wende-Hit.html|title=SCORPIONS: WIND OF CHANGE Der Wende-Hit |work=[[Hamburger Abendblatt]] |access-date=August 23, 2016 |quote=Von Jana-Sophie Brasseler 02.10.09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the record for the best-selling single by a German artist.

The band presented a gold record of the single to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1991. {{As of|2018|11}}, the video for "Wind of Change" has been viewed more than 635 million times on YouTube. The Scorpions were the first German band to receive over 100 million views.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Background and writing==
The lyrics celebrate ''[[glasnost]]'' in the [[Soviet Union]], the end of the [[Cold War]], and speaks of hope at a time when tense conditions had arisen due to the fall of Communist-run governments among [[Eastern Bloc]] nations beginning in 1989.&lt;ref name=Bienstalk2015&gt;Bienstalk, Richard [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/scorpions-wind-of-change-the-oral-history-of-1990s-epic-power-ballad-20150902 Scorpions' 'Wind of Change': The Oral History of 1990's Epic Power Ballad] ''Rolling Stone''. September 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scorpions were inspired to write the song on a visit to [[Moscow]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="Bienstalk2015"/&gt; and the opening lines refer to the city's landmarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I follow the [[Moskva River|Moskva]]
Down to [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]]
Listening to the wind of change&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Moskva is the name of the river that runs through Moscow (both the city and the river are named identically in Russian), and Gorky Park is an urban park in Moscow named after the writer [[Maxim Gorky]].

The song also contains a reference to the [[balalaika]], which is a Russian stringed instrument somewhat like a guitar. The balalaika is mentioned in the following lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Composition==
"Wind of Change" opens with a clean guitar intro played by [[Matthias Jabs]], which is played alongside Klaus Meine's flat whistle. The song's guitar solo is played by [[Rudolf Schenker]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Other versions==

The band also recorded a [[Russian-language]] version of the song, under the title "{{lang|ru|Ветер перемен}}" ("Veter Peremen")&lt;ref&gt;[http://questionrs.com/tube/UPQge1FkqeU/scorpions-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD-wind-of-change-russian-version The wind of change_Russian version]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16229">'''Xanth''' ({{IPAc-en|'|z|æ|n|θ}} {{respell|ZANTH|'}}) is a [[fantasy world]] created by author [[Piers Anthony]] for his ''Xanth'' series of novels, also known as ''The Magic of Xanth''. Anthony originally intended for Xanth to be a [[trilogy]], and after the success of the first three books expanded the series to nine books. A devoted fan base persuaded the author to continue writing the series, which is now open-ended.

Anthony has stated that he has kept the series going as long as he has because the Xanth novels are "just about all that publishers want" from him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agonybooth.com/agonizer/Interview_with_Piers_Anthony.aspx Agony Booth Interview&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name ''Xanth'' pronounced as part of the author's name ("Pier{{uu|s Anth}}ony"), is in itself an unintentional pun, matching the playful tone of the books.&lt;ref&gt;"The name 'Xanth' was from my 'Names' book. I use these books not for the usual purpose of naming babies...but for naming characters in my fiction" (Piers, 213)&lt;/ref&gt; 

=={{Anchor|Xanth series}} Books==

As of August 2017, there are 41 novels, with the latest novel being released in April 2017.

==World of Xanth==

=== Inhabitants and talents ===

{{main|List of Xanth characters}}

Each human character in Xanth is born with a unique [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] ability, called a talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hipiers.com/AuthHour/index.html|title=Piers Anthony|website=www.hipiers.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the [[Xanth#Curse_fiends|curse fiend]]s, the winged centaurs, and the child Surprise Golem (Daughter of Rapunzel and Grundy Golem), these abilities never repeat exactly in individuals throughout the entire history of Xanth (although nearly identical talents show up on occasion.) Though many talents are limited in scope (called the "spot-on-a-wall" variety), the series focuses mainly on individuals with "Magician" caliber abilities (one of the criteria for serving as King of Xanth).

In addition to the human characters, Xanth is populated by [[centaur]]s, [[demon]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[faun]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[golem]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[merfolk (disambiguation)|merfolk]], [[naga (mythology)|naga]], [[nymph]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[Xanth#Curse_Fiends|curse fiend]]s, and other fictional beasts. Though initially introduced as obstacles to the human characters, some individuals from those groups become main characters in later books of the series.

As the series progresses, some of the half-human species are discovered to have the potential to possess magical talents. The centaurs of the primary centaur community, [[Centaur Isle]], exile any centaurs who demonstrate a magical talent (although some centaur communities are more lenient about possession of talent); however, they tolerate talents in "lesser" races such as humans. Goblins and harpies are shown to have the potential to possess half-talents, the complementary half existing in a member of the other species, (i.e., a goblin must team with a harpy for them to utilize their talent); the hostility between goblins and harpies proved a major obstacle to any serious effort by them to work together to develop these potential talents. Other non-human species are also shown to possess potential for talents.

=== Geography ===

{{main|Geography of Xanth}}

Geographically, modern Xanth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/gap_chasm/mapof.html|title=The Map of Xanth|website=members.tripod.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; resembles the state of Florida in the United States in shape, but has landmarks that mimic well known geographical features from around the world. One major example of this is the Gap Chasm, an enormous canyon a mile wide which completely bisects the country, paralleling the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula. The position of the Chasm could also correspond with the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], which, similar to the chasm, is generally forgotten except for those who stumble upon it. The Gap is guarded by a resident dragon, known as Stanley Steamer, and is crossed by means of treacherous bridges. Many of Xanth's other geographical features are puns on those of Florida (for example, [[Lake Okeechobee|Lake Ogre-Chobee]] and the [[Kissimmee River|Kiss-Mee River]]). The [[Florida Keys]] also exist, though they are, in Xanth, actual [[key (lock)|key]]s. Other punning feature names include the Isle of View ("I love you"), Mount Ever-Rest (Mount Everest) and the Centaur Aisle (center aisle) created by a magician from the Centaur Isle. The [[moon]] is close enough that flying creatures may land there; the back side is sweet and [[honey]]ish, the visible side has turned sour and become curdled [[cheese]], due to observing what has happened on Earth and Xanth. Plants may bear [[fruit]] of all descriptions (pie trees and shoe trees are common) or they may be carnivorous (such as the [[Man-eating tree|tangle trees]]), making travel in Xanth risky.

Xanth has a connection with the normal world, which is referred to as "Mundania"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moongadget.com/xanth/index.html|title=Xanthmaker - Piers Anthony Interview - Jitterbug Fantasia|website=moongadget.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; its people are called "Mundanes". Although any citizen of Xanth can enter Mundania at any time through an isthmus in the northwest, Mundanes enter the isthmus in Xanth from random geographic locations and time periods throughout history. In other words, Xanth does not have a fixed location or time in the mundane world; and the timeline between Xanth and Mundania seems to jump backwards and forwards. For example, within the lifetime of a normal citizen of Xanth, an American Mundane from 2012 and an Egyptian Mundane from 3,000 B.C. could both walk across the isthmus. However, Mundanes seem to have trouble finding Xanth on a consistent basis, making any travel to Xanth a somewhat rare occurrence. Despite these seeming difficulties, Xanth was colonized in several waves by groups of invaders and nomads from Mundania over the course of several centuries. The series ties these colonization events to actual historical events on [[Earth]], most notably the [[Punic wars]].

===Adult Conspiracy===

First mentioned in ''[[Crewel Lye]]'', the Adult Conspiracy is one of the prominent features of the Xanth world. In an interview with Moira Allen, Piers Anthony referred to the "Adult conspiracy to keep interesting things from children" as a literary device "parodying current societal conventions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing-world.com/sf/anthony.shtml|title=Master of Punmanship: An Interview with Piers Anthony|website=Writing-World.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all subsequent books contain references to the Conspiracy and its effects, particularly those novels in which the main characters are children.

At its core, the Adult Conspiracy seeks to protect [[child]]ren from knowledge that could bring them to great harm. The precise age for entering into the world of [[adults]] is age 18, corresponding to the [[age of majority]] in most places. The primary principle that inducts children into the Conspiracy is the understanding of the secret of "[[Sexual reproduction|summoning the stork]]". In Xanthian terms, "summoning the stork" literally means to put out a call to summon a stork which will deliver to the couple a child. In [[Isle of View]], it is revealed that summoning the stork will release an "[[ellipsis]]" (...) into the air to fly off to the stork. This is a play on the joke that all the "adult" things happen after a paragraph ends in an ellipsis. Most inductees actually discover the specifics of the act "by accident" after marriage, or under the influence of a love spring (a magical spring which causes two drinkers, not necessarily human, or even of the same species, to fall madly, and lustfully, in love with one another at first sight).

Other faculties of the Adult Conspiracy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://litrpgreads.com/blog/piers-anthony-magic-xanth|title=Piers Anthony: The Magic of Xanth - LitRPG Reads|date=13 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
*[[Censorship]] of [[Profanity|foul language]] &amp;ndash; All foul words contain the ability to cause various effects (the wilting of plants (negative), removal of curse burrs (positive), etc.). These are automatically [[Thomas Bowdler|bleeped]] when said in the presence of someone who has yet to be inducted.
*Visual access to underwear &amp;ndash; Because [[underwear]] is so closely tied to [[human sexuality|sexuality]] (even more so than nudity in Xanth), men become automatically "freaked out" when they view panties. This is made a common joke, most prominently in the novel ''[[The Color of Her Panties]]'', and is often used by women to gain advantage over men. Panties only carry their effects when worn, but because of their nature, they are forbidden to be shown to children.
*Inability to have childish fun &amp;ndash; Children believe that once they join the Adult Conspiracy, they will no longer have pillow fights, eat sweets and drink "tsoda popka" ([[Soft drink|soda pop]]), or want to have [[fun]]. While this belief is exaggerated, the entry to the Conspiracy does cause the couple to lose their bed monster, inadvertently creating the appearance of losing all childhood spirit under the responsibility of Adulthood.

It is important to note that there have been occasions when children gained access to the Adult Conspiracy prematurely. Jenny Elf, Che Centaur, and Gwenny Goblin had to be given access to the Adult Conspiracy when Gwenny received a pair of [[contact lens]]es that corrected her poor [[eyesight]] while giving her the ability to see others' [[dream]]s (some of which could contain Conspiracy material). In one rare instance, a little girl was born with the magic talent of immunity to the magical censorship of Adult Conspiracy, causing her family much distress. This was remedied with magician Sherlock's talent of reversal and a vial of [[lethe]] water which erased her [[memory]].

===Mundania===
Whenever Xanth characters visit the nonmagical land outside of Xanth, called Mundania, its natives (Mundanes) speak what sounds like gibberish to the Xanth characters. The gibberish can be translated by a simple replacement [[cipher]], depending on the Mundane language being spoken. Often the language is a simple shift in the alphabet, a letter or two forwards or backwards (see [[Caesar cipher]]).

=== Curse fiends ===

Curse fiends are a fictional race created by Piers Anthony for the series Xanth.
They are one of the earlier races in Xanth and are known for their talent to throw curses at their enemies. They are believed to be the primary cause of several different settings in Xanth: 1) the land of Air, 2) the land of Earth, 3) the land of Fire, 4) the land of Water (also called the Water Wing), and 5) the Void.
The story about how these regions were created is described in ''[[Demons Don't Dream]]''.

The curse fiends in the present day Xanth stay close to their own community where they put on plays. Because of this, they are widely known for their acting skills.

They call themselves Curse Friends.

'''Étoile de Dakar''' (“Star of Dakar”) were a leading music group of [[Senegal]] in the 1970s.

The group was formed in 1978 by Badou Ndiaye and members of the [[Star Band]], one of [[Dakar]]'s best known nightclub house bands of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Leon|title=Star Band de Dakar|work=AMG|publisher=Macrovision Corporation|date=|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p182251|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading the group allowed N'Dour to launch his career as Senegal's first pop star, and after Étoile de Dakar broke up, he continued calling his band ''Super Étoile de Dakar''.

Playing the Latin-influenced dance music that was popular throughout Africa at the time, Étoile de Dakar quickly became one of the city's most popular bands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/06/etoile-de-dakar-youssou-ndour | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Etoile de Dakar featuring Youssou N'Dour: Once Upon a Time in Senegal | first=Robin | last=Denselow | date=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to record in [[Paris]] with producer [[Ibrahim Sylla]] and had a track on the [[Island Records]] compilation [[Sound d’Afrique]], which was important in bringing African music to western ears in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/7690820/Etoile-de-Dakars-Jalo-the-song-that-transformed-our-tastes-for-ever.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Etoile de Dakar's Jalo: the song that transformed our tastes for ever | first=Mark | last=Hudson | date=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
