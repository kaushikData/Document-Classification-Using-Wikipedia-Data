'''Ābu Ḥanīfah Āḥmad ibn Dawūd Dīnawarī''' (815–896 CE, {{lang-ar|'''أبو حنيفة الدينوري'''}}) was an [[Islamic Golden Age]] polymath, [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|agriculturist]], [[botanist]], [[metallurgist]], [[Islamic geography|geographer]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], and [[historian]].

His ''General History'' (al-Akhbar al-Tiwal) has been edited and published numerous times (Vladimir Guirgass, 1888; Muhammad Sa'id Rafi'i, 1911; 'Abd al-Munim 'Amir &amp; Jamal al-din Shayyal, 1960; Isam Muhammad al-Hajj 'Ali, 2001), but has not been translated in its entirety into a European language. Jackson Bonner has recently prepared an English translation of the pre-Islamic passages of al-Akhbar al-Tiwal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrjb.ca/current-projects/abu-hanifah-ahmad-ibn-dawud-al-dinawari |title=Abu Hanifa Ahmad ibn Dawud ibn Wanand al-Dinawari (A.D. 828-895) - Michael Richard Jackson Bonner |publisher=www.mrjb.ca |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Book of Plants''==

===Botany===
Al-Dinawari is considered the founder of Arabic botany for his ''Kitab al-Nabat'' (''Book of Plants''), which consisted of six volumes. Only the third and fifth volumes have survived, though the sixth volume has partly been reconstructed based on citations from later works. In the surviving portions of his works, 637 plants are described from the letters ''sin'' to ''ya''. He describes the phases of [[plant growth]] and the production of flowers and fruit.&lt;ref name=Fahd-815&gt;{{citation|last=Fahd|first=Toufic|title=Botany and agriculture|page=815}}, in {{Citation |last1=Morelon |first1=Régis |last2=Rashed |first2=Roshdi |date=1996 |title=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-12410-7 |pages=813–852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Muslim early Botanical works are lost, such as that of Al-Shaybani (d.820), Ibn Al-Arabi (d.844), Al-Bahili (d.845) and Ibn as-Sikkit (d.857), but their works, however, are extensively quoted in later books by Abu Hanifa Al-Dinawari.

===Astronomy and meteorology===
Parts of al-Dinawari's ''Book of Plants'' deals with the applications of [[Islamic astronomy]] and [[meteorology]] to [[agriculture]]. It describes the astronomical and meteorological character of the sky, the [[planet]]s and [[constellation]]s, the [[sun]] and [[moon]], the [[lunar phase]]s indicating [[season]]s and [[rain]], the ''anwa'' ([[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes, wells and other sources of water.&lt;ref name=Fahd-815/&gt;

===Earth sciences===
Parts of al-Dinawari's ''Book of Plants'' deals with the [[Earth sciences]] in the context of agriculture. He considers the Earth, stone and sands, and describes different types of ground, indicating which types are more convenient for plants and the qualities and properties of good ground.&lt;ref name=Fahd-815/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6328">'''Acting under a description''' is a conception of the [[intentionality]] of human action introduced by philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].

==G. E. M. Anscombe==
Anscombe wrote that a human action is intentional if the question "Why?", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application (''Intention'', par. 5-8).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Gertrude |last=Anscombe |author-link=G. E. M. Anscombe |title=Intention |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agent can answer the "Why?" question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. "To do Y" or "because I want to do Y" would be typical answers to this sort of "Why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life (sections 18-21). The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Moreover, the act is known without observation (''Intention'', section. 28). For example, a person knows without observation that their hands are pushing upwards and when asked what they are doing, they say they are opening the window. Hence, in their hands pushing upwards, they are opening the window; opening a window being a description of the intentional act.

Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description "pumping water" but not under other descriptions such as "contracting these muscles", "tapping out this rhythm", etc.

==Ian Hacking==
The implications of this philosophy of intentional action were extended by [[Ian Hacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ian |last=Hacking |author-link=Ian Hacking |title=Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personality and the Sciences of Memory |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is as follows: people talk about themselves as intentional beings. Descriptions of acts are almost always descriptions of how an act was intended. A person offers an explanation of why he or she acts thus and so. The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society in which the individual resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists as well as the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions; descriptions that can be assumed by an individual as he or she acts.

Acting under a description has important implications for interpreting our selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding the descriptions under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, the descriptions under which people act constitute the kind of act and the kind of person that commits the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hacking |first=Ian |year= 2007 |title=Kinds of People: Moving Targets |periodical=PROCEEDINGS-BRITISH ACADEMY |volume=151 |pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Curran |first=R |year=1997 |title=HACKING, IAN. Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personalities and the Sciences of Memory |periodical=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=174–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer "to show who's boss", "because I have ADHD", or "because I was provoked". Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them.

According to Hacking, selves are formed not only by humans' bio-physical constitution and the events we experience, but also by the descriptions we ascribe to the events that occur and the events we engage in. These descriptions are often causal descriptions: explanations of how we have come to be the persons that we are. A person does not come to be the person that she is simply because the events of her past caused her to be this person. Rather, the descriptions attributed to events in the past are a formative influence on her being. These explanations are replete with meaning and causal attribution. People are substantially (though not entirely) the people they understand themselves to be.

Acting under a description also has important implications for our interpretation of different societies and different eras. Hacking argues that descriptions change as the shared understandings of particular acts change. Hacking provides the following example. 17th-century courtiers tickled the genitalia of Louis XIII. Were they guilty of child abuse? The description of child abuse available in the 21st century did not exist in the 17th century. "In short, the charge of child abuse may be true of the past, but it was not true in the past. The description only becomes true with time. For Hacking, retroactive descriptions are, at the very least, controversial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past is indeterminate, not because acts simply may or may not have happened, but because the ascribed causes of those acts form an ever-shifting account depending on the ebb and flow of descriptions readily ascribed to those acts as the practices of society change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lynch |first=M |year=1995 |title=Review Symposium on Ian Hacking: Narrative Hooks and Paper Trails: the Writing of Memory |periodical=History of the Human Sciences |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Helena Margaretha (Annie) Romein-Verschoor''' was a Dutch author and historian.  She received the [[Constantijn Huygens Prize]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="dvn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Verschoor, Annie (1895-1978) |encyclopedia=Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland |first=Elias |last=Van der Plicht |date=23 January 2015 |url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/romein-verschoor |publisher=Huygens ING/[[Utrecht University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romein-Verschoor studied Dutch and history at the University of Leiden, where she met and married (on 14 August 1920) the Dutch journalist and historian [[Jan Romein]]. With her husband, she would author two popularizing books on Dutch history that established their national fame: ''De lage landen bij de zee'' ("The [[Low Countries]] by the sea", 1934), a [[Marxist historiography|Marxist]] national history that reached a wide audience, and ''Erflaters van onze beschaving'' ("[[:wikt:testator|Testators]] of our civilization, four volumes, 1938–1940), a collection of 36 biographies of famous Dutchmen (and one woman, [[Betje Wolff]]) of bygone centuries, seventeen of them written by Romein-Verschoor.{{r|dvn}} She joined the [[Communist Party of Holland|Communist Party]] in 1920 but had definitively left that organisation by 1937.{{r|bwsa}}

Romein-Verschoor's 1935 [[Ph.D. thesis]] was printed and published in 1936 as ''Vrouwenspiegel''. A study of female authorship in the Dutch language since 1880, the work was reprinted in 1977 and well received by the [[Second-wave feminism|resurgent feminist movement]] of the 1970s.{{r|bwn}}

During [[World War II in the Netherlands|World War II]], the Romeins were forced to go into hiding. In the following [[Cold War]] era, they were politically isolated as non-affiliated communists. Romein-Verschoor always remained true to the communist ideal, but publicly defended [[Boris Pasternak]] and denounced [[socialist realism]] as a "constant distorting of reality to match theory".{{r|bwsa}} Nevertheless, she was highly successful and popular as a writer.{{r|dvn}} Her 1970 [[autobiography]] ''Omzien in verwondering'' ("Looking back in wonder") became a [[bestseller]].{{r|bwsa}}

The '''architecture of Uzbekistan''' is considered as the symbol of the nations' history. In spite of changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts, the originality of [[Uzbek architecture]] can be seen in the country. 
[[Samarkand]], [[Bukhara]], [[Khiva]], [[Shakhrisabz]], [[Termez]] and [[Kokand]] are the most famous architectural centers of art and science. Particularly, palaces, mausoleums and mosques, minarets and ancient masterpieces are survived to capture the pages of history.
By confirming analytical facts from archeological researches about inhabiting the territory of [[Central Asia]], it is stated that trends in architecture are seen parallel to [[Acheulean era]]. In fact, several pieces of monuments belong to both stone and bronze ages have been found in the mountains of [[Surxondaryo Region|Surkhandarya]], [[Tashkent]], [[Samarkand]], [[Fergana]] and [[Navoi]] regions and in rivers’ valleys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Middle Ages, Uzbekistan was the center of the 7000-mile-long Silk Road, which enabled the flourish of architectural designs of Uzbek culture. Besides, Timurid-period architecture from 14th to 16th century, Shaybanid era of the 16th century resulted in the contribution of Islamic architecture and as well as Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/uzbekistan/culture/art_and_architecture.htm Middle ages] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
Till the 20th century, Uzbek architecture has been characterized by its connection with traditional background on the one hand, and modern innovation on the other.

== History ==
Splendid, colorful mosaics, religious symbols, and abstract geometrical patterns have always characterized historical construction in Uzbekistan. At first sight, the design seems beautiful itself while deeper look maintains geometrical and scientific intellect of abstractness.

== Pre-historic times==
The earliest traces of human habitation in the area of [[Uzbekistan]] are dated back many centuries. Turning details, information about ancient settlements proves that the earliest art of construction is [[Sapallitepa]] (17th-14th centuries BC) and [[Jarkutan]] (14th-9th centuries BC), as well as [[Buddhist monuments]], particularly [[Fayaztepa]] and [[Karatepa]], can be found in [[Surhandarya]] region (1st-3rd centuries AD). They all capture the stages of [[Central Asian]] civilization. One of the most important factor about Uzbek national history is the significance of the culture of ancient Khorezm. According to the life of [[Abu Rayhan Beruny]], it can be notified that the city established even 982 years before [[Alexander the Great]] invaded [[Central Asia]], or, in other words, 34 centuries ago. In other words, settlements of ancient [[Khorezm]] antiquityis defined by architectural masterpieces, such as [[Janbaskala]] (4th century BCE), [[Koi Krilgankala]] (2nd century BC – 4th century AD), [[Toprakkala]] (1st century BC – 6th century AD), Ayazkala (2nd century BC, on the territory of Republic of Karakalpakstan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval eras ==
[[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Khiva]] play a vital role in the influence of [[Middle Age]] architecture of [[Uzbekistan]]. For instance, palaces of the rulers, places of residence of aristocracy, market places, madrasah and mausoleums are confirmed as exceptional architectural patterns.

=== The Kyrk-Kyz ===
[[The Kyrk-Kyz]] ('Forty Girls') mansion in Termez dating back the 9th- 10th centuries is a fine example of an original country manor. [[The Samanids Mausoleum]] in [[Bukhara]] still stands as a fine architectural building from the marvelous period of early [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ulugh Beg Madrasah, was built in the times of Timurid Empire era of Timur, known as [[Tamerlane]]. By looking architectural point of view, it has a lancet-arch (pishtaq) or main square entrance. High minarets represent the beauty of the corners. There is a mosaic panel over the entrance arch, which was decorated by geometrical stylized ornaments. The building consists of mosque and lecture rooms, specialized for students. The walls have magnificent art galleries along the axes.

The construction of the Sher-Dar and Tilla-Kari madrasahs was ordered to be built in the 17th century. The tiger mosaics appear on the face of each madrasah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamic-arts.org/2014/the-registan-square/ About Registan] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lion(or tiger) on the Sher-dor madrassa.JPG|thumb|left|The image of a lion on the ''[[Sher-dar Madrasah]]'']]
Specifically, the uniqueness of Sher Dar madrasah is found as images of lion-tigers, deer, and human faces. They are not only just paintings, but also special symbols of power by the perceptions of Islam religion. The real design beauty and association between grand portal, decorated pillars, and other masterpieces are impossible to be captured in photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lxmagazines.com/2008/12/the-art-architecture-of-uzbekistan/ Sher-Dar Madrasah] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th and the beginning of 20th centuries constructions give e scene of typical residential architecture of an ordinary Uzbek citizens. While the buildings reflect the experiences of historical background and as well as local and modern conditions of the region. For instance, an inhabited house in Bukhara has a closed character and is isolated from the street noise and dust. Its isolated rooms were built according to the weather changes and create a unique microclimate in both the heat and cold. Further example is Khiva, with a high terrace opened to the wind promotes the creation of a favorable microclimate in houses. So, in [[Ferghana]], for example, houses had sliding walls and shutters, and were decorated with niches, ganch (wooden architecture), and other characteristic conditions. Besides, having very simple design styles, the national are veryrational and supplies the originality of Uzbek culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
It has been proved by the facts that special features of Uzbek architecture harmonize traditional originality of structure formation and consideration of microclimate. The magnificent cities of [[Tashkent]], Samarkand, Bukhara, [[Khiva]] are famous with such fantastic architectural ensembles as Khazrat Imam, Registan, Lyabi Khaus, Ichan Kala etc. Almost all historical cities of Central Asia are considered to be on the «Must seen places».&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Babylonokia''''' (also '''''Babylon-Nokia''''', '''''Alien-Mobile''''', and '''''Cuneiform Mobile Phone''''') is a 2012 artwork&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evon|first1=Dan|title=FALSE: 800-Year-Old Alien Cellphone Found|url=http://www.snopes.com/alien-cellphone-found/|website=snopes|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by Karl Weingärtner in the form of a clay tablet shaped like a [[mobile phone]], its keys and screen showing [[cuneiform script]].

Weingärtner created the work to represent the evolution of information transfer from the ancient world to the present.&lt;ref name="orf.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orf.at/stories/2316971/|title=Angeblich "Alien-Handy" in Österreich entdeckt - news.ORF.at|date=31 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fringe scientist]]s and [[alternative archaeology]] proponents&lt;ref name="Open Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openpr.com/news/416272/Centuries-Old-Cell-Phone-Artifact-Presents-Modern-Day-Mystery-Award-Winning-Author-Dana-Lyons-Sees-The-Possibilities-In-Such-An-Impossible-Scenario.html|title=Centuries Old Cell-Phone Artifact Presents Modern Day Mystery|date=19 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently misrepresented a photograph of the artwork as showing an 800-year-old archaeological find;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3379210/An-800-year-old-mobile-phone-left-ALIENS-Austria-according-latest-bizarre-claims-conspiracy-theorists.html|title=Conspiracy theorists think aliens left this phone behind 800 years ago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that story was popularised in a video on the YouTube channel ''[[Paranormal Crucible]]''&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ancient-babylonian-nokia-isnt-ancient-babylonian-nor-a-nokia_us_568d70abe4b0c8beacf5630b|title=Ancient Babylonian Cellphone Isn't Ancient, Babylonian Or A Phone|first1=David Moye|last1=Reporter|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=11 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the object being reported by some press sources as a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadajournal.net/science/is-this-an-800-year-old-mobile-phone-video-40526-2016/|title=Is this an 800-year-old mobile phone? (Video) - Canada Journal - News of the World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artwork ==
Weingärtner created the phone-styled clay tablet with cuneiform signs as a reaction to an exhibition at the [[Museum for Communication]] in Berlin titled ''From the Cuneiform to the SMS: Communication Once and Today'', as well as the negative, global effects of information technology.&lt;ref name="orf.at"/&gt; [[Cuneiform]] signals the beginning of written records of information.

The fact that it is a clay copy of what appears to be a [[Sony Ericsson]] S868 mobile phone,&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Aaron|title=Archeologists Discover 800-Year-Old Cell Phone Tablet-Fiction!|url=https://www.truthorfiction.com/archeologists-discover-800-year-old-cell-phone-tablet/|website=www.truthorfiction.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a model from the 1990s, had no meaning for the artist, who was using it as a metaphor for mobile devices in general.&lt;ref name="Open Press Release" /&gt;

The work of art is unique and is kept by the artist in a special depot. It is available on request as a loan for museums and exhibitions. It is made from clay, weighs 91 grams, and measures approximately {{convert|13.5|by|6.5|by|0.8|cm}}.

== Misrepresentation ==
Weingärtner posted a photo of the image on [[Facebook]] as part of a sale of his work,&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt; and a Facebook commenter coined the name "BabyloNokia".&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt; Three years later, the image was posted to the [[Conspiracy Club]] website with the headline "800-Year-Old Mobile Phone Found In Austria? Check This Out."&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt; The editor of ''UFO Sighting Daily'' reported that the Babylonokia image was proof that [[ancient astronaut]]s had visited Earth in the past.&lt;ref name="mail"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zolfagharifard|first1=Ellie|title=Conspiracy theorists think aliens left this phone behind 800 years ago|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3379210/An-800-year-old-mobile-phone-left-ALIENS-Austria-according-latest-bizarre-claims-conspiracy-theorists.html|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The [[Daily Express]]'', a British tabloid, reposted Weingärtner’s photo without attribution and claimed that the artefact had been dated to the 13th century BCE.&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt;

Speaking about the image's use by fringe websites and the press, Weingärtner said "The photo was used without my knowledge and without my consent. [...] It’s not what I wanted. I do not believe in UFOs and I do not believe in aliens."&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt;

These were erected shortly after the turn of the 20th century. It consists of five residences in Donkin Street, facing onto the Donkin Reserve. One of the residential homes is located at 14 Constitution Street and two others located at 8 and 10 Whitlock Street. The Donkin Street complex forms a notable row of terrace houses, and is one of the city's most prominent landmarks. Many of the landmarks have been declared national monuments. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/places/donkin-street-houses-port-elizabeth Accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://showme.co.za/port-elizabeth/tourism/port-elizabeths-colonial-past-on-the-donkin-heritage-trail/ Accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a replica of the Diaz Cross, commemorating the first European to sail into [[Algoa Bay]] in 1488. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/donkin-heritage-trail.htm Accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
==City Hall==

==Prester John Memorial==
The [[Prester John]] Memorial is a Coptic Cross with two figures inside it. It commemorates the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers who discovered [[South Africa]] as well as the story of a far older mythical figure named Prester John. Between the 12th and 18th centuries Prester John was believed to have been an early [[Christian]] King and one of the descendants of the [[Three Magi]] of Christian belief. He was the ‘patron’ of Christian exploration of the world and is seen as ‘a symbol to European Christians of the Church’s universality, transcending culture and geography to encompass all humanity’ and therefore a figurehead for Portuguese sailors and explorers.&lt;ref&gt;http://showme.co.za/port-elizabeth/tourism/port-elizabeths-heritage-monuments-and-memorials/ Accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campanile==
The Campanile is a 120-foot bell tower, which was built in the 1920s to commemorate the [[1820 Settlers]]. The first proposal for a memorial tower to commemorate the landing of the British Settlers of 1820, was made in 1904 by the Reverend Alfred E Hall, a minister of the Queen Street Baptist Church. On 9 April 1921, the foundation stone of the Campanile was laid by H R H Prince Arthur of Connaught, governor of the [[Union of South Africa]]. On 10 March 1922, the design for the Campanile was approved  and the contract for building the structure was subsequently awarded on 18 March 1922 to a local firm of builders, Harris and Harrower Limited. The tender was worth £6 150. It took approximately 18 months to complete the campanile. The dressed stone, used to construct the base, was taken from some of the oldest buildings in the city and the arched main doorway was built of stone quarried in [[Grahamstown]]. The tower is made of brick and reinforced with concrete. Each brick went through a quality test before being used. The structure, both base and belfry, is made of local brick faced with smooth, red Grahamstown bricks. The roof tiles were also obtained from Grahamstown.

Architecturally, the Campanile is well-proportioned, lofty and slender and simple. The structure is reminiscent of the famous St Mark's Campanile in Venice, which is 320 feet high. The Campanile in Port Elizabeth is 170 feet high from ground level to the tip of the pyramid roof. The area of the structure at the base is 23 feet square, its foundation resting upon sea-worn rock. The windows at different floor levels are fitted with decorative precast concrete grilles and the belfry. There are eight floors within the tower and to reach the observation floor, which is approximately 136 feet above the floor level of the reception area, the visitor has to climb 204 steps. The frieze of the reception area is artistically inscribed with brief details of the events connected with the erection of the Campanile.

The tower was erected at a final cost of £5 940, but there was neither clock nor bells for the proposed carillon, so that fund-raising was started for that purpose. The largest bell in the carillon is about 6 feet in diameter and weighs between three and four tons. The bells were hoisted into position in the belfry during July 1936 and the first recital on the carillon was given on 9 September by Lionel Field, Mus Bac, ARCM.

Six of the bells were sponsored by descendants of 1820 Settlers as a tribute to their forebears, or by others who wished to honour their memory. Details are embossed on each of the 23 bells which are engraved on a brass plaque affixed to a wall in the reception area of the Campanile.
Bells are rung from the campanile three times a day. The 204-step spiral staircase leads to views over [[Algoa Bay]]. The Campanile is partially overshadowed by the Settler's Freeway, however, it remains a focal point of the city's built environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/donkin-heritage-trail.htm Accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://showme.co.za/port-elizabeth/tourism/port-elizabeths-heritage-monuments-and-memorials/ Accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elsecar Heritage Centre''' is a [[living history]] centre in [[Elsecar]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley|Barnsley]], England.

==Heritage Centre==
The buildings were originally used for various industries including [[ironworks]] and [[forge]]s, a [[distillery]], and engineering workshops. These fell into decline when the [[coal mines]] in the village closed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elsecar-heritage.com/|title=Elsecar - Official website|last=Jepson|first=Ledgard|website=www.elsecar-heritage.com|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barnsley-museums.com/elsecar|title=Barnsley Museums - Official website - Elsecar|last=Jepson|first=Ledgard|website=www.barnsley-museums.com|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has its own [[Elsecar goods station]] (called Rockingham Station) on the [[Elsecar Steam Railway]], with a running shed behind the main centre. During some special events, trips are run to [[Hemingfield|Hemingfield Basin]]. There are plans to extend the line to [[Cortonwood]] and build two stations (one at Cortonwood and the other at Hemingfield). The railway's depot is home to a selection of [[steam locomotive]]s as well as a [[diesel locomotive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsecarrailway.co.uk/|title=Home|website=www.elsecarrailway.co.uk|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comprises [[retailing|shops]], galleries, art studios and an exhibition hall. It runs [[craft]] workshops, special events, and a monthly [[antiques]] fair. 

Elsecar Heritage Centre hosts the [[16 mm scale|16mm]] [[Garden railway|Garden Railway]] Show every year which is organised by the Yorkshire Group of 16mm Narrow Gauge Modellers Ltd.

In March 2017 it was announced that the ''Great Place Scheme'' a partnership between [[Arts Council England]], the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and [[Historic England]] was to jointly fund [[Wentworth Woodhouse]] and Elsecar Heritage Centre with a £1,264,000 grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greatplacescheme.org.uk/more-information-about-great-place-scheme|title=More Information about the Great Place Scheme {{!}} Great Place Scheme|website=www.greatplacescheme.org.uk|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/news/article/1140/south_yorkshire_villages_of_elsecar_and_wentworth_to_receive_funding_of_12_million|title=South Yorkshire villages of Elsecar and Wentworth to receive funding of £1.2 million|last=Ellis|first=Joanne|website=www.rotherham.gov.uk|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/culture/venues/a_f/elsecar_heritage_centre.shtml|title=BBC - South Yorkshire Culture - Elsecar Heritage Centre|work=BBC News|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsecar Engine===
[[File:Elsecar Newcomen engine.jpg|alt=Elsecar Newcomen engine|thumb|Elsecar Newcomen engine]]
The centre is also the site of the only [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen beam engine]] in the world still in its original location. The Newcomen Engine was built at the instruction of [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|William Wentworth, the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnsley.gov.uk/media/4049/elsecar-appraisal-draft2.pdf|title=Elsecar Appraisal|last=|first=|date=|website=Barnsley Council|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to pump water out of [[Elsecar New Colliery]] and ran from 1795 until 1923 when it was replaced by electric pumps. The date over the door of the Engine House is 1787, but there is some dispute that the engine was not actually installed until 1795.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1836 the Graham brothers, a local partnership cast a new beam and two parallel motions for the Newcomen engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It also ran briefly in 1928 when the electric pumps were overwhelmed by flooding. At its peak it could draw 600 gallons a minute.  In 1972 the engine was classified as a [[scheduled ancient monument]]. The engine was restored to working order (worked by [[hydraulics]]) over the period 2012&amp;ndash;14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Alan|last=McEwen|title=Elsecar's Newcomen engine restored|journal=Old Glory|issue=299|date=January 2015|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=314723|mname=ELSECAR COLLIERY PUMPING ENGINE|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-18526408|title=Elsecar's 'outstanding' relic for restoration|date=20 June 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franjo Rački''' (25 November 1828 – 13 February 1894) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] historian, politician and writer. He compiled important collections of old Croatian diplomatic and historical documents, wrote some pioneering historical works, and was a key founder of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

==Historian==

Rački was born in [[Fužine, Croatia|Fužine]], near [[Rijeka]]. He completed his secondary education in [[Senj]] and [[Varaždin]]. He graduated theology in Senj, where he was ordained [[Catholicism|Catholic]] priest by the bishop Ožegović in 1852. Rački received his PhD in theology in [[Vienna]] in 1855.

His career as a historian began as soon as he started working as a teacher in Senj. An industrious man, full of patriotic fervor, Rački organized the research of [[Glagolitic]] documents on the islands of [[Kvarner]]. He often went to the village of [[Baška]] on [[Krk]], the location of the famous [[Baška Tablet]]. After analyzing the tablet for a long time, he published ''Viek i djelovanje sv. Cirilla i Methoda slavjamkih apošlolov'' (The Age and Activities of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], the Apostles among the [[Slavs]]).

He was moved from Senj to Rome in 1857. There he worked in the [[Croatian Institute of St Jerome]] for three years, in difficult circumstances. He went around Roman archives in search of documents on Croatian history. He also attended courses in [[paleography]] and related historical sciences.

In Rome he found many documents on [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], collected by the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] struggle against that [[heresy]]. Fifteen years later, Rački would publish ''Bogomili i Patareni'', a milestone in the research on the [[Bosnian Church]]. In the book, Rački founded the "Bogomil [[hypothesis]]", saying that the Bosnian Church was influenced by the [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] heretic teachings from [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], originating in the 9th century. As it was very controversial and intriguing, that theory dominated the research for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but its general premises have been mostly refuted.

Although Rački is more important as a promoter of culture than as a historian, his original historical works are important for their pioneering nature and wealth of information. Aside from the mentioned ''Bogomili i patareni'', he wrote ''Povjesnik Ivan Lučić'' (The Historian [[Joannes Lucius]]), ''Nutarnje stanje Hrvatske prije XII. stoljeća'' (The Internal Organization of Croatia Before the 12th Century), ''Stari grb bosanski'' (The Old Bosnian Coat of Arms), ''Povelje bosanskog kralja Tvrtka'' (Documents of the [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Bosnian king Tvrtko]]). The pinnacle of his scientific work is the monumental ''Documenta historiae Croaticae periodum antiaquam illustrantia''.

==Academy==
[[Image:Franjo Racki.JPG|right|thumb|Bas-relief of Franjo Rački]]
He started ''[[Književnik]]'', the first Croatian scientific magazine for history and linguistics, and ''[[Obzor (magazine)|Obzor]]'' and ''[[Vijenac]]'', very influential magazines for culture and politics. He was a key founder of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslavian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and greatly contributed to the expansion of the [[University of Zagreb]]. Rački founded most editions of the Academy, which are published even today: ''Rad'', ''Starine'', and the ''Codex diplomaticus Regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae'', an exceptional monument of legal history. He founded the Academy library, archive and dictionary. His activities determined the work of the Academy for several decades, especially in its cultural and social aspects.

==Politician==

In 1861, as the church representative from Senj, he became a member of the [[Croatian Parliament]], convened after a pause of 12 years. Along with [[Ante Starčević]], Rački was the only peasant's child in the parliament.

Rački was a prolific political writer. He wrote about all the important Croatia-related topics and issues of his time. He promoted the merging of [[Dalmatia]] with Croatia ruled by the ''[[Ban (title)|ban]]'', he wrote discussions about the Croatian nature of [[Srijem]] and [[Rijeka]], but he spent most energy on analyzing the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|relationships between Croatia and Hungary]], fighting against the Hungarian expansionism. Along with the bishop [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]], Rački was a partisan of the idea of [[Yugoslavia]]. They both promoted the cultural and political unity of the [[South Slavs]].

He died in [[Zagreb]].

'''''Freedom and Destiny: Gender, Family and Popular Culture in India''''' is a book consisting of eight essays by Indian [[Feminism|feminist]] and sociologist Patricia Uberoi. The book, which was published by Oxford University Press in New Delhi in 2006 looks at the site of [[popular culture]] to examine institutions such as the Indian Family, the conjugal unit, the symbol of the woman as well as the iconography of the baby and child in the Indian imagination. The essays in the book, with the exception of the introduction, had previously appeared in various books and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review|jstor = 23620719|journal = Sociological Bulletin|date = 2007-01-01|pages = 154–156|volume = 56|issue = 1|first = Kulwinder|last = Kaur}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparate essays were collected into a volume. Patricia Uberoi begins the volume by reflecting on the wider implications of the misspelled epithet 'Beautiful Wife, Denger Life' seen at the back of a New Delhi truck. These reflections form a starting point for the essays that follow in the volume.

== Synopsis ==

The book which is divided into eight chapters looks at three sites of popular culture in order to identify the contradictions built into family and social life. These are the sites of Calendar Art, Popular Cinema and Romance Fiction.

=== Calendar Art === 
Patricia Uberoi traces the calendar art form ( mass-produced colour prints) in India back to its early imaginings in the late nineteenth century colonial India. She examines how the highly visibilized figure of the woman's body in this art form is both cemented as an object of desire and presented as a commodity for sale. However the figure of the woman is not only contained in the lens of commodification and objectification but also becomes a symbol of a consistently modernising nation. Representations of [[Devi|Hindu Goddesses]], either as consorts of Hindu Gods or in their capacities as mothers are also examined for their social and political implications. Varied notions of femininity and womanliness are examined through this medium. Uberoi's work joins a number of emerging discourses on the print economies and varied interpretations of calendar art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Indian calendar art: the popular picture story|url = https://www.opendemocracy.net/openindia/habiba-insaf/indian-calendar-art-popular-picture-story|website = openDemocracy|accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the baby or child in calendar art is also noted in the book. Babies are variedly represented as the God-Baby, the Welcome Baby, the Hero Baby, the Citizen Baby, and the Customized Baby. Uberoi does not only examine the art form but also reflects upon the socio-political economies that contributed to its emergence and popularity.

=== Popular Cinema ===  
Uberoi uses four extremely popular [[Bollywood]] films – [[Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam|''Sahib, Bibi aur Ghulam'']], ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!|Hum Aapke Hain Kaun]]'', ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge|Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge]]'' and {{clarify|date=January 2016}} [[Pardes (film)|''Pardes'']] to examine a variety of themes, ideas and institutions reproduced in Hindi Cinema as well as to comment on the general conventions of the art form, which spaces allow for patriarchal power to be reinforced and which spaces allow for a subversion of this power. The chapter on Sahib, Bibi aur Ghulam explores how the cinematic narrative focuses on the tussle between individual desire and social duty and  freedom and destiny within the man-woman relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Dialogue of Ideas|url = http://www.thebookreviewindia.org/articles/archives-2634/2007/march/3/a-dialogue-of-ideas.html|website = www.thebookreviewindia.org|accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter on Hum Aapke Hain Kaun is an [[ethnography]] of the viewing of the film and is a close look at the Indian Family and how it negotiates power and duty. Through her examination of the films ''Pardes'' and ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge'', Uberoi looks at the Indian Diaspora and notions of home and country.

=== Romance Fiction === 
Patricia Uberoi looks at how the narratives of romantic fiction published in the English Language magazine ''Woman's Era'' serves important and cautionary functions for its women readers. Uberoi takes care to mention that this art form is not received in exactly the same way that romance fiction in the West is received even though the plots and styles may sound similar. This section looks at how the often formulaic plots offer up a range of plattitudes for happy hetero-normative conjugal and family life.

== Original Title ==

In the preface to the book, Uberoi explains that she had intended the title of the book to be 'Dharma and Desire' in order to encapsulate Indian feminists engagement with the tussle between female desire and 'culturally normative expectations of feminine deportment.' She later changed the title to ''Freedom and Destiny'' so that one could identify the [[moral economy]] of family and social life as well see how notions of modernity ruptured individual autonomy and freedom for both men and women.

[[Image:Geological time spiral.png|thumb|right|300px|An artistic depiction of the major events in the history of Earth]]

'''Geochronology''' is the [[science]] of [[Chronological dating|determining the age]] of [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[fossil]]s, and [[sediment]]s using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves.  Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through radioactive isotopes, whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as [[palaeomagnetism]] and stable isotope ratios.  By combining multiple geochronological (and biostratigraphic) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.

Geochronology is different in application from [[biostratigraphy]], which is the science of assigning sedimentary rocks to a known geological period via describing, cataloguing and comparing fossil floral and faunal assemblages. Biostratigraphy does not ''directly'' provide an absolute age determination of a rock, but merely places it within an ''interval'' of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted. Both disciplines work together hand in hand however, to the point where they share the same system of naming [[stratum|rock layers]] and the time spans utilized to classify layers within a stratum.

The science of geochronology is the prime tool used in the discipline of [[chronostratigraphy]], which attempts to derive absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages and determine the geologic [[History of Earth|history of the Earth]] and extraterrestrial bodies.

== Dating methods ==
{{Geology to Paleobiology}}

=== Radiometric dating ===
{{main|Radiometric dating}}
By measuring the amount of [[radioactive decay]] of a [[radioactive isotope]] with a known [[half-life]], geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time, but less accurate in absolute years. With the exception of the [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon method]], most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a [[radiogenic]] isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope.&lt;ref&gt;Dickin, A. P. 1995. ''Radiogenic Isotope Geology''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-59891-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faure, G. 1986. ''Principles of isotope geology''.

Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-38437-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more radiometric methods can be used in concert to achieve more robust results.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple G. B., Grove M., Lovera O.

Some of the commonly used techniques are:
* [[Radiocarbon dating]]. This technique measures the decay of [[carbon-14]] in organic material and can be best applied to samples younger than about 60,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Plastino |first=W. |authorlink= |author2=Kaihola, L. |author3=Bartolomei, P. |author4=Bella, F. |year=2001 |title=Cosmic Background Reduction In The Radiocarbon Measurement By Scintillation Spectrometry At The Underground Laboratory Of Gran Sasso |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=43 |issue=2A |pages=157–161 |id= |url=https://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/volume43/number2A/azu_radiocarbon_v43_n2a_157_161_v.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080527225654/https://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/volume43/number2A/azu_radiocarbon_v43_n2a_157_161_v.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-27 |accessdate= |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Uranium–lead dating]].  This technique measures the ratio of two lead [[isotope]] s(lead-206 and lead-207) to the amount of uranium in a mineral or rock.  Often applied to the trace mineral [[zircon]] in [[igneous rock]]s, this method is one of the two most commonly used (along with [[argon–argon dating]]) for geologic dating.  [[Monazite geochronology]] is another example of U–Pb dating, employed for dating metamorphism in particular. Uranium–lead dating is applied to samples older than about 1 million years.
* [[Uranium–thorium dating]]. This technique is used to date [[speleothem]]s, [[coral]]s, [[carbonate]]s, and fossil [[bone]]s.  Its range is from a few years to about 700,000 years.
* [[Potassium–argon dating]] and [[argon–argon dating]]. These techniques  date [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[volcanic rock|volcanic]] rocks. They are also used to date [[volcanic ash]] layers within or overlying [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologic]] sites.  The younger limit of the argon–argon method is a few thousand years.
* [[Electron spin resonance]] (ESR) dating

=== Fission-track dating ===
{{main|Fission track dating}}

=== Cosmogenic nuclide geochronology ===
{{Main|Cosmogenic radionuclide dating}}
A series of related techniques for determining the age at which a geomorphic surface was created ([[Cosmogenic dating|exposure dating]]), or at which formerly [[Surficial deposit|surficial materials]] were buried (burial dating).  [[Cosmogenic dating|Exposure dating]] uses the concentration of exotic nuclides (e.g.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be, &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al,  &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl) produced by cosmic rays interacting with Earth materials as a proxy for the age at which a surface, such as an alluvial fan, was created.  Burial dating uses the differential radioactive decay of 2 cosmogenic elements as a proxy for the age at which a sediment was screened by burial from further cosmic rays exposure.

=== Luminescence dating ===
Luminescence dating techniques observe 'light' emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite.  Many types of luminescence techniques are utilized in geology, including [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), [[cathodoluminescence]] (CL), and [[thermoluminescence]] (TL). [[Thermoluminescence]] and [[optically stimulated luminescence]] are used in archaeology to date 'fired' objects such as pottery or cooking stones, and can be used to observe sand migration.

=== Incremental dating ===
{{Main|Incremental dating}}
[[Incremental dating]] techniques allow the construction of year-by-year annual chronologies, which can be fixed (''i.e.'' linked to the present day and thus [[calendar]] or [[sidereal time|sidereal]] time) or floating.

* [[Dendrochronology]]
* [[Ice core]]s
* [[Lichenometry]]
* [[Varve]]s

=== Paleomagnetic dating ===
A sequence of paleomagnetic poles (usually called virtual geomagnetic poles), which are already well defined in age, constitutes an apparent polar wander path (APWP). Such path is constructed for a large continental block. APWPs for different continents can be used as a reference for newly obtained poles for the rocks with unknown age. For paleomagnetic dating it is suggested to use the APWP in order to date a pole obtained from rocks or sediments of unknown age by linking the paleopole to the nearest point on the APWP. Two methods of paleomagnetic dating have been suggested (1) Angular method and (2) Rotation method.&lt;ref&gt;Hnatyshin, D., and Kravchinsky, V.A., 2014. Paleomagnetic dating: Methods, MATLAB software, example. Tectonophysics, doi: 10.1016/j.tecto.2014.05.013  [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2014.05.013]&lt;/ref&gt; First method is used for paleomagnetic dating of rocks inside of the same continental block. Second method is used for the folded areas where tectonic rotations are possible.

=== Magnetostratigraphy ===
{{Main|Magnetostratigraphy}}
[[Magnetostratigraphy]] determines age from the pattern of magnetic polarity zones in a series of bedded sedimentary and/or volcanic rocks by comparison to the magnetic polarity timescale.  The polarity timescale has been previously determined by dating of seafloor magnetic anomalies, radiometrically dating volcanic rocks within magnetostratigraphic sections, and astronomically dating magnetostratigraphic sections.

=== Chemostratigraphy ===
Global trends in isotope compositions, particularly Carbon 13 and strontium isotopes, can be used to correlate strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The falling amplitude of carbon isotopic oscillations through the Lower to Middle Cambrian: northern Siberia data|first1=M D|last1=Brasier|first2=S S|last2=Sukhov|date=1 April 1998|journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=35|issue=4|pages=353–373|doi=10.1139/e97-122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Correlation of marker horizons ===
[[File:Icelandic tephra.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Tephra horizons in south-central [[Iceland]]. The thick and light-to-dark coloured layer at the height of the [[volcanologists]] hands is a marker horizon of [[rhyolitic]]-to-[[basalt]]ic [[tephra]] from [[Hekla]].]]
[[Marker horizon]]s are stratigraphic units of the same age and of such distinctive composition and appearance, that despite their presence in different geographic sites, there is certainty about their age-equivalence. Fossil faunal and floral [[fossil|assemblage]]s, both marine and terrestrial, make for distinctive marker horizons.&lt;ref&gt;Demidov, I.N. 2006. Identification of marker horizon in bottom sediments of the Onega Periglacial Lake. ''Doklady Earth Sciences'', '''407''', 213-216 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m157212n413t5257/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tephrochronology]] is a method for geochemical correlation of unknown volcanic ash (tephra) to geochemically fingerprinted, dated [[tephra]]. [[Tephra]] is also often used as a dating tool in archaeology, since the dates of some eruptions are well-established.

== Differences from chronostratigraphy ==
It is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units.&lt;ref&gt;David Weishampel: ''The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs'', 1996, Cambridge Press, {{ISBN|0-521-44496-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geochronological units are periods of time, thus it is correct to say that ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex'' lived during the Late [[Cretaceous]] Epoch.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Jackson: ''Glossary of Geology'', 1987, American Geological Institute, {{ISBN|0-922152-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is also correct to say that fossils of the genus ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.B., Lamanna, M.C., Lacovara, K.J., Dodson, P. Jnr., Poole, J.C. and Giegengack, R. 2001. A Giant Sauropod Dinosaur from an Upper Cretaceous Mangrove Deposit in Egypt. ''Science'', '''292''', 1704-1707 {{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/292/5522/1704 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908110026/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/292/5522/1704 |archivedate=2008-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, it is entirely possible to go and visit an Upper Cretaceous Series deposit – such as the [[Hell Creek]] deposit where the ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' fossils were found – but it is naturally impossible to visit the Late Cretaceous Epoch as that is a period of time.

'''Sir George Norman Clark''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (27 February 1890 – 6 February 1979) was an English historian, academic and [[British Army]] officer. He was the [[Chichele Professor of Economic History]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1931 to 1943 and the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at [[The University of Cambridge]] from 1943 to 1947. He served as [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Oriel College, Oxford]] from 1947 to 1957.

==Early life==
Clark was born on 27 February 1890 in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], Yorkshire, England, to James Walker Clark and his wife Mary Clark (née Midgley).&lt;ref name="bio - Munks Roll" /&gt; He was educated at [[Bootham School]], an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] [[boarding school]] in [[York]], and at [[Manchester Grammar School]], a [[Grammar School]] in Manchester.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

In 1908, he matriculated into [[Balliol College, Oxford]] to study classics as a Brackenbury Scholar.&lt;ref name="obit - American Historical Association"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent Deaths|journal=The American Historical Review|date=October 1980|volume=85|issue=4|pages=1050–51|jstor=1869127|publisher=American Historical Association|doi=10.1086/567686}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he achieved a [[first class honours|first class]] in ''[[Literae Humaniores]]''.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; He then changed to modern history and graduated in 1912 with a first class honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.&lt;ref name="obit - American Historical Association" /&gt; In 1912, he was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]] and spent time abroad learning foreign languages.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

==Career==

===Military service===
Clark had been a member of the [[Officers' Training Corps]] attached to the [[University of Oxford]] during his studies.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whiteman|first1=Anne|title=Clark, Sir George Norman (1890–1979)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30933|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 July 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 1914, he was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] into the [[Post Office Rifles]], [[British Army]], as a [[second lieutenant]].&lt;ref name="LG 25 August 1914"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28879 |date=25 August 1914 |page=6708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 1915, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]].&lt;ref name="LG 5 May 1916"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29568 |date=5 May 1916 |page=4462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of [[World War I]], he was wounded twice.&lt;ref name="bio - Munks Roll" /&gt;

In May 1916, while fighting in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], he was taken [[Prisoner of war|prisoner]] by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir George Clark.|work=The Times|issue=60478|date=19 November 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his capture, he held the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News in Brief.|work=The Times|issue=41191|date=12 June 1916|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was held in [[Gütersloh]] and [[Krefeld]], and spent his time learning languages.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; He was also involved in writing plays for fellow prisoners to perform, one of which was performed postwar at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], London.&lt;ref name="bio - Munks Roll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir George Norman Clark|website=Munks Roll|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/860|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released at the end of hostilities and returned to Britain.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

===Academic career===
Having been elected a [[Fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford]] in 1912, Clark's academic career truly started in 1919 when he was elected a Fellow and lecturer of [[Oriel College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="obit - American Historical Association" /&gt;

He became the inaugural [[Chichele Professor of Economic History]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1931 (with the accompanying [[Fellow]]ship at [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]]), a post he held until 1943. From then until 1947 he was [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at [[Cambridge University]] and a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Between 1947 and 1957, he was [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Oriel College, Oxford]].

Clark wrote a general [[foreword|introduction]] to the second edition of the ''[[Cambridge Modern History]]'' (1957), criticising the belief of some historians (in particular [[Lord Acton]] who had edited the first edition over half a century earlier) that eventually it would be possible to write an "ultimate history", rather they should expect their works to be built on and superseded by later historians. He stated that "knowledge of the past has come down through one or more human minds, has been processed by them, and therefore cannot consist of elemental and impersonal atoms which nothing can alter..."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cambridge Modern History'', I, (1957), pp. xxiv–xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1930s and 1960s, Clark was the editor overseeing the ''[[Oxford History of England]]'' series and wrote Volume X: ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (1934), which was the first of the series to be published. His ''The Seventeenth Century'' appeared in 1929, and he wrote numerous other monographs.  He was twice editor of the ''[[English Historical Review]]''.

He delivered the Wiles Lectures in the Queen's University of Belfast in October 1956. They were published as ''War and Society in the Seventeenth Century'' (Cambridge UP, 1958).&lt;ref&gt;It is [https://www.questia.com/library/86076191/war-and-society-in-the-seventeenth-century online at Questia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
He was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=39904 |page=3676 |date=3 February 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clark was elected [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA) in 1936.&lt;ref name="bio - British Academy"&gt;{{cite web|title=CLARK, Sir (27/02/1890-06/02/1979) |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/dec.cfm?member=3424 |website=British Academy Fellows |publisher=British Academy |accessdate=2 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213133/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/dec.cfm?member=3424 |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Foreign Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Changes in the Membership 1979–1980|journal=Records of the Academy|date=1979|issue=1979|page=50|jstor=3785693|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Posen 1905.png|thumb|right|250px|German 1905 map showing the extent of the Polish-speaking majority in [[Greater Poland]]]]
Following the [[Partitions of Poland]] in late 18th century, a large part of the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (namely the regions of [[Greater Poland]] and [[Royal Prussia|Royal]], the later [[West Prussia]]) was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the predecessor of the [[German Empire]], which was formed in 1871. Primarily inhabited by Poles, Greater Poland initially was formed into a semi-autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], granted with a certain level of self-governance. However, under [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s government, the ethnic and cultural tensions in the region began to rise. This was paired by growing tendencies of [[nationalism]], [[imperialism]], and [[chauvinism]] within the German society.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bartłomiej Kozłowski |title=Założenie "Hakaty" (Founding of "H-K-T") |publisher=Polska.pl |year=2005 |work=Kalendarium Polska.pl |url=http://kalendarium.polska.pl/wydarzenia/article.htm?id=135224 |accessdate=2009-07-11 |language=pl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231736/http://kalendarium.polska.pl/wydarzenia/article.htm?id=135224 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tendencies went in two different directions, but were linked to each other. On one hand, a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]] was demanded with desires of creating a German [[colonialism|colonial empire]]. And on the other, feelings of hostility towards other national groups within the German state were growing.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"/&gt;

The situation was further aggravated by Bismarck's policies of [[Kulturkampf]] that in Posen Province took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany&lt;ref name="Kaczmarek_Prinke"&gt;{{cite web | author1=Jarmila Kaczmarek | author2=Andrzej Prinke | year=2000 | title=Two Archaeologies in one Country: Official Prussian versus amateur Polish activities in Mid-Western (i.e.: Greater) Poland in XIXth-early XXth cent. | work=Poznań Archaeological Museum publications | url=http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/archweb/archweb_eng/Publications/dwarch/index_dwa.html | accessdate=February 16, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303072621/http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/archweb/archweb_eng/Publications/dwarch/index_dwa.html | archivedate=March 3, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and included a number of specifically anti-Polish laws that resulted in the Polish and German communities living in a virtual [[apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Kitchen-Apartheid"&gt;Martin Kitchen, op.cit., [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1405100419&amp;id=_04R6DoPxLoC&amp;pg=PA130 p.130]&lt;/ref&gt; Many observers believed these policies only further stoked the Polish independence movement. There is also a question regarding possible personal antipathy towards Poles behind Bismarck's motivation in pursuing the Kulturkampf.{{efn|name=Bismarck_speech|As evidenced by some of his remarks and speeches, for instance the one to the Lower House of the Prussian Parliament of January 28, 1886, in: {{cite book | title =Bismarcks Reden | editor =Eugen Kalkschmidt | pages =173–186 | publisher =Deutsche Bibliothek | location =Berlin | url =http://h-net.org/~german/gtext/kaiserreich/speech.html |language=de}}}} Unlike in other parts of the [[German Empire]], in Greater Poland&amp;mdash;then known under the German name of ''[[Provinz Posen]]''&amp;mdash;the Kulturkampf did not cease after the end of the decade. Although Bismarck finally signed an informal alliance with the Catholic Church against the socialists, the policies of [[Germanization]] did continue in Polish-inhabited parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Kaczmarek_Prinke"/&gt; However, with the end of von Bismarck's rule and the advent of [[Leo von Caprivi]], the pressure for Germanisation was lessened&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt; and many German landowners feared that this would lead to lessening the German control over the Polish areas and in the end deprive Germany of what they saw as a natural reservoir of workforce and land.&lt;ref name="Cienciala"&gt;{{cite web | author=Anna M. Cienciala|title=Lecture 6: Poland 1864&amp;ndash;1914|publisher=[[University of Kansas]] | year=2004 | work=Nationalism and Communism in East Central Europe | url=http://web.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect6.htm | accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the actual extent of von Caprivi's concessions towards the Poles was very limited, the German minority of Greater Poland feared that this was a step too far, and that von Caprivi's government would cede the power in Greater Poland to the Polish clergy and nobility.&lt;ref name="Eley"/&gt; The Hakata slogan was: "You are standing opposite to the most dangerous, fanatic enemy of German existence, German honour and German reputation in the world: The Poles."&lt;ref name="Zeit"/&gt;

==Society ==
Under such circumstances a number of nationalist organizations and [[pressure group]]s was formed, all collectively known as the ''[[nationale Verbände]]''. Among them were the [[Pan-German League]], [[Navy League (Germany)|German Navy League]], [[German Colonial Society]], [[German Anti-Semitic Organization]], and the [[German Defence League|Defence League]].&lt;ref name="Verbande"&gt;Geoff Eley, op.cit., [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0472081322&amp;id=3YizSyLkP6wC&amp;pg=PR7 p.VII]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polenz"&gt;{{cite book | author =Peter von Polenz | title =Deutsche Sprachgeschichte 3: vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart.: 19.

It was officially launched November 3, 1894 in [[Poznań]], then referred to under its German name of ''Posen''. The opening meeting elected an assembly and a general committee composed of 227 members, among them 104 from the [[Province of Posen]] and [[Province of West Prussia]], and additional 113 from other parts of [[German Empire]]. The social base of the newly founded society was wide and included a large spectrum of people. Some 60% of the representatives of areas of Germany primarily inhabited by Poles were the [[Junker]]s, the landed aristocracy, mostly with [[uradel|ancient feudal roots]]. The rest were all groups of middle class Germans, that is civil servants (30%), teachers (25%), merchants, craftsmen, Protestant priests, and clerks.&lt;ref name="Eley"/&gt;

The official aims of the society was "strengthening and rallying of [[Germandom]] in the Eastern Marches through the revival and consolidation of German national feeling and the economic strengthening of the German people" in the area.&lt;ref name="Eley"/&gt; This was seen as justified due to alleged passivity of Germans in the eastern territories. Officially it was to work for the Germans rather than against the Poles.&lt;ref name="Eley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt; However, in reality the aims of the society were anti-Polish and aimed at ousting the Polish landowners and peasants from their land at all cost.&lt;ref name="Talmon"&gt;{{cite book | author =Jacob L.

It was argued that either the Poles would be successfully Germanized, or the Germans living in the east would face the Polonization themselves. This conflict was often portrayed as a constant biological struggle&lt;ref name="Bullivant"&gt;{{cite book | author =Keith Bullivant |author2=Geoffrey Giles |author3=Walter Pape  | title=Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences | year = 1999| editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Rodopi | location = | isbn =90-420-0688-9 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jXKk-gs-VNEC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;q=Marches&amp;vq=Marches&amp;dq=Deutscher+Ostmarkenverein+1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between the "eastern barbarity" and "European culture".&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt; To counter the alleged threat, the Society promoted the destruction of Polish national identity in the Polish lands held by Germany,&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; and prevention of ''[[polonization]]'' of the Eastern Marches, that is the growing national sentiment amongst local Poles paired with migration of Poles from rural areas to the cities of the region.&lt;ref name="Grimmer-Solem"&gt;{{cite book | author =Erik Grimmer-Solem | title =The Rise of Historical Economics and Social Reform in Germany 1864-1894 | year = 2003| pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Oxford University Press | location =Oxford | isbn =0-19-926041-9 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=SsJCgbUgCVQC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=%22Eastern+Marches%22+1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the views of Chancellor von Bismarck himself, the Society saw the language question as a key factor in determining one's loyalty towards the state.&lt;ref name="Kitchen"&gt;{{cite book | author =Martin Kitchen | title =A History Of Modern Germany 1800-2000 | year = 2006| pages =129–131 | publisher =Blackwell Publishing | location = | isbn =1-4051-0040-0 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=SZGd4niiMdsC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Ostmarkenverein+1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holborn"&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Hajo Holborn]] | title =A History of Modern Germany, Volume 3: 1840&amp;ndash;1945 | year = 1982| editor = | pages =352–355 | publisher =[[Princeton University]] Press | location =Princeton | isbn =0-691-00797-7 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4pLQ1jC1JIC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=%22Eastern+Marches%22+1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this view, it insisted on extending the ban on usage of the [[Polish language]] in schools, to other instances of everyday life, including public meetings, books, and newspapers. During a 1902 meeting in [[Danzig]] (modern Gdańsk), the Society demanded from the government that the Polish language be banned even from voluntary classes in schools and universities, that the language be banned from public usage and that the Polish language newspapers be either liquidated or forced to be printed in [[bilingual]] versions.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"/&gt;

With limited local success and support, the Ostmarkenverein functioned primarily as a nationwide [[propaganda]] and [[pressure group]].&lt;ref name="Holborn"/&gt; Its press organ, the ''Die Ostmark'' (Eastern March) was one of the primary sources of information on the ''Polish Question'' for the German public and shaped the national-conservative views towards the ethnic conflict in the eastern territories of Germany. The Society also opened a number of libraries in the Polish-dominated areas, where it supported the literary production of books and novels promoting an aggressive stance against the Poles.&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt;  The popular ''Ostmarkenromane''(Ostmark novels) depicted Poles as non-white and struggled to portray a two race dichotomy between "black" Poles and "white" Germans&lt;ref&gt;Germany's colonial pasts Eric Ames, Marcia Klotz, Lora Wildenthal, page 84&amp;ndash;86, University of Nebraska Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it did not limit itself to mere cultural struggle for domination but also promoted a physical removal of the Poles from their lands in order to make space for the German colonization.&lt;ref name="Bullivant"/&gt; The pressure of the H-K-T indeed made the government of [[Leo von Caprivi|von Caprivi]] adopt a firmer stance against the Poles.&lt;ref name="Kitchen"/&gt; The ban on Polish schools was reintroduced and all teaching was to be done in [[German language]]. The ban was also used by the German police to harass the Polish [[trade union]] movement as they interpreted all public meetings as educational undertakings.&lt;ref name="Tooley"&gt;{{cite book | author =T. Hunt Tooley | title =National Identity and Weimar Germany: Upper Silesia and the Eastern Border, 1918&amp;ndash;1922 | year = 1997| chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =University of Nebraska Press | location = | isbn =0-8032-4429-0 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=bGiIDCsbS1QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA15&amp;lpg=RA1-PA15&amp;dq=Eastern+Marches+Society| page =15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important issue was the colonisation of Polish territory: the organisation actively supported the nationalist policy of [[Germanisation]] through removal of Polish population and promoting settlement of ethnic Germans in the eastern regions of the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"/&gt; It was among the main supporters of creation of the [[Prussian Settlement Commission|Settlement Commission]], an official authority with a fund to buy up the land from the Poles and redistribute it among German settlers.&lt;ref name="Kitchen"/&gt; Since 1905 the organisation also proposed and lobbied for a law that would allow forced eviction of Polish owners of land, and succeed in 1908 when the law was eventually passed. However, it remained on paper in the following years, to which the H-K-T responded with large scale propaganda campaign in the press.&lt;ref name="Feuchtwanger"&gt;{{cite book | author =Edgar Feuchtwanger | title =Imperial Germany, 1850&amp;ndash;1918 | year = 2001| pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Routledge | location =London|isbn =0-415-20789-4|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jXKk-gs-VNEC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;printsec=8&amp;vq=Marches&amp;dq=Deutscher+Ostmarkenverein+1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign proved to be successful and on October 12, 1912 the Prussian government issued a decision allowing eviction of Polish property owners in Greater Poland.

== Social base ==
Although the H-K-T is to this day primarily associated with the [[Junker]]s,&lt;ref name="Kozłowski"/&gt; it was one of the groups to oppose the Society's goals the most.&lt;ref name="Eley"/&gt; Initially treated with reserve by most of the conservative [[Prussian aristocracy]], with time it became actively opposed by many of them. The Society opposed any immigration of Poles from the [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] to the area, while the Junkers gained large profits from seasonal workers migrating there every year, mostly from other parts of Poland.&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt; Also the German colonists brought to formerly Polish lands by the [[Prussian Settlement Commission|Settlement Commission]] or the German government largely benefited from the cooperation with their Polish neighbours and mostly either ignored the ''Hakatisten'' or even actively opposed their ideas.&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt; This made the Ostmarkenverein an organization formed mostly by the German [[bourgeoisie]]&lt;ref name="Alter"&gt;{{cite book | author =Peter Alter | title =Nationalism | year = 1995| publisher =Oxford University Press US | location =|isbn =0-340-60061-6|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-oNtUYluNsC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22Eastern+Marches%22+1894| page =28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and settlers, that is [[middle class]] members of the local administration,&lt;ref name="Holborn"/&gt; and not the Prussian Junkers. Other notable group of supporters included the local artisans and businessmen, whose interests were endangered by the [[organic work]], that is the Polish response to the economical competition promoted by the [[Prussian Settlement Commission|Settlement Commission]] and other similar organizations. In a sample probe of H-K-T's members, the social classes represented were as follows:&lt;ref name="Eley"/&gt;
* 26.6% of civil servants and members of German administration
* 17.6% of artisans
* 15.7% of businessmen
* 14.0% of teachers
* 10.7% of landowners
* 4.2% of clergymen
* 2.7% of army officers
* 0.7% of rentiers
* 6.5% of other professions
* 1.3% of people with no designation

== Effects and after-life ==

=== In Poland ===
By 1913 the Society had roughly 48,000 members.&lt;ref name="Feuchtwanger"/&gt; Despite its fierce rhetoric, support from the local administration and certain popularity of its goals, the Society proved to be largely unsuccessful as were the projects it promoted. Much like other similar organizations, the H-K-T not only managed to incite some public awareness to the ''Polish Question'' within German public and radicalise the German policies in the area, but also sparked a Polish reaction. As an effect of the external pressure, the Poles living in the German Empire started to organize themselves in order to prevent the plans of [[Germanisation]].&lt;ref name="Feuchtwanger"/&gt; In addition, the main opposition centre on the Polish side became the middle class rather than aristocracy, which strengthened the Polish resistance and intensified the national sentiment within the Polish society.&lt;ref name="Kitchen"/&gt; Also, the pressure from the German [[nationalism|nationalists]] resulted in strengthening the Polish national-democrats, particularly the [[Polish National-Democratic Party]] of [[Roman Dmowski]], and [[Wojciech Korfanty]].

For instance, the Settlement Commission throughout the 27 years of its existence managed to plant about 25,000 German families on 1,240&amp;nbsp;km² (479&amp;nbsp;mi²) of land in Greater Poland and Pomerania. However, at the same time the reaction of Polish societies resulted in about 35,000 new Polish farmers being settled in the area of roughly 1,500&amp;nbsp;km² (579&amp;nbsp;mi²) of land.&lt;ref name="Bullivant-Commission"&gt;Keith Bullivant, op.cit., [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042006889&amp;id=jXKk-gs-VNEC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA52 pp.52&amp;ndash;53]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the attempts at banning the teaching of religion in Polish language met with a nationwide resistance and several school strikes that sparked a campaign in foreign media.

=== In Germany ===
All in all, even though the H-K-T Society was not the most influential and its exact influence on the German governments is disputable,&lt;ref name="Holborn"/&gt; it was among the best-heard and for the Polish people became one of the symbols of oppression, chauvinism, and national discrimination, thus poisoning the Polish-German relations both in the borderland and in entire Germany.&lt;ref name="Holborn"/&gt; On the eve of [[World War I]] the nationalisms on both sides ran high and the liberal politicians who were seeking some compromise with the German Empire were seen as traitors, while German politicians trying to tone down the aggressive rhetoric on both sides were under attack from the Hakatisten.&lt;ref name="Feuchtwanger"/&gt; This situation proved vital to the failure of German plans of creation of [[Mitteleuropa]] during the Great War, as the Polish political scene was taken over mostly by politicians hostile to Germany.

=== Post-war organisation ===
The works of the Ostmarkenverein practically ceased during the war. At its end, some of its members joined the ''Deutsche Vereinigung'' (''German Association''), a society that aimed at preventing newly restored Poland from acquiring the lands that were formerly in Prussia.&lt;ref name="Blanke"&gt;{{cite book | author =Richard Blanke | title =Orphans of Versailles: The Germans in Western Poland, 1918-1939 | year = 1993| pages =13–25 | publisher =University Press of Kentucky | location = | isbn =0-8131-1803-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80r6Mbnxf8IC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Eastern+Marches+Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more of its members feared possible Polish reprisals after the take-over of Greater Poland, Pomerania and Silesia, and were among the first to pack their belongings and head westwards after the armistice,&lt;ref name="Blanke"/&gt; while others stayed in the lands that were taken over by Poland, protected by the [[Minority Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Blanke"/&gt; Even though the Ostmarkenverein had lost its main rationale as Germany had no influence over the lands of the Republic of Poland, it continued to exist in a rump form. Headed from Berlin, it tried to force the government of the [[Weimar Republic]] to use the threat of reprisals against the remaining Polish minority in Germany in order to win further concessions for the German minority in Poland.&lt;ref name="Blanke-concessions"&gt;Richard Blanke, op.cit., [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813118034&amp;id=80r6Mbnxf8IC&amp;pg=PA138 pp.138&amp;ndash;139]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the post-war government of [[Gustav Stresemann]] mostly rejected the pleas as there were many more Germans in Poland than Poles in Germany, and such a tit-for-tat tactics would harm the German side more.&lt;ref name="Blanke-concessions"/&gt; The Society continued to exist in Berlin, limiting its activities mostly to a press campaign and rhetoric,&lt;ref name="Burleigh"&gt;{{cite book | author =Michael Burleigh | authorlink =Michael Burleigh|title =Ethics and Extermination: Reflections on Nazi Genocide | year = 1997| pages =16–20 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Cambridge University Press | location =Cambridge|isbn =0-521-58816-2|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=y-tbb8Yx3ooC&amp;pg=RA1-PA16&amp;lpg=RA1-PA16&amp;dq=Eastern+Marches+Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its meaning was seriously limited. Finally, after the advent of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rule in Germany, it was disbanded by the Nazis. Some of its former members, now living in Poland, remained members of other German societies and organizations, and formed the core of the German [[Fifth column]] during the German [[Invasion of Poland]] of 1939.&lt;ref name="Imperialismus"&gt;{{cite book | title = Der deutsche Imperialismusund der 2.

'''Gordon Leslie Barnhart''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|SOM}} (born  January 22, 1945) is a former Clerk of the [[Senate of Canada]] and the [[Saskatchewan Legislature]], as well as former Secretary of the [[University of Saskatchewan]]. He was the [[List of lieutenant governors of Saskatchewan|20th]] [[Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan]] from 2006 until 2012. He was the interim President of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] as from May 21, 2014 until October 24, 2015.

==Biography==
Barnhart was born in [[Saltcoats, Saskatchewan]]. He completed his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[history]] in 1967 and in 1968, he took a job teaching grades 10 and 11 history at North Battleford Collegiate Institute (now [[North Battleford Comprehensive High School]]). In 1968, after only four months of teaching, he was appointed Clerk of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly, the youngest to take on such a position across the Commonwealth. During his tenure, he worked on his [[Master of Arts]] at the [[University of Regina]], completing it in 1977.

In 1989, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauvé]], on the advice of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]], appointed Barnhart to [[Clerk of the Senate]], and thereby [[Clerk of the Parliaments]]. After five years, which included contributing to the failed [[Charlottetown Accord]], he resigned from his position in the Senate. He returned to the University of Saskatchewan, where he completed his [[Doctorate]] in 1998.

From 2000 to 2005, he served as Secretary of the University of Saskatchewan. He retired to teach political studies classes, specializing in Canadian politics, government and the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]].

In 2001, Barnhart's book ''Peace, Progress and Prosperity'' ({{ISBN|0-88977-142-1}}), which provided the first detailed biography of Saskatchewan's first premier, [[Thomas Walter Scott]], was first published. Some of his other works include ''Saskatchewan's Premiers of the Twentieth Century'', ''Building for the Future; a photo journal of Saskatchewan's Legislative Building'' and ''Parliamentary Committees: Enhancing Democratic Governance''.

On April 28, 2006, [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] announced that Gordon Barnhart would replace [[Lynda Haverstock]] as [[Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan]]. He was sworn in on August 1, 2006. Barnhart's term ended on March 22, 2012, when he was replaced by [[Vaughn Solomon Schofield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography |url=http://ltgov.sk.ca/the-lieutenant-governor/lieutenant-governor-vaughn-solomon-schofield|publisher=Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Sasakatchewan|accessdate=26 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Saskatchewan]] announced that Barnhart would return to the faculty of the Department of History as of April 1, 2012 as an adjunct professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OCN|title=The Honourable Gordon Barnhart returning to U of S|url=http://news.usask.ca/2012/03/23/the-honourable-gordon-barnhart-returning-to-u-of-s/|work=On Campus News|publisher=University of Saskatchewan|accessdate=26 Mar 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702121925/http://news.usask.ca/2012/03/23/the-honourable-gordon-barnhart-returning-to-u-of-s/|archivedate=2012-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2014, it was announced that Barnhart had been appointed interim President at the University of Saskatchewan to replace [[Ilene Busch-Vishniac]] who was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OCN|title=The Honourable Gordon Barnhart Appointed Interim President|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/university-of-saskatchewan-board-sacks-president-ilene-busch-vishniac-1.2650301|work=On Campus News|publisher=CBC|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he becomes the first former Lieutenant Governor to serve in this capacity. He served as president until October 24, 2015, when he was succeeded by [[Peter Stoicheff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/rally-kicks-off-peter-stoicheff-s-tenure-as-u-of-s-president-1.3289001 |title=Rally kicks off Peter Stoicheff's tenure as U of S president |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2015-10-26 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2014, Barnhart was named a Member of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15694&amp;lan=eng|title=Order of Canada Appointments|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Lieutenant-Governor==
{{quote|It’s a non-partisan position, so I’m not representing the government, I’m not representing a political party, I’m representing the Queen. So that’s the role of the Head of State, and I think it’s a very important one. I would like to think that we’ve had a very good string of Lieutenant Governors in Saskatchewan. I feel that I am part of a heritage of very strong, hardworking people who have been Lieutenant Governor over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesheaf.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=96&amp;Itemid=64 |title=Sheaf Newspaper interviews Barnhart (2007) |publisher=Thesheaf.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;| Gordon Barnhart, Saskatoon, 2006}}

[[File:levee 006.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Gordon and Naomi Barnhart attend a community event for the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] in their first year as Saskatchewan's vice-regal couple, 2006.]]

As lieutenant-governor, Barnhart carries out such duties as reading throne speeches, swearing in premiers and cabinet ministers, opening legislative sessions, approving legislation and bestowing honours to Saskatchewan citizens.

Upon being sworn in, Barnhart expressed his respect and admiration for his predecessors. As an academic, he expects to focus his efforts on education. He also plans on travelling a great deal to continue the office's accessibility to average Saskatchewanians provided by Haverstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leader |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=cfc344e8-bdc3-4f30-9f31-d4e42d95fd12&amp;p=1 |title=Barnhart says he has big shoes to fill |publisher=Canada.com |date=2006-07-31 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnhart hosted hundreds of visitors on the occasion of his first New Year's [[Levee (event)|Levee]] at Government House in 2007, a traditional event that lieutenant-governors in Regina have hosted since 1884.

Barnhart also initiated the "Lieutenant-Governor's Leadership Forum",&lt;ref&gt;[http://ltgov.sk.ca/Leadership%20Forum.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019125808/http://ltgov.sk.ca/Leadership%20Forum.htm |date=October 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which will accept eighteen grade 11 and 12 students each year from 2007 till 2011 to tour the province, meet successful leaders in various fields, and to develop the students' own leadership abilities.

==Etymology==
The name "Irān", meaning "land of the [[Aryan]]s", is the [[New Persian]] continuation of the old genitive plural ''aryānām'' (proto-Iranian, meaning "of the Aryans"), first attested in the [[Avesta]] as ''airyānąm'' (the text of which is composed in [[Avestan language|Avestan]], an old [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] spoken in northeastern Greater Iran, or in what are now [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroastrianism-i-historical-review | title=ZOROASTRIANISM i.

While up until the end of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian period]] in the 3rd century CE, the idea of "Irān" had an ethnic, linguistic, and religious value, it did not yet have a political import. The idea of an "Iranian" empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely [[Sasanian]] one. It was the result of a convergence of interests between the new dynasty and the [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, as we can deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to the idea of an Ērān-šahr "Kingdom of the Iranians", which was "ēr" ([[Middle Persian]] equivalent of [[Old Persian]] "ariya" and Avestan "airya").&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica2"/&gt;

==Definition==
[[Richard Nelson Frye]] defines Greater Iran as including "much of the Caucasus, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, with cultural influences extending to China and western India." According to Frye, "Iran means all lands and peoples where Iranian languages were and are spoken, and where in the past, multi-faceted Iranian cultures existed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, Richard Nelson]], ''Greater Iran'', {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}} p.''xi''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Foltz]] notes that while "A general assumption is often made that the various Iranian peoples of 'greater Iran'—a cultural area that stretched from Mesopotamia and the Caucasus into [[Khwarizm]], [[Transoxiana]], Bactria, and the [[Pamirs]] and included Persians, Medes, Parthians and Sogdians among others—were all 'Zoroastrians' in pre-Islamic times... This view, even though common among serious scholars, is almost certainly overstated." Foltz argues that "While the various Iranian peoples did indeed share a common [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and pool of religious myths and [[Religious symbol|symbols]], in actuality a variety of deities were worshipped—particularly [[Mitra]], the god of covenants, and [[Anahita]], the goddess of the waters, but also many others—depending on the time, place, and particular group concerned".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "Religions of the Silk Road: Premodern Patterns of globalization", Palgrave Macmillan, rev. 2nd edition, 2010. pg 27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[J. P. Mallory]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams]] most of Western ''greater Iran'' spoke Southwestern Iranian languages in the Achaemenid era while the Eastern territory spoke Eastern Iranian languages related to Avestan.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J. P.; Adams, D. Q. (1997), Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture, London and Chicago: Fitzroy-Dearborn, {{ISBN|1-884964-98-2}}. pg 307: "Dialetically, Old Persian is regarded as a southwestern Iranian language in contrast to the east Iranian Avestan which covered most of the rest of Greater Iran. However, it is important to note that during the Achaemeid era, the official language of the empire was [[Aramaic]], which was the mother tongue of the ancient [Iraqis], since it was the language of literature, religion, and science at that time. [Aramaic] language had a great impact on Persian and survived as the dominant language in the middle east until the [Islamic conquest].&lt;/ref&gt;

George Lane also states that after the dissolution of the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Ilkhanids]] became rulers of greater Iran&lt;ref&gt;George Lane, "Daily life in the Mongol empire", Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pg 10" The year following 1260 saw the empire irrevocably split but also signaled the emergence of the two greatest achievements of the house of Chinggis, namely the Yuan dynasty of greater China and the Il-Khanid dynasty of greater Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uljaytu]], according to Judith G. Kolbas, was the ruler of this expanse between 1304–1317 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Judith G. Kolbas, "The Mongols in Iran", Excerpt from 399: "Uljaytu, Ruler of Greater Iran from 1304-1317 A.D."&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources, including Timurid historian Mir Khwand, define Iranshahr (Greater Iran) as extending from the Euphrates to the Oxus&lt;ref&gt;Mīr Khvānd, Muḥammad ibn Khāvandshāh, Tārīkh-i rawz̤at al-ṣafā.

Iranshahr stretches from the Euphrates to the Oxus, and it is the center of the prosperity of the World.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, and until recent times, ethnicity has never been a defining separating criterion  in these regions. In the words of Richard Nelson Frye:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

{{quote|Many times I have emphasized that the present peoples of Central Asia, whether Iranian or Turkic speaking, have one culture, one religion, one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them. | Richard Nelson Frye}}

Only in modern times did western colonial intervention and ethnicity tend to become a dividing force between the provinces of Greater Iran. As [[Patrick Clawson]] states, "ethnic nationalism is largely a nineteenth century phenomenon, even if it is fashionable to retroactively extend it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005 {{ISBN|1-4039-6276-6}} p.23&lt;/ref&gt; "Greater Iran" however has been more of a cultural super-state, rather than a political one to begin with.

In the work ''Nuzhat al-Qolub'' ({{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|نزهه القلوب|fa}}}}), the medieval geographer [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] wrote:

{{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|چند شهر است اندر ایران مرتفع تر از همه|fa}}}}&lt;br /&gt;
''Some cities in Iran are above the rest,''&lt;br /&gt;
{{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|بهتر و سازنده تر از خوشی آب و هوا|fa}}}}&lt;br /&gt;

The ''Cambridge History of Iran'' takes a geographical approach in referring to the "historical and cultural" entity of "Greater Iran" as "areas of Iran, parts of Afghanistan, and Chinese and Soviet Central Asia".&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. III: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods'', [[Ehsan Yarshater]], Review author[s]: [[Richard N. Frye]], [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], Vol. 21, No. 3. (Aug., 1989), pp.415. Link: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/163454]&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed list of these territories follows in this article.

==In Persian literature==
{{empty section|date=January 2016}}

==Background==
Greater Iran is called ''Iranzamin'' ({{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|ایرانزمین|fa}}}}) which means "The Land of Iran". ''Iranzamin'' was in the mythical times opposed to the ''Turanzamin'' the Land of [[Turan]], which was located in the upper part of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dehkhoda Dictionary]], [[Dehkhoda]], see under entry "Turan"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre-Islamic period, Iranians distinguished two main regions in the territory they ruled, one Iran and the other ''Aniran''. By Iran they meant all the regions inhabited by [[ancient Iranian peoples]], this region was more extensive in the past. This notion of ''Iran'' as a territory (opposed to ''Aniran'') can be seen as the core of early Greater Iran. Later many changes occurred in the boundaries and areas where Iranians lived but the languages and culture remained the dominant medium in many parts of the Greater Iran.

As an example, the Persian language (referred to, in Persian, as ''Farsi'') was the main literary language and the language of correspondence in Central Asia and Caucasus prior to the Russian occupation, Central Asia being the birthplace of modern Persian language. Furthermore, according to the British government, Persian language was also used in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], prior to the British Occupation and Mandate in 1918-1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~siamakr/Kurdish/KURDICA/1999/FEB/Iraq-policy.html|title=The old www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk server|work=ed.ac.uk|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Imperial Russia]] continuously advancing south in the course of two wars against Persia, and the treaties of Turkmenchay and Gulistan in the western frontiers, plus the unexpected death of [[Abbas Mirza]] in 1823, and the murdering of Persia's Grand [[Vizier]] (Mirza AbolQasem Qa'im Maqām), many Central Asian khanates began losing hope for any support from Persia against the [[Tsar]]ist armies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nasser Takmil Homayoun|Homayoun, N. T.]], ''Kharazm: What do I know about Iran?''. 2004. {{ISBN|964-379-023-1}}, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian armies occupied the [[Aral Sea|Aral]] coast in 1849, [[Tashkent]] in 1864, [[Bukhara]] in 1867, [[Samarkand]] in 1868, and [[Khiva]] and [[Amudarya]] in 1873.

:''"Many Iranians consider their natural sphere of influence to extend beyond Iran's present borders. After all, Iran was once much larger. Portuguese forces seized islands and ports in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire wrested from [[Tehran]]'s control what is today Armenia, [[Republic of Azerbaijan]], and part of Georgia. Iranian elementary school texts teach about the Iranian roots not only of cities like [[Baku]], but also cities further north like [[Derbent]] in southern Russia. The [[Shah]] lost much of his claim to western Afghanistan following the Anglo-Iranian war of 1856-1857. Only in 1970 did a [[UN]] sponsored consultation end Iranian claims to [[suzerainty]] over the [[Persian Gulf]] island nation of [[Bahrain]]. In centuries past, Iranian rule once stretched westward into modern Iraq and beyond. When the western world complains of Iranian interference beyond its borders, the Iranian government often convinced itself that it is merely exerting its influence in lands that were once its own. Simultaneously, Iran's losses at the hands of outside powers have contributed to a sense of grievance that continues to the present day."'' -[[Patrick Clawson]] of the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave. 2005. Coauthored with [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. {{ISBN|1-4039-6276-6}} p.9,10&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Iran today is just a rump of what it once was. At its height, Iranian rulers controlled Iraq, Afghanistan, Western Pakistan, much of Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Many Iranians today consider these areas part of a greater Iranian sphere of influence."'' -[[Patrick Clawson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave. 2005. Coauthored with [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. {{ISBN|1-4039-6276-6}} p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Since the days of the [[Achaemenids]], the Iranians had the protection of geography. But high mountains and vast emptiness of the Iranian plateau were no longer enough to shield Iran from the Russian army or British navy. Both literally, and figuratively, Iran shrank. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Afghanistan were Iranian, but by the end of the century, all this territory had been lost as a result of European military action."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]].

==Provinces and regions==
In the 8th century, Iran was conquered by the [[Abbassids]] who ruled from [[Baghdad]], and the territory of Iran at that time was known to be composed of two portions: ''[[Persian Iraq]]'' (western portion) and ''Khorasan'' (eastern portion). The dividing region was mostly along with [[Gurgan]] and [[Damghan|Damaghan]] cities. Especially the [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]] divided their [[Empire]] to Iraqi and Khorasani regions. This point can be observed in many books such as ''"Tārīkhi Baïhaqī"'' of [[Abolfazl Beyhaqi|Abul Fazl Bayhqi]], ''Faza'ilul al-anam min rasa'ili hujjat al-Islam'' (a collection of letters of [[Al-Ghazali]]) and other books. Transoxiana and [[Chorasmia]] were mostly included in the Khorasanian region.

====Bahrain====
{{See also|Persians in Bahrain|Huwala|Ajam of Bahrain}}
The "Ajam" and "Huwala" are ethnic communities of Bahrain of Persian origin. The Persians of Bahrain are a significant and influential ethnic community whose ancestors arrived in Bahrain within the last 1,000 years as laborers, merchants and artisans. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of [[Manama]] and [[Muharraq]]. Bahrain's Persians who adhere to the [[Shia]] sect of Islam are [[Ajam]] and the Persians who adhere to the [[Sunni]] sect are called [[Huwala]], who migrated from [[Larestan]] in Iran to the [[Persian Gulf]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.

The immigration of Persians to Bahrain began when the Greek [[Seleucid]] kingdom which was ruling Bahrain at the time fell and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] successfully invaded Bahrain, but it is often believed that mass immigration started during the 1600s when [[Abbas I of Persia]] invaded Bahrain. After settling in Bahrain, some of the Persians were effectively Arabized. They usually settled in areas inhabited by the indigenous [[Baharna]], probably because they share the same Shia Muslim faith, however, some Sunni Persians settled in areas mostly inhabited by Sunni Arab immigrants such as [[Hidd]] and [[Galali]]. In [[Muharraq]], they have their own neighborhood called Fareej Karimi named after a rich Persian man called Ali Abdulla Karimi.

From the 6th century BC to the 3rd century BC, Bahrain was a prominent part of the Persian Empire by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian dynasty]]. Bahrain was referred to by the Greeks as "[[Tylos]]", the centre of pearl trading, when [[Nearchus]] discovered it while serving under [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;''Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient ...'' by Curtis E. Larsen p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; From the 3rd century BC to the arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD, Bahrain was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and the [[Sassanids]].

In the 3rd century AD, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and controlled the area for four centuries until the arrival of Islam.&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division page 7"/&gt; [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]], the first ruler of the Iranian Sassanid dynasty marched to Oman and Bahrain and defeated Sanatruq&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

Shapur constructed a new city there and named it Batan Ardashir after his father.&lt;ref name="Mojtahed-Zadeh"/&gt; At this time, Bahrain incorporated the southern Sassanid province covering the Persian Gulf's southern shore plus the archipelago of Bahrain.&lt;ref name="Jamsheed"&gt;Conflict and Cooperation: Zoroastrian Subalterns and Muslim Elites in ... By Jamsheed K. Choksy, 1997, page 75&lt;/ref&gt; The southern province of the Sassanids was subdivided into three districts; Haggar (now al-Hafuf province, Saudi Arabia), Batan Ardashir (now [[al-Qatif]] province, Saudi Arabia), and [[Mishmahig]] (now Bahrain Island)&lt;ref name="Mojtahed-Zadeh"/&gt; (In  [[Middle-Persian]]/Pahlavi it means "ewe-fish").&lt;ref&gt;Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 130 BC, the Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division page 7"&gt;''Bahrain'' by Federal Research Division, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Iran was further undermined at the end of the 18th century when the ideological power struggle between the Akhbari-Usuli strands culminated in victory for the Usulis in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahrain.wikia.com/wiki/Are_the_Shia_Rising%3F Are the Shia Rising?] Maximilian Terhalle, ''Middle East Policy'', Volume 14 Issue 2 Page 73, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An Afghan uprising led by Hotakis of Kandahar at the beginning of the 18th century resulted in the near collapse of the Safavid state.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=7}} In the resultant power vacuum, [[1717 Omani invasion of Bahrain|Oman invaded Bahrain in 1717]], ending over one hundred years of Persian hegemony in Bahrain. The Omani invasion began a period of political instability and a quick succession of outside rulers took power with consequent destruction. According to a contemporary account by theologian, Sheikh Yusuf Al Bahrani, in an unsuccessful attempt by the Persians and their Bedouin allies to take back Bahrain from the [[Kharijite]] Omanis, much of the country was burnt to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2c6004x0&amp;chunk.id=d0e7560&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e7560&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;query=Bahrain# Autobiography of Sheikh Yusuf Al Bahrani] published in ''Interpreting the Self, Autobiography in the Arabic Literary Tradition'', Edited by Dwight F.

In 1730, the new Shah of [[Persia]], [[Nadir Shah]], sought to re-assert Persian sovereignty in Bahrain. He ordered Latif Khan, the admiral of the Persian navy in the Persian Gulf, to prepare an invasion fleet in [[Bushehr]].{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=7}} The Persians invaded in March or early April 1736 when the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Jubayr, was away on [[hajj]].{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=7}} The invasion brought the island back under central rule and to challenge Oman in the Persian Gulf.

During most of the second half of the eighteenth century, Bahrain was ruled by [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]], the ruler of [[Bushehr]]. The Bani Utibah tribe from Zubarah exceeded in taking over Bahrain after a war broke out in 1782. Persian attempts to reconquer the island in 1783 and in 1785 failed; the 1783 expedition was a joint Persian-[[Qawasim]] invasion force that never left Bushehr. The 1785 invasion fleet, composed of forces from Bushehr, Rig and [[Shiraz]] was called off after the death of the ruler of Shiraz, [[Ali Murad Khan]]. Due to internal difficulties, the Persians could not attempt another invasion.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=46}} In 1799, Bahrain came under threat from the [[expansionist]] policies of [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Sayyid Sultan]], the [[Sultan of Oman]], when he invaded the island under the pretext that Bahrain did not pay taxes owed.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=47}} The Bani Utbah solicited the aid of Bushire to expel the Omanis on the condition that Bahrain would become a [[tributary state]] of Persia. In 1800, Sayyid Sultan invaded Bahrain again in retaliation and deployed a garrison at [[Arad Fort]], in [[Muharraq]] island and had appointed his twelve-year-old son Salim, as Governor of the island.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=47}} &lt;ref&gt;James Onley, The Politics of Protection in the Gulf: The Arab Rulers and the British Resident in the Nineteenth Century, Exeter University, 2004 p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Many names of villages in Bahrain are derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] language.&lt;ref name=Tajer&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tajer|first=Mahdi Abdulla|title=Language &amp; Linguistic Origins In Bahrain|year=1982|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780710300249|pages=134, 135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=bahrain%20village%20persian%20name&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q=bahrain%20village%20persian%20name&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These names were thought to have been as a result influences during the [[Safavid]] rule of Bahrain (1501–1722) and previous Persian rule. Village names such as [[Karbabad]], [[Salmabad]], [[Karzakan]], [[Duraz]], [[Barbar, Bahrain|Barbar]] were originally derived from the Persian language, suggesting that Persians had a substantial effect on the island's history.&lt;ref name=Tajer/&gt; The local [[Bahrani Arabic]] dialect has also borrowed many words from the Persian language.&lt;ref name=Tajer/&gt; Bahrain's capital city, [[Manama]] is derived from two Persian words meaning 'I' and 'speech'.&lt;ref name=Tajer/&gt;{{contradict-inline|article=Manama|section=Etymology|date=March 2018}}

Historian Nasser Hussain says that many Iranians fled their native country in the early 20th century due to a law king [[Reza Shah]] issued which banned women from wearing the [[hijab]], or because they feared for their lives after fighting the English, or to find jobs. They were coming to Bahrain from Bushehr and the [[Fars province]] between 1920 and 1940. In the 1920s, local Persian merchants were prominently involved in the consolidation of Bahrain's first powerful lobby with connections to the municipality in effort to contest the municipal legislation of British control.&lt;ref name=pol&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuccaro|first=Nelida|title=Histories of City and State in the Persian Gulf: Manama Since 1800|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKU6jvKGicUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780521514354|date=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahrain's local Persian community have heavily influenced the country's local food dishes. One of the most notable local delicacies of the people in Bahrain is [[mahyawa]], consumed in Southern Iran as well, is a watery earth brick coloured sauce made from sardines and consumed with bread or other food. Bahrain's Persians are also famous in Bahrain for bread-making. Another local delicacy is "pishoo" made from rose water (golab) and agar agar.

Throughout history, Iran always had strong cultural ties with the region of nowadays [[Iraq]]. Mesopotamia is considered as the cradle of civilization and the place where the first empires in history were established. These empires, namely the [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Babylonia]]n, and [[Assyria]]n, dominated the ancient middle east for millennia, which explains the great influence of the Mesopotamia on the Iranian culture and history, and it is also the reason why the later Iranian and Greek dynasties chose Mesopotamia to be the political centre of their rule. For a period of around 500 years, what is now Iraq formed the core of Iran, with the Iranian [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] empire having their capital in what is modern-day Iraq for the same centuries long time span.

Because the Achaemenid Empire or "First Persian Empire" was the successor state to the empires of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonia]] based in Iraq, and because [[Elam]] is part of Iran, the ancient people of Iran were ruled by ancient Mesopotamians, which explains the close proximity between the people of south western Iran and the Iraqis even in modern days, in fact, the people of that part of Iran speak Mesopotamian Arabic and were put under the rule of modern Iran by the British. The ancient Persians adopted the Babylonian [[Cuneiform|cuneiform script]] and [[Old Persian cuneiform|modified it]] to write their [[Old Persian language|language]], along with adopting many other facets of ancient Iraqi culture, including the [[Aramaic language]] which became the official language of the Persian Empire.

Testimony to the close relationship shared by Iraq and western Iran during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]] and later centuries, is the fact that the two regions came to share the same name. The western region of [[Iran]] (ancient Media) was called [[Persian Iraq|'Irāq-e 'Ajamī]] ("Persian Iraq"), while central-southern [[Iraq]] (Babylonia) was called 'Irāq al-'Arabī ("Arabic Iraq") or Bābil ("Babylon"). And the name Iraq comes from the ancient Mesopotamian city Uruk, which suggests an even older relationship.

For centuries the two neighbouring regions were known as "[[The Two Iraqs]]" ("al-'Iraqain"). The 12th century Persian poet [[Khaqani|Khāqāni]] wrote a famous poem ''Tohfat-ul Iraqein'' ("The Gift of the Two Iraqs"). The city of [[Arak, Iran|Arāk]] in western Iran still bears the region's old name, and Iranians still traditionally call the region between [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Ilam, Iran|Īlām]] "ʿErāq".

During medieval ages, Mesopotamian and Iranian peoples knew each other's languages because of trade, and because Arabic was the language of religion and science at that time. The [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] historian [[Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru]] (d. 1430) wrote of Iraq:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morony|first=Michael G|authorlink=Michael G. Morony|title=IRAQ AND ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iraq-i-late-sasanid-early-islamic|work=IRAQ i. IN THE LATE SASANID AND EARLY ISLAMIC ERAS|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=11 February 2012|quote=Persian remained the language of most of the sedentary people as well as that of the chancery until the 15th century and thereafter, as attested by Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru (d. 1430) who said, “The majority of inhabitants of Iraq know Persian and Arabic, and from the time of domination of Turkic people the Turkish language has also found currency: as the city people and those engaged in trade and crafts are Persophone, the Bedouins are Arabophone, and the governing classes are Turkophone. But, all three peoples (qawms) know each other’s languages due to the mixture and amalgamation.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The majority of inhabitants of Iraq know [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and from the time of domination of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] the [[Turkish language]] has also found currency. | Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru}}

[[Iraqi people|Iraqis]] share religious and certain cultural ties [[Demographics of Iran|Iranians]]. The majority of Iranians are Twelver [[Shia]] (an Islamic sect established in Iraq), although the majority of Iranians were [[Sunni]] Muslims and did not convert to Shia until the [[Safavids]] forced [[Shi'ism]] in Iran.

Iraqi culture has commonalities with the [[culture of Iran]]. The spring festival of [[Nowruz]] that is celebrated in Iran and some parts of Iraq roots back to the Akitu spring festival (Babylonian new year). The [[Iraqi cuisine|Mesopotamian cuisine]] has also similarities to the [[Iranian cuisine|Persian cuisine]] and has common dishes and cooking techniques. The [[Iraqi Arabic|Iraqi dialect]] has absorbed many words from the [[Persian language]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Csató|first1=Éva Ágnes|last2=Isaksson|first2=Bo|last3=Jahani|first3=Carina|title=Linguistic Convergence and Areal Diffusion: Case Studies from Iranian, Semitic and Turkic|year=2005|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-30804-5|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still cities and provinces in Iraq where the Persian names of the city are still retained. e.g. [[Anbar Province|’Anbār]] and [[Baghdad]]. Other cities of Iraq with originally Persian names include ''Nokard'' (نوكرد) --&gt; [[Hdatta|Haditha]],  ''[[Suristan]]'' (سورستان) --&gt; [[Kufa]], ''Shahrban'' (شهربان) --&gt; [[Muqdadiyah]], ''Arvandrud'' (اروندرود) --&gt; [[Shatt al-Arab]], and ''Asheb'' (آشب) --&gt; [[Amadiya]],&lt;ref&gt;See: محمدی ملایری، محمد: فرهنگ ایران در دوران انتقال از عصر ساسانی به عصر اسلامی، جلد دوم: دل ایرانشهر، تهران، انتشارات توس 1375.: Mohammadi Malayeri, M.: Del-e Iranshahr, vol. II, Tehran 1375 Hs.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peroz-Shapur'' --&gt; [[Anbar (town)]]

In the modern era, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran briefly reasserted their hegemony over Iraq in the periods of [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–1555)|1501–1533]] and [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)|1622–1638]], losing Iraq to the [[Ottoman Empire]] on both occasions (via the [[Peace of Amasya|Treaty of Amasya]] in 1555 and the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] in 1639). Ottoman hegemony over Iraq was reconfirmed in the [[Treaty of Kerden]] in 1746.

Following the fall of the Ba'athist regime in 2003 and the empowerment of Iraq's majority Shī'i community, relations with Iran have flourished in all fields. Iraq is today Iran’s largest trading partner in regard to non-oil goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq plans to send 200-member trade delegation to Iran|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/economy-and-business/104757-iraq-plans-to-send-200-member-trade-delegation-to-iran|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=[[Tehran Times]]|date=9 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311105340/http://tehrantimes.com/economy-and-business/104757-iraq-plans-to-send-200-member-trade-delegation-to-iran|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dagestan remains the bastion of [[Persian culture]] in the [[North Caucasus]] with fine examples of Iranian architecture like the Sassanid citadel in [[Derbent]], strong influence of [[Persian cuisine]], and common Persian names amongst the ethnic peoples of Dagestan. The ethnic Persian population of the North Caucasus, the [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]], remain, despite strong assimilation over the years, still visible in several North Caucasian cities. Even today, after decades of partition, some of these regions retain Iranian influences, as seen in their old beliefs, traditions and customs (e.g. [[Nowruz|Norouz]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'': "Caucasus Iran" article, p.84-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], the territories of [[Iran]] and the republic of [[Azerbaijan]] usually shared the same history from the time of ancient Media (ninth to seventh centuries b.c.) and the Persian Empire (sixth to fourth centuries b.c.).&lt;ref&gt;Historical Background Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimately and inseparably intertwined histories for millennia, Iran irrevocably lost the territory that is nowadays Azerbaijan in the course of the 19th century. With the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] of 1813 following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]] Iran had to cede eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], its possessions in the [[North Caucasus]] and many of those in what is today the [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan Republic]], which included [[Baku Khanate]], [[Shirvan Khanate]], [[Karabakh Khanate]], [[Ganja Khanate]], [[Shaki Khanate]], [[Quba Khanate]], and parts of the [[Talysh Khanate]]. [[Derbent]] (Darband) [[Derbent khanate|Khanate]] of [[Dagestan]] was also lost to Russia. These Khanates comprise most of what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan and Dagestan in Southern Russia. By the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828 following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]], the result was even more disastrous, and resulted in Iran being forced to cede the [[Nakhichevan Khanate]] and the Mughan regions to Russia, as well as [[Erivan Khanate]], and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate. All these territories together, lost in 1813 and 1828 combined, constitute all of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan, [[Armenia]], and southern [[Dagestan]]. The area to the North of the river [[Aras River|Aras]], among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Swietochowski Borderland"&gt;{{cite book |last=Swietochowski|first=Tadeusz |authorlink= Tadeusz Swietochowski |year=1995|title=Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition|pages= 69, 133 |edition=  |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FfRYRwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Russia+and+Iran+in+the+great+game:+travelogues+and+orientalism|isbn=978-0-231-07068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=L.

Many localities in this region bear Persian names or names derived from Iranian languages and Azerbaijan remains by far Iran's closest cultural, religious, ethnic and historical neighbor. [[Azerbaijanis]] are by far the second largest ethnicity in Iran, and comprise the largest community of ethnic Azerbaijanis in the world, vastly outnumbering the number in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Both nations are the only officially Shia majority in the world, with adherents of the religion comprising an absolute majority in both nations. The people of nowadays Iran and Azerbaijan were [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|converted to Shiism]] during exactly the same time in history.

[[Khwarazm]] is one of the regions of ''Iran-zameen'', and is the home of the ancient Iranians, [[Airyanem Vaejah]], according to the ancient book of the [[Avesta]]. Modern scholars believe Khwarazm to be what ancient Avestic texts refer to as "Ariyaneh Waeje" or Iran vij. ''Iranovich''  These sources claim that [[Kunya Urgench|Urgandj]], which was the capital of ancient Khwarazm for many years, was actually "Ourva": the eighth land of [[Ahura Mazda]] mentioned in the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of Vendidad. Others such as [[University of Hawaii]] historian [[Elton L. Daniel]] believe Khwarazm to be the "most likely locale" corresponding to the original home of the Avestan people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elton L.

The national anthem in Tajikistan, "[[Surudi Milli]]", attests to the Perso-Tajik identity, which has seen a large revival, after the breakup of the [[USSR]]. [[Tajik language|Their language]] is almost identical to that spoken in Afghanistan and Iran, and their cities have Persian names, e.g. [[Dushanbe]], [[Isfara]], [[Rasht Valley]], [[Garm, Tajikistan|Garm]], [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab]], [[Vahdat]], [[Zeravshan|Zar-afshan river]], [[Shurab, Tajikistan|Shurab]], and [[Kulob]] ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/newsite/articles/ot_grp8/ot_kulab_20050727.html]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).

Home of the [[Parthian Empire]] ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nysa]]). Merv is also where the half-Persian caliph [[al-Mamun]] moved his capital to. The city of [[Ashgabat|Eshgh Abad]] (some claim that the word is actually the transformed form of "Ashk Abad" literally meaning "built by Ashk", the head of Arsacid dynasty) is yet another Persian word meaning "city of love", and like Iran, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan, it was once part of [[Airyanem Vaejah]].

Modern state of Afghanistan was part of [[Sistan]] and [[Greater Khorasan]] regions, and hence was recognized with the name Khorasan (along with regions centered on Merv and Nishapur), which in Pahlavi means "The Eastern Land" (خاور زمین in Persian).&lt;ref&gt;[[Dehkhoda]], ''[[Dehkhoda dictionary]]'', Tehran University Press, p.8457&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays region of Afghanistan is where [[Balkh]] is located, home of [[Rumi]], [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Sanai|Sanāī Ghaznawi]], [[Jami]], [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari]] and where many other notables in [[Persian literature]] came from.

ز زابل به کابل رسید آن زمان&lt;br /&gt;
From [[Zabul]] he arrived to [[Kabul]]&lt;br /&gt;
گرازان و خندان و دل شادمان&lt;br /&gt;
Strutting, happy, and mirthful&lt;br /&gt;
''---[[Ferdowsi]] in [[Shahnama]]''

====Pakistan====
There is considerable influence of Iranian-speaking peoples in Pakistan. The region of Baluchistan is split between Pakistan and Iran and Baluchi, the majority languages of the Baluchistan province of Pakistan are also spoken in Southeastern Iran. In fact, the Chagai Hills and the western part of Makran district were part of Iran till the [[Durand Line]] was drawn in the late 1800s.

[[Pashto language|Pashto]] which is spoken in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan is an Iranian language.

The '''historic centre of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]''', Spain is one of the largest of its kind in Europe.  In 1984, [[UNESCO]] registered the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. A decade later, it expanded the inscription to include much of the old town.&lt;ref name=unesco.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Centre of Cordoba|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/313|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historic centre has a wealth of monuments preserving large traces of Roman, Arabic, and Christian times.

==Historical background==
First a [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] township, Córdoba was captured by the Romans in 206 BC, soon becoming the capital of [[Hispania Citerior]] with fine buildings and imposing fortifications. In the 6th century, with the crumbling of the [[Roman Empire]], the city fell to the [[Visigoths]] until the beginning of the 8th century when it was conquered by the [[Moors]]. In 716, Córdoba became a provincial capital and, in 766, capital of the Muslim emirate of [[al-Andalus]]. By the 10th century, as the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] it had become one of the most advanced cities in the world, recognized for its culture, learning and religious tolerance. It addition to a huge library, the city enclosed over 300 mosques and a multitude of palaces and administrative buildings.&lt;ref name=cph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordobapatrimoniodelahumanidad.com/html/cordoba/historia.htm|title=Córdoba en la Historia|publisher=Córdoba: Patrimonio de la Humanidad|accessdate=30 December 2013 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/313|title=Historic Centre of Cordoba|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=30 December 2013 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1236, King [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] took the city, built new defences and converted the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Grand Mosque]] into a cathedral. The Christian city grew up around the cathedral with palaces, churches, and a fortress. Although the city lost its political significance under Christian rule, it continued to play an important role in commerce thanks to the nearby [[Sierra Morena]] copper mines.&lt;ref name=cph/&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

==Geographic boundaries==
[[File:MolinoAlbolafiaCordoba.jpg|thumbnail|One of the [[mills of the Guadalquivir]].]]
The historic centre as defined by UNESCO comprises the buildings and narrow winding streets around the cathedral. It is bordered on the south by the [[Guadalquivir|River Guadalquivir]] so as to include the [[Roman bridge of Córdoba|Roman Bridge]] and the [[Calahorra Tower]], on the east by the Calle San Fernando, and on the north by the commercial centre. To the west, it includes the [[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alcázar]] and the [[San Basilio, Córdoba|San Basilio district]].&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

==Monuments==
Evidence of the Roman period can be seen in the [[Roman bridge of Córdoba|16-span bridge]] over the Guadalquivir, the mosaics in the Alcázar, the columns of the [[Roman temple of Córdoba|Roman temple]], and the remains of the [[Roman walls of Córdoba|Roman walls]]. In addition to the [[Caliphal Baths]], the Moorish influence in the city's design is evident in the Alcázar gardens adjacent to the former [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Grand Mosque]]. Minarets from the period survive in the churches of Santiago, [[San Lorenzo, Córdoba|San Lorenzo]], San Juan and the [[Convento de Santa Clara (Córdoba)|Santa Clara Hermitage]]. The Jewish presence during Muslim rule can be seen in the La Judería district in which the [[Córdoba Synagogue|synagogue]] was used until 1492.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

The Alcázar, originally a Moorish castle, was adapted to serve as a residence for the Christian kings in the 14th century while the Calahorra Tower, built by the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], was comprehensively reworked by [[Henry II of Castile|King Henry II]] in 1369.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordoba24.info/english/html/torre_calahorra.html|title=Torre de la Calahorra|publisher=Córdoba24|accessdate=30 December 2013 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The little [[Chapel of San Bartolomé]] was completed in the Gothic-Mudéjar style in 1410. Originally a church, the former [[San Sebastián Hospital]], now the Congress Centre, was completed in 1516 in a combination of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Mudéjar]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artencordoba.com/OTROS-MONUMENTOS/Otros-Monumentos-Cordoba-Hospital-San-Sebastian.html|title=El Hospital de San Sebastián|publisher=Artencordoba.com|accessdate=30 December 2013 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other churches from the period include [[San Nicolás de la Villa|San Nicolás]] and San Francisco.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

There are also a number of important 16th-century buildings including the San Pelagio Seminary, the [[Puerta del Puente]], and the Palacio del Marqués de la Fuensanta del Valle designed by [[Hernán Ruiz the Younger|Hernán Ruiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censoarchivos.mcu.es/CensoGuia/fondoDetail.htm?id=621753|title=Conservatorio Superior de Música Rafael Orozco de Córdoba|publisher=Gobierno de España|accessdate=30 December 2013 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also of note is the 18th-century [[Hospital del Cardenal Salazar]] with its [[Baroque]] facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turismodecordoba.org/hospital-cardenal-salazar.cfm|title=Hospital del Cardenal Salazar, Córdob|publisher=Córdoba: ciudad de encuentro|accessdate=30 December 2013 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Trojan War}}
{{Special characters}}

The extent of the '''historical basis of the Homeric epics''' has been a topic of scholarly debate for centuries. 
While researchers of the 18th century had largely rejected the story of the [[Trojan War]] as fable, the discoveries made by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] at [[Hisarlik]] reopened the question in modern terms, and the subsequent excavation of [[Troy VIIa]] and the discovery of the toponym "[[Wilusa]]" in [[Hittite texts|Hittite correspondence]] has made it plausible that the Trojan War cycle was at least remotely based on a historical conflict of the [[Bronze Age collapse|12th century BC]], even if the poems of [[Homer]] are removed from the event by more than four centuries of [[oral tradition]].

==History==
In antiquity, educated Greeks accepted the truth of human events depicted in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', even as [[philosophical scepticism]] was undermining faith in divine intervention in human affairs. In the time of [[Strabo]], topographical disquisitions discussed the identity of sites mentioned by [[Homer]]. This continued when Greco-Roman culture was [[Christianization|Christianised]]: [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] offered [[universal history]] reduced to a [[timeline]], in which [[Troy]] received the same historical weight as [[Abraham]], with whom Eusebius' ''Chronologia'' began, ranking the [[Argives]] and [[Mycenaeans]] among the kingdoms ranged in vertical columns, offering biblical history on the left (verso), and secular history of the kingdoms on the right (recto).&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius' chronological tables are re-analysed in depth by Richard W. Burgess, Witold Witakowski, eds.''Studies in Eusebian and Post-Eusebian Chronography'' vol. 1. (Stuttgart) 1999; see Introduction and Overview&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' followed Eusebius, and all the medieval chroniclers began with summaries of the universal history of Jerome.

With such authorities accepting it,  post-Roman Europeans continued to accept Troy and the events of the [[Trojan War]] as historical. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudo-genealogy traced a Trojan origin for royal [[Britons (historic)|Briton]] descents in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Analysed in Francis Ingledew, "The Book of Troy and the Genealogical Construction of History: The Case of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia regum Britanniae" ''Speculum'' '''69,'''.3 (July 1994:665-704).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merovingian]] descent from a Trojan ancestor was embodied in a literary myth first established in [[Fredegar]]'s chronicle (2.4, 3.2.9), to the effect that the Franks were of Trojan stock and adopted their name from King Francio, who had built a new Troy on the banks of the river Rhine (modern [[Treves]]).&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Bietenholz, ''Historia and Fabula: Myths and Legends in Historical Thought'' 1994:190.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even before the so-called [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century these supposed facts of the medieval concept of history were doubted by [[Blaise Pascal]]: "Homer wrote a [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], for nobody supposes that Troy and [[Agamemnon]] existed any more than the [[Hesperides|apples of the Hesperides]]. He had no intention to write history, but only to amuse us."&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, ''[[Pensées]]'' (published 1660), part ix, §628.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century the stories of Troy were devalued as fables by [[George Grote]].&lt;ref&gt;In Grote, ''A History of Greece'', vol. I (1846), "Legendary Greece" prefaces "Historical Greece to the reign of Peisistratus", and begins the "historical" section with the traditional date of the first Olympiad, 776 BC: "To confound together these disparate matters is, in my judgement, essentially unphilosophical. I describe the earlier times by themselves, as conceived by the faith and feeling of the first Greeks, and known only through their legends,—without presuming to measure how much or how little of historical matter these legends may contain" (Preface). The "Legend of Troy"—"this interesting fable"—fills his chapter xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discoveries made by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] at [[Hisarlik]] revived the question during modern times, and recent discoveries have resulted in more discussion.&lt;ref name=Korfmann/&gt; According to Jeremy B. Rutter, archaeological finds thus far, can neither prove nor disprove whether Hisarlik VIIa was sacked by Mycenean Greeks sometime between 1325 and 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=630#L27Top Rutter, Jeremy B., "Troy VII and the Historicity of the Trojan War", Dartmouth College]&lt;/ref&gt;

No text or artifact found on the site itself clearly identifies the Bronze Age site by name. This is due probably to the leveling of the former [[Hill fort|hillfort]] during the construction of [[Hellenistic]] Ilium (Troy IX), destroying the parts that most likely contained the city archives. A single seal of a [[Luwian language|Luwian]] scribe has been found in one of the houses, proving the presence of written correspondence in the city, but not a single text. Research by Anatolian specialists indicates that what is called "Troy" was in the Late Bronze Age known to the [[Hittites]] as the kingdom of [[Wilusa]], and that it appears that there were several armed conflicts in the area at the end of the Late Bronze Age,&lt;ref name=Korfmann&gt;[http://archive.archaeology.org/0405/etc/troy.html Korfmann, Manfred. "Was There a Trojan War?", ''Archaeology'', Vol. 57 Number 3, May/June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; although this does not identify the combatants.

The bilingual [[toponymy]] of Troy/Ilion is well established in the Homeric tradition. The Mycenaean Greeks of the 13th century BC had colonized the Greek mainland and [[Crete]], and were beginning to make forays into [[Anatolia]]. Philologist Joachim Latacz identifies the "Achaioi" of the ''Illiad'' with the inhabitants of [[Ahhiyawa]]. He posits that in all probability the ''Iliad'' preserved through oral hexameters the memory of one or more acts of aggression perpetrated by the Ahhiyawans against Wilusa in the thirteenth century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.archaeology.org/0405/etc/troy2.html Latacz, Joachim. "Evidence from Homer", ''Archaeology'', Vol. 57 Number 3, May/June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of the ''Iliad''==
The more that is known about Bronze Age history, the clearer it becomes that it is not a yes-or-no question but one of educated assessment of ''how much'' historical knowledge is present in Homer, and whether it represents a retrospective memory of [[Greek Dark Age|Dark Age Greece]], as Finley concludes, or of [[Mycenaean Greece]], which is the dominant view of ''A Companion to Homer'', A.J.B. Wace and F.H. Stebbings, eds. (New York/London: Macmillan 1962). The particular narrative  of the ''Iliad'' is not an account of the war, but a tale of the [[psychology]], the wrath, vengeance and death of individual heroes, which assumes common knowledge of the [[Trojan War]] as a back-story. No scholars now assume that the individual events of the tale (many of which involve divine intervention) are historical fact; however, no scholars claim that the story is entirely devoid of memories of Mycenaean times.

However, in addressing a separate controversy, Oxford Professor of Greek, [[Martin L. West]] indicated that such an approach "misconceives" the problem, and that Troy probably fell to a much smaller group of attackers in a much shorter time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141216010815/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/troia/eng/timesbriefe.html West, Martin L., "Academic spat over Troy project", ''The Times'', 20 August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Iliad'' as essentially legendary==
[[File:Path3959-83.png|thumbnail|right|Map of the Mycenaean culture area 1400-1200 BC (unearthed sites in red dots)]]
Some [[archaeologist]]s and [[historian]]s, most notably, until his death in 1986, Finley,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Finley vigorously attacked Michael Wood's ''[[In Search of the Trojan War]]'' when it first appeared in 1984, four years before modern archaeology was undertaken at the Hisarlik site.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that none of the events in Homer's works are historical. Others accept that there may be a foundation of historical events in the Homeric narrative, but say that in the absence of independent evidence it is not possible to separate fact from myth.

[[Moses I. Finley]], in ''The World of Odysseus'' presents a picture of the society represented by the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'', avoids the question as "beside the point that the narrative is a collection of fictions from beginning to end"&lt;ref name="finley" /&gt;{{rp|9}} Finley was in a minority when his ''World of Odysseus'' first appeared in 1954. With the understanding that war was the normal state of affairs, Finley observed that a ten-year war was out of the question, indicating Nestor's recall of a cattle-raid in Elis as a norm, and identifying the scene in which Helen points out to Priam the Achaean leaders in the battlefield, as "an illustration of the way in which one traditional piece of the story was retained after the war had ballooned into ten years and the piece had become rationally incongruous."&lt;ref name="finley"&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Odysseus|last=Finley|first=Moses I.|year=1978|authorlink=Moses I. Finley}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}

Finley, for whom the Trojan War is "a timeless event floating in a timeless world",&lt;ref name="finley" /&gt;{{rp|172}} analyzes the question of historicity, aside from invented narrative details, into five essential elements: 1. Troy was destroyed by a war; 2. the destroyers were a coalition from mainland Greece; 3. the leader of the coalition was a king named Agamemnon; 4. Agamemnon's overlordship was recognized by the other chieftains; 5. Troy, too, headed a coalition of allies. Finley does not find any evidence for any of these elements.&lt;ref name="finley" /&gt;{{rp|175ff.}}

Aside from narrative detail, Finley pointed out that, aside from some correlation of Homeric placenames and Mycenaean sites,{{refn|group=note|"Although the poverty of the finds in Odysseus's Ithaca is one of the notable exceptions".&lt;ref name="finley"/&gt;{{rp|44}}}} there is also the fact that the heroes lived at home in palaces (''[[Oikos|oikoi]]'') unknown in Homer's day; far from a nostalgic recall of the Mycenaean age, Finley asserts that "the catalog of his errors is very long".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His arms bear a resemblance to the armour of his time, quite unlike the Mycenaean, although he persistently casts them in antiquated bronze, not iron. His gods had temples, and the Mycenaeans built none, whereas the latter constructed great vaulted tombs to bury their chieftains in and the poet cremates his. A neat little touch is provided by the battle [[chariot]]s. Homer had heard of them, but he did not really visualize what one did with chariots in a war. So his heroes normally drove from their tents a mile or less away, carefully dismounted, and then proceeded to battle on foot."&lt;ref name="finley"/&gt;{{rp|45}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What the poet believed he was singing about was the heroic past of his own Greek world, Finley concludes.

During recent years scholars have suggested that the Homeric stories represented a synthesis of many old Greek stories of various Bronze Age sieges and expeditions, fused together in the Greek memory during the "[[Greek dark ages|dark ages]]" which followed the end of the Mycenean civilization. In this view, no historical city of Troy existed anywhere: the name perhaps derives from a people called the Troies, who probably lived in central Greece. The identification of the hill at Hisarlık as Troy is, in this view, a late development, following the Greek colonisation of Asia Minor during the 8th century BC.

It is also worth comparing the details of the Iliadic story to those of older Mesopotamian literature—most notably, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. Names, set scenes, and even major parts of the story, are strikingly similar.&lt;ref&gt;Martin West, ''The East Face of Helicon'' (Oxford 1999), pp. 336-338; T.B.L. Webster, ''From Mycenae to Homer'' (London 1958) pp. 82, 119ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics believe that writing first came to Greece from the east, via traders, and these older poems were used to demonstrate the uses of writing, thus heavily influencing early Greek literature.

==The ''Iliad'' as essentially historical==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[Image:Troas.png|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Troad]] (Troas).]]

Another opinion is that Homer was heir to an unbroken tradition of oral epic poetry reaching back some 500 years into Mycenaean times. The case is set out in ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' by [[Albert Lord|Albert B. Lord]], citing earlier work by folklorist and mythographer [[Milman Parry]]. In this view, the poem's core could represent a historical campaign that took place at the eve of the decline of the Mycenaean civilization. Much legendary material would have been added during this time, but in this view it is meaningful to ask for archaeological and textual evidence corresponding to events referred to in the ''Iliad''. Such a historical background gives a credible explanation for the geographical knowledge of Troy (which could, however, also have been obtained in Homer's time by visiting the traditional site of the city, which was in fact New Ilium, built at the base of the hill at Hisarlık) and otherwise unmotivated elements in the poem (in particular the detailed ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]''). Linguistically, a few verses of the ''Iliad'' suggest great antiquity, because they only fit the meter if projected back into [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]], in part due to the classical loss of the [[digamma]]; this trace of archaic language suggests a poetic tradition spanning the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. On the other hand, there are well-known interpolations in the text we have. Even though Homer was [[Ionians|Ionian]], the ''Iliad'' reflects the geography known to the Mycenaean Greeks,&lt;!--this idea needs to be attributed--&gt; showing detailed knowledge of the mainland but not extending to the [[Ionian Islands]] or [[Anatolia]], which suggests that the ''Iliad'' reproduces an account of events handed down by tradition, to which the author did not add his own geographical knowledge.

==The ''Iliad'' as partly historical==
As mentioned above, though, it is most likely that the Homeric tradition contains elements of historical fact and elements of fiction interwoven. Homer describes a location, presumably in the [[Bronze Age]], with a city. This city was near [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]] in northwest [[Turkey]]. Such a city did exist, at the mound of [[Hisarlik|Hisarlık]]. Homer describes the location as very windy, which Hisarlık almost always is, and several other geographical features also match; so it appears, therefore, that Homer describes an actual place, although this fact does not in itself prove that his story is true.

===Homeric evidence===
[[Image:Homeric Greece-en.svg|thumb|400px|Map of [[Bronze Age]] [[Greece]] as described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]]]''

Also, the ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]'' mentions a great variety of cities, some of which, including [[Athens]], were inhabited both in the Bronze Age and in Homer's time, and some of which, such as [[Pylos]], were not rebuilt after the Bronze Age. This suggests that the names of no-longer-existing towns were remembered from an older time, because it is unlikely that Homer would have managed to name successfully a diverse list of important Bronze Age cities that were, in his time, only a few blocks of rubble on the surface, often without even names. Furthermore, the cities enumerated in the ''Catalogue'' are given in geographical clusters, this revealing a sound knowledge of Aegean topography.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some evidence is mixed, though: locating the Bronze Age palace of [[Sparta]], the traditional home of [[Menelaus]], under the modern city has been challenging.

===Mycenaean evidence===
Likewise, in the Mycenaean Greek [[Linear B]] tablets, some Homeric names appear, including [[Achilles]] (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀑𐀩𐀄}}, ''a-ki-re-u''),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The word ''a-ki-re-u'' which is found on the [[Knossos|KN]] Vc 106 tablet, has been identified as ''Akhilleus''.&lt;/ref&gt; a name which was also common in the classical period, noted on tablets from both [[Knossos]] and [[Pylos]].&lt;ref name="ConantThomas2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conant|first1=Craig|last2=Thomas|first2=Carol G.|title=The Trojan War|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=0-313-32526-X|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Achilles of the Linear B tablet is a shepherd, not a king or warrior, but the very fact that the name is an authentic Bronze Age name is significant. These names in the Homeric poems presumably remember, if not necessarily specific people, at least an older time when people's names were not the same as they were when the Homeric epics were written down. Some story elements from the tablets appear in the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref name="Castleden2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Castleden|first=Rodney|title=Mycenaeans|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-24923-6|page=199|chapter=The Trojan War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hittite evidence===
The first person to point to the [[Hittite texts]] as a possible primary source was the Swiss scholar [[Emil Forrer]] in the 1920s and 1930s. In discussing an ethnic group called the ''Ahhiyawa'' in these texts, Forrer drew attention to the place names ''[[Wilusa]]'' and ''[[Taruisa]]'', which he argued were the Hittite way of writing ''(W)ilios'' (Ilios) and ''Troia'' (Troy). He also noted the mention of a Wilusan king [[Alaksandu]], who had concluded a treaty with the Hittite king [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]]; the name of this king closely resembled Alexandros/Alexander, the alternative name of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], the son of king [[Priam]]. Other identifications Forrer offered included Priam with [[Piyama-Radu]], and [[Eteocles (son of Andreus)|Eteocles]], king of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]], with one ''Tawagalawa''. However, despite his arguments, many scholars dismissed Forrer's identification of Wilusa-(W)ilios/Troia-Taruisa as either improbable or at least unprovable, since until recently the known Hittite texts provided no clear indication where the kingdom of Wilusa was located beyond somewhere in Western Anatolia.&lt;ref name="bryce"&gt;{{cite book |first=Trevor |last=Bryce |title=The Kingdom of the Hittites |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|394ff.}}

General scholarly opinion about this identification changed with the discovery of a text join to the [[Manapa-Tarhunda letter]], which located Wilusa beyond the [[Seha River]] near the Lazpa land. Modern scholars identify the Seha with the Classical Caicus River, which is the modern [[Bakırçay]], and the Lazpa land is the more familiar isle of [[Lesbos]]. As Trevor Bryce observes, "This must considerably strengthen the possibility that the two were directly related, if not identical."&lt;ref name="bryce"/&gt;{{rp|395}}

Despite this evidence, the surviving Hittite texts do not provide an independent account of the Trojan War. The Manapa-Tarhunda letter is about a member of the Hittite ruling family, Piyama-Radu, who gained control of the kingdom of Wilusa, and whose only serious opposition came from the author of this letter, Manapa-Tarhunda. King [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]] of the Hittites was the opponent of this king of Troy, and the result of Muwatalli's campaign is not recorded in the surviving texts.&lt;ref name="bryce"/&gt;{{rp|245–247}} The Ahhiyawa, generally identified with the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean Greeks]],&lt;ref name="bryce"/&gt;{{rp|59–63}} are mentioned in the [[Tawagalawa letter]] as the neighbors of the kingdom of Wilusa, and who provided a refuge for the troublesome renegade Piyama-Radu.&lt;ref name="bryce"/&gt;{{rp|321–324}} The Tawagalawa letter mentions that the Hittites and the Ahhiyawa fought a war over Wilusa.

===Geological evidence===
In November 2001, geologists John C. Kraft from the [[University of Delaware]] and John V. Luce from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] presented the results&lt;ref name = "confex"&gt;[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001AM/finalprogram/abstract_25431.htm  Confex].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Neil|title=Geology corresponds with Homer’s description of ancient Troy|url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2003/troy030303.html|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=U Daily (University of Delaware)|date=3 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; of investigations into the [[geology]] of the region that had started in 1977. The geologists compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the ''Iliad'' and other classical sources, notably [[Strabo]]'s ''Geographia''. Their conclusion was that there is regularly a consistency between the location of Troy as Hisarlik (and other locations such as the Greek camp), the geological evidence, and descriptions of the [[topography]] and accounts of the battle in the ''Iliad''.

'''Hyperlink cinema''' is a term coined by author [[Alissa Quart]], who used the term in her review of the film ''[[Happy Endings (film)|Happy Endings]]'' (2005) for the film journal ''[[Film Comment]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=quart&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate =July 25, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films are not [[hypermedia]] and do not have actual [[hyperlink]]s, but are multilinear in a more metaphorical sense.

In describing ''Happy Endings'', Quart considers captions acting as [[footnote]]s and [[Split screen (film)|split screen]] as elements of hyperlink cinema and notes the influence of the [[World Wide Web]] and [[Human multitasking|multitasking]].&lt;ref name="quart" /&gt; Playing with time and characters' personal history, [[plot twist]]s, interwoven storylines between multiple characters, jumping between the beginning and end ([[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and [[flashforward]]) are also elements.&lt;ref name="quart" /&gt; Ebert further described hyperlink cinema as films where the characters or action reside in separate stories, but a connection or influence between those disparate stories is slowly revealed to the audience; illustrated in Mexican director [[Alejandro González Iñárritu|Alejandro González Iñárritu's]] films ''[[Amores perros]]'' (2000), ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003), and ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name="ebert-syriana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ebert-babel" /&gt;

Quart suggests that director [[Robert Altman]] created the structure for the genre and demonstrated its usefulness for combining interlocking stories in his films ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) and ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993).&lt;ref name="MovieYearbook2007"&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] (2006). ''Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2007''. Andrews McMeel Publishing. p. 100. {{ISBN|0-7407-6157-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jean Renoir|Jean Renoir's]] 1939 ''[[The Rules of the Game ]]'' first used a narrative structure based on multiple characters and predates Altman's ''Nashville'' by 36 years.&lt;ref name="amc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/movie/1962/Kanchenjungha|title=Kanchenjungha|work=AMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quart also mentions the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' and discusses [[Alan Rudolph]]'s film ''[[Welcome to L.A.]]'' (1976) as an early prototype.&lt;ref name="quart"/&gt; ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004) is an example of the genre, as are [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (2002), ''[[Syriana]]'' (2005) ''[[Nine Lives (2005 film)|Nine Lives]]'' (2005) and ''[[Odu Raja Odu]]'' (2018).&lt;ref name="MovieYearbook2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/odu-raja-odu--a-black-comedy-that-is-watchable-review-tamil-siqvNtidjiifd.html|title=Review : Odu Raja Odu -A black comedy that is watchable (2018)|website=www.sify.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The hyperlink cinema narrative and story structure can be compared to social science's [[spatial analysis]]. As described by Edward Soja and Costis Hadjimichalis spatial analysis examines the "'horizontal experience'  of human life, the spatial dimension of individual behavior and social relations, as opposed to the 'vertical experience' of history, tradition, and biography."&lt;ref name="Soja-p59-67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soja |first=Edward W. |last2=Hadjimichalis |first2=Costis |year=1979 |title=Between Geographical Materialism and Spatial Fetishism: Some Observations on the Development of Marxist Spatial Analysis |journal=Antipode |volume=17 |issue=2–3 |pages=59–67 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1985.tb00334.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; English critic [[John Berger]] notes for the novel that "it is scarcely any longer possible to tell a straight story sequentially unfolding in time" for "we are too aware of what is continually traversing the story line laterally."&lt;ref name="Soja-p59-67" /&gt;

An academic analysis of hyperlink cinema appeared in the journal ''Critical Studies in Media Communication,'' and referred to the films as Global Network Films. Narine's study examines the films ''Traffic'' (2000), ''Amores perros'' (2000), ''21 Grams'' (2003), ''Beyond Borders'' (2003), ''Crash'' (2004; released 2005), ''Syriana'' (2005), ''Babel'' (2006) and others, citing network theorist [[Manuel Castells]] and philosophers [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. The study suggests that the films are network narratives that map the [[network society]] and the new connections citizens experience in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Narine |first=Neil |title=Global Trauma and the Cinematic Network Society |journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication |volume=27 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=209–234 |doi=10.1080/15295030903583556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyperlink television ==

An extension to hyperlink cinema has been proposed by [[Robert K. Logan]] and Emma Findlay-White to suggest that hyperlink television has many of the properties of hyperlink cinema in that it also plays with time and characters' personal history, [[plot twist]]s, contains interwoven storylines between multiple characters, jumps between the beginning and end ([[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and [[flashforward]]), and makes use of split screens and footnotes. But in addition it has some marked differences, to wit: weekly dramatic episodes often with multiple seasons such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and multiple episodes as in nightly newscasts such as [[CNN]]'s ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer]]''. The multiple characters of newscasts include two categories: the newsmakers, i.e. the subjects of the news and the anchors, reporters and commentators of the news shows.

'''Abu Abdallah Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Muhammad Ibn Ghazi al-'Utmani al-Miknasi''' (1437&amp;ndash;1513) was a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar in the field of [[history]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Arabic]] [[philology]] and [[mathematics]]. He was born in [[Meknes]] from banu uthman, a clan in the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[kutama]] tribe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Les historiens des Chorfa; essai sur la littérature historique et biographique au Maroc du XVIe au XXe siècle|last=Lévi-Provençal|first=Evariste|date=|publisher=Paris E.

For an explanation of his work, Ibn Ghazi wrote another treatise (about 300 pages long) titled ''Bughyat al-tulab fi sharh munyat al-hussab'' ("The desire of students for an explanation of the calculator's craving"). He included sections on arithmetic and algebraic methods.
He is also the author of ''Kulliyat'', a short work on legal questions and judgements in the Maliki madhab.&lt;ref&gt;E. Levi-Provencal, Chorfa, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kesar Filippovich Ordin''' (1835—1892) was a 19th-century [[Russians|Russian]] mathematician and historian.

He was a graduate in mathematics of [[St. Petersburg University]] and author of a number of articles on Finland, opposing Finnish separatism.

Ordin is perhaps most known of his work in which he tried to disprove the claims published by [[Finland|Finnish]] (also part of [[Russia]] at that time) [[Leo Mechelin]] about the 1809 [[Diet of Porvoo]]. Whereas Mechelin thought that [[Finland]] and Russia had made a treaty which resulted the two countries to form a so-called "permanent [[Political union|union]]", Ordin's version was that Finland had simply been merged to the motherland.

The '''Lordship of Biscay''' ({{lang-es|Señorío de Vizcaya}}, [[Basque language|Basque]]: ''Bizkaiko jaurerria'') was a region under feudal rule in the region of [[Biscay]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] between {{circa}}1040 and 1876, ruled by a political figure known as the Lord of Biscay. One of the [[Basque señoríos|Basque ''señoríos'']], it was a territory with its own political organization, with its own [[ensign|naval ensign]], consulate in [[Bruges]] and customs offices in [[Balmaseda]] and [[Orduña|Urduña]], from the 11th Century until 1876, when the [[Juntas Generales]] were abolished. Since 1379, when [[John I of Castile]] became the Lord of Biscay, the lordship got integrated into the [[Crown of Castile]], and eventually the [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].

== Mythical foundation ==
The first explicit reference to the foundation of the Biscayan lordship is in the ''Livro de Linhagens'', written between 1323 and 1344 by [[Pedro Afonso, Count of Barcelos]]. It is an entirely legendary account. The book narrates the arrival in Biscay of a man named Froom, a brother of the King of [[England]], who had expelled him from his kingdom. Froom along with his son, Fortun Froes, defeat the [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturians]] in [[Busturia]]. Froom is killed in battle; his son was named the first Lord of Biscay.  The Count of Barcelos then lists six additional mythical lords before he comes to Lope, the historical late-11th century lord, [[Lope Íñiguez]].&lt;ref&gt;José Ramón Prieto Lasa (2013), "La genealogía de los Haro en el ''Livro de Linhagens'' del Conde de Barcelos", ''Anuario de Estudios Medievales'', 43/2: 833-69 [http://estudiosmedievales.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosmedievales/article/view/462/470]&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable story among these accounts, which bears some resemblance to the [[Melusine]] legend, is that of the Lady of Biscay (''La Dama de Viscaya''), a beautiful stranger found in the countryside by Lord Diego López.  She joins him only when he agrees to certain conditions, but he later violates these and she flees into the country with their daughter.  Diego López is subsequently captured by Moors, and their son Enheguez Guerra seeks out his mother for help.  She gives him a horse, Pardalo, with whom he frees his father and is subsequently successful in all his battles.  The later lords are said to have made sacrifices at Busturia in thanks for these events, their failure to do so resulting in attacks on the lords and townsmen by a mysterious knight.&lt;ref&gt;José Ramón Prieto Lasa (1991), "Las Leyendas de los Señores de Vizcaya y la Tradicion Melusiniana", doctoral dissertation, [[Complutense University of Madrid]] [http://eprints.ucm.es/3243/1/T17299.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A better known but equally mythical story appears in the ''Bienandanzas e Fortunas'' of Lope García de Salazar (1454). In this story, a man named Çuria is born from the union of the god [[Sugaar]] and a Scottish (or in other versions, Irish, Danish or Frankish) princess in the village of [[Mundaka]]. Çuria was the elected chief of the Biscayans before the victorious battle of [[Arrigorriaga]] against the invading forces of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. Tradition holds that before the battle he saw two wolves carrying lambs in their mouths, presaging the victory; this scene is reflected in the arms of the lords of Biscay of the [[House of Haro]].  García de Salazar proceeds to give Çuria two sons by different mothers, Munso López (perhaps representing the historical [[Munio Velaz]] of the early 10th century) and Ínigo Esquira (an apparent temporally-displaced [[doppelgänger]] of the later lord of that name), who are followed by further apocryphal lords, Lope Díaz and Sancho López, before García de Salazar names a second Ínigo Esquira, this time representing the first authentic Lord of Biscay, the 11th-century [[Íñigo López]] ''Ezkerra''.  This tale of Çuria would further develop into the legend of [[Jaun Zuria]] (''the White Lord'') of Biscay, treated as a historical figure perhaps identical to Froom by 19th century historians.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Antonio Llorente, ''Noticias históricas de las tres provincias vascongadas en que se procura investigar el estado civil antiguo de Álava, Guipúzcoa y Vizcaya, y el origen de sus fueros'' (1808), vol. 5, pp. 429, 441, 486-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century historian [[Gonzalo Argote de Molina]] tells of other legendary lords of Biscay, and in this he is followed by several 17th and 18th century historians.  They name a Hudon (or Eudon), the son of a Duke of Cantabria, who became lord of Biscay and who had a son named Zeno who succeeded him in the title.  Hudon and Zeno are variously placed at different dates ranging from the mid-8th century to the late 9th century, and while the precise details differ in the different accounts, they are described as being related by marriage to the [[King of Pamplona]] and to [[Jaun Zuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monarquia de Espanña - Volumen1|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=CvpcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Zeno,+se%C3%B1or+de+Vizcaya&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZX04VeHRHaK1sATfh4HAAw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zeno%2C%20se%C3%B1or%20de%20Vizcaya&amp;f=false |year= |publisher=Pedro Salazar de Mendoza, Gil González Dávila, Bartolomé Ulloa }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origen de las dignidades seglares de Castilla y Leon con relacion summaria |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=6CEEtFnLVEwC&amp;pg=RA3-PA96-IA1&amp;dq=Zeno,+se%C3%B1or+de+Vizcaya&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nn84VeThOe3IsQTwtoDoDQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zeno%2C%20se%C3%B1or%20de%20Vizcaya&amp;f=false |year= |publisher=Pedro Salazar de Mendoza}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nobleza del Andalucia|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=uulOnaDLaHAC&amp;pg=RA2-PA84&amp;dq=Zeno,+se%C3%B1or+de+Vizcaya+nobleza+en+andalucia&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E4M4Va6WN4zdsAS734HAAw&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zeno%2C%20se%C3%B1or%20de%20Vizcaya%20nobleza%20en%20andalucia&amp;f=false |year= |publisher=Gonzalo Argote de Molina }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Epitome de los señores de vizcaya.

== History ==
{{History of the Basque people}}
===Biscay before the lordship===
The first time Biscay is mentioned with that name (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Vizcaya'') is in the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'' in the late 9th century, which tells of the regions repopulated under orders of [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso I]], and how some territories "owned by their own", among them Biscay, were not affected by these repopulations. Biscay is mentioned again in the 10th-century ''[[Códice de Roda]]'', which narrates the wedding between Velazquita, daughter of [[Sancho I of Pamplona]], to [[Munio Velaz]], Count of [[Álava]], in Biscay. It is considered then, that Biscay was by this period controlled by the [[Kingdom of Navarre]].&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizkaia.net/Kultura/gaztea/pdf/senorio_fuero_iglesia_reyes.pdf |title=Bizkaia y el Señorío |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Website of the Bizkaia Government |publisher=Diputación Foral de Bizkaia |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Haro===
In 1076, after the assassination of [[Sancho IV of Navarre]], [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] and [[Sancho Ramírez|Sancho Ramírez of Aragón]] fought a war over control of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. Count [[Íñigo López]], lord of Biscay surrendering the fortress of [[Bilibio]] to the Leonese, which aided in their conquest of [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]. In exchange, the Leonese monarchs promised to support Íñigo's personal interests in [[Durangaldea]], [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Álava]]. Íñigo died in 1077, and his son, [[Lope Íñiguez]] became [[Lord of Biscay]], now as vassal of the [[Kingdom of Castile]].&lt;ref name="history1" /&gt; The lordship would be later inherited by his son, [[Diego López I de Haro]], who served as Lord of Biscay until 1134 when he was defeated and probably killed by [[Alfonso the Battler]], King of [[Kingdom of Aragón|Aragón]] and Navarre.  The Lordship was then reintegrated into Navarre and [[Ladrón Íñiguez]], one of the most powerful men of the Navarrese court, was named Lord of Biscay. After his death, in 1155, his son [[Vela Ladrón]], who at the time was also Lord of Álava and Guipúzcoa, became Lord of Biscay and ruled through the reigns of Alfonso the Battler, [[García Ramírez of Navarre|García Ramírez]] and [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI]]. During that time, [[Lope Díaz I de Haro]] claimed the title of Lord of Biscay, though he never set foot on the land during his lifetime. In 1173 [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] attacked the Kingdom of Navarre and, a year later with the death of Vela Ladrón, occupied Biscay and restored the [[House of Haro]]: [[Diego López II de Haro]] was named Lord of Biscay.

In 1176 the kingdoms of Navarre and Castile signed a declaration of peace, agreeing to [[arbitration]] by [[Henry II of England]].  New borders were delimited and ratified in 1179.  Biscay was divided, with the left bank of the River [[Nervión]] becoming part of Castile, while the rest of Biscay, Durangaldea and Álava (east from the [[Bayas River]]) were retained by Navarre.  Diego López II, Lord of Biscay, swore fealty to the Navarrese monarchy and he ruled Biscay until 1183.  The Lords of Biscay were vassals of the Kingdom of Navarre until 1206, when the Haro family were given the title of [[Alférez (rank)|alférez]] at the Castilian court, and thereafter Biscay was in the area of influence of the Castilian kingdom, though it would not be wholly integrated into it until much later.

===Crown domain===
The Lordship of Biscay was in the hands of the Haro family and their descendants through 1370, when it passed to prince [[John I of Castile|Juan of Castile]], a distant kinsman with a maternal descent from the earlier Lords.  He would subsequently succeed to his father's Kingdom of Castile, and from that time the Lordship remained bound to the Castilian kingdom, and from the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]], to the Spanish crown. However, the Lordship maintained a high degree of autonomy, through the Biscayan law, or [[fueros]].

In 1874, after the abolishment of the [[First Spanish Republic]] and the beginning of the [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]], [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] abolished the Biscayan law and [[Juntas Generales]]; putting the Lordship to an end. Since then, Biscay has been fully integrated into the Spanish crown as the [[Biscay|province of Biscay]].

== Territory ==

=== ''Tierra Llana'' ===

[[File:TorreZamudio.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Vigil tower in Zamudio.]]

''Tierra Llana'' (literally, flatlands) refers to the territory that was not protected by stone walls, that is, mostly rural areas and [[Baserri|farms]]. This territory was organized into 72 ''[[elizate]]s'', grouped in six ''[[merindad]]es''. Each elizate had a representation in the [[Juntas Generales]].

* Merindad of Busturia (26 elizates): [[Mundaka]] (1st), [[Sukarrieta]] (2nd), [[Busturia]] (3rd), [[Murueta]] (4th), [[Forua]] (5th), Lumo (6th), [[Muxika]] (7th), [[Arrieta]] (8th), [[Mendata]] (9th), [[Arratzu]] (10th), [[Ajangiz]] (11th), [[Ereño]] (12th), [[Ibarrangelu]] (13th), [[Gautegiz Arteaga]] (14th), [[Kortezubi]] (15th), [[Ea, Biscay|Natxitua]] (16th), [[Ispaster]] (17th), [[Ea, Biscay|Bedarona]] (18th), [[Aulesti]] (19th), [[Nabarniz]] (20th), [[Gizaburuaga]] (21st), [[Amoroto]] (22nd), [[Mendexa]] (23rd), [[Berriatua]] (24th), [[Ziortza-Bolibar|Ziortza]] (25th) and [[Munitibar-Arbatzegi Gerrikaitz|Arbatzegi]] (26th).
* Merindad of Markina (2 elizates): [[Markina-Xemein|Xemein]] (27th) and [[Etxebarria]] (28th).
* Merindad of Zornotza (3 elizates): [[Amorebieta-Etxano|Amorebieta]] (29th), [[Amorebieta-Etxano|Etxano]] (30th) and Ibarruri (31st).
* Merindad of Uribe (32 elizates): Gorozika (32nd), [[Barakaldo]] (33rd), [[Abando]] (34th), [[Deusto]] (35th), [[Begoña]] (36th), [[Etxebarri]] (37th), [[Galdakao]] (38th), [[Arrigorriaga]] (39th), [[Arrankudiaga]] (40th), [[Lezama]] (41st), [[Zamudio]] (42nd), [[Loiu]] (43rd), [[Sondika]] (44th), [[Erandio]] (45th), [[Leioa]] (46th), [[Getxo]] (47th), [[Berango]] (48th), [[Sopelana]] (49th), [[Urduliz]] (50th), [[Barrika]] (51st), [[Gorliz]] (52nd), [[Laukiz]] (53rd), [[Gatika]] (54th), [[Lemoiz]] (55th), [[Maruri-Jatabe|Maruri]] (56th), [[Bakio]] (57th), [[Morga]] (58th), [[Mungia]] (59th), [[Gamiz-Fika|Gamiz]] (60th), [[Gamiz-Fika|Fika]] (61st), [[Fruiz]] (62nd), [[Meñaka]] (63rd) and [[Derio]] (72nd).
* Merindad of Bedia (1 elizate): [[Lemoa]] (64th).
* Merindad of Arratia (7 elizates): [[Igorre]] (65th), [[Arantzazu]] (66th), [[Artea]] (67th), [[Zeanuri]] (68th), [[Dima, Spain|Dima]] (69th), [[Zeberio]] (70th) and [[Ubide]] (71st).

All these regions were governed by the Biscayan law, or fuero. There were five ''de facto'' elizates, who did not belong to any merindad nor have any representation in the Juntas. Those were [[Alonsotegi]], [[Arakaldo]], [[Basauri]], [[Zaratamo]] and [[Arrankudiaga|Zollo]].

=== Cities and towns ===

There were 21 walled cities and towns, all founded during the [[Middle Ages]]. They were the towns of [[Balmaseda]], [[Bermeo]], [[Bilbao]], [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], [[Ermua]], [[Gernika]], [[Lanestosa]], [[Lekeitio]], [[Markina-Xemein|Markina]], [[Ondarroa]], [[Otxandio]], [[Portugalete]], [[Plentzia]], [[Mungia]], [[Areatza]], [[Errigoiti]], [[Larrabetzu]], [[Munitibar-Arbatzegi Gerrikaitz|Gerrikaitz]], [[Ugao-Miraballes|Miraballes]], [[Elorrio]] and [[Orduña-Urduña|Urduña]]. There towns had their own [[municipal charter]] or ''carta puebla'', with their own set of laws different from those of the ''fueros''.

=== Enkarterri ===
[[File:Avellaneda-casa-juntas.jpg|thumb|right|Casa de Juntas of Avellaneda]]
The region known as [[Enkarterri]] (''Encartaciones'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is located at the west of the River [[Nervión]] and was incorporated into the Lordship in the 13th Century by the [[House of Haro]]. It was traditionally formed by 10 republics, that were united in councils, each with its own representation and government. Enkarterri had its own ''junta'' and ''fueros'', but eventually adopted the ones from Vizcaya. Their representants held councils in [[Avellaneda, Biscay|Avellaneda]]. A single common representant of all of them assisted the Biscayan Juntas Generales. In the 17th Century, five of the councils got their own representant in the Juntas. In 1804, the Junta of Avellaneda was dissolved and its councils incorporated into the ''Tierra Llana''. The Enkarterri had the following councils: [[Karrantza]], [[Trucios-Trutzioz|Trutzioz]], [[Artzentales]], [[Sopuerta]], [[Galdames]], [[Zalla]], [[Güeñes]], [[Gordexola]], The Three Councils of the Somorrostro Valley ([[Santurtzi]], [[Sestao]] and [[Valle de Trápaga-Trapagaran|Trapagaran]]) and The Four Councils of the Somorrostro Valley ([[Muskiz]], [[Zierbena]], [[Abanto y Ciérbana-Abanto Zierbena|Abanto de Suso]] and [[Abanto y Ciérbana-Abanto Zierbena|Abanto de Yuso]]).

=== Durango ===
{{main|County of Durango}}
[[File:Conjunto_gerendiaga.jpg|thumb|right|The Foral Field of Gerediaga]]
The region known as the [[County of Durango]] (''Merindad de Durango'' in Spanish) and currently known as [[Durangaldea]] is a valley located along the upper river [[Ibaizabal]] and had the traditional name of ''Merindad of Durango''. Durango and its valley were a semi-autonomous region, controlled by the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] (later, [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]) and had its own Foral law, and celebrated its own council mettings in Gerediaga. In 1200 it was conquered by the Kingdom of Castile, and in 1212 [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] gives the land to [[Diego López II de Haro]], Lord of Biscay, as a reward for his services in the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]], being then incorporated into Biscay. The Merindad of Durango comprised the following [[elizate]]s: [[Abadiño]], [[Berriz]], [[Mallabia]], [[Mañaria]], [[Iurreta]], [[Garai, Biscay|Garai]], [[Zaldibar]], [[Atxondo|Arratzola]], [[Atxondo|Axpe]], [[Atxondo]], [[Izurtza]] and [[Elorrio]].

== Political institutions ==

[[File:Fuero de Vizcaya.png|thumb|right|250px|The 1575 publication of the Biscayan law or ''fuero''.]]

=== ''Juntas Generales'' ===

The Biscayan ''Juntas Generales'' were the maximum governing body of the Lordship; in the Juntas were represented all the Biscayan territories. There were in total 72 representants; each [[elizate]] had one, the towns and cities had one each.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia General del País Vasco'', Manuel Montero, Txertoa, Andoin, 2008, pag. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regiment ===

The ''Regimiento General'' (General Regiment) was established in 1500 and had the function of governing the territory when the Juntas were not meeting. It was formed by 12 ''regidores'' that were named by the Juntas and one ''[[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]''. The regiment meet three times each year, and eventually got the name of ''Universal government of the Lordship''.

The ''Regimiento Particular'' (Particular Regiment) was established in 1570 and had the function of governing in the General Regiment's absence. It was formed by all the ''regidores'' that lived in [[Bilbao]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia General del País Vasco'', Manuel Montero, Txertoa, Andoin, 2008, pag. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Diputación General'' ===

It served as the fundamental political institution of the Lordship during the 18th Century. In 1645 the Particular Regiment changed its name to ''Diputación General'' and were granted autonomy from the General Regiment. It was formed by seven members; six ''general members'' and one president, who was the ''[[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]''. Its function was to govern the ''Juntas Generales'', the Diputación had competences in military  and financial issues, as well as the maintenance of the roads and charities.&lt;ref name=ref_duplicada_1&gt;''Historia General del País Vasco'', Manuel Montero, Txertoa, Andoin, 2008, pag. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luke the Evangelist''' ([[Latin]]: ''[[Lucas (given name)|Lūcās]]'', {{lang-grc|Λουκᾶς}}, ''[[Loukas|Loukâs]]'', {{lang-he|לוקאס}}, ''Lūqās'', {{lang-arc|לוקא}}, ''Lūqā&amp;apos;'') is one of the [[Four Evangelists]]—the four traditionally ascribed authors of the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[Gospels]]. The Early [[Church Fathers]] ascribed to him authorship of both the [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Acts of the Apostles]], which would mean Luke contributed over a quarter of the text of the [[New Testament]], more than any other author. Prominent figures in early Christianity such as [[Jerome]] and [[Eusebius]] later reaffirmed his authorship, although the fragile evidence{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} of the identity of the author of the works has led to [[Authorship of Luke–Acts|discussion]] in scholarly circles, both secular and religious.

The New Testament mentions Luke briefly a few times, and the [[Pauline epistles|Pauline]] [[Epistle to the Colossians]] refers to him as a physician (from Greek for 'one who heals'); thus he is thought to have been both a physician and a disciple of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. Since the faith's early years, Christians have regarded him as a [[saint]]. He is believed to have been a [[martyr]], reportedly having been hanged from an olive tree, though some believe otherwise.

The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and other major denominations venerate him as '''Saint Luke the Evangelist''' and as a [[patron saint]] of artists, physicians, [[bachelors]], surgeons, students and butchers; his [[feast day]] takes place on 18 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint/st-luke-the-evangelist-23|title=St. Luke The Evangelist|last=|first=|date=|website=Catholic News Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Many scholars believe that Luke was a [[Greeks|Greek]] physician who lived in the Greek city of [[Antioch, Turkey]] in Ancient [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], although some other scholars and theologians think Luke was a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenic Jew]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding the Bible: A Reader's Introduction|last=Harris|first=Stephen L.|publisher=Mayfield|year=1985|isbn=0-87484-696-X|edition=2nd|location=Palo Alto|pages=266–68|chapter=The Gospels|author-link=Stephen L.

Koet"&gt;[[Bart J. Koet|Koet, Bart J.]], Five Studies on Interpretation of Scripture in Luke-Acts. Leuven University Press, 1989. pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Bart Koet"&gt;[[Bart J. Koet|Koet, Bart J.]], Dreams and Scripture in Luke-Acts.

His earliest notice is in Paul's [[Epistle to Philemon]]—{{Bibleref|Philemon|1:24}}. He is also mentioned in {{Bibleref|Colossians|4:14}} and {{bibleref|2 Timothy|4:11}}, two works commonly ascribed to Paul.&lt;ref name=Milligan&gt;''The New Testament Documents: Their Origin and Early History'', George Milligan, 1913, [[Macmillan and Co.]], p.&amp;nbsp;149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mornin&gt;''Saints: A Visual Guide'', Edward Mornin, Lorna Mornin, 2006, [[Eerdmans Books]], p.&amp;nbsp;74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aherne&gt;

{{quote|Luke, was born in [[Antioch]], by profession, was a physician.&lt;ref name=Hackett&gt;''A Commentary on the Original Text of the Acts of the Apostles'', [[Horatio Balch Hackett]], 1858, Gould and Lincoln; Sheldon, Blakeman &amp; Co., p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; He had become a disciple of the apostle Paul and later followed Paul until his [Paul's] martyrdom. He died at the age of 84 years. (p.&amp;nbsp;335)}}

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Saint Luke (Saint Luc) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Tissot]], ''Saint Luke (Saint Luc)'', [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]

[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] states that Luke was one of the [[Seventy Apostles]] (''[[Panarion]]'' 51.11), and [[John Chrysostom]] indicates at one point that the "brother" Paul mentions in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians 8:18 is either Luke or [[Barnabas]].(''Homily 18 on Second Corinthians'' on 2 Corinthians 8:18)




If one accepts that Luke was indeed the author of the Gospel bearing his name and also the ''Acts of the Apostles'', certain details of his personal life can be reasonably assumed. While he does exclude himself from those who were eyewitnesses to Jesus' ministry, he repeatedly uses the word "we" in describing the Pauline missions in ''Acts of the Apostles'', indicating that he was personally there at those times.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Micropædia vol. 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;554–55. Chicago: [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Inc, 1998. {{ISBN|0-85229-633-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is similar evidence that Luke resided in [[Troad|Troas]], the province which included the ruins of ancient [[Troy]], in that he writes in ''Acts'' in the third person about Paul and his travels until they get to Troas, where he switches to the first person plural. The "we" section of ''Acts'' continues until the group leaves [[Philippi]], when his writing goes back to the third person. This change happens again when the group returns to Philippi. There are three "we sections" in ''Acts'', all following this rule. Luke never stated, however, that he lived in Troas, and this is the only evidence that he did.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[File:Bodleian Library MS. Arm. d.13. Armenian Gospels-0043-0.jpg|thumb|upright|Luke as depicted in the head-piece of an Armenian Gospel manuscript from 1609 held at the [[Bodleian Library]].]]

The composition of the writings, as well as the range of vocabulary used, indicate that the author was an educated man. A quote in the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] differentiates between Luke and other colleagues "of the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]."

{{quote|10 My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. 11 Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me. ... 14 Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings. {{Bibleref|Colossians|4:10–11, 14}}.}}

This comment has traditionally caused commentators to conclude that Luke was a gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, that is not the only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a [[Hellenistic Jew|Hellenized Jew]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. McCall, Th.D. [http://www.levitt.com/essays/luke Was Luke a Gentile?]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase could just as easily be used to differentiate between those [[Jewish Christians|Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism]] and those who did not.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Luke's presence in [[Rome]] with the Apostle Paul near the end of Paul's life was attested by 2 Timothy 4:11: "Only Luke is with me". In the last chapter of the Book of Acts, widely attributed to Luke, there are several accounts in the first person also affirming Luke's presence in Rome, including {{Bibleref|Acts|28:16}}: "And when we came to Rome..." According to some accounts,{{Who|date=September 2014}} Luke also contributed to the [[authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07181a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Epistle to the Hebrews|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luke died at age 84 in [[Boeotia]], according to a "fairly early and widespread tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Butler's Lives of the Saints|last=|first=|publisher=HarperColllins Publishers|year=|isbn=978-0-06-069299-5|editor-last=Walsh|editor-first=Michael|location=New York|publication-date=5 July 1991|pages=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]], Greek historian of the 14th century (and others), Luke's tomb was located in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], whence his relics were transferred to [[Constantinople]] in the year 357.&lt;ref&gt;'Ecclesiasticae Historiae Nicephori Callisti', Lib.

The earliest manuscript of the Gospel, dated circa AD&amp;nbsp;200, ascribes the work to Luke; as did [[Irenaeus]], writing circa AD&amp;nbsp;180, and the [[Muratorian fragment]] from AD&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E.

Most scholars understand Luke's works ([[Luke–Acts]]) in the tradition of [[Greek historiography]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1116&amp;C=1230|title=A Historical Introduction to the New Testament|last=Grant|first=Robert M.|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 10: The Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621102923/http://religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1116&amp;C=1230|archive-date=21 June 2010|dead-url=Yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preface of ''The Gospel of Luke''&lt;ref name=preface&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%20(1:1-4)&amp;version=NLT | title = Luke 1:1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on historical investigation identified the work to the readers as belonging to the genre of history.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses''. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some disagreement about how best to treat Luke's writings, with some historians regarding Luke as highly accurate, and others taking a more critical approach.

Based on his accurate description of towns, cities and islands, as well as correctly naming various official titles, archaeologist [[William Mitchell Ramsay|Sir William Ramsay]] wrote that "Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy... [he] should be placed along with the very greatest of historians."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, ''The Bearing of Recent Discovery on the Trustworthiness of the New Testament'', 222, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Classics at [[Auckland University]], [[E.M. Blaiklock]], wrote: "For accuracy of detail, and for evocation of atmosphere, Luke stands, in fact, with [[Thucydides]]. The Acts of the Apostles is not shoddy product of pious imagining, but a trustworthy record... it was the spadework of archaeology which first revealed the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Blaiklock, The Archaeology of the New Testament, p. 96, Zondervan Publishing Houst, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar Colin Hemer has made a number of advancements in understanding the historical nature and accuracy of Luke's writings.&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, "The Book of Acts in the Setting of Hellenic History", 104–07, as summarized by MacDowell.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the purpose of Acts, New Testament Scholar [[Luke Timothy Johnson]] has noted that "Luke's account is selected and shaped to suit his apologetic interests, not in defiance of but in conformity to ancient standards of historiography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Luke Timothy|authorlink=Luke Timothy Johnson|title=The Acts of the Apostles|publisher=The Liturgical Press|year=1992|pages=474–76|url= http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/luke.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a position is shared by most commentators such as Richard Heard who sees historical deficiencies as arising from "special objects in writing and to the limitations of his sources of information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heard|first=Richard|title=An Introduction to the New Testament|chapter=13: The Acts of the Apostles|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1950|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showbook.asp?title=531|access-date=23 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620161529/http://religion-online.org/showbook.asp?title=531|archive-date=20 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During modern times, Luke's competence as a historian is questioned, depending upon one's ''a priori'' view of the supernatural.&lt;ref name="markpowell"/&gt; Since post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] historians work with [[methodological naturalism]],&lt;ref&gt;McGrew, Timothy, "Miracles", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N.

Bradley 1874/1935; Ehrman 2003: 229).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p96.htm|title=William Lane Craig and Bart Ehrman "Is There Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus?"|first1=Bart|last1=Ehrman|authorlink1=Bart D.

Mark Powell claims that "it is doubtful whether the writing of history was ever Luke's intent. Luke wrote to proclaim, to persuade, and to interpret; he did not write to preserve records for posterity. An awareness of this, has been, for many, the final nail in Luke the historian's coffin."&lt;ref name="markpowell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Mark|title=What are they saying about Luke?|year=1989|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=0-8091-3111-0|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jRu8_-GlKMC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=jesus'+route+cannot+be+reconstructed+on+any+map+and+in+any+case+luke+did+not+possess+one#v=onepage&amp;q=jesus'%20route%20cannot%20be%20reconstructed%20on%20any%20map%20and%20in%20any%20case%20luke%20did%20not%20possess%20one&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert M. Grant has noted that although Luke saw himself within the historical tradition, his work contains a number of statistical improbabilities such as the sizable crowd addressed by Peter in Acts 4:4. He has also noted chronological difficulties whereby Luke "has [[Gamaliel]] refer to [[Theudas]] and [[Judas of Galilee|Judas]] in the wrong order, and Theudas actually rebelled about a decade after Gamaliel spoke (5:36–7)"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== As an artist ==
[[File:Evangelist Luka pishustchiy ikonu.jpg|thumb|upright|Luke the Evangelist painting the first [[icon]] of the Virgin Mary.]]
Christian tradition, starting from the 8th century, states that he was the first [[icon]] painter. He is said to have painted pictures of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and Child, in particular the [[Hodegetria]] image in [[Constantinople]] (now lost). Starting from the 11th century, a number of painted images were venerated as his autograph works, including the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] and [[Theotokos of Vladimir|Our Lady of Vladimir]]. He was also said to have painted Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and Paul, and to have illustrated a gospel book with a full cycle of miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grigg|first=Robert|date=1987|title=Byzantine Credulity as an Impediment to Antiquarianism|url=|journal=[[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]]|volume=26|issue=1|pages=3–9|doi=10.2307/767073|jstor=767073|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The basic study on the legends concerning Saint Luke as a painter is Michele Bacci, Il pennello dell'Evangelista. Storia delle immagini sacre attribuite a san Luca (Pisa: Gisem, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Late medieval [[Guild of Saint Luke|Guilds of Saint Luke]] in the cities of Late Medieval Europe, especially [[Flanders]], or the "[[Accademia di San Luca]]" (Academy of Saint Luke) in Rome—imitated in many other European cities during the 16th century—gathered together and protected painters. The tradition that Luke painted icons of Mary and Jesus has been common, particularly in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. The tradition also has support from the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of India who claim to still have one of the [[Theotokos]] icons that Saint Luke painted and which St. Thomas brought to India.&lt;ref&gt;Father '''H. Hosten''' in his book ''Antiquities'' notes the following "The picture at the mount is one of the oldest, and, therefore, one of the most venerable Christian paintings to be had in India. Other traditions hold that St. Luke painted two icons which currently are in Greece: the "Theotokos Mega Spileotissa" (Our Lady of the Great Cave, where supposedly Saint Luke lived for a period of time in asceticism) and the "Panagia Soumela", and "Panagia Kykkou" which are in Cyprus."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hermen Rode 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Luke and the [[The Madonna|Madonna]], Altar of the Guild of Saint Luke, [[Hermen Rode]], [[Lübeck]] 1484.]]
In traditional depictions, such as paintings, [[evangelist portrait]]s, and church [[mosaic]]s, Saint Luke is often accompanied by an [[ox]] or [[bull]], usually having wings. Sometimes only the symbol is shown, especially when in a combination of those of all [[Four Evangelists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gospel Figures in Art|author=Zuffi|first=Stefano|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2003|isbn=0-89236-727-X|location=|pages=|chapter=The Evangelists and their symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=George Ashdown Audsley |author2= William Audsley |title=Handbook of Christian Symbolism |chapter=Chapter VI.

== Relics ==
Despot [[Đurađ Branković|George of Serbia]] purportedly bought the relics from the Ottoman sultan [[Murad II]] for 30,000 gold coins. After the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]], the kingdom's last queen, George's granddaughter [[Mary of Serbia, Queen of Bosnia|Mary]], who had brought the relics with her from Serbia as her dowry, sold them to the [[Venetian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bosnian Church: A New Interpretation: A Study of the Bosnian Church and Its Place in State and Society from the 13th to the 15th Centuries|last=Van Antwerp Fine|first=John|publisher=East European Quarterly|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the then [[Greek Orthodox]] Metropolitan [[Archbishop Ieronymos II of Athens|Ieronymos]] of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes and Levathia]] (the current Archbishop of [[Athens]] and All Greece) requested from [[Diocese of Padua|Bishop Antonio Mattiazzo of Padua]] the return of "a significant fragment of the relics of St. Luke to be placed on the site where the holy tomb of the Evangelist is located and venerated today". This prompted a scientific investigation of the relics in [[Padua]], and by numerous lines of empirical evidence (archeological analyses of the Tomb in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and the Reliquary of [[Padua]], anatomical analyses of the remains, [[carbon-14 dating]], comparison with the purported skull of the Evangelist located in [[Prague]]) confirmed that these were the remains of an individual of Syrian descent who died between 416 BC and AD 72.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1360095/DNA-test-pinpoints-St-Luke-the-apostles-remains-to-Padua.html|title=DNA test pinpoints St Luke the apostle's remains to Padua|last=Craig|first=Olga|date=21 October 2001|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diocese of Padua|Bishop of Padua]] then delivered to Metropolitan Ieronymos the rib of Saint Luke that was closest to his heart to be kept at his tomb in Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.traces-cl.com/archive/2000/novembre/luca.htm|title=The Beloved Physician|last=Tornielli|first=Andrea|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607075349/http://www.traces-cl.com/archive/2000/novembre/luca.htm|archive-date=7 June 2009|dead-url=Yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/16/world/body-of-st-luke-gains-credibility.html|title=Body of St. Luke Gains Credibility|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|date=16 October 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the relics of Saint Luke are so divided:
* The body, in the [[Abbey of Santa Giustina]] in Padua;
* The head, in the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague;
* A rib, at his tomb in Thebes.

'''Lunel''' ([[Provençal dialect|Provençal]]: ''Lunèl'') is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Hérault]] [[Departments of France|department]] in southern [[France]]. According to legend, Lunel was founded by [[Jews]] from [[Jericho]] in the first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farber |first=J.B. |title=The Pope's Jews in Provence: Itineraries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4axqMcS-1n8C |year=2013 |publisher=Editions Actes Sud |location=Arles |isbn=2330018975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a Jewish population by the first millennium, and an ancient synagogue is located there. 

[[File:Map commune FR insee code 34145.png|thumb|left|350 px|Map]]
{{clear-left}}

Lunel is located {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Montpellier]] and {{convert|28|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Nîmes]] ([[Gard]]).

==History==
The ancient Roman site of [[Ambrussum]] is located nearby. The [[troubadour]] [[Folquet de Lunel]] was from Lunel. 

Lunel was a centre of Jewish learning. It is thought that the family of [[Rashi]] (1040–1105), the great [[Rabbi]] and [[meforshim|commentator]], originated in Lunel. Other scholars include [[Jonathan ben David ha-Cohen|Jonathan of Lunel]], [[Meshullam ben Jacob]] of Lunel, his son [[Aaron ben Meshullam ben Jacob of Lunel]], [[Abraham ben David]] who taught in Lunel before moving to Posquières, and [[Asher ben Meshullam]] of Lunel.

Lunel was the birthplace of [[Louis Feuillade]] (1873&amp;ndash;1925), [[film director]] from the [[silent film|silent era]].  The artist [[Jean Hugo]] (1894-1984) lived in the Lunel area for most of his life and painted scenes from the surrounding countryside. The Parc Jean Hugo in the centre of the town was named after him.

Since the 20th century, the town has been a destination for Muslim immigrants from Algerian and other parts of North Africa. In 2015 the ''New York Times'' reported that 10% of all the French people killed fighting in Syria for [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] came from Lunel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/world/europe/french-town-struggles-over-departures-for-jihad.html?_r=0 "A French Town Linked to Jihad Asks Itself Why"], ''New York Times,'' January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5567">[[Image:Uzziah - Jotham - Ahaz.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''Uzziah-Jotham-Ahaz''.  Traditionally Jotham is the man in green on the left and the child with him is his son Ahaz.]]
'''Matthew 1:9''' is the ninth verse of the first chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[Bible]].  The verse is part of the [[synoptic gospels|non-synoptic]] section where the [[genealogy]] of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the legal father of [[Jesus]], is listed, or on non-[[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] interpretations the [[genealogy of Jesus]].  The purpose of the genealogy is to show descent from the line of kings, in particular [[David]], as the [[Messiah]] was predicted to be the son of David ([[2 Samuel]] 7:12; [[Psalms]] 89:3, 132:11, among others), and descendant of [[Abraham]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12:3; 22:18) .

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:And [[Uzziah|Ozias]] begat [[Jotham of Judah|Joatham]];
:and Joatham begat [[Ahaz|Achaz]];
:and Achaz begat [[Hezekiah|Ezekias]];

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:Uzziah became the father of Jotham.
:Jotham became the father of Ahaz.
:Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=1:9&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 1:9]

==Analysis==
This part (the second section - David to the Babylon Removal - as summarized in [[Matthew 1:17]]) of the list of Jesus' ancestry coincides with the list of the [[Kings of Judah]] that is present in a number of other parts of the [[Bible]],. Unlike other parts of Matthew's genealogy this list is fully in keeping with the other sources. [[Uzziah]], was King of Judah (809 BC - 759 BC) ([[Book of Amos|Amos]] 1:1) . According to [[William F. Albright]], [[Jotham of Judah|Jotham]] ruled from 742 BC until 735 BC and his son [[Ahaz]] ruled from his death until 715 BC. Ahaz's son [[Hezekiah]] ruled from 715 BC to 687 BC.  Hezekiah was the king whose actions prompted the Babylonians to take the Jews into captivity, as prophesied in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 38 and mentioned in the genealogy at [[Matthew 1:11|Verse 11]]. Hezekiah had fifteen years added to his lifespan by God, due to his piety. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

These kings are also listed in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 14-16, together with narrative about their reigns. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==The kings in Matthew 1:9==

The people mentioned in this section of the genealogy are all [[Kingdom of Judah|Kings of Judah]].

==Text==
See above for two English versions, the King James and World English Bible. See the [[#External links|external links]] for many more modern translations.

===Vulgate (Latin) text===

The Latin [[Vulgate]] of [[Jerome]] gives:

{{lang|la|Ozias autem genuit Ioatham Ioatham autem genuit Achaz Achaz autem genuit Ezechiam.}}

===Greek text===

The [[Koine Greek]] [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine text]] or majority text, and the [[textus receptus]] both read:

*{{lang|grc|οζιας δε εγεννησε τον ιωαθαμ ιωαθαμ δε εγεννησε τον αχαζ αχαζ δε εγεννησε τον εζεκιαν}}.

[[Constantin von Tischendorf]] gives rather {{lang|grc|Οζειας}} for the first king.

[[Westcott-Hort]] offers the main reading and also a variant {{lang|grc|αχας}} for the third king.
 
[[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]] has {{lang|grc|εγεννησεν}} instead of {{lang|grc|εγεννησε}}.

===Peshitta text===

The [[Peshitta]] text is substantially different, translated it is: Awazea fathered Yoram Yoram fathered [[Jehoshaphat|Yahoshapat]] fathered Khizaqea.

'''Mbuji-Mayi''' (formerly '''Bakwanga''') serves as the [[Capital (political)|capital city]] of [[Kasai-Oriental]] Province in the south-central [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. It is the third largest city in the country, following the capital [[Kinshasa]] and second largest city [[Lubumbashi]] but ahead of [[Kisangani]] and [[Kananga]], though the exact population is not known. Estimates ranged from a 2010 ''[[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]'' estimated population of 1,480,000 &lt;ref name ="CIA.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html | title =CIA The World Factbook | accessdate =May 30, 2011 | publisher =CIA }}&lt;/ref&gt; to as many as 3,500,000 estimated by the United Nations in 2008.&lt;ref name ="Neglect"&gt;{{Citation | last = UN Integrated Regional Information Networks  | title = Congo-Kinshasa; Neglect, Deaths in Prison Condemned | newspaper = Africa News  | date = Feb 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mbuji-Mayi lies in [[Luba people|Luba]] country on the [[Sankuru River]].  The name Mbuji-Mayi comes from the local language, [[Tshiluba]], and translates as "Goat-Water," a name deriving from the great number of goats in the region and the city's location on the Sankuru, making it a prime watering spot. Despite its large population, the city remains remote, having little connection to surrounding provinces or to Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. Air travel is provided through the [[Mbuji Mayi Airport]].

== History ==
=== Pre-independence ===
The region where the city of Mbuji-Mayi now stands was once a cluster of villages on land owned by the Bakwanga clan. Diamonds were first discovered in the area as early as 1907, but the true value of the find was not recognised until 1913.&lt;ref name ="Wrong"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wrong | first = Michela | title = In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2002 | chapter =5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pTK-vAobpZAC&amp;lpg=PT130&amp;ots=FGgs4PpFUX&amp;dq=0060934433&amp;pg=PT141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  | isbn = 0-06-093443-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discovery, a mining camp designed to house miners and company officials of the [[Societé minière de Bakwanga]] (MIBA) was developed in the area.&lt;ref name="SecondaryCitiesp125"&gt;United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ''The Management of Secondary Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa''. UN-Habitat, 1991, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young city, known at the time as Bakwanga, grew quickly but around strict planning by MIBA, which divided the community into labor camps, mining areas and living quarters. The city's growth was not explosive, and planning was done with the needs of the mining company in mind, not the development of the region as a general population centre.

In fact, fearing theft of the company's diamond resources, the MIBA actively discouraged building in the region and closely monitored who went in and out of the region. Every person in the region needed a permit allowing them to be there, and registration at a command post that monitored the population, which made indefinite residence in the area almost impossible to establish.&lt;ref name="SecondaryCitiesp126"&gt;United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ''The Management of Secondary Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa''. UN-Habitat, 1991, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; There was limited economic activity besides the company-run mining, with even limited agriculture, and the city's population remained low, at approximately 39,830 by the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="SecondaryCitiesp129"&gt;United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ''The Management of Secondary Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa''. UN-Habitat, 1991, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the city grew, more and more infrastructure needs required investment in roads, public works and hospitals. While several primary schools were developed for workers, until independence, there was no higher education available for the native population.&lt;ref name ="SecondaryCitiesp125" /&gt;

===Mineral wealth===
The area around Mbuji-Mayi is one of the richest sources of mineral wealth in the world. In the 1950s, it was estimated that the Mbuji-Mayi area had the world's most important industrial diamond deposits, containing at least 300 million karats of diamonds.&lt;ref name="Lukas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lukas|first1=J. Anthony|title=Gem Smuggling On The Rise In Congo|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/03/07/89914993.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 7, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was literally constructed on top of the diamond deposits, and while the city's reputation as a company town under tight control of Belgian economic interests meant it was neat and orderly, it also meant that the city's buildings and homes, including those of top MIBA executives, were sometimes demolished to access the diamonds.&lt;ref name= Lukas /&gt;

In the earlier years, most of the diamonds mined in the area came from one large MIBA-controlled mine on the city's outskirts, but diamonds could also be easily found in the area's streams and waterways, making it possible for anyone to collect them.

As of 1963, Mbuji-Mayi-based MIBA was the source of 80 percent of the world's [[industrial diamonds]] and 57 percent of all diamonds.&lt;ref name= Lukas /&gt;

=== Capital city of South Kasai ===
Mbuji-Mayi grew rapidly upon Congolese independence in 1960 with the immigration of members of the Luba ethnic group from different parts of the country.

Shortly after independence, [[Albert Kalonji]], a Luba tribal chief, declared himself ruler of the secessionist [[Mining State of South Kasai]] on Aug. 8, 1960 and established the city, still known as Bakwanga, as his capital. In April 1961, Kalonji declared himself as emperor of the region in a traditional tribal ceremony and then returned to Bakwanga, where he was "carried through crowds of chanting, singing and cheering Balubas," and dancing continued outside his royal palace there for four days.&lt;ref name="BalubasHail"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Balubas Hail Kalonji As Their King | newspaper = The Washington Post Times Herald | location = Washington | pages = A9 | date = 10 April 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrating was short-lived, as the central government [[Armée Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC) troops took control of the town and arrested Kalonji, by December 1961. After an escape from the jail in which he was being held, he briefly re-established his government. A second assault on the independent state was launched in the summer of 1962, with ANC government troops fighting poorly armed tribesmen outside of the city. Kalonji was captured again, on 4 October 1962, when ANC forces retook Bakwanga,&lt;ref name="CongoTroops"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Congo Troops Capture Kalonji, Crush Army | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times| location = Los Angeles| pages = 14 | date = 3 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively ending the region's independence.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Soon after the end of the secession, Bakwanga was renamed Mbuji-Mayi after the local river in an attempt to signify a Luba intra-ethnicity reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Pandey|first = Gyanendra|last2 = Geschiere|first2 = Peter| title = The Forging of Nationhood| publisher = Manohar| date = 2003| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CT6FAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=| isbn = 9788173044250| page= 203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jonas Nzemba ===
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zaïre and Mobutu paid little attention to Mbuji-Mayi, offering almost no money to build roads, schools or hospitals.

In the political vacuum, MIBA stepped in. In the place of the federal government, MIBA invested heavily in the region by repairing roads, paying soldiers and supplying water and electricity to the city from its own power station. The company set up a social fund of $5 to $6 million a year, roughly 8 percent of its annual budget. This money went to repair infrastructure and to fund a new university.&lt;ref name="DiamondCity"&gt;{{Cite news | title = The diamond city | newspaper = The Economist | location = London | pages = 42–43 | date = 15 March 1997 | url = http://www.economist.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investments and ita position as largest employer made [[Jonas Mukamba Kadiata Nzemba]] the chief executive officer of MIBA one of the most powerful men in the region, and the de facto governor of Mbuji-Mayi. Nzemba, who was appointed by Mobutu in 1986, was considered one of the more powerful players in Mobutu's political party, the [[Mouvement Populaire pour le Revolution]] (MPR), but he also called himself a "brother" of [[Étienne Tshisekedi]], a popular local political figure and Mobutu's most significant political opposition.&lt;ref name="IRINBrief"&gt;{{Cite web | last = United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs Integrated Regional Information Network for the Great Lakes | title = Zaïre: IRIN Briefing Part VI: Kasai, 3/21/97  | publisher = University of Pennsylvania - African Studies Center  | date = 21 March 1997 | url = http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/irin_32297.html | accessdate = 1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nzemba is credited with creating the [[Conference pour le Developpement Economique de Kasai Oriental]] (CDEKO), a regional economic development group in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="MiningIntel"&gt;{{Cite news | title =  Who's Who No. 129 - Jonas M. Kadiata Nzemba | newspaper = Africa Mining Intelligence| publisher = Indigo Publications | date = 29 March 2006 | url = http://www.africaintelligence.com/C/modules/login/DetailArt/LoginDetailArt.asp?rub=login&amp;lang=ang&amp;service=ART&amp;context=BOI&amp;doc_i_id=18583068 | accessdate = 1 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nzemba also backed the creation of the [[University of Kasai]], which was jointly sponsored by MIBA and the local Catholic Church, and which became the home base of CDEKO. The new organization spearheaded economic growth in Mbuji-Mayi, helped support the development of new agricultural and beer industry expansion around the city and launched [[Wetrafa]], a locally owned airline.&lt;ref name="IRINBrief" /&gt;

Mobutu's willingness to let Nzemba control the province through MIBA came at a price, as Nzemba may have skimmed as much as $1.5 to $2 million a month to send to Mobutu's personal bank accounts.&lt;ref name ="Wrong" /&gt;
 
Although Nzemba and MIBA's largesse helped Mbuji-Mayi maintain some semblance of infrastructure and social services, at least by the standards of Zaïre, the city still struggled. Electricity was spotty, the university was broken down and the road system disintegrated with the rain.&lt;ref name="Wrong" /&gt; Outside of the sector of the city controlled by MIBA, the road network was virtually nonexistent, and in 1991, the entire city had only about 19.7&amp;nbsp;km of paved roads, all in poor condition. The state-run power plant went out of service in 1990, with an 11.8&amp;nbsp;mW hydroelectric plant run by MIBA as the only source of electricity, but frequent power outages led residents to other sources of heat and light, mainly wood and charcoal leading to widespread deforestation in the area.&lt;ref name="SecondaryCitiesp133"&gt;United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ''The Management of Secondary Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa''. UN-Habitat, 1991, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil war ===
As the [[First Congo War]] broke out, Nzemba initially sided with Mobutu against the rebels led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], but as Kabila's [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire]] (AFDL or ADFLC) approached the city, Nzemba quickly switched sides.

When the city fell to the rebels on April 4, 1997, looting by both sides took a toll on the city, particularly MIBA's mining operations.&lt;ref name="Misser"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Misser | first = F  | title = Democratic Republic of the Congo: Kabila turns diamonds to dust | newspaper = African Business  | location = London  | pages = 31–32  | publisher = IC Publications  | year = 2000 | url = http://www.africasia.com/africanbusiness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nzemba was also summoned to Goma to speak with Kabila, who held him for several days, prompting his family to purchase advertising in newspapers publicising their concerns for his safety.&lt;ref name="EmergencyUpdate"&gt;{{Cite web|last=United Nations Integrated Regional Information Networks |title=IRIN Emergency Update No.152 on the Great Lakes |date=17 April 1997 |url=http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/peo/peo_4164.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019035538/http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/peo/peo_4164.html |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nzemba was released shortly after, but MIBA began making "voluntary contributions" to Kabila's war otally, an estimated $5.5 million in 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref name="Misser" /&gt;

In October 1998, Mbuji-Mayi was occupied by both Zimbabwean and Chadian troops as they poured into the country to back up Kabila as the [[First Congo War]] began to grow.&lt;ref name="WarTurnsCommercial"&gt;{{Cite news | title =  War turns commercial | newspaper = The Economist |  date = 22 October 1998 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/173322 | accessdate = 1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and economy ==

===Diamond mining and smuggling===
As a commercial center, Mbuji-Mayi handles most [[diamond]] [[mining]], [[diamond panning|panning]], and production in the Congo.  [[Societé minière de Bakwanga]] and Diamant International are the major diamond producers in the area.

The city had always been a major source of the world's diamonds and that did not change after independence, nor did the age-old tradition of diamond smuggling. But after independence, that ability of the government to control the diamond smuggling quickly eroded and diamond smuggling dramatically increased.&lt;ref name= Lukas /&gt; The black market quickly eclipsed the official business, and in 1963, MIBA officially recorded producing 1.4 million karats of diamonds, while smugglers exported between 4 million and 6 million more karats.&lt;ref name= Lukas /&gt;

===Architecture===
The city lacks much of the organization and classic European architecture that other major cities in the DRC inherited from the Belgian colonists. Journalist Michela Wrong, described Mbuji-Mayi as "a curiously soulless settlement, with no tangible centre ... It is purely functional conurbation, dedicated to making money, with little left over for less focused activities." &lt;ref name="Wrong" /&gt; Even today, much of the city revolves around the Avenue Inga, where diamond and mineral buyers have set up shop and the city's main business remains the diamond trade.&lt;ref name="Wrong" /&gt;

== Climate ==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]] (Aw).&lt;ref name="Climate-Data.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate: Mbuji-Mayi - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/519/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions''''' is a [[1918 in literature|1918]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[linguistics]] and [[mythology]] book written by [[George Aaron Barton]].&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first published by [[Yale University Press]] in the United States and deals with commentary and translations of twelve [[cuneiform]], Sumerian [[myth]]s and texts discovered by the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]].&lt;ref name="Meade1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

'''N. S. B. Gras''' (1884–1956) was a Canadian professor at the [[Harvard Business School]] who invented the [[academic discipline]] of [[Business History]].

==Early life==

'''Operation Thao La''' (21 November–16 December 1971) was a [[Royal Lao Government]] (RLG) dry season offensive during the [[Laotian Civil War]], aimed at severing the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and retrieving the Lao [[Bolaven Plateau]] from the grip of the [[People's Army of Vietnam]]. Its objectives were the use of recently captured [[Salavan (city)|Salavan]] as a jumpoff point for occupying Tha Theng and Ban Phong. Key to the plan was a prearranged daily allotment of supportive tactical air power.

In the event, the Royalists captured their two objectives. However, they lost both Salavan and Paksong to the [[North Vietnamese]]; they also failed to find the Communist transshipment point whose conquest would have interdicted the Trail.

==Overview==
{{See also|Operation Left Jab|Operation Junction City Jr.|Operation Maeng Da|Operation Honorable Dragon|Operation Diamond Arrow|Tchepone Operation|Project Copper|Operation Silver Buckle|Operation Desert Rat}}

The [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] was central to the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) strategy for the conquest of [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Second Indochina War]]. When a series of nine CIA-sponsored incursions from [[Military Regions of Laos|Military Region 3]] (MR 3) and Military Region 4 (MR 4) of the southern panhandle of the [[Kingdom of Laos]] during 1969 and 1970 failed to [[Interdiction|interdict]] the Trail, the massive [[Operation Lam Son 719]] was staged on 8 February 1971 to cut it. In the wake of this failure, CIA backed Laotian guerrillas and [[Royal Lao Government]] [[military irregular]]s made further attempts at severing the [[Military logistics|logistical]] [[lines of communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Nalty, pp. 5–7; 149–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castle, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 217–224, 268–272, 276–284, 289–291&lt;/ref&gt;

A string of Communist [[transshipment point]]s, called ''Binh Trams'', stretched the length of the Trail. Each garrisoned by approximately a PAVN [[regiment]], and was responsible for construction and maintenance of an assigned Trail segment. A ''Binh Tram'' typically consisted of [[motor transport]] [[battalion]]s, [[combat engineer]] battalions, [[antiaircraft]] units, as well as medical personnel, infantry units for security, and a communications section.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, p. 312 note 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In mid-May 1971, [[Operation Phoutah]] failed to secure the [[Covert sites of the Laotian Civil War|forward airfield]] at Moung Phalane as a starting point for Royalist attacks against the Trail.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp 289–292.&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day blood bath of [[Operation Phiboonpol]] from 9–11 June 1971 was indecisive.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt; From 28 July through 31 October 1971, [[Operation Sayasila]] managed to wrest control of Route 23 and the towns of [[Salavan (city)|Salavan]] and Paksong and their associated airstrips from the (PAVN), but failed to conquer the entire [[Bolaven Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 304–307.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, from 1–9 November, [[Operation Bedrock (Laos)|Operation Bedrock]] weakened the PAVN troops on the Trail by denying them rice. It also left ''Groupement Mobile 41'' (GM 41) field tested and ready for further operations.&lt;ref&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 304–308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Thao La==

Operation Thao La was planned to take advantage of improved flying weather during the nascent dry season in Laos. Its objective was ''Binh Tram 37'', 30 kilometers east of Communist-held [[Tha Teng District|Thateng]], Laos. [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF) tactical air power was arranged, with 18 daily sorties allotted for the first two days, then 24 sorties daily for a fortnight. The dark hours would be covered by two gunship sorties per night. If Thao La was successful in smashing ''Binh Tram 37'', it would both restrict supplies to Communist forces in [[South Vietnam]] and starve the Communists off the Bolaven Plateau.&lt;ref name=conboy308&gt;Conboy, Morrison, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the preceding Operation Sayasila, Operation Thao La was aimed at regaining control of the Plateau for the [[Royal Lao Government]] (RLG). The towns of [[Tha Teng District|Thateng]] and Ban Phone were to be captured from the PAVN in a three column multi-battalion offensive.&lt;ref name=hukle22&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As a preliminary move, the gains of Operation Sayasila needed to be protected. On 8 November, ''Bataillon Infanterie 9'' (BI 9) joined ''Bataillon Volontaire 46'' (BV 46) and ''Bataillon Volontaire 48'' (BV 48) in garrisoning Paksong. Four battalions from MR 3 returned to their base at [[Savannakhet]].&lt;ref name=hukle31&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the American restrictions on Lao military planning, approval by the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] did not come through until 15 November.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Sexton, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November, just prior to Thao La's scheduled start, a purported four battalion force of PAVN were reported by Royalist guerrillas, 19 kilometers northwest of Salavan. Tactical air strikes on the concentration resulted in about 70 enemy troops killed.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;&lt;ref name=hukle28&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 1971, the operation was preceded by ten sorties of defensive [[land mines]] air-dropped by the U.S. Air Force. [[Commando Raiders]] occupied a [[helicopter landing pad|helicopter landing zone]] (HLZ) north of Ban Phone. On 21 November, USAF [[F-4 Phantom II]]s struck the HLZ, and the 1,150 Royalist guerrillas of the ''Groupement Mobile 33'' (GM 33) regiment was lifted in unopposed from [[Salavan (city)|Salavan]]. By 1100 hours, it had secured the area with only minor opposition, and all four of its battalions encamped within two kilometers of the village.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hukle, et al, pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 21 November, three battalions of GM 41 swept south through the [[rice paddies]] outside of Salavan. With no appreciable resistance offered by the PAVN, the GM 41 column made it to Ban Nongnok, where they overran the 49th PAVN [[Field Hospital]] on the 23rd. At this time, USAF tactical air blasted an HLZ atop Phou Thioum. Although about 50 PAVN troops tried to defend the hilltop, USAF [[A-1 Skyraider]] strikes quelled them. After capturing the position, the fourth Royalist battalion of GM 41 established a fire base with a [[75mm pack howitzer]], three 75mm [[recoilless rifle]]s, and three 81mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s. The Royalists could now drop artillery shells anywhere in the vicinity of Ban Nongnok.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 25 November, all Royalist objectives had been secured except Tha Theng proper. The following day saw the Royalist reserve of two guerrilla battalions moved north from [[Covert sites of the Laotian Civil War|Lima Site 449]] (LS 449) to reinforce the move into Tha Theng; by afternoon, the three year occupation by the Communists had been ended.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;&lt;ref name=hukle25&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November, GM 33 began clearing Route 16 and its surrounding valley as it handed westward to link up with the Royalist troops in Tha Theng. It covered half the distance in the next two days, while meeting ever-increasing Communist resistance. On 1 December, it captured four trucks. Stretching into battalion line, the irregular regiment swept for PAVN rice caches and supply depots to deprive the Communists of [[materiel]]. Westward moving partisans began to struggle with trees downed to block Route 16. In the meantime, PAVN began a series of [[squad]]-sized attacks on Tha Theng.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;&lt;ref name=hukle26&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, at Paksong, the 9th PAVN Regiment had probed the Royalist defenses 21 times during November.&lt;ref name=hukle31&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December at Tha Theng, a PAVN battalion attacked an irregular battalion. Meanwhile, intelligence reports made it clear that PAVN forces were coalescing near the former Communist [[transshipment point]]. As a counter, the USAF honored an emergency request and dropped aerial denial ordnance along two projected approach lanes to Tha Theng. The USAF also consented to extending the supply of 24 sorties of daily tactical air power for Thao La through 27 December 1971.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hukle, et al, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 2200 hours 5 December, PAVN intruders began probing the Royalist positions at Salavan. Night long close air support by a [[Royal Lao Air Force]] (RLAF) [[AC-47]] gunship helped the Royalist ''Bataillon Volontaires 41'' (BV 41) hold until near dawn. At 0500 hours, a PAVN force of at least three battalions struck Salavan. [[Raven Forward Air Controllers]] directed 60 sorties of tactical air strikes upon them throughout the morning and early afternoon. However, at 1430 hours, the Royalist commander called retreat; the monarchist regulars scattered west and north, leaving Salavan to the Communists, and further isolating the Royalist irregular troops at Tha Theng and Ban Phong.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;&lt;ref name=hukle29&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as Thao La unfolded, the PAVN continued their own offensive operations. By the end of the first week in December, Raven FACs noticed freshly built PAVN bunkers within 50 meters of Paksong's defenses. A skirmish on 8 December resulted in two Royalist killed and ten claimed PAVN dead. Air strikes called by the Royalists are estimated to have killed 20 more PAVN soldiers.&lt;ref name=hukle31/&gt;

At 2000 hours on 9 December, four tanks and two PAVN infantry battalions struck GM 41 at Tha Theng. Striking from the north, they split in half to form two attacking columns. One of the tanks penetrated the Tha Theng [[perimeter]], locked one tread, and spun on the other while firing in all directions, dispersing two of the Royalist guerrilla battalions. The two remaining RLG battalions clung to Tha Theng until reinforced. At 0430 on the 10th, the PAVN armor retreated. The Royalists had suffered 20 killed and 23 wounded, in return for unknown enemy losses. Raven FACs directed [[close air support]] sorties on the Communists for the remainder of the day. It also requested mining sorties along Route 23, to block or destroy PAVN tanks inbound to Salavan.&lt;ref name=conboy308b&gt;Conboy, Morrison, pp. 308–309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hukle27&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the PAVN still were trying to take Paksong. Between 10 and 12 December, there were several engagements, ranging from skirmishes between small units up to company engagements of several hours. At its fiercest, the battle escalated to use of [[B-40 rocket]]s, DK-82 [[recoilless rifle]]s, and 60mm mortars by the PAVN. In return, the Royalists called in RLAF [[T-28 Trojan]] strikes, [[AC-47 gunship]] fire missions, and artillery fire. On 13 December, the outpost of irregulars on Phou Nongkin relocated to the two peaks of Phou Thevada lying three kilometers east of Paksong. On 14 December, four battalions of Royalist guerrillas ambushed the PAVN as they gathered north of the town. Two days later, the same guerrilla force was hit by both 60mm and 82mm mortar fire backed by a ground assault from three sides. The guerrillas scattered in retreat.&lt;ref name=hukle32&gt;Hukle, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented with the dilemma of which objective was most valuable to their cause, the RLG opted on attempting to retake Salavan while holding Tha Theng. GM 33 was approaching Tha Theng from the east as it moved along Route 16. Leaving a small partisan garrison at Tha Theng, the RLG elected to move its four irregular battalions north for a surprise counterattack on Salavan. Beginning 8 December, troops that had withdrawn from Salavan began to rendezvous 32 kilometers west of town. They were mustered, re-equipped, and resupplied to attack northwards towards Salavan on 15 December. A USAF mission dropped both defensive area denial munitions and land mines under direction of Raven FACs. On 16 December, the four irregular battalions left Tha Theng to assault Salavan. Operation Thao La was officially ended.&lt;ref name=conboy309&gt;Conboy, Morrison, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hukle, et al, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The official end of Operation Thao La did not terminate Royalist military action. The recouped guerrillas from Tha Theng had closed to seven kilometers south-southeast of Salavan on 20 December. Two regular Royalist units, ''Bataillon Volontaires 41'' (BV 41) and ''Bataillon Volontaires 46'' (BV 46), were ordered into a flanking attack from the west, although they never budged. The Tha Theng irregulars directed tactical air strikes on the PAVN on 22 and 23 December despite poor flying weather; they followed up with a ground assault. An estimated 250 PAVN were killed in this action, but Salavan remained in Communist hands. The MR 4 command then decided that Salavan could not be held by the RLG even if recaptured. On 24 December, the four battalions of irregulars from Tha Theng joined BV 41 and BV 46 in a retreat from Salavan.&lt;ref name=conboy309/&gt;&lt;ref name=hukle30&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the PAVN action end coincide with Operation Thao La's finish. Even as a purported 1,000 PAVN troops bombarded forward positions at Paksong with mortar fire, making them difficult to reinforce and resupply, they also angled to cut Route 23 to entrap the Royalists. There was little retaliatory air power available; most tactical air power was being used against Salavan or on the [[Plain of Jars]]. On the evening of 18 December, headlights were spotted outside Paksong. On the 19th, tank tread marks were spotted 14 kilometers north of town; at least three tanks were suspected. By 24 December, PAVN troops were spotted on Route 23 between Paksong and the Royalist home base of Pakse. During the next two days, a number of PAVN heavy machine guns moved in on Paksong, complicating Royalist-backed aerial traffic. The bombardment of the town's northern defenses increased.&lt;ref&gt;Hukle, et al, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 1971, two PAVN battalions closed in on Paksong. The two guerrilla battalions on Phou Thevada withdrew into the town. The guerrillas from north of town rushed in after taking 11 killed. Although the Royalist defenders outnumbered the attacking Vietnamese, they fled westward anyhow down Route 23 toward home. Four howitzers, five trucks, and smaller equipment were abandoned to the victors.&lt;ref name=hukle34&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December, the PAVN entered Paksong and torched it. That evening, a tactical air strike destroyed the abandoned howitzers and trucks.&lt;ref name=hukle34/&gt;

==Results==

Operation Thao La gained its two objectives of Tha Theng and Ban Phong by its official end on 16 December. However, it lost its offensive's launching point at Salavan in the process. It also failed to break the PAVN's grip on the eastern Bolavan Plateau where it overwatched the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Although the Royalists had gained their objectives at Tha Theng and Ban Phon, they also lost Salavan and Paksong.&lt;ref name=conboy308b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hukle, et al, pp. 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The RLG casualty list totaled 2,118—399 killed, 1,376 wounded, and 343 missing. GM 41 was especially hard hit. On the other side, PAVN casualties were deemed to be 653 killed by air, 551 killed in ground combat, and 763 wounded, totaling 1,967 dead or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Hukle, et al, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Thao La failed to find ''Binh Tram 37''.&lt;ref name=conboy308/&gt;

'''Paschal Beverly Randolph''' (October 8, 1825 – July 29, 1875) was an African American medical doctor, [[occultist]], [[spiritualist]], [[trance medium]], and writer. He is notable as perhaps the first person to introduce the principles of erotic alchemy to North America, and, according to [[A. E. Waite]], establishing the earliest known [[Rosicrucian]] order in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen H. Greenfield|Greenfield, T. Allen]] (2000). [http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/randolph.htm ''Paschal Beverly Randolph: Sexual Magick in the 19th Century''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[New York City]],{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=248}} Randolph grew up in New York City. He was a free man of mixed-race ancestry, a descendant of [[William Randolph]]. His father was a nephew of [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] and his mother was Flora Beverly, whom he later described as being of mixed English, French, German, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Deveney (1996), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was young, leaving him homeless and penniless; he ran away to sea in order to support himself. From his adolescence through to the age of twenty, he worked as a sailor.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=248}}

As a teen and young man, Randolph traveled widely, due to his work aboard sailing vessels. He journeyed to England, through Europe, and as far east as [[Persia]], where his interest in [[mysticism]] and the occult led him to study with local practitioners of [[folk magic]] and various religions. On these travels he also met and befriended occultists in England and [[Paris, France]].

==Career==
Returning to New York City in September 1855, after "a long tour in Europe and Africa," he gave a public lecture to African Americans on the subject of emigrating to India. Randolph believed that "the Negro is destined to extinction" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Illinois State Register'' (Springfield, IL), September 20, 1855, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the sea, Randolph embarked upon a public career as a lecturer and writer. By his mid-twenties, he regularly appeared on stage as a [[trance medium]] and advertised his services as a spiritual practitioner in magazines associated with [[Spiritualism]]. Like many Spiritualists of his era, he lectured in favor of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of [[slavery]]; after emancipation, he taught literacy to freed slaves in New Orleans.

In addition to his work as a [[trance medium]], Randolph trained as a doctor of medicine and wrote and published both fictional and instructive books based on his theories of health, sexuality, Spiritualism and [[occultism]]. He wrote more than fifty works on magic and medicine, established an independent publishing company, and was an avid promoter of [[birth control]] during a time when it was largely against the law to mention this topic.

Having long used the pseudonym "The Rosicrucian" for his Spiritualist and occult writings, Randolph eventually founded the [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis]] in 1858, and their first lodge in [[San Francisco]] in 1861, the oldest [[Rosicrucian]] organization in the United States, which dates back to the era of the [[American Civil War]]. This group, still in existence, today avoids mention of Randolph's interest in [[sex magic]], but his magico-sexual theories and techniques formed the basis of much of the teachings of another occult fraternity, the [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor]], although it is not clear that Randolph himself was ever personally associated with the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin et al., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Randolph was the principal of the Lloyd Garrison School in New Orleans when on October 14, 1865, he wrote to Garrison in [[Boston]] requesting assistance for his school.&lt;ref&gt;''The Liberator'', November 10, 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief and teaching==
Randolph described himself as a Rosicrucian.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=247}} He had worked "largely alone", producing "his own synthesis" of "esoteric teachings".{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=247}}
The manner in which Randolph incorporated sex into his occult system was considered uncharacteristically bold for the period in which he lived.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=247}}

==Pre-Adamism==
Randolph was a believer in [[pre-Adamism]] (the belief that humans existed on earth before the biblical [[Adam]]) and wrote the book ''Pre-Adamite Man: demonstrating the existence of the human race upon the earth 100,000 thousand years ago!'' under the name of Griffin Lee in 1863. His book was a unique contribution towards pre-Adamism because it wasn't strictly based on biblical grounds. Randolph used a wide range of sources to write his book from many different world traditions, [[esoteric]]a and ancient religions. Randolph traveled to many countries of the world where he wrote different parts of his book. In the book he claims that Adam was not the first man and that pre-Adamite men existed on all continents around the globe 35,000 years to 100,000 years ago. His book was different from many of the other writings from other pre-Adamite authors because in Randolph's book he claims the pre-Adamites were civilised men while other pre-Adamite authors argued that the pre-Adamites were beasts or [[hominids]].&lt;ref&gt;Paschal Beverly Randolph, ''Pre-Adamite Man: demonstrating the existence of the human race upon the earth 100,000 thousand years ago!'', 1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A peripatetic man, he lived in many places, including New York state, [[New Orleans]], San Francisco, and [[Toledo, Ohio]]. He married twice: his first wife was African-American, his second wife was Irish-American.

==Death==
Randolph died in Toledo, Ohio, at the age of 49, under disputed circumstances. According to biographer Carl Edwin Lindgren, many questioned the newspaper article "By His Own Hand" that appeared in ''The Toledo Daily Blade''. According to this article, Randolph had died from a self-inflicted wound to the head. However, many of his writings express his aversion to suicide. [[R. Swinburne Clymer]], a later Supreme Master of the ''Fraternitas'', stated that years after Randolph's demise, in a death-bed confession, a former friend of Randolph had conceded that in a state of jealousy and temporary insanity, he had killed Randolph. Lucus County Probate Court records list the death as accidental. Randolph was succeeded as Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas, and in other titles, by his chosen successor [[Freeman B. Dowd]].

==Influence and legacy==
Randolph influenced both the [[Theosophical Society]] and—to a greater degree—the [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor]].{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=247}}

In 1994, the historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] noted that Randolph had been largely neglected by historians of esotericism.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=247}} In 1996, a biography was published, ''Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician'' by John Patrick Deveney and Franklin Rosemont.

The '''Dutch Polygoon-Profilti''' was a cinema [[newsreel]] company in the [[Netherlands]] from 1919 to 1987. It started with weekly news items in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] movie theaters and lasted until 1987 when it finally surrendered to television news shows.

The company was founded in 1919 and then made in-between movies for the silent movies of that time. Starting from 1921 it made ordered custom movies like 'the winning of brown coal "Carisborg"' (name translated) or 'Steam wheat mill "Holland" in Amsterdam' (name translated).
Then in 1924 it started with cinema newsreel ''Hollands Nieuws'', first bi-weekly, from the 1930s weekly.

"Where they are not, nothing is happening" was the motto of the cameramen of Polygoon who traveled through the Dutch country to capture news and local culture. There was a lot of competition at that time of other companies like Profilti and Haghefilm. Contracts for sport events, cameramen trying to cheat each other or fighting, aggressive sales methods and vague acquisitions were common.

After [[World War II]] the Polygoon-journal had its glorydays; 400 different cinemas weekly showed ''Neêrlands Nieuws'' and ''Wereldnieuws''. In 1946 editor [[Philip Bloemendal]] (1918–1999) started as commentator; his particular voice became synonymous with Polygoon. Because of the emerge of the television in the late 1950s Netherlands the Polygoon journals lost attention, but it lasted until 1987 when it finally ended.

Cameramen employed by Polygoon had orders to fill their reels, no matter what. If not for news, then with the local celebrity or even shots of famous buildings or locations. Because of this Polygoon now is an archive of [[Stock footage]] available for other productions. The Polygoon archive is a valuable historical film archive. It is currently being digitalized by the [[Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision]] located in [[Hilversum]].
Several Polygoon newsreels can also be found on [[YouTube]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4879">'''Romulus Cândea''' (October 7, 1886 – January 27, 1973) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-born [[Romania]]n ecclesiastical historian.

==Biography==
Born in [[Avrig]], [[Szeben County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Austria-Hungary]], his father was a [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest. He studied at the [[Samuel von Brukenthal National College|German High School]] in [[Sibiu]] from 1897 to 1905, followed by the Theology Faculty at [[Chernivtsi University|Czernowitz University]] in [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukovina]] from 1905 to 1909. The same institution granted him a doctorate in 1912,&lt;ref name="pacu"&gt;[http://biserica.org/WhosWho/DTR/C/GheorgheCiuhandu.html "Cândea, Romulus"], entry in [[Mircea Păcurariu]], ''Dicționarul Teologilor Români'', [[Editura Univers Enciclopedic]], Bucharest, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and he returned for a while to teach in Sibiu.&lt;ref name="p&amp;pp420"&gt;''Politics and Political Parties in Roumania'', p. 420. London: International Reference Library Publishers Co., 1936. {{OCLC|252801505}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued to study history and philosophy at [[Leipzig University]], earning a doctorate in philosophy and master's degree in fine arts there in 1916.&lt;ref name="pacu"/&gt;

From March 1915 to October 1919, he taught church history and pedagogy at the theological seminary in Sibiu. By the time he left, both Transylvania and Bukovina had united with Romania; from 1919 to 1922, he was professor of general church history at his alma mater in what was now [[Chernivtsi|Cernăuți]]. Between 1922 and 1940, when the area was [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied by the Soviet Union]], he was professor within the department of medieval, modern and contemporary world history within the Literature and Philosophy Faculty at Cernăuți. For the 1923-1924 academic year, he was dean of the faculty, while from 1925 to 1926, he was rector of the university.&lt;ref name="pacu"/&gt; In 1921, Cândea was involved in a student-led campaign to fire two Jewish professors, including [[Eugen Ehrlich]], and wrote an article denouncing the "ferocious [[pan-Germanism]] of a Jew".&lt;ref name="nast"&gt;Lucian Nastasă, ''Antisemitismul universitar în România (1919-1939)'', p.44. Ed. Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor Minorităților Naționale, Cluj-Napoca, 2011, {{ISBN|978-6-06-927445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Cândea was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]]. He was a lay member both of the [[Cernăuți Archdiocese]]'s assembly and of the national church congress.&lt;ref name="pacu"/&gt; A friend and trusted advisor to [[Ion Nistor]], his professional achievements, in the opinion of historian Lucian Nastasă, did not amount to much.&lt;ref name="nast"/&gt; He also had a parallel career in politics, serving as mayor of Cernăuți from 1927 to 1929.&lt;ref name="nast"/&gt; Within the [[Romanian Parliament]], he represented his university both in the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]] and in the [[Romanian Senate|Senate]] in a number of legislatures.&lt;ref name="pacu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nast"/&gt; He was a prominent member of the quasi-fascist [[Romanian Front]],&lt;ref name="p&amp;pp420"/&gt; elected on [[Pentecost]] 1935 as its regional leader for Bukovina.&lt;ref&gt;"D-l Vaida-Voevod la Cernăuți.

Between 1940 and 1947, Cândea was a professor of world history within the Literature and Philosophy Faculty of [[Cluj University]], which met at Sibiu for the first five years of that period, due to the [[Second Vienna Award]].&lt;ref name="pacu"/&gt; In 1948, the new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|stripped Cândea of his Academy membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Păun Otiman]], [http://www.akademos.asm.md/files/1948_anul%20imensei%20jertfe%20a%20Academiei%20romane.pdf "1948 - Anul imensei jertfe a Academiei Române"], in ''Academica'', Nr. 4 (31), December 2013, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Serb Democratic League in the Ottoman Empire''' ({{lang-sr|Српска демократска лига у Отоманској царевини}}) was an Ottoman Serb political organisation established on August 13, 1908, at the [[First Serb Conference]] (August 10–13), immediately after the [[Young Turk Revolution]].

It included the Serb elite of [[Raška (region)|Old Raška]], [[Kosovo and Metohija]], and [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Aegean Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatomir P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">'''Sujit Wongthes''' (or '''Wongthet''') (b. 1945) is a Thai journalist, historian, and author.

== Biography ==
Wongthes attended [[Silpakorn University]], graduating from the archaeology program there. During his time at university, he wrote for the student journal "Sangkhomsat Paritht" (Social Science Review), in which he criticized excessive materialism and the Americanization of Thai culture; he wrote contemporaneously with [[Sulak Sivaraksa]], who was the journal's editor at the time.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;Baker, Chris, Baker, Christopher John, and Prongpaichit, Pasuk [https://books.google.com/books?id=oFGwJJ21zx8C&amp;pg=PA206 "A History of Thailand"] pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote for "Prachachat", a newspaper associated with progressive elements of Thai society. After the military coup that toppled the [[Seni Pramoj]] administration, "Prachachat" was shut down. Three years later, Wongthes founded ''[[Sinlapa Watthanatham]]'', an arts and culture magazine, and served as the magazine's editor.&lt;ref name="Lysa"&gt;Lysa, Hong [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20072199?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Twenty Years of Sinlapa Watthanatham: Cultural Politics in Thailand in the 1980s and 1990s"] [[Journal of Southeast Asian Studies]] 31,1 (March 2000), 26-47&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Wongthes' most famous works was titled "Jek Phon Lao", meaning "Chinese mixed with Lao." In this work, he advanced the position that modern Thai are a mixture of native [[Lao people]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese migrants]] to [[Siam]], as well as other groups. This contradicted the Thai nationalist historiography, which was based on the idea that Thais had been driven out of southern China and which pitted Thai identity against Chinese identity. He followed this work with "Khon Thai Mai Dai Ma Chak Nai" ("The Thai Did Not Come From Somewhere Else"), which further attacked nationalist ideas by showing [[Tai people]] still living happily in China.&lt;ref name="Thak"&gt;Chaloemtiarana, Thak [https://books.google.com/books?id=6f0CMvP203wC&amp;pg=PA246 "Thailand: The Politics of Despotic Paternalism"] pp. 246-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognitions ==
Wongthes was recognized with a [[Sriburapha Award]] in 1993, and further awarded the title of [[National Artist (Thailand)|National Artist]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="NatArt"&gt;[http://art.culture.go.th/art01.php?nid=30 National Artist: Sujit Wongthes] (in Thai) Ministry of Culture, Department of Cultural Promotion&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Taisu''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 太素; [[pinyin]]: Tàisù), or '''''Grand Basis''''', compiled by Yang Shangshan (楊上善), is one of four known versions of the ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' (''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon''), the other three being the ''[[Suwen]]'', the ''[[Lingshu]]'', and the partially extant ''Mingtang'' (明堂 "Hall of Light").

==Time of compilation==
On the basis of Yang Shangshan's official title at the time of compilation, Nathan Sivin argues that the ''Taisu'' was written in 656 or later, most likely under the reign of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|emperor Gaozong]] (mid-7th century) of the [[Tang dynasty]], and that Yang compiled it from fragments of one or several post-[[Han dynasty|Han]] versions of the ''Neijing''.&lt;ref&gt;Sivin (1998): 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of medicine Qian Chaochen, who had once claimed that Yang Shangshan died under the [[Sui dynasty]] (late 6th century),&lt;ref&gt;Qian (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; is now arguing that because Yang referred to the Palace Library as the "Orchid Pavilion" (''lantai'' 蘭臺) in one of his notes, he must have compiled the ''Taisu'' sometime between 662 and 670, the few years during which that name was in use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.shouxi.net/html/qikan/zgyx/zywxzz/200612244/wxyj/20080831061618484_321861.html Qian] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
Soon lost in China, the ''Taisu'' survived in manuscript copies in Japan, where it was re-discovered in the late 19th century. The content of the ''Taisu'' overlaps with parts of both the ''Suwen'' and the ''Lingshu''. It is an important text to consult when studying the history of Chinese medical ideas.

'''''The Nativity''''' was a 58-minute United States television drama with music about the birth of [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]], presented on the television anthology ''[[Westinghouse Studio One]]''. Directed by [[Franklin Schaffner]], it  is a rare modern network television production of an authentic [[mystery play]], mostly culled from the York and Chester mystery plays of the 14th and 15th centuries in England. The adaptation was by [[Andrew Allan]]. The presentation, originally telecast live the evening of December 22, 1952 on [[CBS]], has been preserved on kinescope. It has been issued in several DVD public domain versions.[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IN68IW] It can also be seen complete online on [[Internet Archive]].

The play was performed in what is now known as [[Elizabethan English]]. Although it takes its text straight from fifteenth-century English, the words were not pronounced as [[Middle English]] would be, but in a more modern manner. Musical selections were selected from Christmas carols and sung by the [[Robert Shaw Chorale]]. The cast included [[Thomas Hardie Chalmers|Thomas Chalmers]], [[Paul Tripp]], and [[Miriam Wolfe]]. [[Hurd Hatfield]] serves as narrator.[https://archive.org/details/Nativity]

'''''The Tall Target''''' is a 1951 American [[historical film|historical]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Anthony Mann]] and starring [[Dick Powell]], [[Paula Raymond]] and [[Adolphe Menjou]]. Powell stars as a police sergeant who tries to stop the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]] at a train stop as Lincoln travels to his inauguration. It is based on the alleged [[Baltimore Plot]].

The film's sets were designed by the [[art director]]s [[Eddie Imazu]] and [[Cedric Gibbons]]. 

==Plot==
New York Police Sergeant John Kennedy once guarded Abraham Lincoln for 48 hours while he was campaigning for [[President of the United States]], and came away deeply impressed by the man. Kennedy has infiltrated a cabal and discovered that an assassination attempt will be made as the president-elect makes his way by train via Baltimore to Washington, DC. His boss, Superintendent Simon G. Stroud (an uncredited [[Tom Powers]]), dismisses the threat as "hogwash", as does Caleb Jeffers ([[Adolphe Menjou]]), a militia colonel with whom Stroud is meeting. Kennedy resigns on the spot to try to foil the conspirators on his own. Having already sent a copy of his report to the Secretary of War, he [[telegram]]s Lincoln, urgently requesting a meeting in Baltimore.

On February 22, 1861, he boards the Night Flyer Express train bound for Baltimore and Washington, where Inspector Reilly (an uncredited [[Regis Toomey]]) is to give him his train ticket. However, Kennedy cannot find his friend. Without a ticket, he is forced to get off by conductor Homer Crowley ([[Will Geer]]), and there are no more tickets to be had. As the train starts pulling away, Kennedy sprints aboard anyway. Among the other passengers are Mrs. Charlotte Alsop ([[Florence Bates]]), an anti-slavery writer; Lance Beaufort ([[Marshall Thompson]]), a soldier from Georgia who plans to resign and enlist in the Confederate army; his sister Ginny ([[Paula Raymond]]); and their slave Rachel ([[Ruby Dee]]).

After much searching, Kennedy finally discovers Reilly's body on the exterior platform of a car, but the corpse slips off the train as he is reaching for it.  When he returns to what should have been his berth, he finds an imposter ([[Leif Erickson (actor)|Leif Erickson]]) claiming to be him and in possession of his ticket. The conductor is summoned. Fellow passenger Jeffers vouches for Kennedy and gives him a spare ticket to share his compartment.

The imposter forces Kennedy off the train at gunpoint at the next stop, planning to kill him when the train whistle sounds. Kennedy grapples with him. The commotion attracts Jeffers' attention, and the colonel shoots and kills the conspirator. When they reboard, Jeffers offers Kennedy first use of the only bed in their compartment. After Kennedy appears to be dozing, Jeffers steals the [[derringer]] he had loaned the ex-policeman and shoots him. Kennedy had become suspicious (as Jeffers' shot could easily have hit him) and tampered with the bullet. Jeffers confesses he is in the plot in order to protect his shares in Northern cotton mills, which would be adversely affected by war.

At the next stop, Kennedy tries to have Jeffers arrested, but Jeffers obtains confirmation by telegram from Stroud that Kennedy is no longer a police officer, and it is Kennedy who is taken into custody by Lieutenant Coulter ([[Richard Rober]]). Rachel tries to give Kennedy an urgent message, but is brushed off by Coulter. Kennedy manages to escape and get back on the train. Meanwhile, the exasperated conductor is ordered to hold the train until a special package is delivered. Passenger Mrs. Gibbons (an uncredited [[Katherine Warren]]) meets and takes aboard her ailing husband.

Kennedy runs into Rachel, who informs him that Beaufort is getting off at Baltimore, not Atlanta as he had claimed. He is taken prisoner by Beaufort and tied up in Jeffers' compartment. The plotters are disappointed, however, when they receive news that Lincoln has cancelled his speech at Baltimore, where Beaufort was to assassinate him.

Jeffers gets off, but as the train is pulling away, he remembers Mrs. Gibbons; he surmises her "husband" is actually Lincoln in disguise. Running after the train, he manages to alert Beaufort. Kennedy, however, frees himself and, in the ensuing struggle, sends the would-be assassin tumbling from the speeding train. Afterward, Mrs. Gibbons tells Kennedy that she is an undercover [[Pinkerton Government Services, Inc.|Pinkerton]] agent, and that his report to the War Department was read by [[Allan Pinkerton]], who persuaded Lincoln to cancel his speech and travel incognito on the train as the ailing Mr. Gibbons.

{{About|the 1931 Baptist history text by James Milton Carroll|the 1976 historical novel|Kenneth Bulmer}}
{{italic title}}
[[File:The Trail of Blood.jpg|thumb|400px|]]
'''''The Trail of Blood''''' (1931) is a book by American [[Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] [[James Milton Carroll]]. It is a collection of five lectures he gave on the history of [[Baptist]] churches, which he presented as a succession from the first Christians.  

The full title is ''The Trail of Blood -: Following the Christians Down through the Centuries - or, The History of Baptist Churches from the Time of [[Christ]], Their Founder, to the Present Day''.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;William Hull, "William Heth Whitsitt: Martyrdom of a Moderate," ''Distinctively Baptist: Essays on Baptist History'', ed. Marc A. Jolley, John D. Pierce, pp. 237-78, p. 255, note 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll presents modern Baptists as the direct succession of a strain of Christianity dating to [[Apostolic Age|apostolic]] times, which was a [[Landmarkism|Landmarkist]] view first promoted in the mid-nineteenth century by [[James Robinson Graves]].  He started an influential movement in Tennessee and the western states. The Landmark controversy divided many Baptists, and ultimately led to the formation of the [[American Baptist Association]] in 1924, as well as Gospel Missions and unaffiliated churches. 

Carroll claims a descent by modern Baptists from such earlier groups as the [[Waldensians]], the [[Cathari]], the [[Paulicians]], and the [[Donatists]].  Carroll acknowledges a number of other writers, including G.H. Orchard and [[John T. Christian]]. The title is taken from [[James Robinson Graves]]' ''[[The Trilemma]]''.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt; The book was published in the year Carroll died. Today the copyright to Carroll's book is held by Ashland Avenue Baptist Church in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

==Controversy==

James Edward McGoldrick wrote a response to Carroll's work called ''Baptist Successionism'' which gave researched opposition to the theory of "[[Baptist Successionism]]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">According to some Medieval authors, between 580 AD and 700 AD a great number of Slavic
tribes entered the lands of the Byzantine Empire, the groups of [[Slavs]] arrived to
the regions of Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Bulgaria,
Greece and Kosovo. The Slavs as described from the Byzantine author Procopius were
people with light blond hair, long skulled and were tall.
A German historiographer by the name of Jordanes mentions that the [[Venethi]] sub-
divided into three groups : Venethi, [[Antes (people)|Antes]] and the [[Sclaveni]]. Later the
Sclaveni began moving southwards towards the [[Danube river]], while the Antes began
moving southeast towards the [[Black Sea]]. These tribes as mentioned by [[Jordanes]]
all spoke a Slavic dialect.
