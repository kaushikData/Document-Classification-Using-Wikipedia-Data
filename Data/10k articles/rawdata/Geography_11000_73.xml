'''Amazonas State''' ({{lang-es|Estado Amazonas}}, {{IPA-es|esˈtaðo amaˈsonas|IPA}}) is one of the 23 [[States of Venezuela|states ''(estados)'']] into which [[Venezuela]] is divided. It covers nearly a fifth of the area of Venezuela, but has less than 1% of Venezuela's population.

The state capital is Puerto Ayacucho. The capital until the early 1900s was [[San Fernando de Atabapo]]. Although named after the [[Amazon River]], most of the state is drained by the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. Amazonas State covers 176,899&amp;nbsp;km² and, in 2007, had a population of 142,200. Its density is 0.8 inhabitants per km².

Amazonas has Venezuela's highest proportion of [[Indigenous peoples in Venezuela|indigenous peoples of Venezuela]]; these make up only around 1.5% of the population nationwide, but the proportion is nearly 50% in Amazonas.&lt;ref&gt;Van Cott (2003), "Andean Indigenous Movements and Constitutional Transformation: Venezuela in Comparative Perspective", ''Latin American Perspectives'' 30(1), p52&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The territory covered by present-day Amazonas was previously part of the [[Guayana Province]], a Province of the [[Spanish Empire]] (from 1585) and later of Venezuela (until 1864, when the [[Provinces of Venezuela]] were replaced by the [[States of Venezuela]], following the [[Federal War]]). Amazonas was created as a state in 1994, having been a Federal Territory since 1864.

[[File:Arthur Donaldson Smith.png|thumb|Arthur Donaldson Smith]]
'''Arthur Donaldson Smith''' (1866–1939) was an [[United States|American]] [[Physician|doctor]], [[hunter]], and [[explorer]] of Africa. In the 1890s he made a geological expedition to Lake Rudolph (now [[Lake Turkana]]), passing through what was then [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], southern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2003/12/26-12-03/Ethiopia.htm Address by former US ambassador to Ethiopia (archive of Addis Tribune)]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to visit Ethiopia, he had to get permission from [[Menelik II]]. The trip lasted 18 months and took place between 1894 and 1895. In 1897 he published a book about his trip called, ''Through Unknown African Countries: the First Expedition from Somaliland to Lake Rudolf''.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/681/ |title = Through Unknown African Countries: the First Expedition from Somaliland to Lake Rudolf |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1897 |accessdate = 2013-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 three new [[species]] of [[reptiles]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] were named in his honor by Belgian-British [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[George Albert Boulenger]]: ''Zamenis smithi'' (now ''[[Short racer|Platyceps brevis smithi]]''), ''[[Hemidactylus|Hemidactylus smithi]]'', and ''[[Pseuderemias|Pseuderemias smithii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. 2011.

The 'Bosnian pyramid complex' is a [[Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeological]]&lt;ref name="balkanologie"/&gt; notion to explain the formation of a cluster of natural hills in central [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Osmanagić initiated excavations in 2006 and has since reshaped one of the hills, making it look like a [[stepped pyramid]].&lt;ref name="Woodard2007a"&gt;Woodard, C.

Archaeopress, Oxford, England. {{ISBN|978-1407310077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The academic community has called for the government to end funding of excavations and disruption of the site because of the damage to true archeological resources.&lt;ref name="BBC2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smiths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epoch2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/358139-5-mysterious-ruins-that-predate-known-civilization/|title=5 Mysterious Ruins That Predate Known Civilization?|author=Tara Maclsaac|date=13 November 2013|publisher=The Epoch Times|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have noted that the claims have been used for serious ideological, political and economic gains by various factions in Bosnia.  Although Osmanagić's claims have been completely disproved by the scientific community, the site has attracted pseudoscience enthusiasts.  By June 2016, Osmanagic had completed an "archeological park" at one of the hills, where he attracts volunteers who are constructing botanical gardens; meditation sessions have been held at the site.&lt;ref name="reuters2016"/&gt;  It has been noted that tourist traffic has aided the economy of this small Muslim town, located near the front of the [[Bosnian War|war]] that destroyed so much of the country in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="reuters2016"/&gt; 

As of 2017, Osmanagic continues to make alterations to the hills and add to his marketing about them. His work is now based on private funding.

==Osmanagić's claims==
The hills are located near the town of [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], northwest of [[Sarajevo]]. The town was Bosnia's capital during the [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], and ruins of a [[Old town of Visoki|medieval fortress]] are located atop Visočica hill.&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt; Given the defensive strategic value of hilltop locations, other civilizations built facilities at this site: the fortress was built over an old observation post of the Roman Empire. It had been constructed on top of the ruins of a more ancient settlement.&lt;ref name="BBC2006"/&gt; The hills are a type known as [[flatiron (geomorphology)|flatirons]]. Archaeological geologist Paul Heinrich of [[Louisiana State University]] has said that such formations are common throughout the world, for example, the so-called 'Russian Twin Pyramids' in [[Vladivostok]], and there are many in the nearby region.&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt;

In October 2005, Osmanagić and his supporters initiated a long-running media campaign to promote the pseudo-scientific belief that [[Visočica hill]] and the surrounding hills are an ancient pyramid complex.  In an interview with [[Philip Coppens (author)|Philip Coppens]] in ''[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]'' (April–May 2006), Osmanagić suggested that they were most likely constructed by the [[Illyrians]], who (according to Osmanagić) lived in the area from 12,000 BC to 500 BC. He has since argued that Visočica is an example of cultures building on top of other cultures.&lt;ref name="BBC2006"/&gt; In 2017 Osmanagić was reported to have claimed that the structures date back 34,000 years.&lt;ref name="express.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Austin|first1=Jon|title=‘Ancient pyramid’ discovery key to Nikola Tesla’s communication with aliens, says expert|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/773789/Bosnian-Pyramid-Nikola-Tesla-standing-waves-aliens|accessdate=March 4, 2017|newspaper=''[[The Daily Express]]''|date=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition,  Osmanagić claims that tunnels around the hill complex, which have been named Ravne tunnels, are an ancient man-made underground network.&lt;ref name="BBC2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Straits2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/pyramids-exist-in-bosnia-archaeologist|title=Pyramids exist in Bosnia: Archaeologist|author=Carolyn Khew|date=14 August 2015|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are claimed to be 2.4 miles (3.8&amp;nbsp;km) long.&lt;ref name="BBC2006"/&gt; He claims to have found fossilised leaves in them dating back 34,000 years.&lt;ref name="Straits2015"/&gt;

Osmanagić supports a number of fringe claims, saying he discovered 'standing waves' at the top of the largest of the hills; waves which he asserts travel faster than light and prove the existence of a 'cosmic internet' that allows for intergalactic communication.&lt;ref name="Marshall2017"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/2017/09/be-reasonable-episode-046-sam-osmanagic/ |title=Episode #046 – Sam Osmanagic |website=[[Merseyside Skeptics Society#Be Reasonable|Be Reasonable]] |publisher=[[Merseyside Skeptics Society]] |last1=Marshal |first1=Michael |author-link=Michael Marshall (skeptic) |date=28 September 2017 |number=046 |time= |access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also promotes the [[ancient astronaut hypothesis]], and believes that human beings are the product of [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name="express.co.uk"/&gt;

Osmanagić has given his own names to the hills.  He has named the two largest hills as the 'Pyramid of the Sun' and the 'Pyramid of the Moon' (not to be confused with the genuine pyramids of the [[Pyramid of the Sun|Sun]] and the [[Pyramid of the Moon|Moon]] in [[Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan, Mexico]]).  Other hills have been named by Osmanagić as the pyramids of 'Love', 'the Earth' and 'the Dragon'.&lt;ref name="BBC2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4912040.stm|title=Dig for ancient pyramid in Bosnia|date=15 April 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt;

Local authorities have funded his excavations, and authorized visits to the 'pyramids' by school children, with guides telling them the hills are part of their Bosnian heritage.&lt;ref name="balkanologie"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://balkanologie.revues.org/2298 |author=Irna |title=Les « pyramides » de Bosnie-Herzégovine: une affaire de pseudo-archéologie dans le contexte bosnien |trans-title=The 'pyramids' of Bosnia and Herzegovina: a case of pseudo-archeology in the Bosnian context |journal=Balkanologie |volume=13 |issue=1-2 |date=15 December 2011 |quote=Que les 'pyramides' de Bosnie, après six années de fouilles sans aucun résultat scientifique, continuent d'être visitées et financées par les autorités, et montrées aux enfants des écoles de Bosnie comme un élément de leur patrimoine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site has become a tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/10/04/bosnian-pyramids-shunned-by-archaeologists-still-draw-tourists|title=Bosnian 'pyramids', shunned by archaeologists, still draw tourists|date=4 October 2017|publisher=Euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osmanagić's methodology and alleged evidence===
According to Osmanagić, the dig in 2006 involved an international team of [[archaeologist]]s from Australia, Austria, Ireland, United Kingdom and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smh.com.au/news/World/Australian-in-Bosnia-pyramid-riddle/2006/01/20/1137553735882.html ''Australian in Bosnia pyramid riddle''], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 20 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; But, many archaeologists whom he named have stated they did not agree to participate and were never at the site.&lt;ref name="Bosnian Pyramids Update"&gt;Mark Rose, [http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/osmanagic/update.html "Bosnian 'Pyramids' Update"], ''Archaeology Magazine Online'', 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Osmanagić also claimed the support of an "Oxford archaeologist", who was found to be an unqualified undergraduate. His foundation's website claimed support of a British Member of Parliament; the name given was not that of any sitting member.&lt;ref&gt;John Bohannon, "Researchers Helpless as Bosnian Pyramid Bandwagon Gathers Pace", ''Science'', 22 December 2006, #314:1862&lt;/ref&gt;

Osmanagić claims that the direction of the hills reveals alignment to support ancient human cosmology. According to Enver Buza, a surveyor from Sarajevo’s Geodetic Institute, the "Pyramid of the Sun" is perfectly oriented to the north.&lt;ref name="Smiths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epoch2013"/&gt;  Osmanagić has said that the sides of the pyramid are oriented toward the cardinal points, and has claimed that this could not be produced by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Smiths"/&gt;

Osmanagić's claims have also centred on alleged evidence concerning satellite photography, thermal analysis and radar detection.  An article by Ian Traynor for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006 reported that Osmanagić and his team alleged that their results from such research showed that the hills were not natural formations and that tunnels may exist inside the hills.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/05/travelnews.travel|title=Tourists flock to Bosnian hills but experts mock amateur archaeologist's pyramid claims|author=Ian Traynor|date=5 October 2006|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Osmanagić, his excavations have produced evidence of blocks that he claims may be part of a man-made outer surface.&lt;ref name="BBC2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"/&gt; Osmanagić claims that these blocks are made of a [[concrete]] poured on-site that was stronger than today's versions.&lt;ref name="Smiths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"/&gt;

==Scholarly response==
Osmanagić's claims have been repeatedly condemned by qualified scientists and archaeologists.  Seven leading European archaeologists issued a [[European Association of Archaeologists]] ''Declaration'' stating: 
:We, the undersigned professional archaeologists from all parts of Europe, wish to protest strongly at the continuing support by the Bosnian authorities for the so-called "pyramid" project being conducted on hills at and near Visoko. This scheme is a cruel hoax on an unsuspecting public and has no place in the world of genuine science. It is a waste of scarce resources that would be much better used in protecting the genuine archaeological heritage and is diverting attention from the pressing problems that are affecting professional archaeologists in Bosnia-Herzegovina on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="e-a-a"/&gt;
 
The Declaration was signed by Hermann Parzinger, President of [[German Archaeological Institute]] in [[Berlin]]; Willem Willems, Inspector General of Rijksinspectie Archeologie in [[The Hague]];  Jean-Paul Demoule, President of the ''Institut nationale de recherches archéologiques préventives'' (INRAP) in [[Paris]]; [[Romuald Schild]], Director of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in Warsaw; Vassil Nikolov, Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] in Sofia; Anthony Harding, President of the [[European Association of Archaeologists]]; and Mike Heyworth, Director of the [[Council for British Archaeology]] in York.&lt;ref name="e-a-a"/&gt;

Osmanagić's assertions have been categorically refuted by a number of experts, who have accused him of promoting [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] notions and damaging valuable archaeological sites with his excavations. Amar Karapuš, a curator at the [[Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in Sarajevo, said, "When I first read about the pyramids I thought it was a very funny joke. I just couldn't believe that anyone in the world could believe this."&lt;ref name=Smiths/&gt; Garrett Fagan of [[Penn State University]] is quoted as saying, "They should not be allowed to destroy genuine sites in the pursuit of these delusions[...] It’s as if someone were given permission to bulldoze [[Stonehenge]] to find secret chambers of lost ancient wisdom underneath."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Hawton, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2601894.ece ''Indiana Jones of the Balkans and the mystery of a hidden pyramid''], ''[[Times Online]]'', 15 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Enver Imamović of the [[University of Sarajevo]], a former director of the National Museum of [[Sarajevo]], concerned that the excavations will damage historic sites such as the medieval [[Visoko during middle ages|royal capital Visoki]], said that the excavations would "irreversibly destroy a national treasure".&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Harris, [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=237 "Amateur to dig on site of medieval capital in search of Bosnia's own Valley of the Kings"], ''The Art Newspaper'', 15 April 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425035231/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=237 |date=April 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- DO NOT LINK to "Excavation (archaeology)" except here in the sentence "Excavations by archaeologists not related to the Foundation..." =&gt; --&gt;

[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] in the summer of 2008 by archaeologists who are not related to Osmanagić's Foundation uncovered medieval artifacts, which led to renewed calls for the government to cancel Osmanagić's digging permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/09/18/feature-02 | title=

A former employee, Nadija Nukić, told a Bosnian newspaper that carvings on stones that Osmanagić characterizes as dating from ancient times were not present when the stones were first uncovered. They were later inscribed by Osmanagić's team. Osmanagić has denied this statement.&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt;

===Responses by archaeologists===
[[Curtis Runnels]], an American expert on prehistoric Greece and the Balkans from [[Boston University]], states that the inhabitants of the area, to whom Osmanagić credits the building of the 'pyramids', were a primitive people who were small in number and who "did not have the tools or skills to engage in the construction of monumental architecture."&lt;ref name="archmag"&gt;Rose, Mark. "[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/osmanagic/index.html The Bosnia-Atlantis Connection]". ''Archaeology Magazine Online''. URL accessed 2006-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Runnels has said that cultures able to build large structures of that type emerged in the region only around 2,500 years ago, but did not construct such earthworks.&lt;ref name="Straits2015"/&gt;  He has also pointed out that a pyramidal shape is resistant to certain forces; it is a surviving, common form produced by natural causes.&lt;ref name="express.co.uk"/&gt;

After visiting Visočica hill,&lt;ref name="Ithaca2006"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |title=British archaeologist nixes Bosnia pyramid claims |date=10 June 2006 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/257547102 |newspaper=[[The Ithaca Journal]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |location=[[Ithaca, New York]] |volume=192 |issue=138 |page=2A |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; British professor Anthony Harding, president of the [[European Association of Archaeologists]], wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' (published 25 April 2006), referring to Osmanagić's theories as "wacky" and "absurd". He expressed concerns that the government of Bosnia had insufficient safeguards in place to protect the country's "rich heritage" from "looting and unmonitored or unauthorised development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/letters/article2072739.ece | title=

Brian Stewart, assistant curator at the [[List of museums and collections at the University of Michigan|Museum of Anthropological Archaeology]] at the [[University of Michigan]], said that "There were very worrying reports that he [Osmanagić] and his team have essentially sculpted the sides of these natural hills into something they think resembles pyramids, in the process stripping away sediment which contains layers of actual archaeology from mediaeval and earlier periods".&lt;ref name="Straits2015"/&gt;

In June 2006, archeologist [[Zahi Hawass]], former Egyptian Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, wrote a letter to ''Archaeology Magazine'' after his name became linked to the excavations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=bosnian-pyramid-created-by-nature-say-european-experts-2006-06-12 "Bosnian 'pyramid' created by nature, say European experts"], AFP, ''Hurriyet Daily News'', 12 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Osmanagić had allegedly said that Hawass had recommended Egyptian geologist Aly Abdullah Barakat to investigate the hills.  Hawass denied all involvement, accusing Osmanagić of spreading falsehoods; in his letter he noted that Barakat had no archaeological knowledge or standing. He further noted that Osmanagić was totally wrong to claim that the [[Maya civilization|Mayan civilization]] of Mesoamerica originated in [[Atlantis]] or the [[Pleiades|Pleiades constellation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/osmanagic/zahi_hawass.pdf Zahi Hawass, "Letter to Archaeology Magazine"] (pdf), ''Archeology'', June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ExcavationsVisocica2.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Visočica hill conglomerate layers]]
The Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun Foundation commissioned a geological team from the [[University of Tuzla]] to investigate Visočica.  On 8 May 2006, members held a press conference in Tuzla to present the results of their research. The academics, from the Faculty of Mining and Geology and led by Sejfudin Vrabac, concluded that the hill is a natural geological formation, made of [[clastic]] sediments of layered composition and varying thickness, and that its shape is a consequence of endodynamical and exodynamical processes in the post-[[Miocene]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/bih/politika/clanak/060508041 |title=Vrabac: Visočica je prirodna geološka tvorevina |date=2006-05-08 |language=Bosnian |publisher=FENA (News Agency)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vrabac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irna.lautre.net/IMG/pdf/Output.pdf |title=Izvještaj o geološkim istraživanjima Visočice kod Visokog |author=Sejfudin Vrabac |publisher=Mining, Geology and Civil Engineering Faculty of University of Tuzla |date=2006-04-17 |language=Bosnian|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'pyramid' is composed of the same matter as mountains in the area; layers of [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[clay]] and [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt;

According to Professor Vrabac, who specializes in [[paleogeology]], there are dozens of similar morphological formations in the Sarajevo-Zenica mining basin alone. The geological team report on Visočica, based on the data collected in six drill holes at 3- to 17-metre depths, is supported by the Research and Teaching Council of the Faculty of Mining and Geology, as well as by the Association of Geologists of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name=vrabac/&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2006, self-promoted Egyptian geologist Aly Abdullah Barakat, claiming to be an expert on pyramids, inspected some blocks at the hills and announced at first look that they were evidence of pyramids. (The very same blocks were inspected by British archaeologist [[Anthony Harding]] shortly afterwards, who concluded they did not constitute evidence of pyramids.&lt;ref name="Bosnian Pyramids Update"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aida Cerkez-Robinson [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901113_pf.html "British Expert Nixes Bosnia Pyramid Claim"], ''Washington Post'', 9 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) In a geological report dated 3 November 2007, Barakat denied that nature produces pyramidal shapes and suggested that the main formation seen today may have been a natural hill shaped into a pyramid by human efforts.  He described his own results as inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irna.lautre.net/At-last-Dr-Barakat-s-report.html "At last, Dr. Barakat’s report"], IRNA, 8 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 dig uncovered fractured [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and sandstone plates, which are naturally occurring.&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt;  Following a visit to the site, American geologist [[Robert Schoch]] concluded that these were common natural geological formations of little interest.&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt; He accused the workers of carving the hillside to make impressions of stepped sides on the so-called 'Pyramid of the Moon',&lt;ref name="Smiths" /&gt; and drew attention to testimony by workers at the site that the alleged ancient inscriptions at the site were freshly made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertschoch.com/bosniacontent.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220100600/http://www.robertschoch.com/bosniacontent.html# |date=2014-02-20 }}, ''The New Archaeology Review'' vol 1.8, pp 16-17, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Schoch's website documents the alleged damage being done by Osmanagić's digs, and accuses Osmanagić of "a deliberate smear campaign".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robertschoch.com/bosniacontent.html |title=The Bosnian Pyramid Phenomenon |last=Schoch |first=Robert M. |author-link=Robert M.

He said that the study of the 'Bosnian pyramids' was still in its infancy, and refrained from concluding that they were man-made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Swelim: Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun is the World’s Largest |author=FENA |url=http://www.piramidasunca.ba/en/index.php/DR.-SWELIM-BOSNIAN-PYRAMID-OF-THE-SUN-IS-THE-WORLDS-LARGEST.html |date=2 September 2007 |website=Archaeological Park: Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun Foundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029042204/http://www.piramidasunca.ba/en/index.php/DR.-SWELIM-BOSNIAN-PYRAMID-OF-THE-SUN-IS-THE-WORLDS-LARGEST.html |archive-date=29 October 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Swelim released a report on his website in which he clarified that, while he does not exclude the possibility the Bosnian hills are man-made, he makes no categorical judgment either way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swelim|first=Nabil Mohamed Abdel|title=VISOCICA ON THE BALANCE|url=http://www.nabilswelim.com/downloads/vic_10.pdf|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not publish this report in a peer-reviewed journal.

===Responses by sociologist===
Colin Woodard, writing for the ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' in December 2009, has suggested that the 'Bosnian pyramid' phenomenon may be a societal reaction to the widespread destruction and horrors of the [[Bosnian War]] which ended in 1995.  He notes that Bosnian leaders, including one prime minister and two presidents, and many Bosnian news outlets have welcomed the theory. It appears to flatter a large and receptive domestic audience with an idea that their homeland was once the seat of a great ancient civilization, and holds out a kind of promise of a bright economic future.  Conversely, Woodard notes, those in Bosnia who have attempted to expose the project as a nationalist hoax "have been shouted down and called anti-Bosnian".&lt;ref name="Smiths"/&gt;

Archaeologist Carl Fegan has similarly suggested that Osmanagić appeals to Bosnian nationalists at a time of continuing struggle with economic and social difficulties since the war. Thousands of people in the region were killed in the war, and "authorities estimate the Visoko region suffered about $200 million in damage with the destruction of infrastructure and factories."&lt;ref name="hoax"/&gt;

With a current population of 11,000,&lt;ref name="hoax"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/bosnia-visoko-pyramids-osmanagic-economy-hoax/28725843.html |title=Whether Real Or A Hoax, Bosnian 'Pyramids' Bringing Concrete Benefits To Town |date=9 September 2017 |last1=Crosby |first1=Alan |last2=Bilic |first2=Ivana  |website=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the town of Visoko has many shop owners who are glad to have tourist traffic to help generate revenue in the local and regional economy. Some Bosnians who have volunteered to dig or otherwise work at the site are glad to have something positive to work for.&lt;ref name="hoax"/&gt;

==Tourism==
Osmanagić claimed to have attracted 200,000 tourists in the first year of his operations at the site.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"/&gt; In 2006 he was seeking funding from investors in Malaysia to construct an archeological park. He also intended to establish parks around other landmarks which he claims as ancient monuments and scientists say are natural features.&lt;ref name="The great Bosnian pyramid scheme"/&gt; Attendance has declined somewhat at the Bosnian hills since the early years, but souvenir sellers say they still depend on the steady business.&lt;ref name="reuters2016"/&gt; 

The impresario has added events to enhance the spiritual atmosphere at the site; for instance, meditation sessions are held in the so-called Ravne tunnels, which he claims to have discovered. In August 2016, Osmanagić claimed that 5,000 people had visited the archeological park since it opened in June of that year.&lt;ref name="reuters2016"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">'''CELPA (Mar Chiquita)''' also known as '''CELPA Atlántico''''' (Centro de Experimentación y Lanzamiento de Proyectiles Autopropulsados)'' was a rocket launch site in [[Mar Chiquita]], [[Argentina]], north of [[Mar del Plata]]. The launch site was in service from 1968 to 1976&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/sites/marquita.htm  Mar Chiquita launch site]&lt;/ref&gt; and was mainly used for launching rockets of the types [[Orión (rocket)|Orión-2]], [[Arcas (rocket)|Arcas]], [[Rocketsonde]] and [[Dragon (rocket)|Dragon I]]. The tests from CELPA Atlántico were sponsored by the [[United Nations]] since 1969. There was a total number of 69 tests.

'''The Center for the Development of Recycling''' (CDR), also known as the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline, is a university-based, non-profit, environmental research and service organization. The CDR is located in the Department of [[Environmental Studies]] office at [[San Jose State University]] (SJSU).&lt;ref name="sjsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/EnvStudies/beyond-class/index.htm |title=San Jose State University Environmental Studies Department |publisher=Sjsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty-managed students work on recycling-related projects for the community.&lt;ref name="sjsufoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsufoundation.org/html/sjsuf-news-info/case-studies.htm |title=SJSU Research Foundation - Case Studies |publisher=Sjsufoundation.org |date=2011-12-18 |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508055347/http://www.sjsufoundation.org/html/sjsuf-news-info/case-studies.htm |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization not only provides the community with a recycling service, but also provides a service-learning opportunity to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svtc.org/about-us/staff/ |title=Staff and Board – Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition |publisher=Svtc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
CDR operates with a part-time Director, two compensated part-time students who serve as Administrative Manager and Project Manager, and a staff of student interns who earn academic credit for community service learning. The CDR Director is a Department of Environmental Studies faculty member who is responsible for all activities including management of staff, projects, equipment, budget, and adherence to University regulations. The San Jose State University Foundation manages accounting and payroll services.&lt;ref name="recyclestuff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recyclestuff.org/about.php |title=Center for the Development of Recycling |publisher=Recyclestuff.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831200037/http://www.recyclestuff.org/about.php |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website==
The CDR’s website assists users to find locations for recycling, reuse, and the donation of goods. It contains specific services available from over 1200 companies and local government for over 2000 product and material types.  Links and documents are provided to assist users with access to multiple information sources that address nearly any question about recycling and waste management.  The site features specific information about recycling and reuse services provided by private business, local government, landfills, and extensive information resources in this expanding field.

==History==
The CDR was founded in 1989 by Bruce Olszewski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/EnvStudies/about/faculty/olszewski.htm |title=Bruce Olszewski Bio |publisher=Sjsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, CDR bridged personnel and equipment resources of SJSU with [[Santa Clara County]] and its 15 cities that resulted in an alliance to provide cost-effective recycling information services for County residents and businesses that also created student service-learning opportunities. In 1992, the CDR began operating the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline. CDR added a donor funded website in 1999.&lt;ref name="recyclestuff" /&gt; In 2017, CDR expanded its organization to include the County of San Mateo.

==Recycling Hotline==
Since 1992,&lt;ref name="recyclestuff" /&gt; the CDR has operated the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline under contract with the County of Santa Clara.&lt;ref name="sjsu" /&gt; The hotline was created to assist residents with finding a reuse or recycling center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/esd/pollution-prevention/e-waste.asp |title=Pollution Prevention for Residents: E-waste |publisher=Sanjoseca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609104312/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/ESD/pollution-prevention/e-waste.asp |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for any recyclable item they may have.&lt;ref name="sccgov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccgov.org/portal/site/iwm/agencychp?path=%2Fv7%2FIntegrated%20Waste%20Management%20%28DIV%29%2FRecycling%20Hotline |title=The County of Santa Clara - Office of Integrated Waste Management |publisher=Sccgov.org |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student-operated hotline serves the 16 jurisdictions of Santa Clara County&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creec.edgateway.net/cs/creecp/view/creec_org/590 |title=CREEC - Center for Development of Recycling, San Jose State University |publisher=Creec.edgateway.net |date=2003-05-14 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:

A '''county''' is a [[geographical region]] of a [[country]] used for administrative or other purposes,&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;[[Chambers Dictionary]], L. Brookes (ed.), 2005, Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the [[Old French]] ''conté'' or ''cunté'' denoting a [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] under the sovereignty of a [[count]] ([[earl]]) or a [[viscount]].&lt;ref name=etymology&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, C. W. Onions (Ed.), 1966, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern French is ''comté'', and its equivalents in other languages  are ''contea'', ''contado'', ''comtat'', ''condado'', ''Grafschaft'', ''graafschap'', ''Gau'', etc. (cf. ''[[Nobility of Italy|conte]]'', ''comte'', ''conde'', ''[[Graf]]'').

When the [[Normans]] conquered [[England]], they brought the term with them. The [[Saxons]] had already established the districts that became the [[historic counties of England]], calling them [[shire]]s;&lt;ref name=vision&gt;Vision of Britain [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/type_page.jsp?unit_type=ANC_CNTY] — Type details for ancient county. Retrieved 31 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; many county names derive from the name of the county town ([[county seat]]) with the word "shire" added on: for example, [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Worcestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=county&amp;searchmode=none Etymology of the word ''county''.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Anglo-Saxon people|Anglo-Saxon]] terms "earl" and "earldom" were taken as equivalent to the [[Continental Europe|continental]] terms "count" and "county" under the conquering Normans, and over time the two blended and became equivalent. Further, the later-imported term became a synonym for the native [[Old English|English]] word ''scir'' ({{IPA|[ʃiːr]}}) or, in [[Modern English]], ''shire''. Since a shire was an administrative division of the [[Realm|kingdom]], the term "county" evolved to designate an administrative division of a [[federalism|federal state]], as in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], or of a [[Central government|national government]] in most other modern uses.
 
In the United States and [[Canada]], founded 600 years later{{efn

  }} on the British traditions, counties are usually an administrative division set by convenient geographical demarcations, which in governance have certain officeholders (''e.g.'', [[sheriff]]s and their [[sheriff's department|department]]s) as a part of the [[state (United States)|state]] and [[province (Canada)|provincial]] mechanisms, including geographically common [[court system]]s.&lt;ref name="citsguide2"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A county may be further subdivided into districts, [[hundred (county division)|hundred]]s, [[civil township|townships]] or other administrative jurisdictions within the county. A county usually, but not always, contains [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, [[civil township|townships]], [[village]]s, or other [[municipal corporation]]s, which in most cases are somewhat subordinate or dependent upon county governments. Depending on the nation, [[municipality]], and local geography, municipalities may or may not be subject to direct or indirect county control&amp;mdash;the functions of both levels are often consolidated into a city government when the area is densely populated.{{efn
 |The larger the population center, and the denser the population, the more likely it is to have assumed and subsumed county level functions; normally under a special bill passed by the cognizant legislative body.
  }}

Outside [[English-speaking countries]], an equivalent of the term "county" is often used to describe subnational jurisdictions that are structurally equivalent to counties in the relationship they have with their national government;{{efn
 |National governments that are Federations, such as Germany have subdivisions similar to the English Counties in size. France has provinces and districts which similarly provide governmental services.

  }} but which may not be administratively equivalent to counties in predominantly English-speaking countries.

==Argentina==
Provinces in Argentina are divided into [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] (departamentos), except in the [[Buenos Aires Province]], where they are called ''[[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partidos]]''. The [[Buenos Aires|Autonomous City of Buenos Aires]] is divided into communes (''comunas'').

==Australia==
In the [[eastern states of Australia]], counties are [[lands administrative divisions of Australia|used in the administration of land titles]]. They do not generally correspond to a level of government, but are used in the identification of parcels of land.

==Canada==
Canada's five oldest provinces – [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] – are divided into counties. In those older provinces that have a two-tier system of municipal government, the counties constitute the upper tier and local municipalities form the lower tier.  In addition to counties, Ontario is also subdivided into territorial districts, district municipalities, metropolitan municipalities, and regional municipalities which are also part of the upper tier. [[British Columbia]] is divided into regional districts that form the upper tier. They are subdivided into local municipalities that are partly autonomous, and unincorporated electoral areas that are governed directly by the regional districts. The rest of Canada has only one level of municipal government.  [[Manitoba]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Yukon]] use their municipalities as regional and local subdivisions without any real differentiation between the two. In [[Alberta]], a "county" used to be a type of designation in a single-tier municipal system; but this was changed to "[[List of municipal districts in Alberta|municipal district]]" under the ''Municipal Government Act'', when the ''County Act'' was repealed in the mid-1990s, at which time they were also permitted to retain the usage of ''county'' in their official names.&lt;ref name=MGAtransition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.municipalaffairs.alberta.ca/cfml/pdf_search/pdf/TOWN/0361/Crowsnest_Pass_Transitional_from_Former_to_this_Act_1994.pdf |author=Province of Alberta |title=Transitional Provisions, Consequential Amendments, Repeal and Commencement (Municipal Government Act) |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Republic of China==
{{Main|Counties of the People's Republic of China}}
The word "county" is used to translate the Chinese term ''xiàn'' ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|县}}}} or {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|縣}}}}). In [[Mainland China]], governed by the People's Republic of China (PRC), counties are the [[County-level division|third level]] of local government, coming under both the [[Administrative divisions of China#Provincial level|province level]] and the [[Administrative divisions of China#County level|prefecture level]].

There are 1,464 counties in the PRC out of 2,862 county-level divisions. The number of counties has remained more or less constant since the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC&amp;ndash;AD 220). The county remains one of the oldest levels of government in China and significantly predates the establishment of provinces in the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279&amp;ndash;1368). The county government was particularly important in imperial China because this was the lowest layer at which the imperial government functioned. The head of a county during imperial times was the [[magistrate]].

In older context, "district" was an older English translation of ''xiàn'' before the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (ROC). The English nomenclature "county" was adopted following the establishment of the ROC.

During most of the imperial times, there were no concepts like municipalities in China. All cities existed within counties, [[Jun (country subdivision)|commanderies]], prefectures, etc., and had no governments of their own.&lt;ref&gt;There were exceptions in the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jīn]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties, when cities were separated from counties and independently administered by institutions like {{lang|zh-hant|録事司}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|lù shi sī}}) and {{lang|zh|司候司}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|sī hòu sī}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Large cities (must be imperial capitals or seats of prefectures) could be divided and administered by two or three counties. Such counties are called 倚郭縣 yǐguō xiàn ("county leaning on the city walls"), or {{lang|zh-hant|附郭縣}} {{lang|zh-Latn|fùguō xiàn}} ("county attached to the city walls"). The [[yamen]] or governmental houses of these counties exist in the same city. In other words, they share one county town. In this sense, a yǐguō xiàn or fùguō xiàn is similar to a district of a city.

For example, the city of [[Guangzhou]] (seat of the eponymous prefecture, also known as Canton in the Western world) was historically divided by [[Nanhai District#History|Nanhai County]] ({{lang|zh-hant|南海縣}}) and [[Panyu District#History|Panyu County]] ({{lang|zh-hant|番禺縣}}). When the first modern city government in China was established in Guangzhou, the urban area was separated from these two counties, with the rural areas left in the remaining parts of them. However, the county governments remained in the city for years, before moving into the respective counties. Similar processes happened in many Chinese cities.

Nowadays, most counties in mainland China are administered by [[prefecture-level cities]]. However, they are all rural areas, and no longer serve as urban districts.

==Denmark==
{{Main|Counties of Denmark}}
[[Denmark]] was divided into counties (''amter'') from 1662 to 2006. On 1 January 2007 the counties were replaced by five [[regions of Denmark|Regions]]. At the same time, the number of municipalities was slashed to 98.

The counties were first introduced in 1662, replacing the 49 fiefs (''len'') in [[Denmark–Norway]] with the same number of counties. This number does not include the subdivisions of the [[Duchy of Schleswig]], which was only under partial Danish control. The number of counties in Denmark (excluding Norway) had dropped to c. 20 by 1793. Following the reunification of [[South Jutland County|South Jutland]] with Denmark in 1920, four counties replaced the [[Prussia]]n ''[[Districts of Prussia|Kreise]]''. [[Aabenraa County|Aabenraa]] and [[Sønderborg County]] merged in 1932 and [[Skanderborg County|Skanderborg]] and [[Aarhus County|Aarhus]] were separated in 1942. From 1942 to 1970, the number stayed at 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.byhistorie.dk/kommuner/artikel.aspx?artikel=amter.xml |title=Amternes administration 1660-1970 (in Danish) |publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number was further decreased by the 1970 Danish municipal reform, leaving 14 counties plus two cities unconnected to the county structure; [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]].

In 2003, [[Bornholm County]] merged with the local five municipalities, forming the [[Bornholm|Bornholm Regional Municipality]]. The remaining 13 counties were abolished on 1 January 2007 where they were replaced by five new regions. In the same reform, the number of municipalities was slashed from 270 to 98 and all municipalities now belong to a region.

==France==
A comté was a territory ruled by a [[count]] (comte) in medieval France.  In modern France, the rough equivalent of a "county" as used in many English-speaking countries is a [[Departments of France|department]].

==Germany==
For the situation in Germany compare ''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]''.
Each administrative district consists of an elected council and an executive, and whose duties are comparable to those of a county executive in the United States, supervising local government administration.
Historically, counties in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were called ''[[Grafschaft]]en''.

==Hungary==
{{Main|Counties of Hungary|Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary}}
The administrative unit of [[Hungary]] is called ''[[megye]]'' (historically, they were also called [[vármegye]], or [[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|comitatus]] in [[Latin]]), which can be translated with the word ''county''. The 19 counties constitute the highest level of the administrative subdivisions of the country together with the capital city Budapest, although counties and the capital are grouped into seven statistical regions.

Counties are subdivided to municipalities, the two types of which are towns and villages, each one having their own elected mayor and council. 23 of the towns have the rights of a county although they do not form independent territorial units equal to counties. Municipalities are grouped within counties into subregions (''kistérség'' in Hungarian), which have statistical and organizational functions only.

The ''vármegye'' was also the historic administrative unit in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which included areas of present-day neighbouring countries of Hungary. Its Latin name (''comitatus'') is the equivalent of the French ''comté''. Actual political and administrative role of counties changed much through history. Originally they were subdivisions of the royal administration, but from the 13th century A.D. they became self-governments of the nobles and kept this character until the 19th century when in turn they became modern local governments.

==Iran==
{{Main|Counties of Iran}}
[[File:Iran Counties.svg|thumb|Counties of Iran]]
The [[Provinces of Iran|ostans (provinces)]] of [[Iran]] are further subdivided into counties called '''shahrestan''' ({{lang-fa|شهرستان}}, shahrestān). County consists of a city centre, a few [[bakhsh]] ({{lang-fa|بخش}}, bakhsh), and many villages around them. There are usually a few cities ({{lang-fa|شهر}}, shahar) and rural agglomerations ({{lang-fa|دهستان}}, dehestān) in each county. Rural agglomerations are a collection of a number of villages. One of the cities of the county is appointed as the capital of the county.

Each shahrestan has a government office known as Farmandari, which coordinates different events and government offices. The Farmandar, or the head of Farmandari, is the governor of the Shahrestan.

[[Fars Province]] has the highest number of Shahrestans, with 23, while [[Semnān Province|Semnān]] and [[South Khorasan Province|South Khorasan]] have only 4 Shahrestans each; [[Qom Province|Qom]] uniquely has one, being [[wiktionary:coextensive|coextensive]] with its [[Qom County|namesake county]]. Iran had 324 Shahrestans in 2005.

==Ireland==
{{Main|Counties of Ireland|Counties of the United Kingdom}}
The island of [[Ireland]] was historically divided into 32 counties, of which 26 later formed the [[Republic of Ireland]] and 6 made up [[Northern Ireland]].

These counties are traditionally grouped into [[Provinces of Ireland|4 provinces]]: [[Leinster]] (12), [[Munster]] (6) [[Connacht]] (5) and [[Ulster]] (9). Historically, the counties of [[County Meath|Meath]], [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]] and small parts of surrounding counties constituted the province of [[Mide]], which was one of the "Five Fifths" of Ireland (in the Irish language the word for province, ''Cúige'', from ''Cúig'', five means "''a fifth''"); however, these have long since become the three northernmost counties of Leinster province. In the Republic each county is administered by an elected "[[county council]]", and the old provincial divisions are merely traditional names with no political significance.

The number and boundaries of administrative counties in the Republic of Ireland were reformed in the 1990s. For example, [[County Dublin]] was divided into three: [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]], and [[South Dublin]]; the [[City of Dublin]] had existed for centuries before. The cities of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Galway]] have been separated from the town and rural areas of their counties. The cities of [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] were merged with their respective counties in 2014. Thus, the Republic of Ireland now has thirty-one 'county-level' authorities, although the borders of the original twenty-six counties are still officially in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osi.ie/mapping/FAQ/areasMeasurements.shtml OSI.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Ireland, the six county councils and the smaller town councils were abolished in 1973 and replaced by a single tier of local government. However, in the north as well as in the south, the traditional 32 counties and 4 provinces remain in common usage for many sporting, cultural and other purposes. County identity is heavily reinforced in the local culture by allegiances to county teams in [[Hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]]. Each [[Gaelic Athletic Association county]] has its own flag/colours (and often a nickname too), and county allegiances are taken quite seriously. See the [[counties of Ireland]] and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].

==Italy==
In [[Italy]] the word county is not used; the administrative sub-division of a region is called [[Provinces of Italy|provincia]].  [[Italy|Italian]] provinces are mainly named after their principal town and comprise several administrative subdivisions called ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (communes). There are currently 110 provinces in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reidsitaly.com/destinations/regions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of pre-modern Italy, the Italian word ''contado'' generally refers to the countryside surrounding, and controlled by, the city state. The ''contado'' provided natural resources and agricultural products to sustain the urban population. In contemporary usage, ''contado'' can refer to a metropolitan area, and in some cases large rural/suburban regions providing resources to distant cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guilds, Markets and Work Regulations in Italy, 16th–19th Centuries|last=Guenzi|first=Alberto|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781351931960|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jamaica==
[[Jamaica]] is divided into fourteen [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]] which are grouped together into three historic [[Counties of Jamaica|counties]]: [[Cornwall County, Jamaica|Cornwall]], [[Middlesex County, Jamaica|Middlesex]], and [[Surrey County, Jamaica|Surrey]].

==Kenya==
{{main|Counties of Kenya}}
Counties are the current second level political division in Kenya. Each county has an assembly where members of the county assembly (MCAs) sit. This assembly is headed by a Governor. Each county is also represented in the [[Senate of Kenya]] by a senator. Additionally, a Women's Representative is elected from each county to the [[Parliament of Kenya]] to represent women's interests. Counties replaced [[Provinces of Kenya|provinces]] as the second level division after the promulgation of the 2010 [[Constitution of Kenya]].

==Korea==
{{main|Administrative divisions of North Korea|Administrative divisions of South Korea}}
County is the common English translation for the [[Korean character|character]] 군 (''gun'' or ''kun'') that denotes the current second level political division in South Korea and one type of municipal-level division in North Korea.

==Liberia==
{{Main|Counties of Liberia}}
[[Liberia]] has 15 counties, each of which elects two senators to the Liberian Senate.

==Lithuania==
''Apskritis'' (pl. ''apskritys'') is the Lithuanian word for county. Since 1994 [[Lithuania]] has 10 counties; before 1950 it had 20. The only purpose with the county is an office of a state governor who shall conduct law and order in the county. See [[counties of Lithuania]].

==New Zealand==
{{Main|Counties in New Zealand}}
After New Zealand abolished its [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] in 1876, a system of counties similar to other countries' systems was instituted, lasting until 1989. They had chairmen, not mayors as [[borough]]s and cities had; many legislative provisions (such as [[burial]] and [[Subdivision (land)|land subdivision]] control) were different for the counties.

During the second half of the 20th century, many counties received overflow population from nearby cities. The result was often a merger of the two into a "district" (e.g. [[Rotorua]]) or a change of name to "district" (e.g. Waimairi) or "city" (e.g. [[Manukau City]]).

The [[Local Government Act 1974 (New Zealand)|Local Government Act 1974]] began the process of bringing urban, mixed, and rural councils into the same legislative framework. Substantial reorganisations under that Act resulted in the 1989 shake-up, which covered the country in (non-overlapping) cities and districts and abolished all the counties except for the [[Chatham Islands]] County, which survived under that name for a further 6 years but then became a "Territory" under the "Chatham Islands Council".

==Norway==
{{Main|Counties of Norway}}
Norway is divided into 18 [[Counties of Norway|counties]] (sing. ''fylke'', plur. ''fylke/fylker'') since 1972. Up to that year [[Bergen]] was a separate county, but is today a [[municipality]] in the county of [[Hordaland]]. All counties form administrative entities called county municipalities (sing. ''fylkeskommune'', plur. ''fylkeskommunar/fylkeskommuner''), further subdivided into [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipalities]], (sing. ''kommune'', plur. ''kommunar/kommuner''). One county, [[Oslo]], is not divided into municipalities, rather it is equivalent to the municipality of Oslo.

Each county has its own [[county council (Norway)|county council]] (''fylkesting'') whose representatives are elected every four years together with representatives to the [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal councils]]. The counties handle matters as high schools and local roads, and until 1 January 2002 hospitals as well. This responsibility was transferred to the state-run [[Regional health authority (Norway)|health authorities]] and [[health trust]]s, and there is a debate on the future of the county municipality as an administrative entity. Some people, and parties, such as the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative]] and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], call for the abolishment of the county municipalities once and for all, while others, including the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]], merely want to merge some of them into larger regions.

==Poland==
{{See also|List of counties in Poland}}
A second-level administrative division in [[Poland]] is called a ''[[powiat]]''. (This is a subdivision of a [[Voivodeship (Poland)|voivodeship]], or province, and is further subdivided into [[gmina]]s.) The term is often translated into English as ''county'' (or sometimes ''district'').

==Romania==
{{See also|Counties of Romania|}}

Romania is divided into [[Counties of Romania|41 jurisdictions]]. A jurisdiction is called a ''[[județ]]''.

The Romanian word for county, '''''comitat''''', is not currently used for any Romanian administrative divisions.

==Sweden==
The Swedish division into [[Counties of Sweden|counties]] was established in 1634, and was based on an earlier division into [[Provinces of Sweden|Provinces]]. [[Sweden]] is today divided into 21 counties. At the county level there is a [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|county administrative board]] led by a governor appointed by the central [[government of Sweden]], as well as an elected [[County councils of Sweden|county council]] that handles a separate set of issues, notably [[hospital]]s and [[public transportation]] for the [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] within its borders.

The Swedish term used is ''[[län]]'', which literally means "[[fief]]".

==Taiwan (Republic of China)==
{{See also|County (Republic of China)|}}
County is the common English translation for the [[Chinese character|character]] 縣 that denotes the current first level political division in Taiwan and surrounding islands. However, [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial cities]] have the same level of authority as counties. Above county, there are [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]] (in effect) and province (suspended due to economical and political reasons).

There are currently 14 counties in Taiwan.

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Counties of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:English ceremonial counties 1998.svg|thumb|Ceremonial counties of England]]
The United Kingdom is divided into a number of [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties]]. There are also [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] which group small non-metropolitan counties into geographical areas broadly based on the [[historic counties of England]]. In 1974, the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties replaced the system of [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] and [[county borough]]s which was introduced in 1889.

Most non-metropolitan counties in England are run by [[county council]]s and are divided into [[non-metropolitan district]]s, each with its own council. Local authorities in the UK are usually responsible for education, emergency services, planning, transport, social services, and a number of other functions.

In England, in the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period, ''shires'' were established as areas used for the raising of [[tax]]es, and usually had a fortified town at their centre. This became known as the ''shire town'' or later the [[county town]]. In many cases, the shires were named after their shire town (for example Bedford''shire''), but there are several exceptions, such as [[Cumberland]], [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]]. In several other cases, such as [[Buckinghamshire]], the modern county town is different from the town for which the shire is named. (See [[Toponymical list of counties of the United Kingdom]])

The name "county" was introduced by the [[Normans]], and was derived from a Norman term for an area administered by a [[Count]] (lord). These Norman "counties" were simply the Saxon shires, and kept their Saxon names. Several traditional counties, including [[Essex]], [[Sussex]] and [[Kent]], predate the unification of England by [[Alfred the Great]], and were originally more or less independent kingdoms.

In [[Northern Ireland]], the six county councils, if not their counties, were abolished in 1973 and replaced by 26 local government districts. The traditional six counties remain in common everyday use for many cultural and other purposes.

The thirteen [[historic counties of Wales]] were fixed by statute in 1539 (although counties such as [[Pembrokeshire]] date from 1138) and most of the [[shires of Scotland]] are of at least this age. In the Gaelic form, Scottish traditional county names are generally distinguished by the designation ''siorramachd''—literally "sherrifdom",  e.g. ''Siorramachd Earra-ghaidheal'' (Argyllshire). This term corresponds to the jurisdiction of the sheriff in the Scottish legal system.

Until 1974, the county boundaries of England changed little over time. In the [[mediæval]] period, a number of important cities were granted the status of counties in their own right, such as [[London]], [[Bristol]] and [[Coventry]], and numerous small [[exclave]]s such as [[Islandshire]] were created. In 1844, most of these exclaves were transferred to their surrounding counties.

In 1965 and 1974–1975, major reorganisations of local government in England and Wales created several new administrative counties such as [[Hereford and Worcester]] and also created several new [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] based on large urban areas as a single administrative unit. In Scotland, county-level local government was replaced by larger [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|regions]], which lasted until 1996. Modern local government in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and a large part of England is trending towards smaller unitary authorities: a system similar to that proposed in the 1960s by the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] for most of Britain.

Counties in U.S. states are administrative divisions of the state in which their boundaries are drawn; for example the territoriality ''medium sized'' state of Pennsylvania has 67 counties delineated in geographically convenient ways.&lt;ref name="citsguide"&gt;{{cite journal

Today, 3,142 counties and county equivalents carve up the United States, ranging in quantity from 3 for [[Delaware]] to 254 for [[Texas]].
 
Where they exist, they are the intermediate tier of state government, between the statewide tier and the immediately local government tier (typically a city, town/borough or village/township). Counties have functional purposes in 48 of the 50 states&amp;mdash;usually judiciary, county prisons and land registration&amp;mdash;sometimes enforcement of building codes, federally mandated services programs, and the like; the other two states ([[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]]) have abolished their counties as functional entities. Of these remaining 48 states, 46 use the term "county" while Alaska and Louisiana use the terms "borough" and "parish", respectively, for analogous jurisdictions.

Depending on the individual state, counties or their equivalents may be administratively subdivided into [[civil township|townships]], [[borough|boroughs or boros]], or [[town]]s (in the [[New England]] states, [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Administrative divisions of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]). 
 
Except in New England, where [[New England town|strong government at the town level]] has historically existed since the area was settled, the township is generally subordinate to the county, which is generally subordinate to the state.  In [[Virginia]], however, all cities are [[Independent city|independent]] and report directly to the commonwealth government; but notwithstanding they are not part of the county, they might operate as a county seat (e.g. the Independent City of Fairfax is the seat of Fairfax County, though it is not legally within Fairfax County). [[California]] has abolished its townships, though many general law cities continue to use the word "Town" as part of their name (e.g. "Town of Atherton" when it is, legally, the City of Atherton). {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

[[Alaska]] is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]'', which typically provide fewer local services than do most U.S. counties, as the state government furnishes many services directly. Some of Alaska's boroughs have merged geographical boundaries and administrative functions with their principal (and sometimes only) cities; these are known as ''unified city-boroughs'' and result in some of Alaska's cities ranking among the geographically largest "cities" in the world. Other states have similar mechanisms to combine government services and functions in a nearly converse situation&amp;mdash;establishing equivalents of [[consolidated city-county]] governments&lt;ref name="citsguide"/&gt;&amp;mdash;a few examples of such combinations existing as exceptions within the state: the five boroughs of New York, Philadelphia,&lt;ref name="citsguide"/&gt; Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and in general, most very large U.S. cities; each level of governance may have been restructured to local needs and realities. Nevertheless, Alaska considers such entities to be boroughs, not cities; while many states consider city government to supersede (or absorb) the powers normally the province of counties. Alaska is also unique in that more than half the geographic area of the state is in the "[[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]]", a legal entity in which the state also functions as the local government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In [[New York (state)|New York]] 5 of the 62 are administrative divisions of the [[New York City|City of New York]]. These five are each called "[[Boroughs of New York City|boroughs]]" in context of city government, but are still called "county" where state function is involved, e.g., "''New York County'' Courthouse".

Most counties have a [[county seat]], a city, town, or other named place where its administrative functions are centered.  Some counties have no incorporated municipalities, such as [[Arlington County, Virginia]].  In several instances throughout the nation, a municipality has merged with a county into one jurisdiction so the county seat is coextensive with the county, forming a [[consolidated city-county]], such as Lexington-Fayette County in Kentucky.  Some [[New England]] states use the term [[shire town]] to mean "county seat".

'''Doti''' (Devnagari; डोटी), also known as '''Doti region''', '''Dotigarh''' (डोटीगढ़) as used in the Jagar (folk tales; जागर), and the '''Farwestern region''' of [[Nepal]], is a region situated between [[Kali River (Uttarakhand)|River Kali]] boarding to the [[Uttarakhand]] in the west and [[Ghaghara River|Karnali]] river on the east.&lt;ref&gt;Prof.Dr. Jay Raj pant wrote "Far-Western region of Nepal is called Doti Culturally "  : In History of Doti Kingdom (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Doti was one of eight different princely states Katyuri Kingdom was divided into Eight for their eight Prince and became different independent Kingdom.

==Districts==
Doti division covers the nine districts of Seti and [[Mahakali Zone]], four in Mahakali and five in [[Seti Zone]] respectively. They are:
*[[Darchula District]]
*[[Baitadi District]]
*[[Dadeldhura District]]
*[[Kanchanpur District]]
*[[Doti District]]
*[[Kailali District]]
*[[Bajhang District]]
*[[Bajura District]]
*[[Achham District]]

Kailali and Kanchanpur District are [[Terai]] districts.

==Etymology==
The name Doti is believed to have originated from the word ''Dovati'', which means the land area between the confluence of two rivers.

Other view is that the original name of Doti was ''devatavi''= ''dev''+''aatavi'' or ''aalaya'' (''dev'' meaning Hindu God and ''aatavi'' meaning the place of re-creation or the place of attaining a meditation in Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;R.D Prabhas Chataut (2001) ; Dotyali Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Doti was an [[ancient]] kingdom in far western region of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] which was formed after the disintegration of the [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuri]]  [[Monarchy|Kingdom]] of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] around  the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dr.Y.S Kathoch, A New History of Uttarakhand; On Katyuri Dynasty "Around,13th Century Katyuri Dynasty established in Ranachulihat was broken into many sections" Doti  was among them&lt;/ref&gt;

Doti was one of eight different [[princely states]] Katyuri Kingdom was divided into Eight for their eight Prince and became different independent Kingdom.
*[[Baijnath, Uttarakhand|Baijnath]]-Katyuri
*[[Dwarahat]]
*Doti
*Baramandal
*[[Askot]]
*[[Didihat|Sira]]
*Sora
*Sui (Kali kumaon)

Later on, the whole land between [[Ramganga]] on the west ([[Uttarakhand]]) and the [[Ghaghara River|Karnali]] on the east (which divides the far western region from other parts Nepal), came under the Raikas after the origin of Raikas of [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuris]] in Doti.&lt;ref&gt;Advin T. Atkinson; Gazetteer Hindi Edition (2003); He wrote (Page 274) Whole territory to the east of Ram gang was belongs to Raikas during the late 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Brahma Dev Mandi" at [[Kanchanpur District]] of [[Mahakali Zone]] was established by Katyuri king Brahma Dev.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Madam Chandra Bhatt; A New History of  Uttarakhand (2006): " Champawat ke Chand Raja.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Raikas of Doti===
Niranjan Malla Dev was the founder of Doti [[Monarchy|Kingdom]] around the 13th century after the fall of the [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuri]] Kingdom. He was the son of Last Katyuris of united [[Katyuri Kings|Katyuris]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Y.S
Kathoch; A New History of Uttarakhand(2006).Founder of Doti was Niranjan Mall Dev..&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings of Doti were called Raikas (also  Rainka Maharaj).&lt;ref&gt;[[Badri Datt Pandey]] ; History of Kumaun (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Raikas, after defeating the  [[Khas]] Malla of Karnali Zone, were able to establish a strong Raikas Kingdom in Far Western Region and [[Kumaon division|Kumaun]] which was Doti. So far, the historical evidences&lt;ref&gt;..Sources  of  these historical evidence are taken  from the books mentioned in the references.&lt;/ref&gt; of following Raikas have been discovered:

===Conflict With Gorkhalis===
The historic place of war between the Doti Kingdom and Nepal ([[Gorkha Kingdom]]) during the period of Gorkha Expansion in 1790, according to the [[history of Nepal]], is ''Nari-Dang'' which lies on the bank of the [[Seti River]] and Dumrakot was the base of the Doti Kingdom during the fighting against the Gorkhalis.
In the war with the Gorkhalis, the Doti kingdom was defeated and Doteli King fled to [[Pilibhit]].&lt;ref name=HistoryofNepal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indus-intl.com/bookdetails.cfm?bookid=IN-02404|title=History of Nepal|accessdate=2008-01-31|publisher=T.R.Vaidya Publications|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209191916/http://www.indus-intl.com/bookdetails.cfm?bookid=IN-02404|archivedate=2005-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mogul invasion on Far-Western Nepal===
During the period of [[Akbar]]'s rule in the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire|Moguls]] had attacked the Raikas of Doti. They invaded Ajemeru, capital of the Raika Kingdom. Ajemeru is now in [[Dadeldhura District]] of far western region of [[Nepal]]. Hussain Khan, army chief of Akbar residing in [[Lucknow]] had led the attack. According to [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni]] (c. 1540 - 1615), Indo-Persian historian during [[Mughal Empire]], Mughal Army chief of Lukhnow, Hussian Khan, lured by the wealth and treasures of the kingdom of the Raikas, wanted to plunder the state, this being the motive behind the assault; but they did not succeed.

==  Khairgarh-Singhai State ==
Raja Deep Shahi was expelled from Nepal in 1790 A.D and on arriving to Terai of Oudh (now Lakhimpur Kheri District of Uttar Pradesh of India) he established Khairgarh-Singhai State in Khairigarh  under British India.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/k/khairigarh{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kanchanpur Praganna  (now the District of Kaillali and Kanchanpur of Nepal) was also the parts of his State or ''Zamindari''. He  succeeded in defeating the Banjaras rural of Khairigarh and establishing himself not only in that Pargana but also in parts of Bhur. His state was merged with India In 1947 after Indian Independence.

==Geography==
The Far-Western Development Region has the [[Mid-Western Development Region, Nepal|Mid-Western Development Region]] to the east, [[Uttar Pradesh]] ([[India]]) to the south, [[Uttarakhand]] ([[India]]) to the west and the [[Tibet|Tibet Autonomous Region]] ([[People's Republic of China]]) to the north.

The highest [[mountain]] in the region is the '''[[Api (mountain)|Api Peak]]''', with {{Convert|7132|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; it is in the [[Darchula District|Darchula]] [[district]]. Other high mountain is '''[[Saipal]]''', {{Convert|7031|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, in the [[Bajhang District|Bajhang]] district.

The most important rivers in the Far-Western Development Region are the '''[[Seti River|Seti]]''' and the '''[[Mahakali River|Mahakali]]''' ( ''Kali'' or''Sharda'' in [[India]]) rivers; both rivers are [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Ghaghara]] or [[Ghaghara|Karnali]]  river.

==Demographics==
It is the smallest Development Region of Nepal with an area of {{Convert|19539|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and also with the lowest population with 2,552,517 people living there;&lt;ref name=un /&gt; its population density is the second lowest of all the regions, with 130.6 persons/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Main ethnic group are [[chhetri]]s 76%

==Language and culture==
Dotiyali or Dotyali (Also Doteli) and [[Kumauni language|Kumauni]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kcm.co.kr/bethany_eng/p_code1/1330.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113132/http://kcm.co.kr/bethany_eng/p_code1/1330.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the local language spoken in Doti region or far western region of Nepal. Dotiyali which is similar to [[Kumauni language|Kumauni]] language is one of language of [[Indo-European family]]. According to [[Rahul Sankrityayan]], Dotiyali is the dialect of [[Kumauni language|Kumauni]] language which was brought in Doti by section of Katyuri dynasty of kumaoun which had ruled over Doti till 1790. Therefore, It is mainly an offshoot of Katyuri language which is now in the form of mixture of  several North Indian languages.Doti [[Monarchy|Kingdom]] was ruled by Katyuri Dynasty established after the destruction of previous Katyuri kingdom  into eight different princely states.

According to the census (2011) total 7,87,827 of the population speaks Doteli  and 2,72,524 of the population speaks [[Kumaoni language|Kumauni]] (Baitadeli) in Far western region of Nepal which is now recognized as a separate language of Nepal . Local intellectuals and people speaking Dotiyali language were increasingly demanding that their language be recognized as one of the other national languages of [[Nepal]].

Inhabitants of two terai districts [[Kailali District]] and [[Kanchanpur District]] speak  different languages. Rana-tharu and Dangaura-tharu speaks  their own  language. Language spoken by Rana-tharus is  [[Hindi]] Dialect and Dangaura-tharu speaks Tharu Language.

Traditional dance and songs Chhaliya, Bhada, Jhora Chapeli, Rung Culture of Rung people (Sauka), Baira song, [[Deuda song|Deuda]] and Jagar are part of the culture. Jagara, tales of bravery is most important culture in Doti since Katyuri period. [[Jhusia Damai]] of Baskot of [[Baitadi District]] (stayed in [[Dharchula]] India) was famous Jagar singer.The major festivals of Doti are mainly Gora (Gamra), Kumauni holi, Bishpati, [[Harela]], Raksha Bandhab (Rakhi) Dashin, Diwali, Makar Sankranti, and others.

'''Ecosystem services''' are the many and varied benefits that humans freely gain from the natural environment and from properly-functioning [[ecosystems]]. Such ecosystems include, for example, [[agroecosystem]]s, [[forest ecosystem]]s, [[grassland ecosystem]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Collectively, these benefits are becoming known as 'ecosystem services', and are often integral to the provisioning of clean [[drinking water]], the [[decomposition]] of wastes, and the natural pollination of crops and other plants.

While scientists and [[environmentalists]] have discussed ecosystem services implicitly for decades, the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MA) in the early 2000s popularized the concept.&lt;ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005"&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). 2005. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Synthesis {{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005715/http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}. [[Island Press]], Washington. 155pp.&lt;/ref&gt; There, ecosystem services are grouped into four broad categories: ''provisioning'', such as the production of food and water; ''regulating'', such as the control of climate and disease; ''supporting'', such as [[nutrient cycles]] and [[oxygen]] production; and ''cultural'', such as spiritual and recreational benefits. To help inform [[Decision-making|decision-makers]], many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values.

==History==

While the notion of human dependence on Earth's ecosystems reaches to the start of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''{{'}} existence, the term 'natural capital' was first coined by [[E. F. Schumacher|E.F. Schumacher]] in 1973 in his book ''[[Small Is Beautiful|Small is Beautiful]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F (1973). ''Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered''.&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  Recognition of how ecosystems could provide complex services to humankind date back to at least [[Plato]] (c. 400 BC) who understood that [[deforestation]] could lead to soil [[erosion]] and the drying of springs.&lt;ref name="Daily1997"&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems. Island Press, Washington. 392pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed| date=February 2015}}  Modern ideas of ecosystem services probably began when Marsh challenged in 1864 the idea that Earth's natural resources are unbounded by pointing out changes in [[soil fertility]] in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, G.P. 1864 (1965). Man and Nature. [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], New York. 472pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}} It was not until the late 1940s that three key authors—[[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr]],&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, F. 1948. [[Our Plundered Planet]]. Little, Brown and Company: Boston. 217pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, W. 1948. Road to Survival. William Sloan: New York. 335pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aldo Leopold]] &lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. 1949. A Sand County Almanac and Sketches from Here and There. [[Oxford University Press]], New York. 226pp.&lt;/ref&gt;—promoted recognition of human dependence on the environment.

In 1956, [[Paul Sears]] drew attention to the critical role of the ecosystem in processing wastes and recycling nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, P.B. 1956. "The processes of environmental change by man." ''In'': W.L. Thomas, editor. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth (Volume 2). [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago. 1193pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and Rosa Weigert called attention to "ecological systems" in their environmental science textbook&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1970. Population, Resources, Environment: Issues in Human Ecology. [[W. H. Freeman and Company|W.H. Freeman]], San Francisco. 383pp. - see p.157&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most subtle and dangerous threat to man's existence... the potential destruction, by man's own activities, of those ecological systems upon which the very existence of the human species depends".

The term "'''environmental services'''" was introduced in a 1970 report of the ''Study of Critical Environmental Problems'',&lt;ref&gt;Study of Critical Environmental Problems (SCEP). 1970. Man's Impact on the Global Environment. MIT Press, Cambridge. 319pp.&lt;/ref&gt; which listed services including insect pollination, [[fisheries]], [[climate]] regulation and [[flood]] control. In following years, variations of the term were used, but eventually 'ecosystem services' became the standard in scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1981. Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species. [[Random House]], New York. 305pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecosystem services concept has continued to expand and includes [[socio-economic]] and [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] objectives, which are discussed below. A history of the concepts and terminology of ecosystem services as of 1997, can be found in Daily's book "Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Daily1997"/&gt;

While [[Gretchen Daily]]'s original definition distinguished between ecosystem goods and ecosystem services, [[Robert Costanza]] and colleagues' later work and that of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment lumped all of these together as ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Brown2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown |first1=Thomas C. |author2=John C.

==Definition==
Per the 2006 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), ecosystem services are "the benefits people obtain from ecosystems". The MA also delineated the four categories of ecosystem services—supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural—discussed below.

By 2010, there had evolved various working definitions and descriptions of ecosystem services in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Ojea, E. Classifying Ecosystem Services for Economic Valuation: the case of forest water services. BIOECON Conference, Venice 27–28 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent double counting in ecosystem services audits, for instance, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB) replaced "Supporting Services" in the MA with "Habitat Services" and "ecosystem functions", defined as "a subset of the interactions between ecosystem structure and processes that underpin the capacity of an ecosystem to provide goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teebtest.org/wp-content/uploads/Study%20and%20Reports/Reports/Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations/TEEB%20Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations%20report/TEEB%20Foundations.pdf The Ecological and Economic Foundation], chapter 1, p.19, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|TEEB]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four categories==
[[Image:Dungbeetle.jpg|right|thumb|[[Detritivore]]s like this [[dung beetle]] help to turn animal wastes into organic material that can be reused by primary producers.]]

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) report 2005 defines ''Ecosystem services'' as benefits people obtain from ecosystems and distinguishes four categories of ecosystem services, where the so-called supporting services are regarded as the basis for the services of the other three categories.&lt;ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005"/&gt;

=== Supporting services ===
These include services such as nutrient recycling, primary production and [[soil formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation of ecosystem services|url=http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|website=basicbiology.net|publisher=Adam Purcell|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129194450/http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services make it possible for the ecosystems to provide services such as food supply, flood regulation, and water purification.

=== Provisioning services ===
* food (including [[seafood]] and [[Game (food)|game]]), crops, wild foods, and [[spice]]s
* raw materials (including lumber, skins, fuel wood, organic matter, fodder, and fertilizer)
* genetic resources (including crop improvement genes, and health care)
* water
* [[biogenic minerals]]
* [[Medication|medicinal resources]] (including pharmaceuticals, chemical models, and test and assay organisms)
* [[energy]] ([[hydropower]], [[biofuel|biomass fuels]])
* ornamental resources (including fashion, handicraft, jewelry, pets, worship, decoration and souvenirs like furs, feathers, ivory, orchids, butterflies, aquarium fish, shells, etc.)

=== Regulating services ===
* pollination
* carbon sequestration and [[climate]] regulation
* waste [[decomposition]] and detoxification
* purification of [[water purification|water]] and [[air pollution|air]]
* [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[disease]] control

===Cultural services===
* cultural (including use of nature as motif in books, film, painting, folklore, national symbols, architect, advertising, etc.)
* spiritual and historical (including use of nature for religious or heritage value or natural)
* [[recreation]]al experiences (including [[ecotourism]], outdoor sports, and recreation)
* science and education (including use of natural systems for school excursions, and [[scientific discovery]])
* Therapeutic (including Ecotherapy, social forestry and animal assisted therapy)

There is discussion as to how the concept of '''cultural ecosystem services''' can be operationalized. A good review of approaches in landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation, and spiritual significance to define and assess cultural values of our environment so that they fit into the ecosystem services approach is given by Daniel et al.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, T. C. et al. 2012: ''Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109: 8812–8819 [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/18/1114773109.full.pdf+html].&lt;/ref&gt; who vote for models that explicitly link ecological structures and functions with cultural values and benefits.
There also is a fundamental ''critique'' of the concept of cultural ecosystem services that builds on three arguments:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T. 2012: ''Pivotal cultural values of nature cannot be integrated into the ecosystem services framework.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109 (46): E3146.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pivotal cultural values attaching to the natural/cultivated environment rely on an area's unique character that cannot be addressed by methods that use universal scientific parameters to determine ecological structures and functions. 
# If a natural/cultivated environment has symbolic meanings and cultural values the object of these values are not ecosystems but shaped phenomena like mountains, lakes, forests, and, mainly, symbolic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Kirchhoff, T./Trepl, L./Vicenzotti, V. 2012:''What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions''. Landscape Research iFirst.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Those cultural values do result not from properties produced by ecosystems but are the product of a specific way of seeing within the given cultural framework of symbolic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Backhaus, G./Murungi, J. (eds.): ''Symbolic Landscapes''. Dordrecht 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples illustrate the relationships between humans and natural ecosystems through the services derived from them:
* In [[New York City]], where the quality of drinking water had fallen below standards required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]], authorities opted to restore the polluted [[Catskill Park|Catskill Watershed]] that had previously provided the city with the ecosystem service of water purification. Once the input of sewage and pesticides to the [[Drainage basin|watershed]] area was reduced, natural [[abiotic]] processes such as soil [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[filtration]] of chemicals, together with biotic recycling via [[root| root systems]] and [[soil]] [[microorganisms]], [[water quality]] improved to levels that met government standards. The cost of this investment in [[natural capital]] was estimated between $1–1.5 billion, which contrasted dramatically with the estimated $6–8 billion cost of constructing a [[water filtration]] plant plus the $300 million annual running costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graciela Chichilnisky|Chichilnisky, G.]] and G. Heal. 1998. Economic returns from the biosphere. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 391: 629-630.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pollination of [[crops]] by [[bees]] is required for 15–30% of U.S. [[food production]]; most large-scale farmers import non-native honey bees to provide this service. One study &lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"&gt;Kremen, C. 2005. Managing ecosystem services: what do we need to know about their ecology?  [[Ecology Letters]] 8: 468-479.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that in [[California| California's]] agricultural region, it was found that wild bees alone could provide partial or complete pollination services or enhance the services provided by honey bees through behavioral interactions. However, [[Intensive farming|intensified agricultural practices]] can quickly erode pollination services through the loss of species. The remaining species are unable to compensate this. The results of this study also indicate that the proportion of [[chaparral]] and [[California oak woodland|oak-woodland habitat]] available for wild bees within 1–2&amp;nbsp;km of a [[farm]] can stabilize and enhance the provision of pollination services. The presence of such ecosystem elements functions almost like an insurance policy for farmers.
* In watersheds of the [[Yangtze River]] ([[China]]), [[Spatial analysis|spatial models]] for water flow through different forest habitats were created to determine potential contributions for [[hydroelectric power]] in the region. By quantifying the relative value of ecological parameters (vegetation-soil-slope complexes), researchers were able to estimate the annual economic benefit of maintaining forests in the watershed for power services to be 2.2 times that if it were harvested once for [[timber]].&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Z.W., X.M. Xio and D.M. Li. 2000. An assessment of ecosystem services: water flow regulation and hydroelectric power production. Ecological Applications 10: 925-936.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s, mineral water company Vittel (now a brand of Nestlé Waters) faced a critical problem. Nitrates and pesticides were entering the company's springs in northeastern France. Local farmers had intensified agricultural practices and cleared native vegetation that previously had filtered water before it seeped into the aquifer used by Vittel. This contamination threatened the company's right to use the "natural mineral water" label under French law.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, C, J Ranganathan, C Iceland, and J Finisdore. (2008) The Corporate Ecosystem Services Review (Version 1.0). [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this business risk, Vittel developed an incentive package for farmers to improve their agricultural practices and consequently reduce water pollution that had affected Vittel's product. For example, Vittel provided subsidies and free technical assistance to farmers in exchange for farmers' agreement to enhance pasture management, reforest catchments, and reduce the use of agrochemicals. This is an example of a [[payment for ecosystem services]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot-Maître, D. (2006) The Vittel payments for ecosystem services: a "perfect" PES case? [[International Institute for Environment and Development]], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was counted that to plant 15 000 ha new woodland in the UK, if we consider only the value of timber, it would cost  £79 000 000 which is more than the benefit of £65 000 000. If, however, we include all other benefits the trees in lowland could provide (like soil stabilization, wind deflection, recreation, food production, air purification, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, fuel production, cooling, flood prevention), the costs will increase due to displacing the profitable farmland (would be around £231 000 000) but will be overweight by benefits of £546 000 000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=EU Environment|title=Ecosystem services and Biodiversity - Science for Environment Policy|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-09-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806014145/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s&amp;feature=youtu.be|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Europe, various projects are implemented in order to define the values of concrete ecosystems and to implement this concept into decision making process. For example,  "LIFE Viva grass" project aims to do this with grasslands in Baltics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vivagrass.eu/|title=LIFE Viva Grass {{!}} Integrated planning tool for grassland ecosystem services|website=vivagrass.eu|access-date=2016-09-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807201444/http://vivagrass.eu/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Understanding of ecosystem services requires a strong foundation in [[ecology]], which describes the underlying principles and interactions of organisms and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Since the scales at which these entities interact can vary from [[microbes]] to [[landscapes]], milliseconds to millions of years, one of the greatest remaining challenges is the descriptive characterization of energy and material flow between them.  For example, the area of a forest floor, the [[detritus]] upon it, the microorganisms in the soil and characteristics of the soil itself will all contribute to the abilities of that forest for providing ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, water purification, and [[erosion]] prevention to other areas within the watershed. Note that it is often possible for multiple services to be bundled together and when benefits of targeted objectives are secured, there may also be ancillary benefits—the same forest may provide [[habitat]] for other organisms as well as human recreation, which are also ecosystem services.

The complexity of Earth's ecosystems poses a challenge for scientists as they try to understand how relationships are interwoven among organisms, processes and their surroundings. As it relates to human ecology, a suggested research agenda &lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"/&gt; for the study of ecosystem services includes the following steps:
# identification of ''ecosystem service providers'' (''ESP''s)—[[species]] or populations that provide specific ecosystem services—and characterization of their functional roles and relationships;
# determination of community structure aspects that influence how ESPs function in their [[natural landscape]], such as compensatory responses that stabilize function and non-random extinction sequences which can erode it;
# assessment of key environmental (abiotic) factors influencing the provision of services;
# measurement of the spatial and temporal scales ESPs and their services operate on.

Recently, a technique has been developed to improve and standardize the evaluation of ESP functionality by quantifying the relative importance of different species in terms of their efficiency and abundance.&lt;ref name="Balvanera"&gt;Balvanera, P. C. Kremen, and M. Martinez. 2005. Applying community structure analysis to ecosystem function: examples from pollination and carbon storage. Ecological Applications 15: 360-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Such parameters provide indications of how species respond to changes in the environment (i.e. predators, resource availability, climate) and are useful for identifying species that are disproportionately important at providing ecosystem services. However, a critical drawback is that the technique does not account for the effects of interactions, which are often both complex and fundamental in maintaining an ecosystem and can involve species that are not readily detected as a priority. Even so, estimating the functional structure of an ecosystem and combining it with information about individual species traits can help us understand the [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of an ecosystem amidst environmental change.

Many ecologists also believe that the provision of ecosystem services can be stabilized with [[biodiversity]]. Increasing biodiversity also benefits the variety of ecosystem services available to society. Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and an ecosystem's stability is essential to the management of natural resources and their services.

===Redundancy hypothesis===
The concept of ecological redundancy is sometimes referred to as ''functional compensation'' and assumes that more than one species performs a given role within an ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, B.H. 1992. "Biodiversity and ecological redundancy." [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 6: 18-23.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is characterized by a particular species increasing its efficiency at providing a service when conditions are stressed in order to maintain aggregate stability in the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, T.M., [[Stephen R. Carpenter|S.R. Carpenter]], A.R. Ives, and T.K. Kratz. 1995. "Species compensation and complementarity in ecosystem function." ''In'': C. Jones and J. Lawton, editors. Linking species and ecosystems. [[Chapman &amp; Hall]], London. 387pp.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such increased dependence on a compensating species places additional stress on the ecosystem and often enhances its susceptibility to subsequent [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The redundancy hypothesis can be summarized as "species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience".&lt;ref name="Naeem 1998"&gt;Naeem S. 1998. "Species redundancy and ecosystem reliability" [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 12: 39–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another idea uses the analogy of rivets in an airplane wing to compare the exponential effect the loss of each species will have on the function of an ecosystem; this is sometimes referred to as ''rivet popping''.&lt;ref name="Lawton 1994"&gt;Lawton, J.H. 1994. What do species do in ecosystems? [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] 71: 367-374.&lt;/ref&gt; If only one species disappears, the loss of the ecosystem's efficiency as a whole is relatively small; however, if several species are lost, the system essentially collapses—similar to an airplane that lost too many rivets. The hypothesis assumes that species are relatively specialized in their roles and that their ability to compensate for one another is less than in the redundancy hypothesis. As a result, the loss of any species is critical to the performance of the ecosystem. The key difference is the rate at which the loss of species affects total ecosystem functioning.

===Portfolio effect===
A third explanation, known as the ''portfolio effect'', compares biodiversity to stock holdings, where diversification minimizes the volatility of the investment, or in this case, the risk of instability of ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D., C.L. Lehman, and C.E. Bristow. 1998. Diversity-stability relationships: statistical inevitability or ecological consequence?" ''The American Naturalist'' 151: 277-282.&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the idea of ''response diversity'' where a suite of species will exhibit differential responses to a given environmental perturbation. When considered together, they create a stabilizing function that preserves the integrity of a service.&lt;ref&gt;Elmqvist, T., C. Folke, M. Nyström, G. Peterson, J. Bengtsson, B. Walker and J. Norberg. 2003. Response diversity, ecosystem change, and resilience. [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 1: 488-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several experiments have tested these hypotheses in both the field and the lab. In ECOTRON, a laboratory in the UK where many of the [[biotic component|biotic]] and abiotic factors of nature can be simulated, studies have focused on the effects of earthworms and [[symbiotic bacteria]] on plant roots.&lt;ref name="Lawton 1994"/&gt;  These laboratory experiments seem to favor the rivet hypothesis. However, a study on grasslands at Cedar Creek Reserve in Minnesota supports the redundancy hypothesis, as have many other field studies.&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J.P. 1997.

There are questions regarding the environmental and economic values of ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Raudsepp-Hearne, C. et al. 2010. Untangling the Environmentalist's Paradox: Why is Human Well-being Increasing as Ecosystem Services Degrade? Bioscience 60(8)  576–589.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may be unaware of the environment in general and humanity's interrelatedness with the natural environment, which may cause misconceptions. Although environmental awareness is rapidly improving in our contemporary world, ecosystem capital and its flow are still poorly understood, threats continue to impose, and we suffer from the so-called '[[tragedy of the commons]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, G. 1968. The tragedy of the commons" ''Science'' 162: 1243-1248.&lt;/ref&gt; Many efforts to inform decision-makers of current versus future costs and benefits now involve organizing and translating scientific knowledge to [[economics]], which articulate the consequences of our choices in comparable units of impact on human well-being.&lt;ref name="Daily et al. 2000."&gt;Daily, G.C., T. Söderqvist, S. Aniyar, K. Arrow, P. Dasgupta, P.R. Ehrlich, C. Folke, A. Jansson, B. Jansson, N. Kautsky, S. Levin, J. Lubchenco, K. Mäler, D. Simpson, D. Starrett, D. Tilman, and B. Walker. 2000. The value of nature and the nature of value" ''Science'' 289: 395-396.&lt;/ref&gt; An especially challenging aspect of this process is that interpreting ecological information collected from one spatial-temporal scale does not necessarily mean it can be applied at another; understanding the dynamics of ecological processes relative to ecosystem services is essential in aiding economic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. 2004. Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function. [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 2: 249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Weighting factors such as a service's irreplaceability or bundled services can also allocate economic value such that goal attainment becomes more efficient.

The economic valuation of ecosystem services also involves social communication and information, areas that remain particularly challenging and are the focus of many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Varela|first2=Elsa|last3=Piqué|first3=Miriam|last4=Prokofieva|first4=Irina|title=Demand and supply of ecosystem services in a Mediterranean forest: Computing payment boundaries.|journal=Ecosystem Services|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.11.006|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806071955/http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the idea is that although individuals make decisions for any variety of reasons, trends reveal the aggregative preferences of a society, from which the economic value of services can be inferred and assigned. The six major methods for valuing ecosystem services in monetary terms are:&lt;ref&gt;Farber, S.C., R. Costanza and M.A. Wilson. 2002. Economic and ecological concepts for valuing ecosystem services. Ecological Economics 41: 375-392.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Avoided cost: Services allow society to avoid costs that would have been incurred in the absence of those services (e.g. waste treatment by [[wetland]] habitats avoids health costs)
* Replacement cost: Services could be replaced with man-made systems (e.g. [[Restoration Ecology|restoration]] of the [[Catskill Watershed]] cost less than the construction of a [[water purification]] plant)
* Factor income: Services provide for the enhancement of incomes (e.g. improved [[water quality]] increases the commercial take of a [[fishery]] and improves the income of fishers)
* Travel cost: Service demand may require travel, whose costs can reflect the implied value of the service (e.g. value of [[ecotourism]] experience is at least what a visitor is willing to pay to get there)
* Hedonic pricing: Service demand may be reflected in the prices people will pay for associated goods (e.g. coastal housing prices exceed that of inland homes)
* Contingent valuation: Service demand may be elicited by posing hypothetical scenarios that involve some valuation of alternatives (e.g. visitors willing to pay for increased access to national parks)

A peer-reviewed study published in 1997 estimated the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital to be between US$16–54 trillion per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costanza |first=Robert |first2=Ralph |last2=d'Arge |first3=Rudolf |last3=de Groot |first4=Stephen |last4=Farberk |first5=Monica |last5=Grasso |first6=Bruce |last6=Hannon |first7=Karin |last7=Limburg |first8=Shahid |last8=Naeem |first9=Robert V. |last9=O'Neill |first10=Jose |last10=Paruelo |first11=Robert G. |last11=Raskin |first12=Paul |last12=Sutton |first13=Marjan |last13=van den Belt |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |date=15 May 1997 |volume=387 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Salles (2011) indicates 'The total value of biodiversity is infinite, so having debate about what is the total value of nature is actually pointless because we can't live without it'.

==Management and policy==

Although monetary pricing continues with respect to the valuation of ecosystem services, the challenges in policy implementation and management are significant and multitudinous. The administration of [[common pool resources]] is a subject of extensive academic pursuit.&lt;ref name="Ostrom 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge. 279pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. E. Ostrom and P.C. Stern. 2003. The struggle to govern the commons" ''Science'' 302: 1907-1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, J. 2003. Social capital and the collective management of resources" ''Science'' 302: 1912-1914.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heikkila, T. 2004. Institutional boundaries and common-pool resource management: a comparative analysis of water management programs in California. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' from [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]] 23: 97-117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, C.C., J.T. Williams and E. Ostrom. 2005. Local management and better forests. [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] 33: 273-284.&lt;/ref&gt; From defining the problems to finding solutions that can be applied in practical and sustainable ways, there is much to overcome. Considering options must balance present and future human needs, and decision-makers must frequently work from valid but incomplete information. Existing legal policies are often considered insufficient since they typically pertain to human health-based standards that are mismatched with necessary means to protect [[ecosystem health]] and services. To improve the information available, one suggestion has involved the implementation of an ''Ecosystem Services Framework'' (ESF&lt;ref name="Daily 2000"&gt;Daily, G.C. 2000. Management objectives for the protection of ecosystem services. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 3: 333-339.&lt;/ref&gt;), which integrates the biophysical and [[socio-economic]] dimensions of protecting the environment and is designed to guide [[institutions]] through multidisciplinary information and jargon, helping to direct strategic choices.

Novel and expedient methods are needed to deal with managing Earth's ecosystem services. Local to regional collective management efforts might be considered appropriate for services like crop [[pollination]] or resources like water.&lt;ref name="Kremen 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostrom 1990"/&gt; Another approach that has become increasingly popular over the last decade is the marketing of ecosystem services protection. Payment and trading of services is an emerging worldwide small-scale solution where one can acquire credits for activities such as sponsoring the protection of carbon sequestration sources or the [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] of ecosystem service providers. In some cases, banks for handling such credits have been established and conservation companies have even gone public on stock exchanges, defining an evermore parallel link with economic endeavors and opportunities for tying into social perceptions.&lt;ref name="Daily et al. 2000."/&gt; However, crucial for implementation are clearly defined [[land rights]], which is often lacking in many [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Jessica Brown and Neil Bird 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&amp;title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation Costa Rica sustainable resource management: Successfully tackling tropical deforestation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083601/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&amp;title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation |date=14 May 2011 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, many forest-rich developing countries suffering [[deforestation]] experience conflict between different forest stakeholders.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In addition, concerns for such global transactions include inconsistent compensation for services or resources sacrificed elsewhere and misconceived warrants for irresponsible use. Another approach has been focused on protecting ecosystem service '[[biodiversity hotspot|hotspots]]'. Recognition that the conservation of many ecosystem services aligns with more traditional conservation goals (i.e. [[biodiversity]]) has led to the suggested merging of objectives for maximizing their mutual success. This may be particularly strategic when employing networks that permit the flow of services across [[landscapes]], and might also facilitate securing the financial means to protect services through a diversification of investors.&lt;ref&gt;Balvanera, P., G.C. Daily, P.R. Ehrlich, T.H. Ricketts, S.Bailey, S. Kark, C. Kremen and H. Pereira. 2001. Conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. [[Science (journal)|Science]] 291: 2047.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K.M.A., M.R. Shaw, D.R. Cameron, E.C. Underwood and G.C. Daily. 2006. Conservation planning for ecosystem services. [[PLoS Biology]] 4: 2138-2152.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in recent years there has been interest in the valuation of ecosystem services provided by [[shellfish]] production and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Northern Economics Inc|title=Valuation of Ecosystem Services from Shellfish Restoration, Enhancement and Management: A Review of the Literature|url=http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|publisher=Prepared for Pacific Shellfish Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203085756/http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A keystone species, low in the food chain, bivalve shellfish such as oysters support a complex community of species by performing a number of functions essential to the diverse array of species that surround them. There is also increasing recognition that some shellfish species may impact or control many ecological processes; so much so that they are included on the list of "ecosystem engineers"—organisms that physically, biologically or chemically modify the environment around them in ways that influence the health of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|author2=Lawton, and Shachak|title=Organisms as Ecosystem Engineers|journal=Oikos|year=1994|volume=69|issue=3|pages=373–386|doi=10.2307/3545850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the ecological functions and processes performed or affected by shellfish contribute to human well-being by providing a stream of valuable ecosystem services over time by filtering out particulate materials and potentially mitigating water quality issues by controlling [[nutrient pollution|excess nutrients]] in the water.

===Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)===

Ecosystem-based adaptation or EbA is an emerging strategy for community development and environmental management that seeks to use an ecosystem services framework to help communities adapt to the effects of [[climate change]]. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] currently defines Ecosystem-Based Adaptation as "the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change", which includes the use of "sustainable management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems, as part of an overall adaptation strategy that takes into account the multiple social, economic and cultural co-benefits for local communities".&lt;ref name="ebaflagship.org"&gt;http://ebaflagship.org/images/ContentsForPublications/eba%20policy%20brochure%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment announced that humanity's impact on the natural world was increasing to levels never before seen, and that the degradation of the planet's ecosystems would become a major barrier to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In recognition of this fact, Ecosystem-Based Adaptation seeks to use the restoration of ecosystems as a stepping-stone to improving the quality of life in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change. Specifically, this involves the restoration of ecosystems that provide the community with essential services, such as the provisioning of food and water and protection from [[storm surges]] and flooding. EbA interventions typically combine elements of both [[climate change mitigation]] and [[adaptation to global warming]] to help address the community's current and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604195815/http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |archivedate=4 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative planning between scientists, policy makers, and community members is an essential element of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation. By drawing on the expertise of outside experts and local residents alike, EbA seeks to develop unique solutions to unique problems, rather than simply replicating past projects.&lt;ref name="ebaflagship.org"/&gt;

==Estuarine and coastal ecosystem services==

Ecosystem services are defined as the gains acquired by humankind from surroundings ecosystems. Four different types of ecosystem services have been distinguished by the scientific body: regulating services, provisioning services, cultural services and supporting services. An ecosystem does not necessarily offer all four types of services simultaneously; but given the intricate nature of any ecosystem, it is usually assumed that humans benefit from a combination of these services. The services offered by diverse types of ecosystems (forests, seas, coral reefs, mangroves, etc.) differ in nature and in consequence. In fact, some services directly affect the livelihood of neighboring human populations (such as fresh water, food or aesthetic value, etc.) while other services affect general environmental conditions by which humans are indirectly impacted (such as climate change, erosion regulation or natural hazard regulation, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Barbier, E.B.; Hacker, S.D.; Kennedy, C.; Koch, E.W.; Stier, A.C. &amp; Silliman, B.R. [http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/10-1510.1] ''Ecological Monographs'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are both marine ecosystems. An [[estuary]] is defined as the area in which a river meets the sea or the ocean. The waters surrounding this area are predominantly salty waters or brackish waters; and the incoming river water is dynamically motioned by the tide. An estuary strip may be covered by populations of reed (or similar plants) and/or sandbanks (or similar form or land).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A coastal ecosystem occurs in areas where the sea or ocean waters meet the land.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Regulating services===
Regulating services are the "benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|title=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|author=|date=|website=www.millenniumassessment.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224041032/http://millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|archivedate=24 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, these services include climate regulation, waste treatment and disease control and natural hazard regulation.

====Climate regulation====
Both the biotic and abiotic ensembles of marine ecosystems play a role in climate regulation. They act as sponges when it comes to gases in the atmosphere, retaining large levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide). Marine plants also use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for photosynthesis purposes and help in reducing the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The oceans and seas absorb the heat from the atmosphere and redistribute it through the means of water currents, and atmospheric processes, such as evaporation and the reflection of light allow for the cooling and warming of the overlying atmosphere. The ocean temperatures are thus imperative to the regulation of the atmospheric temperatures in any part of the world: "without the ocean, the Earth would be unbearably hot during the daylight hours and frigidly cold, if not frozen, at night".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"&gt;MOlnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn &amp; Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waste treatment and disease regulation====
Another service offered by marine ecosystem is the treatment of wastes, thus helping in the regulation of diseases. Wastes can be diluted and detoxified through transport across marine ecosystems; pollutants are removed from the environment and stored, buried or recycled in marine ecosystems: "Marine ecosystems break down organic waste through microbial communities that filter water, reduce/limit the effects of eutrophication, and break down toxic hydrocarbons into their basic components such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt; The fact that waste is diluted with large volumes of water and moves with water currents leads to the regulation of diseases and the reduction of toxics in seafood.

====Buffer zones====
Coastal and estuarine ecosystems act as buffer zones against natural hazards and environmental disturbances, such as floods, cyclones, tidal surges and storms. The role they play is to "[absorb] a portion of the impact and thus [lessen] its effect on the land".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt; Wetlands, for example, and the vegetation it supports – trees, root mats, etc. – retain large amounts of water (surface water, snowmelt, rain, groundwater) and then slowly releases them back, decreasing the likeliness of floods.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, A.C.; Hernandez, M.E.; Moreno-Casasola, P.; Espinosa, E.C.; Robledo, A.R. &amp; Mata, D.I. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626667.2011.629786] ''Hydrological Sciences Journal'', December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Mangrove forests protect coastal shorelines from tidal erosion or erosion by currents; a process that was studied after the 1999 cyclone that hit India. Villages that were surrounded with mangrove forests encountered less damages than other villages that weren't protected by mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;Badol, Ruchi &amp; Hussain, S.A. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=314311&amp;jid=ENC&amp;volumeId=32&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=314310], ''Environmental Conservation'', February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisioning Services===
Provisioning services consist of all "the products obtained from ecosystems". Marine ecosystems provide people with: wild &amp; cultured seafood, fresh water, fiber &amp; fuel and biochemical &amp; genetic resources.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Marine products====
Humans consume a large number of products originating from the seas, whether as a nutritious product or for use in other sectors: "More than one billion people worldwide, or one-sixth of the global population, rely on fish as their main source of animal protein. In 2000, marine and coastal fisheries accounted for 12 per cent of world food production".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Molnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn &amp; Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fish and other edible marine products – primarily fish, shellfish, roe and seaweeds – constitute for populations living along the coast the main elements of the local cultural diets, norms and traditions. A very pertinent example would be sushi, the national food of Japan, which consists mostly of different types of fish and seaweed.

====Fresh water====
Water bodies that are not highly concentrated in salts are referred to as 'fresh water' bodies. Fresh water may run through lakes, rivers and streams, to name a few; but it is most prominently found in the frozen state or as soil moisture or buried deep underground. Fresh water is not only important for the survival of humans, but also for the survival of all the existing species of animals, plants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Raw materials====
Marine creatures provide us with the raw materials needed for the manufacturing of clothing, building materials (lime extracted from coral reefs), ornamental items and personal-use items (luffas, art and jewelry): "The skin of marine mammals for clothing, gas deposits for energy production, lime (extracted from coral reefs) for building construction, and the timber of mangroves and coastal forests for shelter are some of the more familiar uses of marine organisms. Raw marine materials are utilized for non-essential goods as well, such as shells and corals in ornamental items".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Humans have also referred to processes within marine environments for the production of renewable energy: using the power of waves – or tidal power – as a source of energy for the powering of a turbine, for example.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Oceans and seas are used as sites for offshore oil and gas installations, offshore wind farms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Biochemical and genetic resources====
Biochemical resources are compounds extracted from marine organisms for use in medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other biochemical products. Genetic resources are the genetic information found in marine organisms that would later on be used for animal and plant breeding and for technological advances in the biological field. These resources are either directly taken out from an organism – such as fish oil as a source of omega3 –, or used as a model for innovative man-made products: "such as the construction of fiber optics technology based on the properties of sponges. ... Compared to terrestrial products, marine-sourced products tend to be more highly bioactive, likely due to the fact that marine organisms have to retain their potency despite being diluted in the surrounding sea-water".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Cultural services===
Cultural services relate to the non-material world, as they benefit the benefit recreational, aesthetic, cognitive and spiritual activities, which are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Inspirational====
Marine environments have been used by many as an inspiration for their works of art, music, architecture, traditions... Water environments are spiritually important as a lot of people view them as a means for rejuvenation and change of perspective. Many also consider the water as being a part of their personality, especially if they have lived near it since they were kids: they associate it to fond memories and past experiences. Living near water bodies for a long time results in a certain set of water activities that become a ritual in the lives of people and of the culture in the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Recreation and tourism====
Sea sports are very popular among coastal populations: surfing, snorkeling, whale watching, kayaking, recreational fishing...a lot of tourists also travel to resorts close to the sea or rivers or lakes to be able to experience these activities, and relax near the water.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[File:Tourism on Greek Beaches.jpg|thumb|Beach accommodated into a recreational area.]]

====Science and education====
A lot can be learned from marine processes, environments and organisms – that could be implemented into our daily actions and into the scientific domain. Although much is still yet to still be known about the ocean world: "by the extraordinary intricacy and complexity of the marine environment and how it is influenced by large spatial scales, time lags, and cumulative effects".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt;

===Supporting services===
Supporting services are the services that allow for the other ecosystem services to be present. They have indirect impacts on humans that last over a long period of time. Several services can be considered as being both supporting services and regulating/cultural/provisioning services.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Nutrient cycling====
Nutrient cycling is the movement of nutrients through an ecosystem by biotic and abiotic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scienceaid.net/biology/ecology/nutrient.html|title=Nutrient Cycles: Recycling in Ecosystems, The Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles - ScienceAid|work=ScienceAid|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ocean is a vast storage pool for these nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrients are absorbed by the basic organisms of the marine food web and are thus transferred from one organism to the other and from one ecosystem to the other. Nutrients are recycled through the life cycle of organisms as they die and decompose, releasing the nutrients into the neighboring environment. "The service of nutrient cycling eventually impacts all other ecosystem services as all living things require a constant supply of nutrients to survive".&lt;ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/&gt;

====Biologically mediated habitats====
Biologically mediated habitats are defined as being the habitats that living marine structures offer to other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;UK National Ecosystem Assessment Technical Report, {{cite web |url=http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060244/http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, ''Chapters 13-16'', June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These need not to be designed for the sole purpose of serving as a habitat, but happen to become living quarters whilst growing naturally. For example, coral reefs and mangrove forests are home to numerous species of fish, seaweed and shellfish... The importance of these habitats is that they allow for interactions between different species, aiding the provisioning of marine goods and services. They are also very important for the growth at the early life stages of marine species (breeding and bursary spaces), as they serve as a food source and as a shelter from predators.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[File:Example of Biologically Mediated Habitats.jpg|thumb|Coral and other living organisms serve as habitats for many marine species.]]

====Primary production====
Primary production refers to the production of organic matter, i.e., chemically bound energy, through processes such as photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. The organic matter produced by primary producers forms the basis of all food webs. Further, it generates oxygen (O2), a molecule necessary to sustain animals and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?isbn=1118506243|title=isbn:1118506243 - Google zoeken|author=|date=|website=books.google.be|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services|title=Ecosystem Services|author=|date=|website=msu.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228161544/http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|title=Oxygen and Human Requirements|author=|date=|website=www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022082604/http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Inhaled and exhaled air|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026150605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem services degradation can pose a number of risks to corporate performance as well as provide business opportunities through ecosystem restoration and enhancement. Risks and opportunities include:

* '''''Operational'''''
** Risks such as higher costs for freshwater due to scarcity or lower output for hydroelectric facilities due to siltation
** Opportunities such as increasing water-use efficiency or building an on-site wetland to circumvent the need for new water treatment infrastructure
* '''''Regulatory and legal'''''
** Risks such as new fines, government regulations, or lawsuits from local communities that lose ecosystem services due to corporate activities
** Opportunities such as engaging governments to develop policies and incentives to protect or restore ecosystems that provide services a company needs
* '''''Reputational'''''
** Risks such as retail companies being targeted by nongovernmental organization campaigns for purchasing wood or paper from sensitive forests
::Opportunities such as implementing and communicating sustainable purchasing, operating, or investment practices in order to differentiate corporate brands.
* '''''Market and product'''''
** Risks such as customers switching to other suppliers that offer products with lower ecosystem impacts or governments implementing new sustainable procurement policies
** Opportunities such as launching new products and services that reduce customer impacts on ecosystems or participating in emerging markets for carbon sequestration and watershed protection other products
* '''''Financing'''''
** Risks such as banks implementing more rigorous lending requirements for corporate loans
** Opportunities such as banks offering more favorable loan terms or investors taking positions in companies supplying products and services that improve resource use efficiency or restore degraded ecosystems

Many companies are not fully aware of the extent of their dependence and impact on ecosystems and the possible ramifications. Likewise, environmental management systems and environmental due diligence tools are more suited to handle "traditional" issues of pollution and natural [[resource consumption]]. Most focus on [[environmental impacts]], not dependence. Several newly developed tools and methodologies can help the private sector value and assess ecosystem services.

==Land use change decisions==

Ecosystem services decisions require making complex choices at the intersection of [[ecology]], [[technology]], [[society]] and the [[economy]]. The process of making ecosystem services decisions must consider the interaction of many types of information, honor all [[project stakeholder|stakeholder]] viewpoints, including [[regulatory agencies]], proposal proponents, decision makers, residents, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, and measure the impacts on all four parts of the intersection. These decisions are usually [[spatial planning|spatial]], always [[multi-objective optimization|multi-objective]], and based on uncertain data, models, and estimates. Often it is the combination of the best science combined with the stakeholder values, estimates and opinions that drive the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Secco|first2=L|last3=Pisani|first3=E|title=Exploring the interlinkages between governance and social capital: A dynamic model for forestry.|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2016.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One analytical study modeled the stakeholders as [[software agent|agents]] to support water resource management decisions in the Middle Rio Grande basin of New Mexico.  This study focused on modeling the stakeholder inputs across a spatial decision, but ignored uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url= http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2012/120710.pdf|author= Tidwell, V.,  E.

In Baltic countries scientists, nature conservationists and local authorities are [http://vivagrass.eu/about-the-project/ implementing integrated planning approach for grassland ecosystems]. They are developing Integrated Planning Tool that will be based on [[GIS]] (geographic information system) technology and put online that will help for planners to choose the best grassland management solution for concrete grassland. It will look holistically at the processes in the countryside and help to find best grassland management solutions by taking into account both natural and socioeconomic factors of the particular site.

Count '''Erik Jönsson Dahlbergh''' (10 October 1625{{snd}}16 January 1703) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer, soldier, and [[field marshal]]. He was born of peasant stock but he eventually rose to the level of nobility through his military competence. He was renowned for fortification works and was called the "[[Vauban]] of Sweden".

== Life ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
Erik Dahlbergh was born of peasant stock in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], but rose to the level of titled nobility due to his military abilities. His early studies involved the science of fortification.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Dahlberg, Erik Johansen, Count |volume=7 |page=731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphaned at an early age, Dahlbergh's studies qualified him as a [[scribe]] and in 1641 he found employment with Gert Rehnskiöld, the senior accountant for [[Pommern]] and [[Mecklenburg]]. During his six years he was taught the fundamentals in draughtsmanship and stood out for his ability to draw. While learning these skills, he also intensely studied mathematics, architecture, perspective and map drawing.
[[File:Erik Dahlberg - Battle of Warsaw - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Warsaw (1656)|Battle of Warsaw]] by Dahlbergh]]

As an engineer officer he saw service in the latter years of the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In 1650, the military command dispatched Dahlbergh to Frankfurt to recoup war indemnity awarded to Sweden following the end of the war and the [[Treaty of Westphalia]]. Dahlbergh contacted the publishing firm of [[Matthäus Merian|Merian]] and provided topographical maps. In 1635 Matthäus Merian the Elder initiated the ''Theatrum Europaeum'', a series of contemporary chronicles published until 1732. Both works, the ''Theatrum Europaeum'' and the topographical prints, were continued following the death of Mattheus Merian in 1650 by his sons and stepsons. [[Image:Suecia 1-004 ; Erik Dahlberg.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Erik Dahlbergh in ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]]]''

He attempted several unsuccessful pilgrimages to Palestine and Jerusalem both by sea and land. While studying art in Italy, news reached him of a coming war between Sweden and Poland-Lithuania and he saw the potential for a military career and he rode from Rome to Stettin in 23 days.

In his military career, Dahlbergh saw service in [[Poland]] where he probably witnessed the fighting at the second battle of Warsaw and survived a plague which nearly killed him. As adjutant-general and engineering adviser to [[Charles X of Sweden]], he had a great share in [[March across the Belts|the famous crossing]] of the frozen [[Great Belt|Belts]], and at the sieges of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Kronborg]] where he directed the engineers during the [[Northern Wars]]. In spite of his distinguished service, however, Dahlbergh remained an obscure lieutenant-colonel for many years. His patriotism, however, proved superior to the tempting offers [[Charles II of England]] made to induce him to enter the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] service, when, in that age of professional soldiering, the offer was completely acceptable.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His talents were eventually recognized and, in 1676, he became director-general of fortifications for the Swedish crown. As director, Dahlbergh rendered distinguished service over the next twenty-five years in attack as in the [[Scanian War]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In [[Helsingborg]] in 1677, he was a key operative in the [[Great Northern War]] at [[Dunamünde]], and in 1700 he was instrumental in the defence of the two sieges of [[Riga]].  His work in repairing the fortresses of his own country earned for him the title of the "[[Vauban]] of Sweden", and he was also the founder of the Swedish engineer corps. He retired while in the rank of field marshal in 1702 and died the following year.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In modern times, Erik Dahlbergh was best known for compiling the collection of drawings called "[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]", or ''Ancient and Modern Sweden'', published 1660–1716, and assisted [[Samuel Pufendorf]] in his "Histoire de Charles X Gustave". He wrote a memoir of his life (to be found in Svenska Bibliotek, 1757) and an account "Of the campaigns of Charles X" (ed. Lundblad, Stockholm, 1823).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The German influence reveals itself in his work; adopting the [[Teutons|Teutonic]] theme of glorification to Sweden's leaders, cities and peoples.

'''''Gauss''''' was a ship built in Germany specially for polar exploration, named after the [[mathematician]] and [[physical scientist]] [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. Purchased by Canada in 1904, the vessel was renamed '''CGS ''Arctic'''''. As ''Arctic'', the vessel made annual trips to the Canadian Arctic until 1925. The ship's fate is disputed among the sources, but all claim that by the mid-1920s, the vessel was out of service.

Classed "A1" by [[Germanischer Lloyd]]s, she was designed to carry 700 tons of stores, enough to make her self-sufficient for up to three years with a crew of 30 aboard.

==Ship history==
[[File:Gauss corp2854.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of ''Gauss'' in the ice during the German Antarctic Expedition taken using a tethered balloon]]

Between 1901 and 1903 ''Gauss'' explored the [[Antarctic]] in the [[Gauss expedition]] under the leadership of [[Erich von Drygalski]].

In early 1904 the ship was purchased by the Canadian government under the advice of [[Joseph-Elzéar Bernier]], who had surveyed the ship before the acquisition. The ship was renamed ''Arctic'' and under the command of Bernier she explored the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Arctic Archipelago]]. Bernier and ''Arctic'' made annual expeditions to Canada's north.&lt;ref name=maginley/&gt; On 1 July 1909, Bernier, without government approval, claimed the entire area between Canada's eastern and western borders all the way to the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacEachern |first=Alan |year=2010 |title=J.E.

'''Geddes''' is a [[surname]] of English and Scottish origin. In Scotland and northern Ireland the name may be derived from the place-name [[Geddes, Highland|Geddes]] in [[Nairn]], Scotland. However, according to the ''Dictionary of American Family Names'', the surname is more likely a [[patronymic]] name derived from the name ''Geddie''.&lt;ref name="Geddes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Geddes-family-history.ashx|title=Geddes Name Meaning and History|accessdate=14 December 2008|work=[[Ancestry.com]]}} This webpage cites ''Dictionary of American Family Names'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-508137-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This name (''Geddie''), may be an altered form of MacAdam. In this way, the letter ''G'' represents the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''mac'' "son of" and ''Eddie'' is a variant of [[Adam]]. ''Geddie'' may also be a [[nickname]] meaning "greedy", derived from ''gedd'' meaning "pike", this could also refer to a voracious eater.&lt;ref name="Geddie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Geddie-family-history.ashx|title=Geddie Name Meaning and History|accessdate=14 December 2008|work=[[Ancestry.com]]}} This webpage cites ''Dictionary of American Family Names'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-508137-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest written record of the surname ''Geddes'' is of William ''Ged'', from [[Shropshire]], England, recorded within the [[Pipe Rolls]] in the year 1230.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reaney |first=Percy Hilde |author2=Wilson, Richard Middlewood |title=A Dictionary of English Surnames |format=[[pdf]] |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-203-99355-1 |page=1295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surname Geddes can be represented in Scottish Gaelic as ''Geadasach'' and ''Geadais''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mac an Tàilleir, Iain |title=Ainmean Pearsanta |url=http://www2.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gaidhlig/faclair/cuspair/Ainmean_pearsanta.docx |work=[[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig]] |publisher= |accessdate=15 October 2009 |format=[[docx]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gaelic-English Dictionary |last=Mark |first=Colin |year=2003 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-203-27706-6 |format=[[pdf]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geographic names board''' is an official body established by a government to decide on official names for geographical areas and features.

Most countries have such a body, which is commonly (but not always) known under this name. Also, in some countries (especially those organised on a federal basis), subdivisions such as individual states or provinces will have individual boards.

[[China]] has great [[physical diversity]]. The eastern plains and southern coasts of the country consist of fertile lowlands and foothills and is the location of most of China's agricultural output and human population. The southern areas of the country (South of the Yangtze River) consist of hilly and mountainous terrain. The west and north of the country are dominated by sunken [[drainage basin|basin]]s (such as the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and the [[Taklamakan]]), rolling [[plateau]]s, and towering [[massif]]s. It contains part of the highest [[tableland]] on earth, the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and has much lower agricultural potential and population.

&lt;!-- Background and nowadays human geography: --&gt;
Traditionally, the Chinese population centered on the [[Central Plain (China)|Chinese central plain]] and oriented itself toward its own enormous inland market, developing as an imperial power whose center lay in the middle and lower reaches of the [[Yellow River]] on the northern plains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} More recently, the {{convert|18000|km|abbr=on}} coastline has been used extensively for export-oriented trade, causing the coastal provinces to become the leading economic center.

&lt;!-- Area:--&gt;
The People's Republic of China has an area of about {{convert|9600000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about [[Political Status of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Aksai Chin]], the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]], and [[South Tibet]]. The area of the People's Republic of China is {{convert|9596960|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} according to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] ''The World Factbook''.&lt;ref name="CIA Factbook China"/&gt; The People's Republic of China is either the [[Largest countries|third or fourth largest country in the world]], being either slightly larger or slightly smaller than the [[United States]] depending on how the area of the United States is measured. Both countries are smaller than [[Russia]] and [[Canada]] and larger than [[Brazil]].

==Physical geography==


=== Generalities ===
[[File:China Traditional Divisions.png|thumb|400px|Traditional physical and cultural divisions of China]]
[[Image:China topography full res.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Topographic map of China]]
The [[topography]] of China has been divided by the Chinese government into five homogeneous physical macro-regions, namely Eastern China (subdivided into the northeast plain, north plain, and southern hills), Xinjiang-Mongolia, and the Tibetan highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Communist China Map Folio|author=CIA|publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency |date=October 1967 |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/china_map_folio/txu-oclc-588534-54922-10-67-text.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is diverse with snow-capped mountains, deep river valleys, broad basins, high plateaus, rolling plains, terraced hills, sandy dunes with many other geographic features and other landforms present in myriad variations. In general, the land is high in the west and descends to the east coast. Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent) and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country's land surface.  Most of the country's arable land and population are based in lowland plains (12 percent) and [[structural basin|basins]] (19 percent), though some of the greatest basins are filled with deserts. The country's rugged terrain presents problems for the construction of [[Transportation in the People's Republic of China|overland transportation infrastructure]] and requires extensive terracing to sustain [[agriculture in China|agriculture]], but is conducive to the development of [[forestry]], [[mineral]] and [[hydropower]] resources, and [[tourism in China|tourism]].

=== Eastern China ===

;Northeast plain
Northeast of Shanhaiguan a narrow sliver of flat coastal land opens up into the vast [[Manchurian Plain]]. The plains extend north to the crown of the "Chinese rooster," near where the [[Greater Khingan|Greater]] and [[Lesser Khingan|Lesser Hinggan]] ranges converge.  The [[Changbai Mountains]] to the east divide China from the Korean peninsula. Compared with the rest of the area of China, here live the most Chinese people due to its adequate climate and topography.

;North plain
The [[Taihang Mountains]] form the western side of the triangular [[North China Plain]]. The other two sides are the Pacific coast to the east and the Yangtze River to the southwest. The vertices of this triangle are Beijing to the north, Shanghai to the southeast, and Yichang to the southwest.  This alluvial plain, fed by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, is one of the most heavily populated regions of China.  The only mountains in the plain are the [[Mount Tai|Taishan]] in Shandong and [[Dabie Mountains]] of Anhui.

Beijing, at the north tip of the North China Plain, is shielded by the intersection of the Taihang and [[Yan Mountains]]. Further north are the drier grasslands of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, traditionally home to pastoralists. To the south are agricultural regions, traditionally home to sedentary populations.  The Great Wall of China was built in the mountains across the mountains that mark the southern edge of the Inner Mongolian Plateau. The Ming-era walls run over {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} east to west from Shanhaiguan on the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]] coast to the [[Hexi Corridor]] in Gansu.

East of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], deeply folded mountains fan out toward the [[Sichuan Basin]], which is ringed by mountains with 1,000–3,000 m elevation.  The floor of the basin has an average elevation of 500 m and is home to one of the most densely farmed and populated regions of China.  The Sichuan Basin is capped in the north by the eastward continuation of the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun range]], the [[Qinling]], and the [[Daba Mountains|Dabashan]].  The Qinling and Dabashan ranges form a major north-south divide across [[China Proper]], the traditional core area of China.  Southeast of the Tibetan Plateau and south of the Sichuan Basin is the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]], which occupies much of southwest China.  This plateau, with an average elevation of 2,000 m, is known for its limestone [[karst]] landscape.

South of the Yangtze, the landscape is more rugged.  Like Shanxi Province to the north, [[Hunan]] and [[Jiangxi]] each have a provincial core in a river basin that is surrounded by mountains.  The [[Wuling Mountains|Wuling]] range separates Guizhou from Hunan.  The Luoxiao and [[Jinggang Mountains|Jinggang]] divide Hunan from Jiangxi, which is separated from Fujian by the [[Wuyi Mountains]].  The southeast coastal provinces, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong, have rugged coasts, with pockets of lowland and mountainous interior.  The [[Nanling Mountains|Nanling]], an east-west mountain range across northern Guangdong, seals off Hunan and Jiangxi from Guangdong.

===Xinjiang-Mongolia===

Northwest of the Tibetan Plateau, between the northern slope of Kunlun and southern slope of Tian Shan, is the vast [[Tarim Basin]] of [[Xinjiang]], which contains the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. The Tarim Basin, the largest in China, measures {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west and {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south at its widest parts. Average elevation in the basin is 1,000 m. To the east, the basin descends into the [[Turpan Depression|Hami-Turpan Depression]] of eastern Xinjiang, where the dried lake bed of [[Lake Ayding]], at −154m below sea level, is the lowest surface point in China and [[List of countries by lowest point|the third-lowest in the world]]. With temperatures that have reached 49.6 C., the lake bed ranks as one of the hottest places in China. North of Tian Shan is Xinjiang's second great basin, the [[Dzungaria|Junggar]], which contains the [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]]. The Junggar Basin is enclosed to the north by the [[Altay Mountains]], which separate Xinjiang from Russia and Mongolia.

Northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, the [[Altun Shan]]-[[Qilian Mountains]] range branches off the Kunlun and creates a parallel mountain range running east-west. In between in northern Qinghai is the [[Qaidam Basin]], with elevations of 2,600–3,000 m and numerous brackish and salt lakes. North of the Qilian is [[Hexi Corridor]] of Gansu, a natural passage between Xinjiang and [[China Proper]] that was part of the ancient [[Silk Road]] and traversed by modern highway and rail lines to Xinjiang. Further north, the [[Mongolian Plateau|Inner Mongolian Plateau]], between 900–1,500 m in elevation, arcs north up the spine of China and becomes the [[Greater Hinggan]] Range of [[Northeast China]].

Between the Qinling and the Inner Mongolian Plateau is [[Loess Plateau]], the largest of its kind in the world, covering {{convert|650000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Shaanxi]], parts of [[Gansu]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces, and some of [[Ningxia]]-Hui Autonomous Region. The plateau is 1,000–1,500m in elevation and is filled with loess, a yellowish, loose soil that travels easily in the wind. Eroded loess silt gives the [[Yellow River]] its color and name. The Loess Plateau is bound to the east by the Luliang Mountain of Shanxi, which has a narrow basin running north to south along the Fen River. Further east are the [[Taihang Mountains]] of Hebei, the dominant topographical feature of [[North China]].

;Highlands
The [[List of highest mountains|world's tallest mountains]], the [[Karakorum]], [[Pamirs]] and [[Tian Shan]] divide China from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. Eleven of the seventeen tallest mountain peaks on Earth are located on China's western borders. They include the world's tallest peak [[Mt. Everest]] (8848 m) in the [[Himalayas]] on the border with Nepal and the world's second tallest peak, [[K2]] (8611 m) on the border with [[Pakistan]].  From these towering heights in the west, the land descends in steps like a terrace.

North of the Himalayas and east of the Karakorum/Pamirs is the vast [[Tibetan Plateau]], the largest and highest plateau in the world, also known as the "Roof of the World." The plateau has an average elevation of 4,000 meters above sea level and covers an area of 2.5 million square kilometers, or about one-fifth of China's land mass.  In the north, the plateau is hemmed in by the [[Kunlun Mountains]], which extends eastward from the intersection of the Pamirs, Karakorum and Tian Shan.

;Tallest mountain peaks
Besides Mt. Everest and K2, the other 9 of the world's 17 tallest peaks on China's western borders are: [[Lhotse]] (8516 m, 4th highest), [[Makalu]] (8485 m, 5th), [[Cho Oyu]] (8188 m, 6th), [[Gyachung Kang]] (7952 m, 15th) of the Himalayas on the border with [[Nepal]] and [[Gasherbrum I]] (8080 m, 11th), [[Broad Peak]] (8051 m, 12th), [[Gasherbrum II]] (8035 m, 13th), [[Gasherbrum III]] (7946 m, 16th) and [[Gasherbrum IV]] (7932 m, 17th) of the Karakorum on the border with [[Pakistan]]. The tallest peak entirely within China is [[Shishapangma]] (8013 m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in [[Nyalam County]] of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].  In all, 9 of the 14 mountain peaks in the world over 8,000 m are in or on the border of China.  Another notable Himalayan peak in China is [[Namchabarwa]] (7782 m, 28th), near the great bend of the Yarlungtsanpo (upper [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]) River in eastern Tibet, and considered to be the eastern anchor of the Himalayas.

Outside the Himalayas and Karakorum, China's tallest peaks are [[Kongur Tagh]] (7649 m, 37th) and [[Muztagh Ata]] (7546 m, 43rd) in the Pamirs of western [[Xinjiang]], [[Gongga Shan]] (7556 m, 41st) in the [[Daxue Mountain|Great Snowy Mountains]] of western [[Sichuan]]; and [[Jengish Chokusu|Tömür Shan]] (7439 m, 60th), the highest peak of Tian Shan, on the border with [[Kyrgyzstan]].

[[File:China rivers.svg|thumb|left|Main rivers of China]]
China originally had an estimated number of 50,000 rivers. However, due to statistical discrepancies, water and soil loss, and climate change, there are currently only an estimated 22,000 rivers remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/04/28-000-rivers-disappeared-in-china-what-happened/275365/|title=28,000 Rivers Disappeared in China: What Happened?|last=Miao|first=Angel Hsu, William|date=2013-04-29|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers in China have a total length of 420,000 kilometers. 1,500 have a catchment area exceeding 1,000 square kilometers. The majority of rivers flow west to east into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Yangtze]] (Chang Jiang) rises in [[Tibet]], flows through [[Central China]] and enters the [[East China Sea]] near [[Shanghai]]. The Yangtze is 6,300 kilometers long and has a catchment area of 1.8 million square kilometers. It is the third longest river in the world, after the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and the [[Nile]]. The second longest river in China is the Huang He ([[Yellow River]]). It rises in Tibet and travels circuitously for 5,464 kilometers through [[North China]], it empties into the [[Bo Hai Gulf]] on the north coast of the [[Shandong]] Province. It has a catchment area of 752,000 square kilometers. The [[Heilongjiang]] (Heilong or [[Black Dragon River]]) flows for 3,101 kilometers in [[Northeast China]] and an additional 1,249 kilometers in [[Russia]], where it is known as the [[Amur River|Amur]]. The longest river in [[Northern and southern China|South China]] is the Zhujiang ([[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]), which is 2,214 kilometers long. Along with its three [[tributaries]], the Xi (West), Dong (East), and Bei (North) rivers, it forms the [[Pearl River Delta]] near [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhuhai]], [[Macau]], and [[Hong Kong]]. Other major rivers are the [[Liaohe]] in the northeast, [[Haihe]] in the north, [[Qiantang River|Qiantang]] in the east, and [[Lancang River|Lancang]] in the southwest.

[[File:West Lake at night in Hangzhou.jpg|thumb|250px|[[West Lake]] in [[Hangzhou]], at night]]
Inland drainage involving upland basins in the north and northeast accounts for 40 percent of the country's total drainage area. Many rivers and streams flow into lakes or diminish in the [[desert]]. Some are used for [[irrigation]].

China's territorial waters are principally marginal seas of the western Pacific Ocean. These waters lie on the indented [[coastline]] of the mainland and approximately 5,000 [[island]]s. The [[Yellow Sea]], [[East China Sea]], and [[South China Sea]] are marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean. More than half the coastline, predominantly in the south, is rocky; most of the remainder is sandy. The [[Bay of Hangzhou]] roughly divides the two kinds of [[shoreline]].

; Northern plain
There is a steep drop in the river level in the [[North China Plain]], where the river continues across the delta, it transports a heavy load of sand and mud which is deposited on the flat plain. The flow is aided by manmade [[Levee|embankments]]. As a result, the river flows on a raised ridge fifty meters above the plain. Waterlogging, floods, and course changes have recurred over the centuries. Traditionally, rulers were judged by their concern for or indifference to preservation of the embankments.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the modern era, China has undertaken extensive flood control and conservation measures.

Flowing from its source in the Qingzang highlands, the Yellow River courses toward the sea through the North China Plain, the historic center of Chinese expansion and influence. [[Han Chinese]] people have farmed the rich alluvial soils since ancient times, constructing the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] for north-south transport during the [[History of China|Imperial Era]]. The plain is a continuation of the [[Dongbei]] (Manchurian) Plain to the northeast but is separated from it by the [[Bohai Gulf]], an extension of the Yellow Sea.

Like other densely populated areas of China, the plain is subject to floods and earthquakes. The mining and industrial center of [[Tangshan]], {{convert|165|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Beijing, was leveled by an earthquake in July 1976, it was believed to be the largest earthquake of the 20th century by death toll.

The [[Hai River]], like the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]], flows from west to east. Its upper course consists of five rivers that converge near [[Tianjin]], then flow seventy kilometers before emptying into the [[Bohai Gulf]]. The [[Huai River]], rises in [[Henan]] Province and flows through several lakes before joining the Pearl River near [[Yangzhou]].

; East and Yangtze
The [[Qin Mountains]], a continuation of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], divides the North China Plain from the [[Yangtze River Delta]] and is the major physiographic boundary between the two great parts of [[China Proper]]. It is a cultural boundary as it influences the distribution of customs and language. South of the Qinling mountain range divide are the densely populated and highly developed areas of the lower and middle plains of the [[Yangtze River]] and, on its upper reaches, the [[Sichuan Basin]], an area encircled by a high barrier of mountain ranges.

The country's longest and most important waterway, the Yangtze River, is navigable for the majority of its length and has a vast [[hydroelectric]] potential. Rising on the Qingzang Plateau, the Yangtze River traverses {{convert|6300|km|mi|abbr=on}} through the heart of the country, draining an area of {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} before emptying into the East China Sea. Roughly 300 million people live along its middle and lower reaches. The area is a large producer of rice and wheat. The Sichuan Basin, due to its mild, humid climate and long growing season, produces a variety of crops. It is a leading [[silk]]-producing area and an important industrial region with substantial [[mineral resources]].

The [[Nanling Mountains]], the southernmost of the east-west mountain ranges, overlook areas in China with a [[tropical climate]]. The climate allows two crops of rice to be grown per year. Southeast of the mountains lies a coastal, hilly region of small deltas and narrow valley plains. The drainage area of the Pearl River and its associated network of rivers occupies much of the region to the south. West of the Nanling, the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]] rises in two steps, averaging 1,200 and 1,800 m in elevation, respectively, toward the precipitous mountain regions of the eastern Qingzang Plateau.

=== Geology and natural resources ===
[[File:China fuels 1983.jpg|thumb|250px|Energy and mineral resources]]
China has substantial [[mineral reserve]]s and is the world’s largest producer of [[antimony]], [[natural graphite]], [[tungsten]], and [[zinc]]. Other major minerals are [[aluminum]], [[bauxite]], [[coal]], [[crude petroleum]], [[diamonds]], [[gold]], [[iron ore]], [[lead]], [[magnetite]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[natural gas]], [[phosphate rock]], [[tin]], [[uranium]], and [[vanadium]]. China’s [[hydropower]] potential is the largest in the world.

===Land use===
{{main|Land use in China}}
Based on 2005 estimates, 14.86% (about {{convert|1400000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}) of China’s total land area is [[arable land|arable]]. About 1.3% (some 116,580&amp;nbsp;km²) is planted to permanent [[crops]] and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap [[harvest]]s that are sufficient to feed the world’s largest population and still have surplus for [[export]]. An estimated 544,784&amp;nbsp;km² of land were [[irrigated]] in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as [[pasture]], and 17.5% was [[forest]].

===Wildlife===
{{main article|Wildlife of China}}
China lies in two of the world's major [[ecozone]]s, the [[Palearctic]] and the [[Indomalaya]]. In the Palearctic zone mammals such as the [[horse]], [[camel]], and [[jerboa]] are found. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the [[leopard cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various other species of monkeys and apes. Some overlap exists between the two regions because of natural dispersal and migration, and deer or antelope, bears, wolves, pigs, and rodents are found in all of the diverse climatic and geological environments. The famous [[giant panda]] is found only in a limited area along the [[Yangtze]].  There is a continuing problem with trade in [[endangered species]], although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.

==Human geography==

=== History ===
[[Image:China-Historic macro areas.svg|left|thumb|300px|The Central plain, visible in dark orange]]
Chinese history is often explained in terms of several strategic areas, defined by particular topographic limits. Starting from the [[Central Plain (China)|Chinese central plain]], the former heart of the Han populations, the Han people expanded militarily and then demographically toward the [[Loess Plateau]], the [[Sichuan Basin]], and the Southern Hills (as defined by the map on the left), not without resistance from local populations. Pushed by its comparatively higher demographic growth, the Han continued their expansion by military and demographic waves. The [[Lingnan|far-south]] of present-day China, the northern parts of today's Vietnam, and the [[Tarim Basin]] were first reached and durably subdued by the [[Han dynasty]]'s armies. The Northern steppes were always the source of invasions into China, which culminated in the 13th century by Mongolian conquest of the whole China and creation of Mongolian Yuan dynasty. [[Manchuria]], much of today's [[Northeast China]], and [[Korean Peninsula]] were usually not under Chinese control, with the exception of some limited periods of occupation. Manchuria became strongly integrated into the Chinese empire during the late [[Qing dynasty]], while the west side of the [[Changbai Mountains]], formerly the home of Korean tribes, thus also entered China.

{{see also|Demographics of China#Population density and distribution}}
The demographic occupation follows the topography and availability of former arable lands. The [[Heihe–Tengchong Line]], running from [[Heihe]], [[Heilongjiang]] to [[Tengchong County]], [[Yunnan]] divides China into two roughly equal sections–in terms of geographic area, with areas west of the line being sparsely settled and areas east densely populated, in general. Today there are 5 major religions that have been recognized by the state; Buddhism, Taoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam. Buddhism and folk religions account for roughly 21% of the population while protestants make up 5% and Islam 1.6% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religion-china|title=The State of Religion in China|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial number of Buddhists live in the southwestern Tibetan region of the country which borders Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan and most notably India, the birthplace of Buddhism. The Islamic population, consisting mostly of Hui and Uighur Muslims, is concentrated in the northwestern Xinjiang region of the country which shares borders with Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/new-religious-breakdown-in-china-14|title=This fascinating map shows the new religious breakdown in China|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Regional economic strategies of the People's Republic of China}}
[[Economy of China|China's economy]] has recently become export-oriented. The coastal provinces got the greatest benefits from the recent development of China's economy, becoming the new economic center of China. The Chinese leadership has long encouraged a move inland, and in 2012, following the western crisis, the top leadership announced a policy to redirect Chinese production toward the national market.

=== Administrative geography ===
[[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Chinese administrative geography]] was drawn mainly during the 1949 and 1954 administrative reorganizations. These reorganizations have been the source of much debate within China. In addition, a parcel of land was ceded from Guangdong to Guangxi to grant the latter immediate access to the Gulf of Tonkin, while Hainan was split from Guangdong in 1988 and Chongqing from Sichuan in 1997.

=== Agriculture ===
China has followed the same path as many other countries in respect to agriculture. As the country continues to industrialize, the share of agriculture as a part of China's GDP has lowered to 11% in recent years. This is an unsurprising occurrence for most countries going through industrialization. As agriculture generally decreases, manufacturing and service increase. Of the enormous labor force in China, 27.7% work in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: China — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's primary agricultural import is wheat from Argentina, Australia, Canada, and France. They import about four to five million metric tons of wheat per year and they are able to buy the wheat for about $70 per ton, making wheat China's most important agricultural import. On the other hand, China's most important agricultural export is rice. China exports about 750,000 metric tons of rice per year for about $120 per ton. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/651886?Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=china&amp;searchText=agriculture&amp;searchText=imports&amp;searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?Query=china+agriculture+imports&amp;refreqid=search:89fd5f588009c5d5858552b0e9a122bd&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|title=Why China Imports Wheat|website=www.jstor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant agricultural exports from China are potatoes, corn, tobacco, peanuts, tea, apples, cotton, pork, mutton, eggs, fish, and shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: China — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Bank, as of 2015, China’s total arable land was estimated at 119,000,000 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.ARBL.HA?end=2015&amp;locations=CN&amp;start=1961&amp;view=chart|title=Arable land (hectares) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2005, arable land in China has been on the decline and the total arable land per citizen has reached .2 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-feeding-china/|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a percentage, agricultural land makes up about 54.7% of land. The climate of the country is difficult to describe because it varies so much depending on the region of China. The southernmost parts of the country are almost tropical, while the northernmost part is subarctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: China — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{PRC provinces imagemap}}

=== Territory ===
The territory of China has been defined as a homeland for many different ethnic and racial groups in the country. However, the way that the territory has been defined varies between ethnic groups. In relation to the Han Chinese, the homeland has been defined by national borders which are more or less accepted internationally. This is because the Han Chinese are the largest population and have most influence politically than any other ethnic population in China. To the Han Chinese population, the territory of the country is defined by the regions of Tibet, inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and the Xinjiang Province which is the most western land of China. The Chinese territory is the second largest in land area and also has the longest combined land border in the world. However, there are many other ethnic groups in China that have their own definitions of what concerns the territory of China.

One group of people in China are the Tibetans. Tibetans and the land of Tibet are considered by the Han Chinese government to be part of China and that the territory of Tibet is also part of the country. However, many Tibetans disagree and are protesting as well as rallying for freedom in present day. To this ethnic population, the territory of Tibet is not considered part of China and so is not defined as a Chinese territory. However, the Chinese government still consider Tibet as a territory of China which reflects the dispute in definition of Chinese territory between two ethnic groups.

Another group of people which have a dispute in definition of territory are the Taiwanese. The Taiwanese people inhabit the island of Taiwan and are markedly politically different as the people of Taiwan have a free market capitalist based economy while the mainland Chinese government employ a communistic state run economy. There are disputes in the definition of territory between Taiwan and China as the Chinese government claims ownership over Taiwan while the Taiwanese people maintain that they are a sovereign state completely independent from the mainland Chinese government. These disputes have led to international controversy as many countries such as the United States of America have not officially recognized the sovereignty of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Jae Ho|date=2017-09-21|title=China Goes Local (Again)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002|journal=Columbia University Press|doi=10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Central Asia
China's borders have more than {{convert|20000|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of land frontier shared with nearly all the nations of mainland [[East Asia]], and have been disputed at a number of points. In the western sector, China claimed portions of the {{convert|41000|km²|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[Pamir Mountains]] area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], the former [[Soviet Union]], and China meet in [[Central Asia]]. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The {{convert|6542|km|0}} frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Heilongjiang]] along segments of the [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun River]], [[Amur River]], and [[Ussuri River]]. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. In a September 1986 speech in [[Vladivostok]], the Soviet leader [[Mikhail S. Gorbachev]] offered the Chinese a more conciliatory position on Sino-Soviet border issues. In 1987 the two sides resumed border talks that had been broken off after the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] (see [[Sino-Soviet relations]]). Although the border issue remained unresolved as of late 1987, China and the Soviet Union agreed to consider the northeastern sector first. In October 2004, China signed an agreement with [[Russia]] on the [[delimitation]] of their entire {{convert|4300|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}-long border, which had long been in dispute.

;Southern border
Eastward from [[Bhutan]] and north of the [[Brahmaputra River]] (Yarlung Zangbo Jiang) lies a large area controlled and administered by India but claimed by the Chinese. The area was demarcated by the British [[McMahon Line]], drawn along the Himalayas in 1914 as the Sino-Indian border; India accepts and China rejects this boundary. In June 1980 China made its first move in twenty years to settle the border disputes with India, proposing that India cede the Aksai Chin area in Jammu and Kashmir to China in return for China's recognition of the McMahon Line; India did not accept the offer, however, preferring a sector-by-sector approach to the problem. In July 1986 China and India held their seventh round of border talks, but they made little headway toward resolving the dispute. Each side, but primarily India, continued to make allegations of incursions into its territory by the other. Most of the mountainous and militarized boundary with India is still in dispute, but Beijing and [[New Delhi]] have committed to begin resolution with discussions on the least disputed middle sector. India does not recognize Pakistan’s ceding lands to China in a 1964 boundary agreement.

The China-Burma border issue was settled October 1, 1960, by the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The first joint inspection of the border was completed successfully in June 1986.

India: On May 15, 2015, Mr. Li from China and Mr. Modi from India held talks at the Great Hall of the people during Modi's China tour. The two leaders held talks on border disputes that began in 1914 when the British still controlled India and signed an agreement with Tibet to make the McMahon line the de-facto boundary between India and China, even though China had rejected this agreement. Both countries had various claims to disputed territories such as the South Tibetan region of Zangnan which is considered to be part of the Arunachal Pradesh state in India. So far there have been only talks and no solutions and tensions continue to rise as each country continues to increase regional influences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-32747667|title=India and China 'to resolve dispute'|date=2015-05-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Seas

China is involved in a complex dispute with [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], and possibly [[Brunei]] over the [[Spratly (Nansha) Islands]] in the South China Sea. The 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea" eased tensions but fell short of a [[legally binding]] [[code of conduct]] desired by several of the disputants. China also controls the [[Paracel (Xisha) Islands]], which are also claimed by Vietnam, and asserts a claim to the [[Japan]]ese-administered [[Senkaku Islands|Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands]] in the East China Sea.

South China Sea: On June 16, 2011, the Chinese government sent out one of its largest patrol ships known as the Haixun-31 which the Chinese government describe as routine. The ship will pass the Paracel and Spratly Islands and make its way up from the Malaysian to Filipino coast. Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia all have competing claims to the Spratlys Islands while Beijing and Hanoi are in dispute over the Paracel islands. Hanoi has proposed a multilateral solution between the Asian countries but China says that it prefers to negotiate with individual states separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13796958|title=China sends ship to disputed sea|date=2011-06-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Border Security ====
The security and strength of the Chinese borders vary depending on the location of the section of the border in question. This is due to the nature of the borders as well as the physical geography of the country. China has a large territory, about the same size as the United States, but the actual distribution of population is highly disproportionate. Sixty percent of the population live on the east coast of China which is only 22 percent of its territory while the other 78 percent lying inland is sparsely populated with ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other Chinese Muslim groups. Many of these groups have little to no loyalty to the central government of China further adding to the strained security of China's borders. The regions of Xinjiang and Tibet in particular harbor strong separatist movements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Jae Ho|date=2017-09-21|title=China Goes Local (Again)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002|journal=Columbia University Press|doi=10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibet: Many Tibetans protest and actively support the Dalai Lama who lives in exile in what he calls "autonomous Tibet". The Chinese authorities charge him of promoting Tibetan independence and will not allow him to come back into the country or he will face arrest. In May 2018, a Tibetan activist known as Tashi Wangchuk was sentenced to prison for 5 years as he voiced his concerns over that Tibetan culture was being destroyed by the Chinese government. Amnesty International denounced this sentencing to be "beyond absurd" but his release is still dated to be in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-44207981|title=Tibet activist jailed after NYT video|date=2018-05-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xinjiang: In the region of Xinjiang, Uighur separatists have engaged in acts of violence to promote independence. These Chinese Muslims have garnered support from neighboring areas in central Asia and Turkey both politically and economically. However, many of these efforts have been shut down by Chinese officials. The Xinjiang region is facing large scale immigration of Han Chinese people but the Uighurs still make up 8 out of the 19 million inhabitants. In August 2018, a UN human rights panel cited "creditable reports" that more than one million people in the region were being held in counter extremism centers in Xinjiang but Chinese officials claimed that only "religious extremist" Uighurs were undergoing re-education and resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16860974|title=Xinjiang profile|date=2018-10-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China-Russia Relations: China and the Soviet Union signed an alliance in 1950 building on their communist relations that dated back to the 1920's. In the wake of the 1960's Sino-Soviet split, and for 25 years after the split, the border between China and Russia was one of the most unfriendly borders in the world. At one point over "one and a half million troops armed with nuclear weapons" were installed along the two sides of the border. Relations improved in the mid 1980's but this is due to Russia's decrease in power and threat to the Chinese government. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Jae Ho|date=2017-09-21|title=China Goes Local (Again)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002|journal=Columbia University Press|doi=10.7312/columbia/9780231176200.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to China's ancient history and central location in the geography of Asia, it is surrounded by potential enemies and many complicated rivalries. The government plays the fine line between domination and cooperation in order to preserve their national identity and borders. However, due to the nature of their political geography, the borders are very much volatile and disputes continue to exist in different areas of the border.

Tajikistan: On January 13, 2011, the country of Tajikistan agrees to cede land to the Chinese government. The Tajik parliament voted to ratify a 1999 deal to cede 1000 square kilometers of land in the remote Pamir Mountain range which the Chinese claim thoroughly resolved the century long border dispute. China is the largest investor in the Tajik economy especially in the energy and infrastructure sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567|title=Tajikistan cedes land to China|date=2011|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government Structure ==
The structure of government in China is in the framework of a socialist republic which is run by a single party: the Communist Party of China. The party wishes to control and manage the ideology of their subjects to maintain their political dominance in China. For example, Document number 9, or the Communiqué on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere, was a document circulated in China in 2013 to warn the citizens of China against some western values such as media freedom. The president of China is the highest position of the country and is the ceremonial figurehead of the National People's Congress. Currently Xi Jinping is the president of China and the chairman of the Central military commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03|title=Implementation Regulations of the People's Republic of China Drug Management Law|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2753/clg0009-4609450202|journal=Chinese Law &amp; Government|volume=45|issue=2|pages=30–49|doi=10.2753/clg0009-4609450202|issn=0009-4609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government is divided into three primary groups of state power: the National People's Congress (NPC), the President, and the State Council. Members of the State Council include the Premier, four vice premiers, five state councilors and 29 heads of State Council commissions. Under the Chinese constitution, the National Peoples congress holds the most power and meets annually for 2 weeks to discuss and review legislative policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.31227/osf.io/5ncpe|title=Studi Literasi Menggunakan Endnote Dan Aplikasi Pembantu (Google Translator, Google Cendikia, Google Sites, Chemoffice 2008, e-learning,  dan Snipping Tool)|last=Zainul|first=Rahadian|date=2018-08-16|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As China has only one dominant party, the spatial patterns of voting and election results are favoring the dominant communist party. However, the country still has some other variables and variations in the divisions of administration. Local government is divided into four levels of hierarchy. Local government includes township, county, prefecture or municipality, and the province as the scope of government increases. China also has a system of autonomous regions intended to give more control to ethnic minorities who preside in those regions. In practice however, the power still remains with the party secretary while the local chairman is the nominal head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chapter 4: Local Party Government|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3726/978-3-653-05128-5/13|work=Local Government Institutionalization in Hungary|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631657348|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imperialism ==

==== Japan ====
Historically there have been instances of imperialism in China. Japan had invaded and conquered much of Manchuria and Coastal cities in China in the Sino-Japanese war. Cities such as Nanjing and Hong Kong were devastated by Japanese forces with actions such as massacre and rape of civilians was rampant. This imperialism and invasion of Japanese forces still leads to tensions in modern day. For example in April 2005, a Japanese junior high textbook minimized the atrocities of Nanjing stating that the massacre was an "incident". The textbooks transgression sent thousands of Chinese citizens out to protest and three weeks of state sanctioned protest led to rising tensions between Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MISSING-VALUE|first=MISSING-VALUE|title=The pre-recognition period (1949–1972)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315568379-2|work=Australia—China Relations post 1949|pages=9–36|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315568379|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hong Kong and Britain ====
Due to the opium wars between the British from 1839 to 1842, the British were able to make demands to the Chinese government before removing blockades and stopping bombardment on key ports. The Chinese agreed to cede the island of Hong Kong which in the control of the British, witnessed phenomenal growth. The population grew from 1,500 to 19,000 by 1844. In 1860 in the wake of the Second Opium war, the Peking convention was signed which ceded to Britain the Kowloon peninsula (up to Boundary Street) and Ngon Sun Chau, which was a part of mainland China. With the end of world war 2 however, the British lost control of the colonies and in 1997, the colony of Hong Kong was returned to the control of communist mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/hongkong.htm|title=Hong Kong Colony|website=www.britishempire.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trade Agreements ==
China has bilateral investment agreements with 100+ countries and economies. China’s bilateral investment agreements cover expropriation, arbitration, and other investment related issues. These bilateral agreements are generally much weaker than investment treaties that the United States would want to negotiate. China also maintains 14 free trade agreements(FTA's) and is currently implementing an additional 8 FTA's. China's FTA partners are ASEAN, Singapore, Pakistan, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, Iceland, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Australia, and Korea. These trade agreements exist to maintain and organize business and trade with various countries in order to improve and expand the economy of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.export.gov/article|title=export.gov|website=www.export.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
China in 2017, was reported to have a population of 1,379,302,711&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: China — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In October 2015, China changed the long standing 1979 law that allowed each couple to have "one child". So that there would be enough youth to support the old, the government began to allow couples to have 2 children. With this rule, the birth rate increased to 12.3 births/1,000 population,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the death rate is reported to be 7.8 deaths/ 1,000 population&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Established in 2017, the current population growth is at a .41%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The current infant mortality total rate is 11.8 deaths/1,000 live births&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. For females the rate is 11.4 deaths/1,000 live births&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, and the males stand at 12.2 deaths/ 1,000 live births&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In 2015 it was established that the maternal mortality rate is 27 deaths/ 100,000 live births&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. For both infant and maternal mortality rates, China stands at 118 in comparison to the world&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The people of China are beginning to move from the rural farming areas to the business centered cities. The rate of urbanization from 2015 to 2018 is at a 2.42% annual rate of change&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. China currently has an urban population of 59.3%&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The most populated urban areas are: Shanghai 25.582 million&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, Tianjin 13.215 million&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, Guangdong 12.683 million&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;,19.618 million Beijing (capital)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, 11.908 million Shenzhen&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, 14.838 million Chongqing&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The life expectancy at birth for the total population stands at 75.7 years&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. While men are averaged out at 73.6 years&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, the woman of China are reported to have the life expectancy of 78 years&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Age Structure ====
[[File:Population_pyramid_of_China_2016.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Population_pyramid_of_China_2016.png|thumb|Shows the age structure of China]]
Below a 2016 population pyramid illustrates the population age structure throughout China. It can be observed that the youth of China is significantly lower than the working class. However, there is enough people in the working class to support the elders at the time. This can help prove physically the reasoning and push to change the "one child" 1979 law, to two.

=== Climate ===
{{See also|Hot summer cold winter zone}}
[[File:China Köppen.svg|thumb|380px|[[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen climate]] types of China]]
Owing to tremendous differences in latitude, longitude, and altitude, the [[climate]] of China is extremely diverse, ranging from [[Tropical climate|tropical]] in the far south to [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] in the far north and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] in the higher elevations of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. [[Monsoon]] winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the [[East Asian Monsoon]] carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the [[Siberian anticyclone]] dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account in large degree for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex.

The northern extremities of both [[Heilongjiang]] and [[Inner Mongolia]] have a subarctic climate; in contrast, most of [[Hainan Island]] and parts of the extreme southern fringes of [[Yunnan]] have a tropical climate. Temperature differences in winter are considerable, but in summer the variance is considerably less. For example, [[Mohe County]], Heilongjiang has a 24-hour average temperature in January approaching {{convert|−30|°C}}, while the corresponding figure in July exceeds {{convert|18|°C|0}}. By contrast, most of Hainan has a January mean in excess of {{convert|17|°C|0}}, while the July mean there is generally above {{convert|28|°C}}.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is almost invariably concentrated in the warmer months, though annual totals range from less than {{convert|20|mm|1}} in northwestern [[Qinghai]] and the [[Turpan Depression]] of Xinjiang to easily exceeding {{convert|2000|mm|0}} in [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], and Hainan. Only in some pockets of the [[Dzungaria]] region of Xinjiang is the conspicuous seasonal variation in precipitation that defines Chinese (and, to a large extent, East Asian) climate absent.

Annual sunshine duration ranges from less than 1,100 hours in parts of [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]] to over 3,400 hours in northwestern Qinghai. Seasonal patterns in sunshine vary considerably by region, but overall, [[Northern and southern China|the north]] and the Tibetan Plateau are sunnier than the south of the country.

=== Environment ===
{{main article|Environment of China}}
[[Air pollution]] ([[sulfur dioxide]] particulates) from reliance on [[coal]] is a major issue, along with [[water pollution]] from untreated wastes and use of debated standards of pollutant concentration rather than [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]. There are water shortages, particularly in the north. The eastern part of China often experiences smoke and dense fog in the atmosphere as a result of industrial pollution. Heavy [[deforestation]] with an estimated loss of one-fifth of agricultural land since 1949 to [[soil erosion]] and economic development is occurring with resulting [[desertification]]. 
China is a party to the [[Antarctic-Environmental Protocol]], the [[Antarctic Treaty]], the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Global warming|Climate Change]] treaty, the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], the [[Endangered Species]] treaty, the Hazardous Wastes treaty, the [[Admiralty law|Law of the Sea]], the International Tropical Timber Agreements of [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]] and [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], and agreements on Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, [[MARPOL 73/78|Ship Pollution]], and Wetlands protection. China has signed, but not ratified, the [[Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] (but is not yet required to reduce its carbon emission under the agreement, as is India) and the [[Nuclear Test Ban]] treaty.

[[Colonel]] '''Sir George Everest''' [[Commander of the Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[Fellows of The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|FRAS]] [[FRGS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|v|r|ᵻ|s|t}}; 4 July 1790 – 1 December 1866) was a British surveyor and geographer who served as [[Surveyor General of India]] from 1830 to 1843. He is best known for having [[Mount Everest]], the highest mountain on Earth, named in his honour.

After receiving a military education, Everest joined the [[East India Company]] and arrived in India at the age of 16. He was eventually made an assistant to [[William Lambton]] on the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]], and replaced Lambton as superintendent of the survey in 1823. Everest was largely responsible for surveying the [[meridian arc]] from the southernmost point of India north to [[Nepal]], a distance of about {{convert|2400|km|mi|-2}}, a task which took from 1806 to 1841 to complete. He was made Surveyor General of India in 1830, retiring in 1843 and returning to England.

In 1865, the [[Royal Geographical Society]] renamed Peak XV – at the time only recently identified as the world's highest peak – in Everest's honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Colin|title=Mount Everest – The British Story|url=http://www.everest1953.co.uk/NamingMountEverest.php|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Scott Waugh]], his protégé and successor as surveyor general, had been responsible for putting his name forward in 1856. Everest's name was used as a compromise due to the difficulty of choosing between multiple local names for the mountain. He initially objected to the honour, as he had had nothing to do with its discovery and believed his name was not easily written or pronounced in [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name=BBC_mwde&gt;{{cite news|title=The man who 'discovered' Everest|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3193576.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=9 August 2016|first=Soutik|last=Biswas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See report in 'The Illustrated London News', 15 August 1857&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=1894 | title = Reminiscences and anecdotes of great men of India: both official and non-official for the last one hundred years | editor=Ram Copal Sanyal | page=25 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BYdAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:G Everest grave Hove.jpg|thumb|upright|Everest's grave, [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove]].]]

Everest was educated at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], before joining the [[East India Company]] as a cadet in 1806. He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Bengal Artillery]], and sailed for India the same year.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;
{{cite ODNB|id=9003|title=Everest, Sir George|last=Baigent|first=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everest was a [[Freemason]], initiated (date unknown) in Neptune Lodge, Penang, under the authority of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]]. Later, having returned to England, he joined Prince of Wales's Lodge, London, on 20 February 1829.&lt;ref name="Gila Valley"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gilavalleylodge9.wordpress.com/2010/06/27/freemasons-and-the-royal-society/ | title= Freemasons and the Royal Society | publisher= Gila Valley Lodge No 9|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career in India===
Little is known about Everest's earliest years in India, but he apparently had a talent for mathematics and astronomy. He was seconded to [[British Java|Java]] in 1814, where Lieutenant-Governor [[Stamford Raffles]] appointed him to survey the island. He returned to Bengal in 1816, where he improved British knowledge of the [[Ganges]] and the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]]. He later surveyed a [[semaphore]] line from [[Calcutta]] to [[Benares]], covering approximately {{convert|400|mi|km}}. Everest's work came to the attention of Colonel [[William Lambton]], the leader of the [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] (GTS), who appoint him as his chief assistant. He joined Lambton at [[Hyderabad]] in 1818, where he was in the process of surveying a [[meridian arc]] northward from [[Cape Commorin]]. He was responsible for much of the fieldwork, and in 1820 contracted [[malaria]], necessitating a period of recovery spent at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Everest returned to India in 1821. He succeeded as superintendent of the GTS upon Lambton's death in 1823, and over the following years extended his predecessor's efforts on the arc up to [[Sironj]], in present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Everest suffered from poor health, however, and the effects of fever and rheumatism left him half paralysed. He left for England in 1825, where he spent the following five years recuperating. Everest was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March 1827. Most of his free time was spent lobbying the East India Company for better equipment and studying the methods used by the [[Ordnance Survey]]; he frequently corresponded with [[Thomas Frederick Colby]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

===Surveyor General of India=== 
In June 1830, Everest returned to India to continue his work on the GTS, and was simultaneously appointed [[Surveyor General of India]]. The arc from Cape Commorin to the northern border of British India was finally completed in 1841, under the supervision of [[Andrew Scott Waugh]]. To his dismay, much of his time was spent on administrative concerns, as well as combating criticism from home. The East India Company had provisionally Thomas Jervis as Everest's successor, and Jervis subsequently delivered a series of lectures to the Royal Society on the perceived deficiencies of Everest's methods. In response, Everest penned a series of open letters to [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], the society's president, in which he lambasted the society "for meddling in matters of which they know little". Jervis withdrew from consideration, and Everest successfully secured the appointment of his protégé Waugh as his successor. He resigned in November 1842 and his commission was formally revoked in December 1843, at which point he returned to England.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

===Later life===
In 1847, Everest published ''An Account of the Measurement of Two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India'', for which he was awarded a medal by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. He was later elected to fellowship of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]] and the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. Everest was promoted to [[colonel]] in 1854, made a [[Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in February 1861, and created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in March 1861. He died at his home in [[Hyde Park Gardens]] on 1 December 1866, and was buried in [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church, Hove]], near [[Brighton]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Naming of Mount Everest==
George Everest had no direct connection with the mountain that bears his name, which he never saw. He was, however, responsible for hiring [[Andrew Scott Waugh]], who made the first formal observations of the mountain, and [[Radhanath Sikdar]], who calculated its height. Before its significance was realised, Mount Everest was originally known as Peak "B" and later as Peak XV. In March 1856, Waugh wrote to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] to announce that the mountain was believed to be the highest in the world, and proposed that it be named "after my illustrious predecessor", as it was "without any local name that we can discover" – the "native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal". There were in fact several native names among the [[Nepal]]ese and [[Tibet]]ans, but those areas were closed off to the British at the time and people living further to the south of the Himalayas did not have a specific name for the peak. In the decade after 1856, Waugh's proposal was widely debated by the Royal Geographical Society and similar bodies. Other scholars of India put forward native names that they believed to be correct, such as [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]]'s "Deva-dhunga" and [[Hermann Schlagintweit]]'s "Gaurisankar". Everest himself objected to his name being used, as "the native of India" could not pronounce it and it could not be written in [[Hindi]]. Nonetheless, in 1865 the society officially settled on "Mount Everest" as the name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everest1953.co.uk/naming-mount-everest Naming Mount Everest]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Sir George had several siblings, including two younger brothers.  George's first younger brother was the Rev. Robert Everest, M.A., chaplain to the East India Company and author of ''A Journey Through the United States and Part of Canada''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Journey Through the United States and Part of Canada|last = Everest|first = Robert|publisher = John Chapman: King William Street, Strand, London, 1855.|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His second (his youngest brother) was the Rev. Thomas Roupell Everest, M.A., the father of Mary Everest and a lay [[homeopathy|homoeopath]].

Sir George's third child, Ethel Everest, was an associate of [[Emma Cons]], and friend of [[Lilian Baylis]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Schafer [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U4Y6Jyc0vSAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=ethel+everest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xYbn7nuPPo&amp;sig=bTcQJYQH49BnrY1AWRZm8i67wWI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Udb4VOKeNpDdasKjgpAO&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ethel%20everest&amp;f=false "Lilian Baylis: A Biography"]. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; She provided financial support for the founding of [[Morley College]] in south London.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Richards [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d6X0JhHB8-8C&amp;pg=PT60&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;dq=ethel+everest+daughter+of+george+everest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NSEU-cLR_m&amp;sig=OA_-OBi88lfEJdg87q9CWiwbCjc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0zv3VOW5L4ec7gal94CoAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ethel%20everest%20daughter%20of%20george%20everest&amp;f=false "Offspring of the Vic: A History of Morley College"].

One of Sir George's sons, Lancelot Feilding Everest, was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was called to [[Bar (law)|the Bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]].  He practised as a barrister in chambers in London and was also the principal author of ''The Law of Estoppel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Law of Estoppel|last = Everest|first = Lancelot Feilding|publisher = Stevens and Sons: 119, Chancery Lane, London, 1881|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancelot's eldest son, Cyril Feilding Everest, enlisted in the Canadian Infantry on 17 November 1914 and was killed in action on 9 October 1916 at the [[Battle of the Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/soldierDetailPrint.asp?ID=60846|title=Canadian Great War Project|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everymanremembered.org/profiles/soldier/1567689 |title=Every Man Remembered – Soldier Profile Private Cyril Fielding Everest |website= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730101710/http://www.everymanremembered.org/profiles/soldier/1567689/ |archivedate=30 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everest's house in Mussoorie, India==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Park House 17b.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sir George Everest's House and Laboratory, also known as Park House.]]
Everest owned a house in [[Mussoorie]], Uttarakhand, [[India]], for about 11 years. He purchased it, sight unseen, from General Whish. Although now virtually derelict, it still has its roof, and there have been various plans to make it into a museum.

Built in 1832, the house is known today as Sir George Everest's House and Laboratory, or Park House. The house is situated in Park Estate about {{convert|6|km|mi|0}} west of Gandhi Chowk / Library Bazaar, (the west end of Mall Road in Mussoorie). Its location has panoramic views of the [[Doon Valley]] on one side and the [[Aglar River]] valley and the [[Himalayan Range]] to the north.

[[File:George everest house.jpg|left|thumb|Park House as seen through multi-coloured, weathered flags from a vantage point at an angle above.]]
The house is under the jurisdiction of the Tourism Department. These underground water cisterns (or perhaps pits for storing ice, although water is scarce in the area) are quite deep and lie uncovered in the front yard outside the house, filled with litter and posing danger of slipping.

The interior has been stripped but the fireplaces, roof, and the door and window frames still remain. The house is secured by steel grills and cannot be entered. Now that this property is better known and the access road has been improved, the walls are covered with graffiti and then periodically whitewashed clean.

Recent new fencing, tree planting and the construction of a ticket booth (as of late 2015) indicate that at some point it will cost to enter the property. The inside has signs of renovation several years ago, such as ceramic floor tiles in the kitchen and electrical switch boxes. Conservation architects at [[INTACH|the Indian National Trust]] are vying for this project.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Glastonbury Tor''' is a hill near [[Glastonbury]] in the English county of [[Somerset]], topped by the roofless St Michael's Tower, a Grade I [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhlelb&gt;{{NHLE|desc=St Michael's Church Tower|num=1345475|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole site is managed by the [[National Trust]], and has been designated a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name=nhlesm&gt;{{NHLE|desc=St Michael's Church, monastic remains, and other settlement remains on Glastonbury Tor|num=1019390|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|mname=Earthworks Glastonbury Tor|mnumber=196702|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conical hill of clay and [[Blue Lias]] rises from the [[Somerset Levels]]. It was formed when surrounding softer deposits were eroded, leaving the hard cap of [[sandstone]] exposed. The slopes of the hill are terraced, but the method by which they were formed remains unexplained. Artefacts from human visitation have been found, dating from the [[Iron Age]] to Roman eras.

Several buildings were constructed on the summit during the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval periods]]; they have been interpreted as an early church and monks' hermitage. The head of a [[wheel cross]] dating from the 10th or 11th century has been recovered. The original wooden church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1275, and the stone Church of St Michael built on the site in the 14th century. Its tower remains, although it has been restored and partially rebuilt several times. Archaeological excavations during the 20th century sought to clarify the background of the monument and church, but some aspects of their history remain unexplained. The Tor is mentioned in [[Celtic mythology]], particularly in myths linked to [[King Arthur]], and has a number of other enduring mythological and spiritual associations.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name "Glastonbury" is unclear, but when the settlement was first recorded in the late 7th and early 8th centuries it was called Glestingaburg.{{sfn|Gray|1935|pp=46–53}}{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=67}} Of the latter name, ''Glestinga'' is obscure, and may derive from an [[Old English]] word or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] personal name.{{sfn|Gray|1935|pp=46–53}}{{sfn|Gathercole|2003|}} It may derive from a person or [[kinship group]] named Glast.{{sfn|Gray|1935|pp=46–53}} The second half of the name, ''-burg'', is [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and could refer to either a fortified place such as a [[burh]] or, more likely, a monastic enclosure.

''[[Tor (rock formation)|Tor]]'' is an English word referring to a high rock or a hill, deriving from the [[Old English]] ''torr''.{{#tag:ref|''Tor'' is often considered to have a [[Celtic language|Celtic]] etymology, but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists no match in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] or [[Breton language|Breton]]; the nearest Celtic word is the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''tẁr'', from the [[Old Welsh]] ''tẁrr''. The Old English ''torr'' is likely [[cognate]] with the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''tòrr''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web|title=tor, n.|publisher= [[OED Online]]. [[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/203486|accessdate=10 December 2013}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtic name of the Tor was '''''Ynys Wydryn''''', or sometimes ''Ynys Gutrin'', meaning "Isle of Glass". At this time the plain was flooded, the isle becoming a peninsula at low tide.{{sfn|Ekwall|1960|p=198}}{{sfn|Hawkins|1989|p=83}}

==Location and landscape==
[[File:Street and Glastonbury Tor.jpg|thumb|Street and Glastonbury Tor viewed, above the mist, from Walton Hill]]

The Tor is in the middle of the Summerland Meadows, part of the [[Somerset Levels]],{{sfn|Siraut|Thacker|Williamson|2006a|}} rising to an elevation of {{convert|518|ft}}.&lt;ref name=nhlesm/&gt; The plain is reclaimed [[fen]] above which the Tor is clearly visible for miles around. It has been described as an island but actually sits at the western end of a [[peninsula]] washed on three sides by the [[River Brue]].{{sfn|Hawkins|1989|p=69}}

The Tor is formed from rocks dating from the early [[Jurassic]] Period, namely varied layers of [[Lias Group]] strata. The uppermost of these, forming the Tor itself, are a succession of rocks assigned to the [[Bridport Sand Formation]]. These rocks sit upon strata forming the broader hill on which the Tor stands; the various layers of the [[Beacon Limestone Formation]] and the [[Dyrham Formation]].&lt;ref name="bgs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/geologyOfBritain/viewer.html|title=Geology of Britain viewer &amp;#124; British Geological Survey (BGS)|publisher=bgs.ac.uk|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Geology of British Rocks and Soils&amp;nbsp;— Lias Group|url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/17270/1/OR12032.pdf|publisher=British Geological Survey|accessdate=16 November 2013|format=PDF|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bridport Sands have acted as a [[caprock]] protecting the lower layers from erosion. The iron-rich waters of [[Chalice Well]], a [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] at the base of the Tor, flow out as an artesian well impregnating the sandstone around it with [[iron oxide]]s that have reinforced it to produce the caprock.{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=20}} Iron-rich but oxygen-poor water in the aquifer carries dissolved [[Iron#Compounds|iron (II) "ferrous" iron]], but as the water surfaces and its oxygen content rises, the oxidised [[Iron#Compounds|iron (III) "ferric" iron]] drops out as insoluble "rusty" oxides that bind to the surrounding stone, hardening it.{{sfn|Mann|2011|p=17}}

The low-lying damp ground can produce a visual effect known as a [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]] when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist.{{sfn|Young|1807|p=302}} This [[optical phenomenon]] occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep [[Inversion (meteorology)|thermal inversion]] where an [[atmospheric duct]] has formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Andrew|title=An Introduction to Mirages|url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/mirages/mirintro.html|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian term ''Fata Morgana'' is derived from the name of [[Morgan le Fay]], a powerful sorceress in [[Arthurian legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morgan le Fay|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/theme/morgan|work=Camelot Project|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terraces===
[[Image:Glastonbury Tor from north east showing terraces.jpg|thumb|left|Terraces on the Tor]]

The sides of the Tor have seven deep, roughly symmetrical terraces, or [[lynchet]]s. Their formation remains a mystery&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|mname=Earthworks Glastonbury Tor|mnumber=196702|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many possible explanations. They may have been formed as a result of natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and [[clay]] used by farmers during the [[Middle Ages]] as [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced hills]] to make ploughing for crops easier.{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=67}} Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces, it would be expected that the effort would be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions would provide a good yield, but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side, which would provide little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved.{{sfn|Mann|1986|pp=32–33}} Alternatively, the flattened paths may have been created by the hooves of grazing cattle.{{sfn|Vallins|2013|}}

[[File:glastonbury tor (the final climb) arp.jpg|thumb|The last few yards of the walk up the Tor. The concrete path encourages visitors to avoid the steeper, more direct, routes, and thus minimises the possibility of erosion.]]
Other explanations have been suggested for the terraces, including the construction of defensive ramparts.{{sfn|Vallins|2013|}} Iron Age hill forts including the nearby [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]] in Somerset show evidence of extensive [[fortification]] of their slopes. The normal form of ramparts is a bank and ditch, but there is no evidence of this arrangement on the Tor. South Cadbury, one of the most extensively fortified places in early Britain, had three concentric rings of banks and ditches supporting an {{convert|18|ha|adj=on}} enclosure. By contrast, the Tor has seven rings and very little space on top for the safekeeping of a community.{{sfn|Mann|1986|p=32}} It has been suggested that a defensive function may have been linked with [[Ponter's Ball Dyke]], a linear [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] about {{convert|1|km|mi}} east of the Tor.{{sfn|Allcroft|1908|p=496}}&lt;ref name=SHER23564/&gt; It consists of an embankment with a ditch on the east side.&lt;ref name=SHER23564&gt;{{cite web|title=Ponters Ball (linear earthwork), Havyatt|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/23564|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=South West Heritage Trust|year=2002|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose and provenance of the dyke are unclear. It is possible that it was part of a longer defensive barrier associated with [[New Ditch]], three miles to the south-west, which is built in a similar manner. It has been suggested by [[Ralegh Radford]] that it is part of a great Celtic sanctuary, probably 3rd century BC, while others, including [[Philip Rahtz]], date it to the post-Roman period and link it to the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] occupation on Glastonbury Tor. The 1970 excavation suggests the 12th century or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|mname=Ponters Ball|mnumber=196694|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] also mentions the alternative possibility that the terraces are the remains of a medieval "spiral walkway" created for pilgrims to reach the church on the summit,{{sfn|MacLaran|Scott|2009}} similar to that at [[Whitby Abbey]].{{sfn|Hutton|2006|p=79}}

Another suggestion is that the terraces are the remains of a three-dimensional labyrinth,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2001|p=135}} first proposed by Geoffrey Russell in 1968. He states that the classical [[labyrinth]] ([[Caerdroia]]), a design found all over the Neolithic world, can be easily transposed onto the Tor, so that by walking around the terraces a person eventually reaches the top in the same pattern.{{sfn|Bowden-Pickstock|2009|p=107}}{{sfn|MacQueen|2005|p=106}} Evaluating this hypothesis is not easy. A labyrinth would very likely place the terraces in the Neolithic era,{{sfn|Mann|1986|p=24}} but given the amount of occupation since then, there may have been substantial modifications by farmers and/or monks and conclusive excavations have not been carried out.{{sfn|Hutton|2006|p=79}} In a more recent book, Hutton writes that "the labyrinth does not seem to be an ancient sacred structure".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=354}}

==History==

===Pre-Christian===
Some [[Neolithic]] flint tools recovered from the top of the Tor show that the site has been visited, perhaps with lasting occupation, since [[prehistory]]. The nearby remains of [[Glastonbury Lake Village]] were identified at the site in 1892, which confirmed that there was an [[Iron Age]] settlement in about 300–200&amp;nbsp;BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/23637 |title=Glastonbury Lake Village |accessdate=18 November 2007 |work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=South West Heritage Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1992|p=70}} There is no evidence of permanent occupation of the Tor, but finds, including Roman pottery, do suggest that it was visited on a regular basis.{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=71}}

[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] on Glastonbury Tor, undertaken by a team led by [[Philip Rahtz]] between 1964 and 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excavation (1964–1966), Glastonbury Tor|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/44979|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=South West Heritage Trust|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed evidence of [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] occupation during the 5th to 7th centuries&lt;ref name=nhlesm/&gt;{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|pp=71–78}} around the later medieval church of St. Michael. Finds included postholes, two hearths including a metalworker's [[forge]], two burials oriented north-south (thus unlikely to be Christian), fragments of 6th century [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] [[amphora]]e (vases for wine or cooking oil),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracts from the Tor Excavations Booklet|url=http://www.chalicewell.org.uk/index.cfm/glastonbury/HistoricalArchive.Article/article_id/27|publisher=Chalice Well|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a worn hollow bronze head which may have topped a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] staff.{{sfn|Castleden|1999|p=55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistoric, Roman and Post-Roman occupation, Glastonbury Tor|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/23603|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=South West Heritage Trust|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Walmsley|2013|p=15}}

===Christian settlement===

[[File:Glastonbury Tor Plate.jpg|thumb|right|This plate is fitted to the wall inside the Ruin of St Michael's Church atop Glastonbury Tor.]]

During the late Saxon and early medieval period there were at least four buildings on the summit. The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and it may have been a hermitage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Late Saxon and medieval occupation, Glastonbury Tor|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/23604|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=South West Heritage Trust|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken head of a [[Sun cross|wheel cross]] dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit.{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=78}}{{sfn|Abrams|Carley|1991|p=33}}{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=816}} The head of the cross is now in the [[Museum of Somerset]] in [[Taunton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frome Hoard finds new home at the centre of new Somerset Museum|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/archaeology/art365271|publisher=Culture 24|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest timber church, which was dedicated to [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]],{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=80}} is believed to have been constructed in the 11th or 12th century from which post holes have since been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Church of St Michael, The Tor, Glastonbury|url=http://www.somersetheritage.org.uk/record/23605|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=South West Heritage Trust|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=79}} Associated monk cells have also been identified.{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=79}}

St Michael's Church was destroyed by an earthquake on 11 September 1275.&lt;ref name=bgs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/historical/historical_listing.htm |title=Historical Earthquake Listing |accessdate=25 December 2007 |work=British Geological Survey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119072210/http://www.quakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/historical/historical_listing.htm |archivedate=19 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[British Geological Survey]], the earthquake was felt in London, Canterbury and Wales,{{sfn|Musson|2003|pp=1.14–1.16}} and was reported to have destroyed many houses and churches in England. The intensity of shaking was greater than 7&amp;nbsp;[[Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale|MSK]], with its epicentre in the area around [[Portsmouth]] or [[Chichester]], South England.&lt;ref name=bgs/&gt;

A second church, also dedicated to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating the foundations of the previous building. It included [[stained glass]] and decorated floor tiles. There was also a portable altar of [[Purbeck Marble]];{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|pp=80–81}} it is likely that the Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]. In 1243 [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|p=83}}

St Michael's Church survived until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539 when, except for the tower, it was demolished.&lt;ref name=nhlesm/&gt; The Tor was the place of execution where [[Richard Whiting (abbot)|Richard Whiting]], the last Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] along with two of his monks, John Thorne and Roger James.{{sfn|Stanton|1892|p=538}} The three-storey tower of St Michael's Church survives. It has corner [[buttress]]es and perpendicular bell openings. There is a sculptured tablet with an image of an eagle below the parapet.&lt;ref name=nhlelb/&gt;

===Post-dissolution===
[[File:Torre de Glastonbury - Interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of St Michael's Tower]]
In 1786, [[Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet|Richard Colt Hoare]] of [[Stourhead]] bought the Tor and funded repair of the tower in 1804, including the rebuilding of the north-east corner.&lt;ref name=nhlesm/&gt;{{sfn|Garner|2004|}} It was then passed on through several generations to the Reverend George Neville and included in the [[Butleigh|Butleigh Manor]] until the 20th century. It was then bought as a memorial to a former [[Dean of Wells]], [[Thomas Jex-Blake]], who died in 1915.{{sfn|Siraut|Thacker|Williamson|2006b|}}

The [[National Trust]] took control of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Garner|2004|}} During the 1960s, excavations identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had moved in the past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of the increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the [[Hadspen Quarry]].{{sfn|Garner|2004|}}

A model vaguely based on Glastonbury Tor (albeit with a tree instead of the tower) was incorporated into the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London. As the athletes entered the stadium, their flags were displayed on the terraces of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain fires up the world: London gets the 2012 Games under way with the Greatest Show On Earth (rounded off by Macca, of course) |first1=Rick |last1=Dewsbury |first2=Ian |last2=Garland |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2179920/Olympics-Opening-Ceremony-London-gets-2012-Games-way-Greatest-Show-On-Earth-rounded-Macca-course.html?ITO=1490 |publisher=Mail Online |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glastonbury Tor's starring role in London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony|url=http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/Glastonbury-Tor-s-starring-role-London-2012/story-16609128-detail/story.html|publisher=This is Somerset|accessdate=27 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207133345/http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/Glastonbury-Tor-s-starring-role-London-2012/story-16609128-detail/story.html|archivedate=7 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waite|first=Richard|title=Glastonbury Tor, a village green and a farmyard&amp;nbsp;— Olympic opening ceremony plans revealed|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/glastonbury-tor-a-village-green-and-a-farmyard-olympic-opening-ceremony-plans-revealed/8631595.article|publisher=''Architects' Journal''|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology and spirituality==
[[File:GlastonburyTorViewsrsteel.jpg|thumb|View from Glastonbury Tor]]
The Tor seems to have been called ''Ynys yr Afalon'' (meaning "The Isle of Avalon") by the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] and is believed by some, including the 12th and 13th century writer [[Gerald of Wales]], to be the [[Avalon]] of [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerald of Wales|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/debarri.html|work=Sources of British History|publisher=Britannia|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tor has been associated with the name Avalon, and identified with [[King Arthur]], since the alleged discovery of his and Queen Guinevere's neatly labelled coffins in 1191, recounted by [[Gerald of Wales]].{{sfn|Nitze|1934|pp=355–361}}{{sfn|Ditmas|1964|pp=19–33}} Author [[Christopher L. Hodapp]] asserts in his book ''The Templar Code for Dummies'' that Glastonbury Tor is one of the possible locations of the [[Holy Grail]], because it is close to the monastery that housed the [[Nanteos Cup]].{{sfn|Hodapp|Von Kannon|2007|}}

With the 19th century resurgence of interest in [[Celtic mythology]], the Tor became associated with [[Gwyn ap Nudd]], the first Lord of the Otherworld ([[Annwn]]) and later King of the [[fairy|Fairies]].{{sfn|Bowman|2005|p=178}}{{sfn|Bowman|2008|p=251}} The Tor came to be represented as an entrance to Annwn or to Avalon, the land of the fairies. The tor is supposedly a gateway into "The Land Of The Dead (Avalon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emick|first=Jennifer|title=The Everything Celtic Wisdom Book|year=2008|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-2170-6|pages=96–97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5skKKMRUHAMC&amp;pg=PT109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A persistent myth of more recent origin is that of the [[Temple of the Stars|Glastonbury Zodiac]],{{sfn|Wylie|2002|pp=441–454}} a purported astrological [[zodiac]] of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient [[hedge]]rows and trackways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caine|first=Mary|title=The Glastonbury Giants|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/GGZodiac2.html|work= [[Gandalf's Garden]]|volume= 4|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius.{{sfn|Bowman|2005|p=180}} The theory was first put forward in 1927 by [[Katharine Emma Maltwood|Katherine Maltwood]],{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|pp=65–66}}{{sfn|Rahtz|1993|p=50}} an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago.{{sfn|Maltwood|1987|}} But the vast majority of the land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2001|p=112}} and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glastonbury Zodiac|url=http://www.badarchaeology.com/?page_id=889|publisher=Bad Archeology|author1=Fitzpatrick-Matthews, Keith |author2=Doeser, James |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rahtz|Watts|2003|pp=65–66}}

The tor and other sites in Glastonbury have also been significant in the modern-day [[Goddess movement]], with the flow from the [[Chalice Well]] seen as representing [[menstrual flow]] and the tor being seen as either a breast or the whole figure of the Goddess. This has been celebrated with an effigy of the Goddess leading an annual procession up the Tor.{{sfn|Bowman|2004|pp=273–285}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7658">{{Former monarchic orders of succession}}

The House of Aisin Gioro ruled China during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1912). A Chinese emperor would pick one of his many sons, or another relative, to succeed him. Under the Qing, a succession edict was hidden in the palace and read upon the death of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, Ross, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TKowRrrz5BIC&amp;dq= The New Chinese Empire: And What It Means For The United States]'', Basic Books, Mar 5, 2009, p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Puyi, China's last emperor, was ousted in 1912, the country was declared a republic. Puyi was emperor of [[Manchukuo]], now northeastern China, in 1934–1945. He died without issue in 1967. His brother Prince [[Pujie]] was next in line under a 1937 succession law, the most recently published agreed upon succession rule.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchoukuo Year Book 1941'', "Text of the Law Governing Succession to the Imperial Throne", March 1, 1937, p. 905, Tōa Keizai Chōsakyoku (Japan). "In the absence of sons or descendants, the brothers of the reigning emperor, borne of the same mother, and their male-line descendants succeed according to age." (Article 5)&lt;br&gt;Buyers, Christopher, ''The Royal Ark'', "[http://www.royalark.net/China/china.htm China]".&lt;/ref&gt; Stories published in the ''Chicago Times'' and ''The New York Times'' acknowledge Pujie as heir of Puyi.&lt;ref&gt;Schmetzer, Uli, "Emperor-in-waiting recalls bygone age", ''Chicago Tribune'', Oct. 25, 1992.&lt;br&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/02/obituaries/pu-jie-87-dies-ending-dynasty-of-the-manchus.html Pu Jie, 87, Dies, Ending Dynasty Of the Manchus]", ''New York Times'', March 2, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pujie died in 1994. He is survived by a daughter, Princess Husheng, who was born in 1941. However, the law restricts succession to males.&lt;ref&gt;"The Imperial Throne of Manchoukuo shall be succeeded to by male descendants in the male line of His Majesty the Emperor for ages to come." (Article 1, "Text of the Law Governing Succession to the Imperial Throne", ''The Manchoukuo Year Book 1941'', p. 905.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several news stories have suggested that [[Jin Yuzhang]], a nephew of Puyi and Pujie, is the current family head.&lt;ref name=jinyuzhang&gt;Spencer, Richard, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3537292/The-Chinese-man-who-would-be-emperor.html The Chinese man who would be emperor]", ''The Telegraph'', 30 Nov 2008.&lt;br / &gt;McDonald, Hamish,

In ''The Empty Throne'', Tony Scotland tells how he found Prince [[Yuyan]], who lived in a mud floor hovel near the imperial palace.&lt;ref name="Scotland"&gt;Scotland, Tony, and Patrick Leigh Fermor, ''The Empty Throne: Quest for an Imperial Heir in the People's Republic of China'', (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Yuyan, a distant cousin of Puyi, told Scotland that the former emperor made him heir to the throne in a ceremony performed while they were imprisoned in Russia together in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is not supported by any official document, although it was customary in the Qing dynasty that an emperor name his successor in a will or edict. Puyi's autobiography confirms merely that the idea was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pu Yi, Paul Kramer, ''The Last Manchu: The Autobiography of Henry Pu Yi, Last Emperor of China'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Yuyan died in 1997. His eldest son is Prince Hengzhen, who was born in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication that Yuyan designated him heir to the throne, or that he claims this status.

During the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Revolution]] some minorities suggested that the Manchu emperor be replaced by an ethnic Chinese.

'''ISO 3166-2:PW''' is the entry for [[Palau]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Palau, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[states of Palau|16 states]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|PW}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Palau. The second part is three digits, which is the old [[FIPS 6-4]] code of the state.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

''Parent article:'' '''[[List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]'''

These are some notable [[tornado]]es, [[tornado outbreak]]s, and [[tornado outbreak sequence]]s that have occurred in [[North America]].
#''The listing is U.S.-centric, with greater and more consistent information available for U.S. tornadoes. Some North American outbreaks affecting the U.S. may only include tornado information from the U.S.''
#''Exact death and injury counts are not possible, especially for large events and events before 1955.''
#''Prior to 1950 in the United States, only significant tornadoes are listed for the number of tornadoes in outbreaks.''
#''Due to increasing detection, particularly in the U.S., numbers of counted tornadoes have increased markedly in recent decades although number of actual tornadoes and counted [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornadoes has not. In older events, the number of tornadoes officially counted is likely underestimated.''
#''Historical context: Much of the tornado activity in the American Midwestern area is relatively unknown and significantly under-reported prior to the middle of the 1800's as few people lived there to record the yearly activity outside of Native Americans whom did not keep much, if any written records. The American government did not acquire the Midwestern states area until the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] from the French government. The Louisiana Purchase area included major tornado activity areas of north Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, South Dakota, and lower Minnesota. Large groups of settlers and pioneers only began populating there as the American government began organizing this acquired territory during the 1820-1860s. The other areas east of the Mississippi River and west of the original thirteen colonies that have more frequent tornado activity of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama didn't begin having larger groups of settlers populating these areas until the earlier 1800's. As these areas began being more populated, existing tornado activity there became more known and reported through newspaper and telegraph.

| The largest continuous and fourth-deadliest outbreak in U.S. history caused the most tornado-related deaths since [[1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak|1936]]. April 27 was also the deadliest tornado day in the U.S. since [[1925 Tri-State tornado|March 18, 1925]], and the second-deadliest Alabama outbreak on record, with 238 deaths in the state, behind only the 268 people killed on March 21, 1932. The outbreak produced 15 violent (EF4-EF5) tornadoes all on April 27, behind only the 1965 Palm Sunday Outbreak (17) and 1974 Super Outbreak (30). Numerous, violent, long-tracked tornadoes, four of them EF5s, and eleven EF4s struck eastern Mississippi, north and central Alabama, northwestern Georgia, and eastern Tennessee. There were a total of 71 more tornadoes of significant strength, 55 of which on 4/27 alone. There were 31 killer tornadoes during the outbreak, 28 of them on 4/27 including 14 of the 15 violent tornadoes. One of the longest-lived tornadoes on record, an [[2011 Hackleburg–Phil Campbell, Alabama tornado|EF5]] traveled {{convert|132|mi|km|abbr=on}} across northwest Alabama, devastating [[Hackleburg, Alabama|Hackleburg]] and other communities, killing 72 people, making it the deadliest Alabama tornado on record. Another [[2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado|long-tracked tornado]] produced EF4 damage in the [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]–[[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] area, killing 64. This outbreak is called the 2011 Super Outbreak due to the amount of tornadoes in one day (216 on 4/27 CDT), amount of violent tornadoes, and the severity and degree of the outbreak.

[[Image:Pico Orizaba Pines.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pico de Orizaba]] ([[Citlaltépetl]]), a [[stratovolcano]] on the boundary between the states of [[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz]], is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of [[Mexico|México]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''26 [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summits]] of [[Mexico|México]]'''.  Each of these peaks has at least {{convert|1500|m|-3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|-3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pico de Orizaba]] exceeds {{convert|4000|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} of topographic prominence, [[Popocatépetl]] exceeds {{convert|3000|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and [[Nevado de Colima]] exceeds {{convert|2500|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.  Seven mountain peaks of México exceed {{convert|2000|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, the following 26 ultra-prominent summits exceed {{convert|1500|m|-1|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and 42 summits exceed {{convert|1000|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18805">[[File:Ipoh Town.PNG|thumb|right|432px|Street map of Ipoh in 1921.  The [[Kinta River]] and [[Federated Malay States Railways|FMS railway]] run from the north to the SW corner.  The heart of the town lies between them.  Hugh Low Street is the main road running East-West, crossing the river, passing through the centre of town and leading to the railway station.  As it leaves the town, it forks to the South East becoming Gopeng Road - the main road to [[Gopeng]] which was one of the first roads in the region. ]]
This is a '''list of main roads and streets in [[Ipoh]]''' — the capital of the [[Perak]] state of [[Malaysia]].  Like many city streets in Malaysia and Singapore, these were named after British colonial officers or adjacent landmarks in English.  Following the [[history of Malaysia#Towards Malaysia|independence of Malaya]] in 1957 and the prescription of [[Malay language|Malay]] as the country's national language, the city's streets were [[street renaming|renamed]] after local politicians and royalty, with the Malay word ''jalan'' being used to indicate a main road.

The town is located on the [[Kinta River]] which was the main means of communication to the area until 1895 when the Kinta Valley Railway opened.  It grew up at the point on the river at which it ceased to be navigable and the landing stage was by an old [[upas tree]] from which the town took its name.  During the 1890s the town expanded rapidly from a market village to a booming mining town as large number of Chinese coolies came to the area to work the tin mines of the Kinta valley.  The only two roads initially in the area were the cart tracks linking the mines to the landing stages.  A wooden bridge was built across the Kinta river on the road to [[Gopeng]] which became Hugh Low Street.{{sfn|Tate|1962|p=13-17}}

Plots of land had been sold to the Chinese by the local land-owning aristocrat, the ''Dato Panglima Kinta'', Mohamed Jusuf, who had laid them out with broad, straight streets but the rapid development had been disorderly so that the main road to Gopeng varied in width from 20 to 70 feet.  There was then a great fire on 1 June 1892, which destroyed much of the town's wooden buildings which had ''[[attap]]'' palm thatch roofs.  The reconstruction of the town was organised by the British Collector of Land Revenue, W.J.P. Hume, who straightened the road network, redrew the land boundaries and issued new title deeds.  He had no formal authority to do so but his influence and good sense made a success of the scheme.  The streets were now 50–60 feet wide, brick drains were laid and shade trees planted.{{sfn|Tate|1962|p=13,18}}
[[File:Hugh Low Street.PNG|thumb|right|432px|Hugh Low Street around 1910.  This was named after [[Hugh Low]] — the influential fourth [[Resident (title)#Residents in Asia|Resident]] of [[Perak]].]]
{{quote box|width=35%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|fontsize=100%|quote=In the early part of 1895, I came to Malaya.  I embarked at Penang, sailed in a coastal steamship for Teluk Anson—and entrained for Ipoh.  I was taken to my uncle's house in Hale Street.  A few weeks after I was admitted into the Anglo-Chinese school, which was then behind the present site of the Labour and Land Office (1950).  The undermentioned roads and streets were in existence when I first came to Ipoh:-

Station Road: It turned off to the road in front of the Kinta Town Board and joined Hale Street.  The table-land, on which the Clock Tower now stands, sloped down to Hale Street.  Consequently Station Road did not continue as far as Belfield Street, as you see now.

The road in front of the Kinta Town Board continued its course straight across the Ipoh Padang and Clayton Road to the sloping road on the west side of the St. Michael's Institution (which did not exist then), and continued to Kuala Kangsar Road.  There were a few attap-roofed plank houses along the sides of the road across the [[padang]] (which was not a padang then).  The Ipoh Club was in a plank building at the corner of Club Road and Hugh Low Street.

Belfield Street: This street terminated at Hale Street in the North and at Patrick Street in the South.  From here it turned off to Lahat Road.

Leech Street: This ended at Hale Street and Hill Street.

Treacher Street: Terminated at Panglima Street in the north.  On the south it stretched as far as the Kinta River.  Across the river there was a narrow wooden bridge to enable the [[kampong (village)|kampong]] people to pass by.

Hale Street extended as far as the river bank.  There was no [[bunding|bund]], but a platform was constructed for people to bathe — chiefly the Chinese.

Panglima Street ended at Treacher Street because the bend in the river was there.

Market Street had its end at Belfield Street in the west and at the Market on the river bank on the east.  This was the only market for Ipoh at the time.

Hugh Low Street extended as far as the Ipoh Hospital in front of the railway station in the west and Tambun and Gopeng Roads in the east.  There was a wooden bridge across the river.  This street did not go as it does today, but turned onto the road by the side of the Malay mosque and joined Gopeng Road at the spot where Universal Motors now stands.  Opposite to this was the iron foundry, known as Riley Hargreaves.  On this road, by the side of Anderson Road, was the old Mariammem temple.  There was no New Town then.  There were kampongs and jungle in that area.  Dato Laxamana's house with fort was in the centre of the present Ipoh Market Square adjoining Laxamana Road, which was a bridle path.

Club Road terminated in the north at Station Road and in the south at Lahat Road.  By the side of Club Road, where the bus station now lies, was the railway goods shed.

Lahat Road was as it is today.  On Lahat Road between Patrick Street and the old Cold Storage Road was the Ipoh Foundry.  The Majestic Hotel — some years ago known as the Grand Hotel — was the residence of Dato Wahab (the Dato Muda) and later of Orang Kaya Sri Adika Raja, Mohamed Salleh Isa.  The high ground where the Anglo-Chinese School main building stands was a Malay kampong.  The other buildings you see on Lahat Road were not in existence then.  Falim was a vegetable garden and later a rubber estate.

Connolly Road: There was no such road then, but Hill Street extended as far as Connolly Road behind the houses on Jelf Road.  A bridle path stretched up to the Biroh School, at which place was the incinerator (built 1897).  The playground by the side was the old hospital burial ground.

In general, Brewster Road, Jalan Datoh, Clayton Road, Silibin Road and Maxwell Road were not in existence.  Labrooy Town was a swampy place.  The Istana and Residency was at Istana Road.  The eastern side of the Ipoh padang was a swamp where buffaloes wallowed.  Kenion Street was the bed of the Kinta River, which flowed close to Treacher Street and in front of the Chinese Temple in the People's Park.  In the space between Kenion Street and the houses on the right of Market Street stood the Malay [[mosque]].  The present transport office was the former Post and Telegraph Office.  The present Detective Office was the former police station.  The gambling houses were at the corners of Market and Leech Streets.  Panglima and Hill Streets were famous for the Chinese and Indian beauties respectively.|title=Reminiscences of R. Ayaru writing in 1950 about the Ipoh of 1895 |source=R.

===Primary schools===
[[Image:Chillerton and Rookley Primary School.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Chillerton and Rookley Primary School.]]
[[File:Chale Primary School.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Chale Primary School.]]
There are currently 41 state-maintained [[primary school]]s on the Isle of Wight, after Chale Primary School closed in July 2011 following the schools reorganisation - it had a roll of only 20 pupils. Merges also meant that the number of primary schools on the island decreased: St Wilfrids Catholic Primary, St Boniface C of E Primary and St Margarets C of E Primary (all in Ventnor) all closed and reopened as St Francis Catholic and Church of England Primary School on the site of the old Ventnor Middle School in a purpose built, brand new building; St John's C of E Primary (Sandown) and Sandown C of E Primary School merged to become The Bay C of E Primary School, split across both of the former school sites; and East Cowes Primary School and Whippingham Primary School merged to become Queensgate Foundation Primary School on the old Osborne Middle School site. A number of other primary schools also moved to former middle school sites including Gurnard Primary School to the old Solent Middle School site in Cowes, Hunnyhill Primary School to the old Kitbridge Middle School site in Newport, Greenmount Primary to the old Mayfield Middle School site in Ryde, Oakfield C of E Primary School to the old Bishop Lovett Middle School site in Ryde, Bembridge Primary School to the old Forelands Middle School site in Bembridge and Broadlea Primary School to the old Lake Middle School site in Lake. In addition, Haylands Primary School has had a brand new school built on the playing fields of the former Swanmore Middle School in Ryde.&lt;ref name="Primary schools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/schools/type_schools.asp?frmType=Primary|title=EduWight - Isle of Wight Primary Schools|publisher=www.eduwight.gov.uk|accessdate=2008-09-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207062925/http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/schools/type_schools.asp?frmType=Primary|archivedate=2009-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary schools===
[[Image:Medina High School.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Medina High School, Newport|Medina High School]], in [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]].]]
There are currently seven island [[secondary school]]s, all of which also have a [[sixth form]]. The sixth forms for Carisbrooke College and Medina College are merged, and are based at the new Island Innovation VI Form Campus, on the site of the former Nodehill Middle School in the centre of Newport.

===Special and alternative schools===
State-maintained [[special school]]s on the Isle of Wight include:
* Medina House School, 
* St George's School,
* Island Learning Centre (Pupil Referral Unit) [http://www.islandlearning.co.uk]

===Further education===

==Independent schools==
[[Image:Ryde School main entrance.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ryde School with Upper Chine.]]

[[Independent school (United Kingdom)|Independent schools]] on the island include:

* [[Ryde School with Upper Chine]]
* [[Priory School, Isle of Wight|Priory School]]

There is also [[St Catherine's School, Ventnor|St Catherines School]], which is a non-maintained special school.

==Former schools==
===Middle===
Previous [[List of middle schools in England|middle schools]] below have now been phased out during the transition to a two-tier education system. Education on the Island has really suffered since this happened and most of the secondary schools are now deemed unsatisfactory or have gone into special measures.

[[Image:Nodehill Middle School.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Nodehill Middle School.]]
[[File:Christ the King College upper campus.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The lower campus of Christ the King College (formerly Trinity Church of England Middle School).]]
There were originally 16 state-maintained [[middle school]]s on the Isle of Wight, including two voluntary aided church schools (which were the foundation for the new Christ the King College) and two controlled church schools. In July 2008, the two voluntary aided middle schools (Archbishop King Catholic Middle School and Trinity Church of England Middle School), which are both located on Wellington Road in Carisbrooke, closed and reopened in September of the same year as Christ the King College, and from September 2009, kept on its Year 8 pupils of the previous academic year as Year 9 pupils and started the transition from middle school to secondary school age range. In line with the rest of the Island, September 2009 was the last year in which a Year 5 was admitted to the Christ the King College. Instead, all Year 5 pupils, and then consequently Year 6 pupils, on the island remained in primary schools from September 2010 onwards. 
Additionally, Kitbridge Middle School became federated with Downside Middle School, and the two schools both became Downside Middle School, but were split across the two separate campuses in Newport; Furrlongs Campus and Kitbridge Campus.&lt;ref name="Middle schools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/schools/type_schools.asp?frmType=Middle|title=EduWight - Isle of Wight Middle Schools|publisher=www.eduwight.gov.uk|accessdate=2008-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620024335/http://eduwight.iow.gov.uk/schools/type_schools.asp?frmType=Middle|archive-date=2008-06-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All middle schools on the island, other than Christ The King College, closed for pupils as of July 21, 2011. Instead of the four years at middle school, children have been given 2 extra years in primary school and then move straight onto secondary school. Children already in middle school transferred straight to the new secondary schools at the start of the next academic year, whether they are in year 6, 7 or 8.

The '''Liverpool–Manchester rivalry''' is a rivalry that exists between the [[England|English]] cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]]. The cities have many similarities and differences, which have intensified the rivalry, and both lie at the heart of [[North West England]] — the most populated region outside of the Greater London area in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="bbcscousevmanc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6956608.stm|publisher=BBC.co.uk|title=Scouse v Manc | date=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry is generally agreed to have ignited after the construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. Manchester merchants became disenchanted with the level of dues they had to pay to export and import their goods. Consequently the Mancunian merchants decided to construct a ship canal. The Ship Canal would become the largest in the world upon opening in January 1894 and highlighted the length the merchants were prepared to take to avoid paying dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=1 January 1894: Opening of the Manchester ship canal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/17/guardian190-manchester-ship-canal-opens |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 1894 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Industrialisation===
The rivalry has its beginnings during the Victorian era, when both cities underwent substantial industrialisation. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in 1830 was a key achievement, and was the first inter-city railway in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.138|title=Building the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|publisher=mersey-gateway.org|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester Ship Canal===
The rivalry turned bitter after the construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in 1894 by Manchester merchants. The Mancunian merchants became disenchanted with the dues they have to pay to import and export goods to and from Manchester. Consequently, they decided to build a ship canal, which was the largest ship canal in the world upon opening in 1894.

===Today===
Both cities in the 2010s remain rivals, but on a better relationship than the past and some believe a strong Manchester and Liverpool is in the [[North West England|North West]]'s interests. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' stated that the North West economy, led by the redevelopment of Manchester and Liverpool, is a genuine rival to 'overheated London'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Living in the North West |url=http://careers.astrazeneca.co.uk/working-here/our-locations/alderley-park/living-in-the-North-West/ |work=AstraZeneca |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026025623/http://careers.astrazeneca.co.uk/working-here/our-locations/alderley-park/living-in-the-North-West/ |archivedate=2011-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Manchester has openly supported Liverpool in its recent bid to become the European Capital of Culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='Rival' city supports culture bid |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2836901.stm |work=BBC |date=10 March 2003 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=City sends rival Valentines card |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2759491.stm |work=BBC |date=14 February 2003 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bid which Liverpool eventually won making it the European Capital of Culture in 2008.

==Liverpool–Manchester Megalopolis==
{{Original research section|date=November 2011}}
{{See also|North West England#Metropolitan areas}}
Despite being rivals the two cities are connected in many ways with Liverpool and Manchester sometimes being considered parts of a large polynuclear [[metropolitan area]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:89997|title=Shrinking cities and growing regions ? emerging trends of new rural-urban relationships in the UK and Germany|first=Andreas Schulze|last=Bäing|website=www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1122670315&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=-81&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=adhoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;va=&amp;pt=a|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105182544/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1122670315&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=wg&amp;geo=-81&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=adhoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;va=&amp;pt=a|deadurl=yes|title=World Gazetteer: United Kingdom - largest cities (per geographical en…|date=5 January 2013|archivedate=5 January 2013|website=world-gazetteer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stockdale |first=David |title=Achieving Equality of Service Provision across the North West |url=http://www2.mssociety.org.uk/downloads/Achieving_equality_in_Service_Provision_across_the_Northwest_by_David_Stockdale.15242ff2.pdf |publisher=The MS Society |accessdate=2011-11-27 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63VzHFTKD?url=http://www2.mssociety.org.uk/downloads/Achieving_equality_in_Service_Provision_across_the_Northwest_by_David_Stockdale.15242ff2.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total population of the area is over 4 million.

The region is separated from the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] and the [[Sheffield Urban Area]], by the [[Peak District]] and is close to the [[Rossendale]] Urban area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/index.html Census 2001 Key Statistics, Urban areas in England and Wales, See part 8]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Accrington|Accrington Urban Area]] near [[Blackburn]] and [[Burnley]] and the [[Preston Urban Area]]. The short distance between the areas make some consider them part of the Liverpool-Manchester megalopolis.

==Sport==
{{See also|Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry}}
A notable rivalry exists between the football clubs and supporters of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with the rivalry between Liverpool and United supporters being particularly fierce. This is partly due to the fact that Manchester United and Liverpool have dominated the English game and are the country's two most successful clubs.  When Manchester City and Liverpool played each other in the [[2014 International Champions Cup]] in the United States, the rivalry took on another sporting angle in the host country due to the ownership of the two clubs; [[City Football Group]]'s partners in their [[Major League Soccer]] team [[New York City FC]] — [[Yankee Global Enterprises]] — own the [[New York Yankees]] [[Major League Baseball]] franchise, who have [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry|a strong rivalry]] with the [[Boston Red Sox]] — a subsidiary of [[Fenway Sports Group]], the owners of Liverpool.

Historically both cities were part of Lancashire until 1974, and both share the [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] in county cricket. Matches are primarily played at [[Old Trafford cricket ground]] just outside Manchester in [[Trafford]], where the club was formed in 1865. However, matches are played at [[Aigburth Cricket Ground, Liverpool|Aigburth Cricket Ground]] in Liverpool.

A '''national university''' is generally a [[university]] created or managed by a government, but which may at the same time operate autonomously without direct control by the state.

Some national universities are associated with national cultural or political aspirations.  
For example, the [[National University of Ireland]] during the early days of [[Irish Free State|Irish independence]] collected a large amount of information about the [[Irish language]] and [[Irish culture]]. In Argentina, the national universities are the result of the [[University reform in Argentina|1918 Argentine university reform]] and subsequent reforms, which were intended to provide a secular university system without direct clerical or government influence by bestowing self-government on the institutions.

[[File:moon names.svg|thumb|400px|right|The names of the major [[lunar mare|maria]] and some [[lunar craters|craters]] on the near side of the Moon]]

The '''near side of the Moon''' is the lunar hemisphere that is permanently turned towards [[Earth]], whereas the opposite side is the [[far side of the Moon|far side]]. Only one side of the [[Moon]] is visible from Earth because the Moon rotates on its axis at the same rate that the Moon orbits the Earth – a situation known as [[synchronous rotation]], or [[tidal locking]].

The Moon is directly illuminated by the [[Sun]], and the cyclically varying viewing conditions cause the [[lunar phase]]s. Sometimes the dark portion of the Moon is faintly visible due to [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]], which is indirect [[sunlight]] reflected from the surface of Earth and onto the Moon.

Since the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] is both somewhat [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] and [[orbital inclination|inclined]] to its [[equator|equatorial plane]], [[libration]] allows up to 59% of the Moon's surface to be viewed from Earth (though only half at any moment from any point).

[[File:Lunar libration with phase Oct 2007 450px.gif|right|thumb|thumbtime=0:02|alt=Over one lunar month more than half of the Moon's surface can be seen from the surface of the Earth.|The near side as observed (from Earth's [[Northern Hemisphere]]) over the course of one [[lunar month|month]], showing the [[libration]] effects]]

==Names==
The near side of the Moon is characterized by large dark areas that were believed to be seas by the astronomers who first mapped them, in the 17th century (notably, [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] and [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]]). Although it was found out later that the Moon has no seas, the term "mare" (plural: maria) is still used. The lighter toned regions are referred to as "terrae", or more commonly, the "highlands".

==Orientation==
[[File:Moon nearside LRO.jpg|right|thumb|Detailed view by NASA's [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter|LRO]] ]]
The image of the Moon here is drawn as is normally shown on maps, that is with north on top and west to the left. Astronomers usually turn the map over to have south on top, as to correspond with the view in most telescopes which also show the image upside down.

West and east on the Moon are where you would expect them, when standing on the Moon. But when we, on Earth, see the Moon in the sky, then the east–west direction is just reversed. When specifying coordinates on the Moon it should therefore always be mentioned whether [[geographic]] (or rather [[selenographic coordinates|selenographic]]) coordinates are used or [[astronomical]] coordinates.

The actual orientation you see the Moon in the sky or on the horizon depends on your geographic [[latitude]] on Earth. In the following description a few typical cases will be considered.

*On the north pole, if the Moon is visible, it stands low above the horizon with its north pole up.
*In mid northern latitudes (North America, Europe, Asia) the Moon rises in the east with its northeastern limb up (Mare Crisium), it reaches its highest point in the south with its north on top, and sets in the west with its northwestern limb (Mare Imbrium) on top.
*On the equator, when the Moon rises in the east, its N — S axis appears horizontal and Mare Foecunditatis is on top. When it sets in the west, about 12.5 hours later, the axis is still horizontal, and Oceanus Procellarum is the last area to dip below the horizon. In between these events, the Moon reached its highest point in the [[zenith]] and then its selenographic directions are lined up with those on Earth.
*In mid southern latitudes (South America, South Pacific, Australia, South Africa) the Moon rises in the east with its southeastern limb up (Mare Nectaris), it reaches its highest point in the north with its south on top, and sets in the west with its southwestern limb (Mare Humorum) on top.
*On the south pole the Moon behaves as on the north pole, but there it appears with its south pole up.

==Differences==
{{see also|Lunar mare}}
The two hemispheres have distinctly different appearances, with the near side covered in multiple, large [[Lunar mare|''maria'']] (Latin for 'seas,' since the earliest astronomers incorrectly thought that these plains were seas of lunar water). The far side has a battered, densely cratered appearance with few maria. Only 1% of the surface of the far side is covered by maria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J. J. Gillis | author2=P. D. Spudis | title=The Composition and Geologic Setting of Lunar Far Side Maria | journal=Lunar and Planetary Science | date=1996 | volume=27 | pages=413| bibcode=1996LPI....27..413G }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 31.2% on the near side. According to research analyzed by NASA’s [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory]] (GRAIL) mission, the reason for the difference is because the moon’s crust is thinner on the near side compared to the far side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/106378/moons-blotchy-near-side-has-bigger-craters-than-expected/ Universe Today]&lt;/ref&gt; The dark splotches that make up the large lunar maria are lava-filled impact basins that were created by asteroid impacts about four billion years ago. Though both sides of the moon were bombarded by similarly large impactors, the near side hemisphere crust and upper mantle was hotter than that of the far side, resulting in the larger impact craters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6159/724 Science Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; These larger impact craters make up the [[Man in the Moon]] references from popular mythology.

[[File:Merwede map.png|thumb|350px|Kruik's {{circa|lk=no|1730}} map of the [[Merwede]], the first full-scale depiction of contours of depth ([[isobath]]s).]]
'''Nicolaas Samuelszoon Kruik''' ({{lang-la|Nicolaus Samuelis Cruquius}}; 2 December 1678, [[West-Vlieland]] – 5 February 1754, [[Spaarndam]]), also known as '''Klaas Kruik''' and '''Nicolaes Krukius''', was a Dutch land surveyor, cartographer, astronomer and weatherman. He is remembered most today for the [[Museum De Cruquius]] bearing his name.

He was a perfectionist who liked to measure things and he calculated temperature measurements in [[Fahrenheit]] from 1706 to 1734. His historical calculations are still used today by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]], the Dutch [[meteorological]] institute. He not only measured weather changes in wind speed, rainfall, air pressure, temperature, and humidity, but also measured sea level. His method of visualising planes of water level to illustrate contours of depth ([[isobath]]s) in his map of the [[Merwede]] (1728) was the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Map |volume=17 |page=630}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an advocate of pumping out the [[Haarlemmermeer]] (Haarlem lake),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Haarlem Lake |volume=12 |page=781}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was done a century after his death.

==Biography==
[[File:Spaarndam-Gemeenlandshuis Rijnland zuidzijde.jpg|thumb|left|Rijnlandshuis, the [[Gemeenlandshuis]] where Cruquius lived and worked in Spaarndam]]
He became a surveyor at the age of 19 and began to draw maps, a lucrative job in his day. Though born in Vlieland, he moved to [[Delft]] a few years after he was born and it is there in 1705 that he started his first weather observations. In 1717 at the age of 39, though firmly established as a respected surveyor, he moved to the family farm in [[Rijnsburg]] outside Leiden and chose to study in [[Leiden]] under [[Herman Boerhaave]], at that time the most famous scientist in the Netherlands. He signed himself in as "Krukius, medical student, born in Delft". Thanks to Boerhaave, Kruik became a member of the [[Royal Society of London]]. The secretary of the Royal Society at that time, [[James Jurin]], started the first European network of meteorological weather stations, and the Dutch members played a large part. Kruik was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27Cruquius%27%29|title=The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Archive Resource entry for Cruquius; Nicolaus|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1721 and 1723 [[Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli]] travelled to Holland and he and Boerhaave stimulated Kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health. Kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the Netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work. On these trips he was sometimes accompanied by Boerhaave and Marsigli. While studying the [[Merwede]], he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the Netherlands dry. 

It was at this time that Kruik changed his name to the Latin ''Cruquius'' after his first publications of maps and measurements. In 1725 he wrote a famous letter to [[Willem 's Gravesande]], a Dutch professor of physics and astronomy at Leiden, proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the Netherlands. This letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] to create a water defence plan in 1727. It was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of [[Haarlemmermeer]] bij pumping the Haarlem lake dry more than a century later. 
[[File:Cruquius-Diagram-eclipse-1732.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram showing the distance of the planets to the earth in 1732, also showing a complete lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in that year]]
In 1733 he became a member of the '[[Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland]]', the Dutch Waterboard Agency, and worked as a Waterboard inspector in [[Spaarndam]]. It was here that he met Jan Noppen (1706–1734), the [[Halfweg]] inspector, who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in [[Zwanenburg]] with measurements 3 times daily of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and rainfall.

An eccentric man, Kruik wrote music, and had an obsessive need to measure things. This need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily. According to contemporary accounts, only Boerhaave could successfully work with him.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Suriname:

'''[[Suriname]]''' &amp;ndash; sovereign state on the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America, and the smallest country on that continent. It was long inhabited by indigenous tribal peoples with diverse cultures, before being explored and contested by European powers from the 16th century, and eventually coming under Dutch rule in the late 17th century. In 1954, the country became one of the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On 25 November 1975, the country of Suriname left the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become an independent state, while maintaining close economic, diplomatic, and cultural ties to its former colonizer. Suriname is the only sovereign nation outside Europe where Dutch is spoken by a majority of the population.

The '''Paraná Delta''' ({{lang-es|Delta del Paraná}}) is the [[river delta|delta]] of the [[Paraná River]] in [[Argentina]] and it consists of several islands known as the '''Islas del Paraná'''. The Paraná flows north–south and becomes an [[alluvium|alluvial]] basin (a [[flood plain]]) between the [[Provinces of Argentina|Argentine provinces]] of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] then emptying into the [[Río de la Plata]].

It covers about {{convert|14000|km2|mi2}} and starts to form between the cities of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] and [[Rosario]], where the river splits into several arms, creating a network of islands and [[wetland]]s. Most of it is in the jurisdiction of Entre Ríos Province, and parts in the north of [[Buenos Aires Province]].

The Paraná Delta is conventionally divided into three parts:
* the Upper Delta, from the [[Diamante, Entre Ríos|Diamante]]&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;[[Puerto Gaboto]] line to [[Villa Constitución]];
* the Middle Delta, from Villa Constitución to the [[Ibicuy Islands]];
* the Lower Delta, from the Ibicuy Islands to the mouth of the river.

The total length of the delta is about {{convert|320|km|mi}}, and its width varies between {{convert|18|and|60|km|mi}}. It carries 160 million [[tonne]]s of suspended [[sediment]] (about half of it coming from the [[Bermejo River]] through the [[Paraguay River]]) and advances from {{convert|50|to|90|m|ft}} (depending on the source) per year over the Río de la Plata.&lt;ref name=sarubbi/&gt; It is the world's only river delta that is in contact not with the sea but with another river.

The Lower Delta was the site of the first modern settlements in the Paraná-Plata basin and is today densely populated, being the agricultural and industrial core of Argentina and host to several major ports. The main course of the Paraná lies on the west of the delta, and is navigable downstream from [[Puerto General San Martín]] by ships up to [[Panamax]] kind.

==Rivers of the delta==
Among the many arms of the river are the Paraná Pavón, the Paraná Ibicuy, the Paraná de las Palmas, the Paraná Guazú and the smaller Paraná Miní and Paraná Bravo.

The Paraná Pavón is the first major branch. It has a meandering course that starts on the eastern side, opposite Villa Constitución. Between the main Paraná and the Paraná Pavón lie the Lechiguanas Islands. The Paraná Pavón flows east and then turns south to be continued by the Ibicuy, which itself gives origin to the smaller Paranacito River, a tributary of the Uruguay River that passes by [[Villa Paranacito]].

The Paraná de las Palmas starts around the mouth of the Paraná Ibicuy, downstream from [[Baradero]], flowing west into the province of Buenos Aires and then turning southeast again. The main course is continued by the other major branch, the Paraná Guazú. In turn, the Paraná Guazú sprouts two east-flowing branches in the territory of Entre Ríos: first the Paraná Bravo, and then the Paraná Miní.

==Climate==
[[Image:Delta del Paraná Sign.jpg|thumb|Each habitat in the Paraná Delta is named, not numbered.]]
Due to the low elevation and the ubiquitous presence of water, the Paraná delta is subject to a particular climate within the climate zones of the Pampas. As in the entire region, there are four distinct seasons; however, the Delta has slightly colder nights, milder winters and higher humidity, which allows some warmer-weather species to thrive.

Summers are hot and often muggy; with daily highs between {{convert|18|and|22|C|F}} and nights between {{convert|16|and|20|C|F}}. Heat waves are common, yet they are not as intense as in central Argentina, and usually temperatures will not go much above 36&amp;nbsp;°C (97F), although they have reached 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104F) in the past. Thunderstorms are common and can bring heavy rain and much cooler weather. As in the entire Pampas region, summers are "cut" by short, cool periods when southerly ''Pampero'' winds blow.

March is already noticeably cooler than the summer, and April is characterized by very pleasant weather: highs range from 21&amp;nbsp;°C (70F) to 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77F), nights from 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50F) to 14&amp;nbsp;°C (57F), and May is already generally cool, with chilly nights.

Winter runs from late May to late August. Temperatures usually range from 13&amp;nbsp;°C (55F) to 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64F), while nights go from 3&amp;nbsp;°C (37F) to 7&amp;nbsp;°C (45F), with lower precipitation but higher cloudiness and relatively common fog. As in the entire Pampas region, there are often brief, mild spells in the winter when the temperatures might reach 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77F), followed by much colder weather and frosty nights. Temperatures usually reach 0&amp;nbsp;°C several times a year, yet they rarely fall much lower than -3&amp;nbsp;°C (27F), with record lows approaching -7&amp;nbsp;°C (19F). However, generally speaking, the windy, humid weather makes it feel significantly chillier than indicated by real temperatures.

Spring is usually delightful, yet very sudden changes may occur: summer-like and winter-like temperatures often alternate, and there may be a large difference between day and night temperatures. It is also the season most prone to violent weather. October has the same average temperatures as April, with slightly cooler nights, yet extremes of heat and cold are more likely: frost may rarely occur, as may temperatures of 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95F), sometimes within the same week.

Precipitation in the region ranges from {{convert|1000|to|1400|mm|in}}, with two peaks in late spring / early summer, and late summer / early fall, and a drier, yet cloudier winter.

==Ecology==
[[File:Paraná Delta Nature 2.jpg|thumb|[[Erythrina crista-galli|Ceibo]] blossoms]]
[[Image:Paraná Delta near Rosario.jpg|thumb|Semi-flooded islands in the Upper Delta, off the coast of [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]]]
The flood plain of the river is part of the Paraná Delta and Islands Ecoregion. The original ecosystem, especially in the Lower Delta, has been heavily modified by deforestation, hunting, fishing and the introduction of foreign species of flora, as well as damaged by domestic and industrial pollution. It hosts species such as the [[marsh deer]], the [[capybara]], the [[neotropical river otter]], the [[Pampas cat]], the [[jaguar]], the [[coypu]] and the [[red-faced guan]], some of them endangered.

===Protected areas===
The [[Predelta National Park]], created in 1992, protects a sample of the Upper Delta. It is in the southwest of Entre Ríos, {{convert|6|km|mi|0}} south of Diamante, and has an area of {{convert|24.58|km2|mi2}}, occupied by low-lying islands subject to flooding, as well as lagoons and swamps.

The Paraná Delta Biosphere Reserve is composed of the second and third sections of the Islands of the [[San Fernando Partido|San Fernando]] Delta, located just north of [[Buenos Aires]]. It was declared a natural reserve in 2000 by [[UNESCO]].  It takes up {{convert|886|km2|mi2}}, of which {{convert|106|km2|mi2}} are the core protected area. It is an area rich in biodiversity, including species that find their southernmost limit of distribution, which makes the area interesting for the conservation of genetic diversity. The main human activity in this part of the delta is the exploitation of the willow forest for commercial purposes, and human impact is low. The region has suffered from a loss of human population and today there are only 3,600 inhabitants living there (2001). The establishment of the Biosphere Reserve aims at revitalizing the economy of the region at the same time as conserving the natural and cultural values of the area and support the investigation and study of the ecosystem with the possibilities of national and international investment in projects of sustainable growth and the grouping of the region in reference of organic cultivation and varied ways of land-forest production with certification of ecological quality.

The '''Rainforest Foundation US''' is a [[non-profit]] NGO working in Central and South America. It is one of the first international organizations to support the [[indigenous peoples]] of the world's [[rainforest]]s in their efforts to protect their environment and fulfill their [[indigenous rights|rights]] to land, life and livelihood.&lt;ref name="VerticalNews"&gt;VerticalNews. March 29, 2010. "J. Sabatelli Brazil Cosmetics Announces Partnership With the Rainforest Foundation US".&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the indigenous peoples of the world are holders of a specific set of rights and are also the victims of historically unique forms of discrimination is most completely/thoroughly enunciated by the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007. The Rainforest Foundation US works to protect and defend indigenous rights, thereby protecting the rainforests.

==History==
[[File:Raoni and singer Sting.jpg|thumb|upright|Sting and the [[Chief Raoni]] in 1989 in Paris.]]

The Rainforest Foundation was first founded in 1988 by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and his wife [[Trudie Styler]] after the indigenous leader of the [[Kayapo people]] of Brazil, the [[Chief Raoni]] made a personal request to them to help his community protect their lands and culture. The Rainforest Foundation's initial project was successful in coordinating the first ever privately funded demarcation of indigenous land in the region - 17,000 square miles of traditional land, the [[Terra Indigena Menkragnoti|Menkragnoti]] area, next to [[Xingu National Park]], was demarcated and legally titled to the Kayapo people by the Brazilian government in 1993.

Since then the Rainforest Foundation US, along with its sister organizations the Rainforest Foundation UK, The [[Rainforest Foundation Norway]], and the Rainforest Foundation Fund, have protected a total of 28 million acres of forest in 20 different rainforest countries around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;The Rainforest Foundation US  "[http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/about-us About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030195327/http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/about-us |date=2011-10-30 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==
With its goal of conserving the rainforest, the Rainforest Foundation advocates for the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of the rainforest, by providing project-related grants, capacity-building expertise and direct technical assistance to its local partners on the ground, including indigenous communities and grassroots organizations.

The Rainforest Foundation's current work is focused around three main issues:&lt;ref name="Our Work"&gt;The Rainforest Foundation US "[http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/our-work Our Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310110030/http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/our-work |date=2010-03-10 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protecting lands===
:The Rainforest Foundation believes that indigenous peoples can defend their communities, and their rainforests, against development pressures if they have secure rights to their lands and natural resources. They are not alone in this belief - it is widely accepted that indigenous communities are effective stewards of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Forum (ECOSOC) 2005 Ministerial Roundtable "[http://www.landcoalition.org/program/adv05ecoapa.htm Presentation by Martin Cheong] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018200656/http://www.landcoalition.org/program/adv05ecoapa.htm |date=2005-10-18 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indigenous Land Tenure and Tropical Forest Management in Latin America. Shelton H. Davis and Alaka Wali.
Ambio - Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Vol. 23, No. 8 (Dec., 1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;485–490&lt;/ref&gt; Securing indigenous land rights is particularly crucial to conserving the rainforest as many of the world's remaining large tracts of intact rainforests are found in traditional indigenous lands.&lt;ref&gt;John Vidal "[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/17/forests-endangeredhabitats Pay indigenous people to protect rainforests, conservation groups urge]" Guardian UK. 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:However, indigenous peoples are often not recognized as the owners of their land, even if they have lived there for hundreds or thousands of years. Without official titles, many indigenous communities have little recourse but to watch as government or corporate interventions profit from and sometimes even damage or destroy huge tracts of their forests without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;Models for Recognizing Indigenous Land Rights in Latin America. Roque Roldán Ortiga. The International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development/THE WORLD BANK. October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Moreover, indigenous groups face significant legal, technical and cultural hurdles to obtaining legal recognition of their land rights, including: inadequate national legislation, difficulties with accurate marking of boundaries, lack of good maps and documentation, historic discrimination, unfamiliarity with legal systems, and geographic isolation.&lt;ref&gt;TOO MUCH FOR TOO FEW: Problems of Indigenous Land Rights in Latin America. Anthony Stocks. Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 34: 85-104, October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rainforest Foundation US works with indigenous communities to overcome these hurdles.

===Building effective local organizations===

:Indigenous communities in the rainforest face frequent threats to their homes and livelihoods from land invasions, illegal resource extraction, and the undermining of their rights at the local and national levels. Indigenous peoples are often not respected, nor even recognized, as rights holders, and traditional indigenous governance practices and structures are not respected by local and national authorities or by outsiders interested in exploiting the resources of the rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF "[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=14935&amp;Cr=indigenous&amp;Cr1=people Latin America must fight discrimination against indigenous people]" 08 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Grey Postero, Leon Zamosc. The Struggle for Indigenous Rights in Latin America. Journal of Latin American Anthropology. Volume 11, Issue 1, pages 208–210, April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As indigenous peoples often lack the information, resources and technical skills necessary to exercise their rights and advocate on their own behalf, the Rainforest Foundation US funds and collaborates on various [[capacity-building]] initiatives of indigenous leadership and representative indigenous organizations. They provide technical support, legal guidance, and funding for community training workshops. These workshops train local leaders in building administratively and financially strong organizations that are capable of effectively managing social and [[economic development]] projects on their lands as well defending their rights. The Rainforest Foundation US also assists communities with formalizing their traditional governance practices to ensure that they are acknowledged and respected by local and national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Chino, PhD and Lemyra DeBruyn, PhD. Building True Capacity: Indigenous Models for Indigenous Communities. American Journal of Public Health. 2006 April; 96(4): 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influencing climate change policy===

:The Rainforest Foundation US works to provide indigenous peoples with independent and balanced information about climate change science, indigenous rights and international policy. They develop and adapt training materials, and fund local workshops and national level trainings for indigenous leaders. They also connect communities with the legal and technical expertise they need to analyze climate change policies and be informed and effective participants in local, regional and national policy discussions regarding climate change policy.

:[[Deforestation#Environmental problems|Tropical deforestation]] is responsible for nearly 15% of the world's annual [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. xi: Valentina Bosetti, Ruben Noah Lubowski "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Deforestation_and_climate_change.html?id=LxG6WUEz6LIC Deforestation and climate change: Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]" Edward Elgar Publishing, 2010. Science. 190 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; The world's existing rainforests are also massive [[carbon sink]]s, absorbing approximately 20% of the world’s CO2 production each year.&lt;ref&gt;Yude Pan et al. "A Large and Persistent Carbon Sink in the World’s Forests" Published Online July 14, 2011
Science 19 August 2011: Vol. 333 no. 6045 pp.&amp;nbsp;988–993. {{doi|10.1126/science.1201609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lousie Gray. "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/forests/4690299/Trees-absorb-a-fifth-of-carbon-emissions-pumped-out-by-humans.html Trees absorb a fifth of carbon emissions pumped out by humans]" The Telegraph UK. 18 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in recent years, [[climate change]] debates have focused increasingly on the need to develop international and national policies to [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|reduce deforestation and rainforest degradation]], known as 'REDD' programs.

:Indigenous peoples’ lands contain some of the last remaining expanses of intact rainforest on the planet, placing their communities in the center of major policy debates on combating climate change. Such climate change and REDD policies have the potential to provide significant social and economic benefits to the indigenous peoples of the rainforest. But, if poorly designed or implemented, these same policies risk establishing top-down models for forest protection, leading to an increase in conflicts over land ownership and the unfair distribution of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Barnsley. "[http://www.ias.unu.edu/resource_centre/REDDPocketGuide_web.pdf Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing countries, A Guide for Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229073116/http://www.ias.unu.edu/resource_centre/REDDPocketGuide_web.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}" United Nations University 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:In many countries government consultations have been rushed and have not allowed time for the communities to understand complex concepts and programs, seek independent consultations, or have adequate internal discussions to decide if and how they want to participate. Many agreements are being formed which violate the indigenous communities' right to Free, Prior and [[Informed Consent]] - a right enshrined by a number of globally ratified declarations and laws. (e.g. the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]). The rush to develop such climate change mitigation policies in several countries has also exacerbated existing problems with indigenous land rights.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, T. (2008). Seeing ‘REDD’ - Avoided deforestation and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. Indigenous Perspectives, 9(1–2), 93–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heike Schroeder.

==Current projects==

The Rainforest Foundation US is currently funding and collaborating on work in 4 countries:&lt;ref name="Our Work"/&gt;

:'''Brazil:'''
The territory of [[Raposa Serra do Sol]], located in the northern Brazilian Amazon, is home to an about 18,000 [[Macuxi]], [[Wapishana]], [[Ingarikó]], Taurepang and [[Patamona]] people.  For over 30 years these communities have worked together to gain legal recognition of their traditional lands and protection of their rights in the region. They have been opposed by cattle ranchers, rice growers, and others with economic interests in their lands, who have used violence and intimidation against the indigenous peoples to continue their illegal activities. The length of the fight and the severity of the situation, led the [[Roraima|Indigenous Council of Roraima]] (CIR), together with the Rainforest Foundation US, to file a petition for help with the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] in 2004. While, In April 2005, the Brazilian government formally recognized the indigenous people's rights to their land in Raposa Serra do Sol, with a decree which called for all illegal non-indigenous settlers to leave the territory some rice-growers refuse to leave and have retaliated violently against indigenous communities, leading to further court cases. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Brazil issued a decision reaffirming the rights of the indigenous peoples in Raposa Serra do Sol, and again mandating the exit of the rice-growers. There is currently a case  with the Inter-American Commission on Human rights focusing primarily on violence perpetrated against the community and impunity of those who allegedly committed acts of intimidation including physical violence against the communities.&lt;ref name="globalalternatives.org"&gt;Isabella Kenfield [http://globalalternatives.org/node/93 "The Dark Side of Brazil's Agribusiness Boom: Violence, Mutiny and Environmental Pillage in the Amazon"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

:'''Guyana:'''
::* The Rainforest Foundation US works with the Amerindian Peoples Association in [[Guyana]]. The APA is a national representative body of indigenous peoples in Guyana. The two organizations are working together to ensure that indigenous people are effective participants in the design and implementation of climate change programs, in particular [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|REDD]] programs, that could affect their lands and resource use and to ensure that there are viable economic alternatives for the Indigenous communities of the rainforest . RF-US funds have helped the APA: hold community level workshops that train indigenous peoples about climate change science, policy, and indigenous rights and also to hold media and advocacy trainings for indigenous leaders to become stronger advocates for their people. Nearly 80% of Guyana is covered in rainforests, and those forests are home to over 69,000 indigenous people who have been living in and managing them for centuries but who still lack secure tenure over their lands.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Forestry and Development "[http://forestryanddevelopment.com/site/2011/03/04/redd-in-guyana-lessons-for-emerging-economies/ REDD in Guyana: Lessons for emerging economies]" 04 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;REDD Monitor.org "[http://www.redd-monitor.org/2009/02/11/drivers-for-redd-in-guyana/ Drivers for REDD in Guyana]"11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guyanese Ministry of Agriculture"[http://www.agriculture.gov.gy/Bulletins/January%202009/Grant%20agreement%20signed%20to%20establish%20REDD%20Secretariat.html Grant agreement signed to establish REDD Secretariat in forestry sector]"January 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Panama:'''
::* The [[Embera-Wounaan|Wounaan]] people live primarily in the heavily forested [[Darién Province]] of eastern Panama. The Embera, Wounaan and Kuna currently are asking for 29 collective lands titles Eastern Panama, of these 24 have yet to be granted. These lands include significant swaths of untouched rainforest, as well as intact mangrove and lowland forest ecosystems, and ecologically important rivers and estuaries. However, the lands are threatened by the invasions of outsiders who clear forests for agriculture, cattle-raising, and other development projects. The Indigenous communities argue that they need legal recognition of their land rights in order to protect their natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Ahni [http://intercontinentalcry.org/echoes-of-the-future/ "Echoes of the Future"] Intercontinental Cry, Jan 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2008, the Panamanian Congress passed a law which will facilitate the demarcation of indigenous collective land rights, followed in 2010 by a law setting out all the steps necessary for recognition of collective lands. RF-US is working with the communities to formalize recognition for all 29 collective land titles covering over 1 million acres of land, by training communities in mapping their territories using traditional mapping techniques as well as drone and cell phone technology aided mapping and monitoring of territories.  Rainforest Foundation also provides assistance with legal work, community meetings, gathering necessary documents, and subsequent negotiations with the government. The Rainforest Foundation also engages in other projects as requested by communities; for example in 2014 lead a project to bring potable water to the now-titled community of Caña Blanca by installing solar panels to power a water filtration system.

:'''Peru:'''
::*In 2015 the Rainforest Foundation US helped the Ashéninka community of Saweto Alto Tamayo obtain title to 200,000 acres of rainforest land.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mongabay.com/2015/10/after-years-of-struggle-and-bloodshed-peruvian-community-wins-back-its-land/&lt;/ref&gt;  The community of Saweto engaged in a 12-year struggle to have their lands recognized. After 11 years of fighting for recognition, Saweto's leaders were brutally murdered in 2014, leading the widows and daughters to take on the leadership of their community.&lt;ref&gt; [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140911-peru-amazon-illegal-logging-chota-alto-tamaya/]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the murders, the Rainforest Foundation stepped in to help the community and has supplied legal counsel, aided the community in gathering documents and negotiating with the government to help the community of Saweto obtain legal title to their lands.  the organization has also supported the community in its demands for a full investigation of the murders of its leaders.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/31/justice-still-being-sought-for-murders-of-peruvian-forest-campaigners&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Rainforest Foundation helps with general advocacy and community training, and planning. The Rainforest Foundation also works with communities in Madre de Dios region in Peru and in 2016 is beginning program to protect 26 million acres of Amazonian rainforest in Southeastern Peru.

==Examples of past projects==
:'''Brazil:'''
::* The Rainforest Foundation US worked in the state of [[Pará]] with indigenous peoples, led by the [[Xingu peoples]], to inform local communities, through workshops and outreach events, about likely impacts from the hotly contentious [[Belo Monte Dam]]&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Anne Hughes.

::* The territory of [[Raposa Serra do Sol]], located in the northern Brazilian Amazon, is home to an about 18,000 [[Macuxi]], [[Wapishana]], [[Ingarikó]], Taurepang and [[Patamona]] people.  For over 30 years these communities have worked together to gain legal recognition of their traditional lands and protection of their rights in the region. They have been opposed by cattle ranchers, rice growers, and others with economic interests in their lands, who have used violence and intimidation against the indigenous peoples to continue their illegal activities. The length of the fight and the severity of the situation, led the [[Roraima|Indigenous Council of Roraima]] (CIR), together with the Rainforest Foundation US, to file a petition for help with the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] in 2004. In April 2005, the Brazilian government formally recognized the indigenous people's rights to their land in Raposa Serra do Sol, with a decree which called for all illegal non-indigenous settlers to leave the territory. Some rice-growers refused to leave and retaliated violently against indigenous communities, leading to further court cases. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Brazil issued a decision reaffirming the rights of the indigenous peoples in Raposa Serra do Sol, and again mandating the exit of the rice-growers.&lt;ref name="globalalternatives.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ww4report.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Indians of Raposa Serra do Sol"/&gt;

::* From 2000 through 2010 the Rainforest Foundation US partnered with the Organization of Indigenous Women of [[Roraima]] (OMIR) to build their organizational capacity so they can better defend the rights and well-being of the indigenous women of Roraima as well as to set up local sources of income in the form of local crafts markets. The organization also held workshops and informational sessions on priority issues to women, such as [[domestic violence]] and alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Rainforest Foundation US [http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/empower-indigenous-women-brazil "Empower Indigenous Women in Brazil"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420094111/http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/empower-indigenous-women-brazil |date=2012-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Panama:'''
::* The [[Kuna people]] live in the autonomous community of [[Kuna Yala]], much of which is made up of low-lying islands off the coast of [[Panama]]. Climate change will affect all indigenous groups in Panama, but the Kuna are particularly concerned since many of their communities are already experiencing serious flooding and are threatened by sea level rise. Panama is participating in both the [[United Nations|UN’s]] and the [[REDD#Active international organizations|World Bank’s]] large-scale [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|REDD]] financing programs aimed at combating climate change. Unfortunately, the government of Panama did not secure the free, prior and informed consent of their indigenous peoples before entering into these programs despite the fact that approximately 30% of Panama’s forests overlap with traditional indigenous territories.&lt;ref&gt;Asociación Indígena Ambiental [http://vh-gfc.dpi.nl/img/userpics/File/REDD/REDD-in-Panama.pdf "REDD in Panama"], Global Forest Coalition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Braun [http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2010/12/08/will_a_un_climate-change_solution_help_kuna_yala/ "Will a UN Climate-Change Solution Help Kuna Yala?"] National Geographic, Dec 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rainforest Foundation has worked with the Kuna people’s representative NGO to educate Kuna communities on issues related to climate change and REDD, and to ensure that their organization was able to advocate for the indigenous rights agenda in Panama and to bring an informed indigenous voice to bear on REDD policy designs and other development and forestry management programs.

::*In 2009 and 2010 the Rainforest Foundation US partnered with a number of indigenous organizations representing the Kandozi and Shapra peoples who live in Datem del Marañón Province, in Peru's northern Amazon, as well as with other NGOs, to find ways for the communities to exercise their legal right to healthcare to the Peruvian state. These communities lack access to all basic social services, particularly health care (a public good and legal right to all Peruvian citizens). They are also threatened by an epidemic of Hepatitis B, as approximately 70% of the entire population was infected in 2000.[38] The Rainforest Foundation US set up community workshops teaching indigenous peoples about their rights and providing them with legal advocacy tools and pro bono expert legal work. The advocacy was successful, and in 2010 government officials traveled to the area to investigate the situation.

==Funding==
The Rainforest Foundation US is a non-profit organization. The majority of its financing comes from grants from foundations and other non-profit organizations, the Rainforest Fund among them, as well as from individual and corporate donations.

===Corporate alliances and promotions===
The Rainforest Foundation US has worked together with various companies to promote their cause. Current alliances include:

* The [[Volvic]] "Drink 1,Give 10" campaign in North American markets. From June 27 til December 25, 2011, Volvic is donating 5 cents to the Rainforest Foundation for each bottle of Volvic natural spring water sold. 2011 is the 4th year of this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.drink1give10.com/ Drink 1 Give 10 Campaign Website]"&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 'philosophy' cosmetics company designed a "green ® multitasking shampoo, shower gel &amp; bubble bath" and is donating 100% of net proceeds from the sale of this product to the Rainforest Foundation US &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.philosophy.com/shop-for-a-cause/green-shower-gel-product philosophy green product website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202155/http://www.philosophy.com/shop-for-a-cause/green-shower-gel-product |date=2011-10-08 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Opel]] automotive company partnered with the Rainforest Foundation US for the Panamanian leg of their current "Project Earth" expedition, billed as an aspect of the company's environmental sustainability efforts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.opelprojectearth.com Opel Project Earth Campaign Website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910200525/http://www.opelprojectearth.com/ |date=2012-09-10 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
 Since 2008, the Rainforest Foundation US has received four stars out of four, with an efficiency score of 38.93 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7663&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 2002-2004 the organization was given zero stars out of four by [[Charity Navigator]], primarily because only 43-60% of funds during those years were spent on programs on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Pilkington. May 7, 2008. "[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/07/conservation.endangeredhabitats Sting charity criticized as he marks 20 years in rainforest activism]."

It overlooks the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rock of Monaco|url=http://travel.viamichelin.com/web/Destination/France-French_Alps-French_Riviera_and_Monaco-Monaco/Tourist_Site-The_Rock_of_Monaco-Avenue_St_Martin|publisher=Michelin|accessdate=9 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609165545/http://travel.viamichelin.com/web/Destination/France-French_Alps-French_Riviera_and_Monaco-Monaco/Tourist_Site-The_Rock_of_Monaco-Avenue_St_Martin|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The Rock has been a coveted possession from the beginning of the ancient [[Marseilles|Massilia]]n colony of Monoïkos ([[Ancient Greek Language|Greek]]: Μόνοικος), named for the [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes who occupied the area and vied for control of it; even earlier, it was a shelter for primitive populations. The Rock of [[Monaco]] was also the first conquest of the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] dynasty, the rulers of the country for more than 700 years, founded when the [[Guelf]] [[François Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]] disguised himself as a Franciscan monk in order to gain entry to the city and open the gates for his soldiers.

==Today==
Today, the Rock is in the oldest of Monaco's four quarters, [[Monaco-Ville]], which is also the location of Old Town, the oldest part of the city. This is not far from the [[Prince's Palace of Monaco|Prince's Palace]] ({{lang-fr|Le Palais Princier}}), home of the current [[monarch]] [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert II]] and the [[Monegasque Princely Family|princely family]], the [[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Monaco|Cathedral]] and the [[Oceanographic Museum of Monaco]]. The Rock of Monaco is a popular attraction where tourists view the palace and the changing of the guards.

[[File:AM426 Grettir.jpg|thumb|[[Grettir]] is ready to fight in this illustration from a 17th-century [[Iceland]]ic manuscript]]
[[File:Íslendingasögur.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail of a miniature from a 13th-century Icelandic manuscript.]]

The '''Sagas of Icelanders''' ({{lang-is|Íslendingasögur}}), also known as '''family sagas''', are prose narratives mostly based on historical events that mostly took place in [[Iceland]] in the 9th, 10th, and early 11th centuries, during the so-called [[Saga Age]]. They are the best-known specimens of [[Icelandic literature]].

They are focused on history, especially genealogical and family history. They reflect the struggle and conflict that arose within the societies of the early generations of Icelandic settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/03/1|title=The Icelandic Sagas: Europe's most important book?|last=Myers|first=Ben|date=2008-10-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually many of Icelandic sagas were recorded, mostly in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The 'authors', or rather recorders of these sagas are unknown. One saga, ''[[Egils saga]]'', is believed by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;''Egil's Saga'', English translation, Penguin Books, 1976, introduction by [[Hermann Pálsson]] and [[Paul Edwards (literary scholar)|Paul Edwards]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigurður Nordal]] had this to say in his edition of Egils saga: "This matter will never be settled fully with the information we now have. … As for me, I have become more and more convinced, as I gained a better understanding of Egils saga that it is the work of Snorri, and I will henceforth not hesitate to count the saga among his works, unless new arguments are presented, which I have overlooked."&lt;/ref&gt; to have been written by [[Snorri Sturluson]], a descendant of the saga's hero, but this remains uncertain. The standard modern edition of Icelandic sagas is known as [[Íslenzk fornrit]].

== Gaukur's Saga – A Lost Saga ==
The Saga of ''[[Gaukur á Stöng]]'' is believed to have existed but is now considered lost. The saga{{snd}} set in the anthology of sagas known as Möðruvallabók between ''[[Njáls saga]]'' and ''[[Egils saga|Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar]]''{{snd}} tells of a man named Gaukur Trandilsson who lived in the 10th century. Gaukur is mentioned in chapter 26 of Njáls saga. Icelandic professor and poet [[Jón Helgason (poet)|Jón Helgason]] managed to decipher a line that read "Let Trandilsson's story be written here. I am told that [Mr.] Grim knows it." However, the story was never put to paper. The Grim mentioned in the manuscript is believed to have been Grímur Þorsteinsson, knight and governor ({{circa|1350}}).

Gaukur is reported to have been an exceptionally brave and gentle man. He was the foster brother of Ásgrimur. However, it is said that he had a falling out with his foster brother, who ultimately killed him.

Gaukur must have been a well-known figure in Icelandic folklore as he is mentioned in not only Njáls Saga but also the Íslendigadrápa, a poem about the Icelandic heroes. He is also mentioned on a tomb in the [[Orkney Islands]], where a runic inscription translates to "These runes were carved by the man who was the most knowledgeable of runes in the west of the sea, using the axe that belonged to Gaukur Trandilsson in the south of the land".&lt;ref name="Naumann, Hanspeter 2011 p.326"&gt;Naumann, Hanspeter (2011); "Die Saga von Njal und dem Mordbrand", p. 326,  {{ISBN|978-3-8258-8416-1}}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The south of the land refers to Iceland.&lt;ref name="Naumann, Hanspeter 2011 p.326"/&gt;

== Explanations for saga writing ==
Icelanders produced a high volume of literature relative to the size of the population. Historians have proposed various theories for the high volume of saga writing:
* The unique nature of the political system of the Icelandic Commonwealth created incentives for aristocrats to produce literature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lords and Literature: The Icelandic Sagas as Political and Social Instruments|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03468750310001192|journal = Scandinavian Journal of History|date = 2003-06-01|issn = 0346-8755|pages = 1–17|volume = 28|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/03468750310001192|first = Axel|last = Kristinsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Negotiating Pasts in the Nordic Countries: Interdisciplinary Studies in History and Memory|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ds1wxJSGjQUC|publisher = Nordic Academic Press|date = 2010-01-01|isbn = 9789185509331|language = en|first = Anne|last = Eriksen|first2 = Jón Viðar|last2 = Sigurðsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because new principalities lacked internal cohesion, a leader typically produced Sagas "to create or enhance amongst his subjects or followers a feeling of solidarity and common identity by emphasizing their common history and legends".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Leaders from old and established principalities did not produce any Sagas, as they were already cohesive political units.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The production of literature was a way for chieftains to create and maintain [[social differentiation]] between them and the rest of the population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tulinius|first=Torfi|title=Torfi H. Tulinius Matter of the North Part 1.pdf|url=https://www.academia.edu/33208863/Torfi_H._Tulinius_Matter_of_the_North_Part_1.pdf|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Later (late 13th century and 14th century) saga-writing was motivated by the desire of the Icelandic aristocracy to maintain or reconnect links with the Nordic countries by tracing the ancestry of Icelandic aristocrats to well-known kings and heroes to which the contemporary Nordic kings could also trace their origins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  
* It has also been proposed that the Icelandic settlers were so prolific at writing in order to capture their settler history. Historian Gunnar Karlsson does not find that explanation reasonable though, given that other settler communities have not been as prolific as the early Icelanders were.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sagnfraedingafelag.net/2017/03/09/14.09.14/|title=Sagnfræðingafélag Íslands » Archive » Hlaðvarp: Gunnar Karlsson: Ísland sem jaðarsvæði evrópskrar miðaldamenningar|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early nationalist historians emphasized how the ethnic characteristics of the Icelanders were conducive to a literary culture, but these types of explanations have fallen out of favor with academics in modern times.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* It has been argued that a combination of readily available parchment (due to extensive cattle farming) and long winters encouraged Icelanders to take up writing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Historian Gunnar Karlsson has proposed the theory that Iceland's peripheral location put it out of reach of the continental kings of Europe and that those kings could therefore not ban subversive forms of literature.
* Historians Gunnar Karlsson and [[Jesse Byock]] have also argued that the Icelanders wrote the Sagas as a way to establish commonly agreed norms and rules in the decentralized Icelandic Commonwealth by documenting past feuds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Surveying]] in North America is heavily influenced by the United States [[Public Land Survey System|Public lands survey system]]. It inherits the basis of its land tenure from the United Kingdom, as well as the other countries that established colonies, [[Spain]] and [[France]].

==History==
{{See also|Surveying in early America}}
[[File:Virginiacolony.png|thumb|alt= See Caption|Map of North America showing historical claims for the Colony of Virginia]]
The first European Explorations of North America were quickly followed by territorial claims. The original colonies the made up the United States were granted royal charters that described the limits of the lands where the settlements could be located. Since much of the lands were unknown to Europeans, the grants allocated sweeping areas and were often later amended or superseded. As the population grew and the land was explored, the state borders were defined, like the [[Mason–Dixon line]], finalized in 1767.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition included a preliminary survey of the features of the western united states, resulting in maps of geographical features.

==Organization==
The current geodetic model of the earth used in the US is the North American Datum 1983, often called NAD83. The system is used to define horizontal co-ordinates of reference markers all over the US. Although created as a geocentric datum which originates at the center of the earth, more recent models of the earth have shown the origin to be 2.2&amp;nbsp;m off the centre of the earth. Elevation is recorded against the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88), which uses as its origin point Father Point, in Quebec, Canada. Error in the system is approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm per mile, resulting in a total error of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;m from one corner of the continental US to the other.&lt;ref name="NGS-NAD videos"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Status of Today’s Geodetic Datums?|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/corbin/class_description/NGS_Video_Library.shtml#Todays_Status|website=National Geodetic Survey|publisher=US Federal Government|accessdate=30 December 2015|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American [[Bearing (navigation)|bearings]] are quadrant bearings.

=== Licensing ===
Licensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders.

====Canada====
{{see also|Geomatics engineering}}
In Canada, land surveyors register to work in their respective province. The designation for a land surveyor breaks down by province. It follows the rule whereby the first letter indicates the province, followed by L.S. There is also a designation [[Association of Canada Lands Surveyors|C.L.S. or Canada lands surveyor]]. They have the authority to work on [[Canada lands]], which include Indian Reserves, National Parks, the three territories, and offshore lands.

The Canadian version of the PLSS is the [[Dominion Land Survey]].

====Mexico====
{{Empty section|date=June 2016}}

====United States====
Most of the US recognizes surveying as a distinct profession apart from [[engineering]].

[[Professional Engineer|Licensing requirements]] vary by [[U.S. state|state]],&lt;ref name="NCEES: Licensure"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCEES: Licensure|url=http://ncees.org/licensure/|website=NCEES|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have components of education, experience, and examinations. Most states insist upon the basic qualification of a degree in surveying, plus experience and examination requirements. In the past, candidates completed an [[apprenticeship]] before taking a series of examinations to gain licensure.

The licensing process follows two phases. Upon graduation, the candidate may take the ''Fundamentals of Surveying'' (FS) exam. If they pass and meet the other requirements they become a surveying intern (SI). Upon certification as an SI, the candidate then needs to gain on-the-job experience to become eligible for the second phase. In most states, this is the ''Principles and Practice of Land Surveying'' (PS) exam and a state-specific examination. SIs were formerly called surveyors in training (SIT).

Licensed surveyors usually denote themselves with [[post nominal letters|post nominal]]s. The letters PLS (professional land surveyor), PS (professional surveyor), LS (land surveyor), RLS (registered land surveyor), RPLS (Registered Professional Land Surveyor), or PSM (professional surveyor and mapper) follow their names, depending upon their jurisdiction of registration.

'''Tan Qixiang''' ({{zh|s=谭其骧}}; 25 February 1911 − 28 August 1992) was a historian and is considered a founder of the field of [[historical geography]] in Modern China. His ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', the eight-volume ''[[The Historical Atlas of China]]'', was published between 1982 and 1988.&lt;ref name="chen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iqh.net.cn/info.asp?column_id=1133 |script-title=zh:谭其骧的历史地理学研究 |author=Chen, Qitai |publisher=Institute of Qing History, Renmin University |language=Chinese |date=2006-05-20 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guoxue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/master/gujiegang/xr-tqx.htm |script-title=zh:谭其骧 |language=Chinese |publisher=Guoxue.com |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dfdaily"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tanqixiang.fudan.edu.cn/infoview.php?id=94 |script-title=zh:复旦纪念历史学家谭其骧百年诞辰 |newspaper=Dongfang Daily |language=Chinese |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in 1981.

==Early life==
Tan Qixiang was born on 25 February 1911 at the [[Huanggutun railway station]] in [[Shenyang]], [[Liaoning]]. Soon after his birth, he was brought back to his hometown of [[Jiaxing]], [[Zhejiang]]. After attending Xiuzhou High School in Jiaxing, he briefly studied [[sociology]] at the [[Shanghai University]] in 1926 before transferring to [[Jinan University]] (then located in Shanghai), where he graduated from the history department in 1930.&lt;ref name="guoxue"/&gt;

In 1930, he entered the graduate school of [[Yenching University]] in [[Peiping]] (now Beijing), where he studied under the prominent historian [[Gu Jiegang]] and graduated in 1932.&lt;ref name="guoxue"/&gt;

==Career==
From 1932 to 1936, he worked as a lecturer of historical geography and history at several universities in Peiping, including Yenching, [[Fu Jen Catholic University]], [[Peking University]], and [[Tsinghua University]].&lt;ref name="guoxue"/&gt; In the 1930s, Gu and Tan cofounded the Yugong Society (禹贡学会) and the journal ''Chinese Historical Geography'' (Chinese name ''Yugong'').&lt;ref name="chen"/&gt;

In 1940, Tan joined [[Zhejiang University]] and then relocated to inland [[Guizhou]] province due to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]], as an associate professor. In 1946, after the [[surrender of Japan]], Tan moved to [[Hangzhou]] with Zhejiang University, which was moved back to its original campus. From 1947 to 1949, he taught at both Zhejiang University and his alma mater Jinan University in Shanghai. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Jinan University was closed, and most of its departments were merged into [[Fudan University]]. Tan became a history professor at Fudan, where he stayed for the rest of his career. He was the head of the Department of History of Fudan starting in 1957 and became an academician of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in 1981. From 1982 to 1986, he served as director of the Institute of Historical Geography of China at Fudan University.&lt;ref name="guoxue"/&gt;

==''The Historical Atlas of China''==
[[File:The Historical Atlas of China.png|thumb|''The Historical Atlas of China'']]
His most important work is ''[[The Historical Atlas of China]]'', which is also regarded as the most significant work in the field of historical geography in China. He began working on the atlas in 1955 and partly based it on the work of [[Qing dynasty]] scholar [[Yang Shoujing]]. It took him more than 30 years to complete the work, and the eight-volume atlas was published from 1982 to 1988. The atlas consists of 304 maps covering the thousands of years of Chinese history until the Qing Dynasty and includes over 70,000 place names.&lt;ref name="dfdaily"/&gt; The atlas contains many maps that are politically sensitive, especially on [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. According to his student [[Ge Jianxiong]], Tan was under strong political pressure to make the historical Tibet appear smaller, but he insisted on being faithful to history, and his version was eventually approved by China's then-reformist leader, [[Hu Yaobang]].&lt;ref name="dfdaily"/&gt;

==Students==
His students include [[Wang Zhongshu]], who studied history with him at Zhejiang University and later became one of the most prominent archaeologists in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cssn.cn/44/4402/201110/t20111018_352049.shtml |title=王仲殊 [Wang Zhongsu] |language=Chinese |publisher=Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Fudan University, students [[Zhou Zhenhe]] and [[Ge Jianxiong]], now well-known historians, were the first two recipients of the doctoral degree in humanities (文科博士) in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/html/jiaoyu/7467158.html |script-title=zh:记全国首批文科博士周振鹤、葛剑雄教授 |language=Chinese |publisher=[[Wen Hui Bao]] |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cover of The Cold and the Dark, The World after Nuclear War (1984).jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''The Cold and the Dark'']]
'''''The Cold and the Dark: The World after Nuclear War''''' is a 1984 book by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], [[Carl Sagan]], and [[Donald Kennedy]]. 

==Background==
It makes dramatic long lasting climate predictions of the effect a [[nuclear winter]] would have on the Earth, an event that is suggested by the authors to follow both a city [[countervalue]] strike during a [[nuclear war]], and especially following strikes on [[Buncefield fire|oil refineries and fuel depots]].

The book was released following the highly publicised "TTAPS" study, co-authored by Sagan, which was published in 1983 in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/222/4630/1283 "Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions"], R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">'''Thermal infrared spectroscopy''' (TIR spectroscopy) is the subset of [[infrared spectroscopy]] that deals with radiation emitted in the infrared part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  The emitted infrared radiation, though similar to blackbody radiation, is different in that the radiation is banded at characteristic vibrations in the material.  The method measures the thermal [[infrared radiation]] emitted (as opposed to being transmitted or reflected) from a volume or surface.  This method is commonly used to identify the composition of surface by analyzing its  [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] and comparing it to previously measured materials. It is particularly suited to airborne and spaceborne applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3080">'''Tierra Helada''' (Spanish for "frozen land"), also known as '''Tierra Nevada''' (Spanish for "snowy land"), is a term used in Latin America to refer to the highest places found within the [[Andes]] mountains.

The ''Tierra Helada'' comprises the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[Suni (geography)|suni]]s, [[puna grassland|puna]]s and [[páramo]]s between the [[tree line]] and the [[snow line]]. The term ''tierra helada'' is accurate from a climatological standpoint, as its land is indeed "frozen", situated above the snow line. In the northern Andes, the latter is located at an altitude of approximately 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft (or about 4,500 m).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf Brigitta Schütt (2005); Azonale Böden und Hochgebirgsböden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182826/http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zech and Hintermaier, 2002"&gt;Zech, W. and Hintermaier-Erhard, G.

The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal ([[Altitudinal zonation]]) used following altitudes: 
*{{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} as the border between the tropical rainforest and the subtropical cloud forest
*{{convert|2300|m|ft|abbr=on}} m as the end of the subtropical cloud forest (''[[Yunga#Fluvial Yunga|Yunga fluvial]]'')
*{{convert|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} m as the tree line
*{{convert|4800|m|ft|abbr=on}} m as the puna end&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú. Edit. Universo S.A., Lima 1979.
