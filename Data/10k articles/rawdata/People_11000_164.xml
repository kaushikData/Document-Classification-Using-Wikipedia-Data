'''Absalom''' ({{lang-he-n|אַבְשָלוֹם}}, ''Avshalom'', "father of peace"), according to the [[Hebrew Bible]], was the third son of [[David (biblical king)|David]], [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King of Israel]] with [[Maacah]], daughter of [[Talmai]], King of [[Geshur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:25|NIV}} describes him as the most handsome man in the kingdom. Absalom eventually rebelled against his father and was killed during the [[Battle of Ephraim's Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:1–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
===Background===
Absalom, David's third son, by Maacah, was born in [[Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved at an early age along with the transfer of the capital to [[Jerusalem]], where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father, and of the people. His charming manners, personal beauty, insinuating ways, love of pomp, and royal pretensions, captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot, and had fifty men run before him.

Little is known of Absalom's family life, but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar .&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:27}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the language of {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:18}}, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance", it is inferred that his sons died at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/18.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on 2 Samuel 18, accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|11:20|NKJV}} says that Absalom had another daughter or granddaughter named [[Maacah]], who later became the favorite wife of [[Rehoboam]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=2 Chronicles 11:20 cev : Then Rehoboam married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom; 2 Chronicles 11:21 cev : Rehoboam loved his wife Maacah the most |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=rehoboam+maacah&amp;qs_version=CEV}}. A [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%2011:19-21&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-11435a footnote in the New King James Version] reads "Literally ''daughter'', but in the broader sense of granddaughter"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of Amnon===
[[File:Convito di Ansalonne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Banquet of Absalom'' attributed to [[Niccolò de Simone]] around 1650]]
Absalom's sister, who was also called [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], was raped by [[Amnon]], who was their half-brother. Amnon was also David's eldest son. After the rape, Absalom waited two years, and then avenged Tamar by sending his servants to murder a drunken Amnon at a feast, to which Absalom had invited all the king's sons ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13|NIV}}).

After this murder Absalom fled to [[Talmai]], who was the king of [[Geshur]] and Absalom's maternal grandfather&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13:37|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also {{bibleverse||Joshua|12:5|NIV}} or {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|13:2|NIV}}). It was not until three years later that Absalom was fully reinstated in his father's favour and finally returned to Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13–14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Joab]]).

===The revolt at Hebron===
[[File:InsideAbsalom'sPillar.jpg|thumb|Two views of the burial chamber inside the so-called [[Tomb of Absalom]] in the [[Valley of Jehoshaphat]], [[Jerusalem]], which has no connection to biblical Absalom.]]

While at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying, “See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you", perhaps reflecting flaws in the judicial system of the United Monarchy. "If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice." He made gestures of flattery by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He "stole the hearts of the people of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|15|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After four years he declared himself king, raised a revolt at [[Hebron]], the former capital, and slept with his father's concubines.&lt;ref name="Kirk-Duggan2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirk-Duggan |first=Cheryl A.|year=2004 |title=Pregnant Passion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_gW1I90G4MC&amp;pg=PA59 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004127319 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Israel and Judah flocked to him, and David, attended only by the [[Cherethites]] and [[Pelethites]] and his former bodyguard, which had followed him from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned [[Ahithophel]] (sometimes spelled Achitophel).

David took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the [[Jordan River]]. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, [[Hushai]], to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the battle.

===The Battle of Ephraim's Wood===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Yerushalayim Tomb of Absalom 1860s.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of [[Tomb of Absalom|Absalom's Tomb]] in Kidron Valley (1860s)]] --&gt;

A fateful [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim|battle]] was fought in the [[Wood of Ephraim]] (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absalom's head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it. He was discovered there still alive by one of David's men, who reported this to [[Joab]], the king's commander. Joab, accustomed to avenging himself, took this opportunity to even the score with Absalom.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absalom had once set Joab's field on fire&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|17:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then made Amasa Captain of the Host instead of Joab. Killing Absalom was against David's explicit command, "Beware that none touch the young man Absalom". Joab killed Absalom with three darts through the heart.

When David heard that Absalom was killed, although not how he was killed, he greatly sorrowed.
:''O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
David withdrew to the city ([[Mahanaim]])&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|19:32}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mourning, until Joab roused him from "the extravagance of his grief" &lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/19.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on 2 Samuel 19, accessed 12 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and called on him to fulfil his duty to his people.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|19:1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial===
Absalom had erected a monument near [[Jerusalem]] to perpetuate his name:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:18|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An ancient monument in the [[Kidron Valley]] near the Old City of Jerusalem, known as the [[Tomb of Absalom]] or Absalom's Pillar and traditionally identified as the monument of the biblical narrative, is now dated by modern archeologists to the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xDxCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT334&amp;dq=Tomb%20of%20Absalom%20first%20century&amp;pg=PT334#v=onepage&amp;q=Tomb%20of%20Absalom%20first%20century&amp;f=false|title=Zondervan Handbook of Biblical Archaeology: A Book by Book Guide to Archaeological Discoveries Related to the Bible|last=Price|first=J.

===Fiction===
* [[Georg Christian Lehms]], ''Des israelitischen Printzens Absolons und seiner Prinzcessin Schwester Thamar Staats- Lebens- und Helden-Geschichte'' (''The Heroic Life and History of the Israelite Prince Absolom and his Princess Sister Tamar''), novel in [[German language|German]] published in [[Nuremberg]], 1710.
* ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' is a novel by [[William Faulkner]], and refers to the return of [[Thomas Sutpen]]'s son.
* ''Oh Absalom!'' was the original title of [[Howard Spring]]'s novel ''My Son, My Son!'', later adapted for [[My Son, My Son!|the film]] of the latter name.
* ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' by [[Alan Paton]]. Absalom was the name of Stephen Kumalo's son in the novel. Like the historical Absalom, Absalom Kumalo was at odds with his father, the two fighting a moral and ethical battle of sorts over the course of some of the novel's most important events. Absalom kills and murders a man, and also meets an untimely death.
* ''[[Ender's Shadow]]'' references the story of Absalom and King David's lament. Bean, as he sends his soldiers on a suicide mission to destroy the Buggers, says to them, "O my son Absalom. My son, my son Absalom. Would God I could die for thee, O Absalom, my son. My sons!"
* The character of Absalom appears in [[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell|Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell]]''.
* Throughout [[Robertson Davies]]'s ''[[The Manticore]]'' a comparison is repeatedly made between the protagonist's problematic relations with his father and those of between the Biblical Absalom and King David. Paradoxically, in the modern version, it is the rebellious son who has the first name "David". The book also introduces the term "Absalonism", as a generic term for a son's rebellion against his father.
* The character of Absalom appears in [[Michael Cook (playwright)|Michael Cook]]'s ''[[The Head Guts and Sound Bone Dance]]''.
* Absalom appears as a prominent character in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''Yonadab'', which portrays Amnon's rape of Tamar and his murder at Absalom's hands.
* Absalom is a character in [[Michael Crummey]]'s [[Newfoundland]]-set ''Galore''.
* Absalom's attempted coup against his father David is explored in the novel ''Zoheleth'' by J Francis Hudson (Lion Publishing 1994).
* In ''[[Death of a Hero]]'' by [[Richard Aldington]], the narrator adapts the famous quote "O my son Absalom. My son, my son Absalom." During a discussion on the nature of war as the protagonist rides the train towards the WWI front lines.
* A scene in the Swedish writer [[Frans G. Bengtsson]]'s historical novel "[[The Long Ships]]" depicts a 10th Century Christian missionary recounting the story of Absalom's rebellion to the assembled Danish court, including the aging King [[Harald Bluetooth]] and his son [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]]; thereupon, King Harald exclaims "Some people can learn a lesson from this story!", casting a meaningful glance at his son Sweyn—whom the King (rightly) suspects of plotting a rebellion.

===Music===
* [[Josquin des Prez]] composed the [[motet]] "[[Absalon, fili mi]]" on the occasion of the death of [[Giovanni Borgia (1474)|Juan Borgia]] (Absalon being a further alternative spelling).
* [[Nicolas Gombert|Nicholas Gombert]] composed the two-part, eight-voice motet "Lugebat David Absalon".

This verse is also used in "David's Lamentation" by [[William Billings]], first published in 1778.
* [[Leonard Cohen]]'s poem "Prayer for Sunset" compares the setting sun to the raving Absalom, and asks whether another Joab will arrive tomorrow night to kill Absalom again.
* "Absalom, Absalom" is a song on the 1996 Compass CD ''[[Making Light of It]]'' by singer/songwriter [[Pierce Pettis]], incorporating several elements of the biblical narrative.
* The Australian composer [[Nigel Butterley]] set the verse in his 2008 choral work "Beni Avshalom", commissioned by the [[Sydney Chamber Choir]]
* During the finale of the song "[[Distant Early Warning (song)|Distant Early Warning]]" by Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Geddy Lee]] sings, "Absalom Absalom Absalom"; lyrics written by drummer [[Neil Peart]].
* [[David Olney]]'s 2000 CD ''[[Omar's Blues]]'' includes the song "Absalom." The song depicts David grieving over the death of his son.
* The story of Absalom is referred to several places in folk singer [[Adam Arcuragi]]'s song "Always Almost Crying".
* The San Francisco-based band [[Om (band)|Om]] mentions Absalom in their song "Kapila's Theme" from their debut album ''[[Variations on a Theme (Om album)|Variations on a Theme]]''.

* "Absalom" is a song on [[Brand New Shadows]]'s debut album, ''[[White Flags]]''. It is a mournful lament from King David's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brandnewshadows.com/_downloads/lyrics.pdf |title=Brand New Shadows |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708090903/http://brandnewshadows.com/_downloads/lyrics.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ajou Deng''' (born 22 March 1978) is a Sudanese-British professional [[basketball]] player. He is the son of [[Aldo Deng]], a former Sudanese politician and is the brother of [[Luol Deng]], an [[NBA]] player who is also his teammate on [[Great Britain national basketball team|Great Britain's national team]].

== College Basketball ==
The 6’11" [[Center (basketball)|center]] played his university basketball in [[Connecticut]] with the [[Fairfield University|Fairfield]] [[Fairfield Stags|Stags]] from 2001 through 2003 after two years playing for the [[UConn]] [[Connecticut Huskies|Huskies]] from 1999 through 2001. His career was known for not measuring up to the tremendous amount of hype that preceded his arrival at UConn. College Basketball analysts like Billy Packer and Dick Vitale once predicted that he could be the best player ever at UConn.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Professional Basketball ==
After graduating from Fairfield, Deng returned to Great Britain, where his family had been granted asylum, and joined pro outfit [[Brighton Bears]] for the [[British Basketball League 2004-05|2004-05 season]]. In 37 games Deng scored 428 points, an average of 11.57 per game, and averaged nearly 10 rebounds and 1.5 blocks. He started the following season with the [[Scottish Rocks]] before joining the Guildford Heat.

He played 37 games during the [[British Basketball League 2005-06|2005-06 season]], scored 398 points – an average of 10.76 per game – and had 6.43 rebounds and one block per game. Deng was named BBL player of the month in March 2006 and was a BBL All-Star that year as well. He won a [[BBL Cup]] winner’s medal with Brighton his first year as a professional.

Deng sat out the [[British Basketball League 2006-07|2006-07 season]] with an ankle injury. He underwent treatment in [[Chicago]], United States, where he stayed with his brother, [[Luol Deng]], a forward for the [[Chicago Bulls]] of the [[NBA]]. Deng returned to the Heat on 7 December 2007 to replace [[Carlton Aaron]], who had recently been cut by the team.

Deng left the Guildford Heat in February 2008 before the BBL Trophy Final to join [[Slavia Tu Kosice]] of Slovakia.

'''Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Nu'man al-'Ukbari al-Baghdadi''', known as '''al-Shaykh al-Mufid''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شیخ مفید) and '''Ibn al-Mu'allim''' (c.{{nbsp}}948{{ndash}}1022 CE), was a prominent [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] [[theologian]].&lt;ref name="Amali"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-amali-dictations-shaykh-al-mufid|title=Al-Amali, The Dictations of Shaykh al-Mufid|work=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christoph" /&gt; His father was a teacher (''mu'allim''), hence the name Ibn al-Mu'allim. The title "al-Mufid" was given to him either by [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the twelfth Shia Imam,&lt;ref name="Ak̲h̲tar1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ak̲h̲tar|first=Vaḥīd|title=Early Shīʻite Imāmiyyah Thinkers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1PYAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1988|publisher=Ashish Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7024-196-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by al-Rummani, a [[Sunni]] scholar, after a conversation with him.&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraemer|first=Joel L.|title=Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam: The Cultural Revival During the Buyid Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKU58ZcXAM8C&amp;pg=PA67|year=1992|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-09736-8|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the Shia community,&lt;ref name="Jane"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McAuliffe|first1=Jane Dammen|authorlink=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|title=Qurānic Christians : an analysis of classical and modern exegesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9khRsDDuX8C&amp;pg=PA59|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-36470-6|page=46|edition=digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a ''Mutikallim'', theologian, and Shia jurist.

He was taught by [[Ibn Babawayh|Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]], [[Ibn Qulawayh]], [[Harith al-Muhasibi|Abu Abdallah al-Basri]] and al-Rummani, and [[Sharif al-Murtaza]] and [[Shaykh Tusi]] were among his students. Only 10 of his 200 works have survived, among which are ''Amali'', ''Al-Irshad'', ''Al-Muqni'ah'', and ''Tashih al-Itiqadat''.

== Early life and education ==

Al-Mufid was born in [['Ukbara]], a small town to the north of [[Baghdad]], on 11th [[Dhul Qa'dah]] in 336 [[Islamic calendar|Hijra]]. According to Shaykh Tusi, however, he was born in 338{{nbsp}}[[Hijri|AH]],&lt;ref name="Amali" /&gt; and later migrated with his father to [[Baghdad]], where the [[Shia]] [[Buwayhid]]s were ruling. He studied with [[Ibn Babawayh]].

[[Sharif al-Murtaza]] and [[Shaykh Tusi]] were among his students. His career coincided with that of the [[Mu'tazili]] theologian and leader of the [[Bahshamiyya]] school, [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad|'Abd al-Jabbar]]. Al-Mufid was often attacked, and his library and school were destroyed.&lt;ref name="McDermott1978" /&gt;

He was also called Ibn Muallim, meaning "son of the teacher";&lt;ref name="Glassé1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlPuAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-063126-0|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muallim was his father. Among his teachers were the [[Shia]] theologian Abu Ali al-Iskafi, Abu Abdallah al-Marzubani, Abu Abdallah al-Basri, Abu al-Hassan, and Ali ibn Isa al-Rummani.&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992" /&gt;

Commonly known as the leader of the Shia,&lt;ref name="Jane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaykh Abu Jaʻfar Mohammad ibn Hasan ibn ʻAli al-Tusi|others= by A. Ezzati|title=Al-nihayah : concise description of Islamic law and legal opinions (al-Nihayah fī mujarrad al-fiqh wa al-fatawa)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FO6CBMZU5xgC&amp;pg=PR1|date=2008|publisher=ICAS Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-904063-29-2|page=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbridge|first=Linda S.|title=The Most Learned of the Shi`a : The Institution of the Marja` Taqlid: The Institution of the Marja` Taqlid|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FVf4V4aXWgC&amp;pg=PA216|date=6 August 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534393-9|pages=216–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mufid is regarded as the most famous scholar of the [[Buyid]] period and an eminent [[Jurisprudence|jurist]],&lt;ref name="Christoph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jane" /&gt; mainly due to his contributions in the field of [[kalam]]. According to [[Ibn al-Nadim]], who knew al-Mufid personally, he was the head of the Shia ''Mutekallimun'' in the field of kalam, and [[Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī|al-Tawhidi]], who was also personally familiar with al-Mufid, described him as "eloquent and skillful at dialectic (''jadal'')". His skill in polemical debate was such that he was said to be capable of convincing his opponents "that a wooden column was actually gold".&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992" /&gt; He was taught the Islamic science of [[hadith]] by [[Ibn Babawayh|Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]].&lt;ref name="Christoph" /&gt;

===His nickname "al-Mufid"===

It is said that al-Mufid earned his name "al-Mufid" as a result of a dispute about the relative merits of two events, the [[Ghadir Khumm]] and the Cave. Al-Mufid participated in a lecture given by Isa al-Rummani, where in a response to a question al-Rummani claimed that Ghadir Khum was based merely on ''riwayah'' (transmitted tradition), while the story of the Cave was based on ''diraya'' (knowledge). After the lecture, al-Mufid visited al-Rummani and asked him about [[Talha]] and [[Zubayr]], who had rebelled against [[Ali]], "a legitimate Imam". Al-Rummani responded that they had repented, and al-Mufid claimed that their repenting was merely based on ''riwaya''. Al-Rummani then sent al-Mufid to al-Basri, with a note nicknaming the bearer "al-Mufid" ("the Instructor").&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992" /&gt; However, according to [[Ibn Shahr Ashub]], in his ''Ma'alimul Ulamaa'', the name was given to him by [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the twelfth Shia Imam.&lt;ref name="Amali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ak̲h̲tar1988" /&gt;

==As a theologian==

Taught by Abdallah al-Basri, the [[Mutazili]] theologian and [[hanafi]] jurist,&lt;ref name="PowersSpectorsky2013" /&gt; al-Mufid adopted many theological opinions.&lt;ref name="Heemskerk2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heemskerk|first=Margaretha T.|title=Suffering in the Mu'tazilite Theology: ʻAbd Al-J̆abbār's Teaching on Pain and Divine Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kyEa2P1RFpgC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11726-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdermott believes{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} that al-Mufid's theology is closer to the old [[Baghdad]] school of Mutazilism than to Abdul Jabbar's late Basran system. His methodology is closer to that of the Baghdad school, and he seems to have followed the Baghdad school and Mutazilism in his views concerning such questions as God's unity and justice. However, al-Mufid differs from Mutazilism on the problem of [[Imamate]] and the position of grave sin in this life. Al-Mufid tried to defend the role of reason{{snds}}he described it as Al-Nazar{{snds}}and also disputed for the truth and put away faults with the help of argument and proofs. Also, al-Mufid believed that the task of a theologian was according to reason and argument. His views were adopted by his pupils, [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad|'Abd al-Jabbar]] and [[Sharif al-Murtaza]].&lt;ref name="McDermott1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=Martin J.|title=The Theology of Al-Shaikh Al-Mufīd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvFiAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Dar el-Machreq éditeurs|isbn=978-2-7214-5601-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===God's attributes===

Al-Mufid defined God's unity in this way:{{quote|I say that God is one in divinity and eternity. Nothing resembles Him, nor can anything be compared with Him. He alone deserves adoration. He has no second with Him in this, in any respect or connection.&lt;ref name="McDermott1978" /&gt;}} According to al-Mufid, all believers in God's unity, save for "some eccentric anthropomorphists", agree with this. Like [[Mutazili|Mutazilis]], al-Mufid rejected "the simple realism of the Ash'arite theory of attribution". However, al-Mufid and 'Abd al-Jabbar give different explanations of what an attribute is, and whether it is in an object or in the mind.&lt;ref name="McDermott1978" /&gt;

===Prophecy===
According to al-Mufid, there is an absolute necessity for [[prophet]]s, since in order to know [[God]] and moral principles man needs [[revelation]], and he noted that "every [[apostle]] (''rasul'') is a prophet but every prophet (''nabi'') is not an apostle". Although he took care to make a distinction between an apostle and a prophet as the [[Quran]] does, he did not believe that there was a difference in their functions, which enabled him to put the [[Imams]] on the level of the prophets and the apostles except in terms of their names.&lt;ref name="McDermott1978" /&gt;

===Imamah===
Al-Mufid defined the ''Imamiya'' as those who believe in the necessity of [[Imamah]], [[Ismah]] and personal ''[[Nass (Islam)|nass]]'', i.e., personal designation. He tended to the belief that the [[Imams]] are superior to all the prophets and apostles, with the exception of [[Muhammad]]. According to al-Mufid, Imams can "take the place of the prophets in enforcing judgments, seeing to the execution of the legal penalties, safeguarding the Law, and educating mankind", a definition which makes an Imam not only "the head of the community in administrative, judicial, and military matters", but an "authoritative teacher of mankind". This attitude regarding Shia Imam is the basis of other teaching in Mufid theology such as Imam’s immunity from sin and error, the necessity of having an imam in all the times and the way the Imam should be designated.&lt;ref name="McDermott1978" /&gt;

===His criticisms of Al-Shaykh al-Saduq===

On a number of occasions al-Mufid was a critical of his teacher, [[Ibn Babawayh|Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]], and his ''Tashih al-Itiqadat'' was a correction of al-Saduq's ''Risalat al-Itaqadat''. Not limiting himself to theological matters, al-Mufid rejected al-Saduq's resort to ''akhbar al-ahad'' (single tradition), particularly when a legal statement is to be issued. However, he did not object to al-Saduq's views concerning the extent of the [[Quran]]; he only criticized his views on the nature of the Quran.&lt;ref name="Jane" /&gt; Unlike al-Saduq, al-Mufid accepted "religious and speculative theology".&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992" /&gt; While al-Saduq allowed controversy "only in the form of quoting and explaining the words of God, the Prophet, and the Imams", reporting a tradition from [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Imam of Shia, al-Mufid believed that there were two kinds of disputation{{snds}}namely, "true" and "vain".&lt;ref name="McDermott1978" /&gt;

==Works==

Shaykh al-Mufid is said to have written 200 works, of which only a few more than ten have survived.&lt;ref name="Christoph"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcinkowski|first1=Christoph|title=Shi'ite identities : community and culture in changing social contexts|date=2010|publisher=Lit|location=Wien|isbn=978-3-643-80049-7|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9khRsDDuX8C&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his works are as follows:

== Death ==

Al-Mufid died on the third day of [[Ramadan]] in 413{{nbsp}}AH. According to the [[Shia]] writer [[Shaykh Tusi]], "The day of his death drew the largest crowd ever seen in any funeral, and both friends and foes wept uncontrollably". He remained buried in his own house for two years, after which his body was moved to [[Al Kadhimiya Mosque]] and buried next to his teacher, Ibn Qulawayh al-Qummi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-amali-dictations-shaykh-al-mufid/past-master-sheikh-al-mufid#account-his-death|title=The Past Master: Sheikh Al-Mufid|work=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McDermott |first=Martin  |author-link= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Irannica |title=EBN QŪLAWAYH, ABU’L- QĀSEM JAʿFAR |trans-title= |url= http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ebn-qulawayh|access-date= |language= |edition= |date= |year= |publisher= |series= |volume= 8 |location= |id= |isbn=|page=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is near the feet of two of the [[Shia]] [[Imams]], [[Musa al-Kadhim]] and his grandson [[Muhammad al-Jawad]].&lt;ref name="Ak̲h̲tar1988" /&gt;

'''Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Алекса́ндр Фёдорович Ке́ренский}}, {{IPA-ru|ɐlʲɪˈksandr ˈkʲerʲɪnskʲɪj|IPA}}; [[Reforms of Russian orthography|Russian]]: Александръ Ѳедоровичъ Керенскій; 4 May 1881 – 11 June 1970) was a Russian lawyer and revolutionist who was a key political figure in the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. After the [[February Revolution|February Revolution of 1917]], he joined the newly formed [[Russian Provisional Government]], first as [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]], then as [[Minister of War]], and after July as the government's [[List of heads of government of Russia#Russian Provisional Republic|second]] [[Prime Minister of Russia|Minister-Chairman]]. A leader of the moderate-socialist [[Trudoviks]] faction of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], he was also vice-chairman of the powerful [[Petrograd Soviet]]. On 7 November, his government was overthrown by the [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]-led [[Bolshevik]]s in the [[October Revolution]]. He spent the remainder of his life in exile, in Paris and New York City, and worked for the [[Hoover Institution]].

==Early life and activism==
Alexander Kerensky was born in Simbirsk (now [[Ulyanovsk]]) on the [[Volga River]] on 4 May 1881 and was the eldest son in the family.&lt;ref name=wwi&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Kerenski|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/kerenski.htm|publisher=First World War|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Fyodor Mikhailovich Kerensky, was a teacher&lt;ref name=wwi/&gt; and director of the local [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and was later promoted to Inspector of public schools. His maternal grandfather was head of the Topographical Bureau of the [[Kazan]] [[Military district (Russian Empire)|Military District]]. His mother, Nadezhda Aleksandrovna (née Adler),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=N. Magill |first=Frank |date=5 March 2014 |title=The 20th Century Go-N: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3sBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1944 |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=1941 |isbn=978-1-317-74060-5 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the first-name Nadezhda meaning "Hope"; her patronymic last or "maiden" name was Kalmykova), was the daughter of a former [[serf]] who had had to purchase his freedom before [[Emancipation reform of 1861|serfdom was abolished in 1861]]. He subsequently embarked upon a mercantile career, in which he prospered, allowing him to move his business to Moscow, where he continued his success, becoming a wealthy Moscow merchant.&lt;ref name=eternal&gt;{{cite web|title=Александр Федорович Керенский |url=http://eternaltown.com.ua/%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B8/2920/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725092037/http://eternaltown.com.ua/%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B8/2920/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mega.km.ru/bes_2004/encyclop.asp?TopicNumber=31562&amp;search=%EA%E5%F0%E5%ED%F1%EA%E8%E9 Encyclopedia of Cyril and Method]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerensky's father was the teacher of [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin)]], and members of the Kerensky and Ulyanov families were friends. In 1889, when Kerensky was eight, the family moved to [[Tashkent]], where his father had been appointed the main inspector of public schools (superintendent). Alexander graduated with honours in 1899. The same year he entered [[St. Petersburg University]], where he studied history and [[philology]]. The next year he switched to law. He earned his law degree in 1904 and married Olga Lvovna Baranovskaya, the daughter of a Russian general, the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2001/janfeb/features/kerensky.html A Doomed Democracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311025735/http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2001/janfeb/features/kerensky.html# |date=11 March 2007 }} Bernard Butcher, Stanford Magazine, January/February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Kerensky joined the [[Narodnik]] movement and worked as a legal counsel to victims of the [[Revolution of 1905]]. At the end of 1904, he was jailed on suspicion of belonging to a militant group. Afterwards he gained a reputation for his work as a defence lawyer in a number of political trials of revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Political Figures of Russia, 1917, Biographical Dictionary, Large Russian Encyclopedia, 1993, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Kerensky became widely known when he visited the goldfields at the [[Lena River]] and published material about the [[Lena Minefields incident]].&lt;ref&gt;The Lena Goldfields Massacre and the Crisis of the Late Tsarist State by Michael Melancon [https://books.google.com/books?id=ymYJfA3mx2kC&amp;pg=PA112]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Kerensky was elected to the [[Fourth Duma]] as a member of the [[Trudoviks]], a moderate, non-Marxist [[Labour movement|labour party]] founded by [[Alexis Theodorovich Aladin|Alexis Aladin]] that was associated with the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]], and joined a [[Freemason]] society uniting the anti-monarchy forces that strived for the democratic renewal of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/politics-and-society/aleksandr-kerensky/ | title=Prominent Russians: Aleksandr Kerensky | publisher=RT|location=Russia | accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/oas/oas_pdf/v51/p127_130.pdf |title=Alexander Fedorovich Kerensky |author=Medlin, Virgil D. |journal=Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Science |year=1971 |volume=51 |pages=128 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051142/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/oas/oas_pdf/v51/p127_130.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omolenko.com/en/rasputin/tatyana-mironova-belied-life-belied-death.htm Tatyana MironovaGrigori Rasputin: Belied Life – Belied Death]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Socialist Revolutionary Party bought Kerensky a house, as he otherwise wouldn't be elective for the Duma, according to the Russian property-laws. He then soon became a significant Duma member of the ''Progressive Block'', which included several Socialist Parties, [[Mensheviks]], and Liberals - but not the [[Bolsheviks]].&lt;ref&gt;TV-documentary "Russian Revolution seen from Russia" aired at Danish [[DR K]] 11.June.2018&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brilliant orator and skilled parliamentary leader of the socialist opposition to the government of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

On May 28, 1914, Kerensky appealed to [[Rodzianko]] with a request from the Council of elders to inform the Tsar that to succeed in war he must:
1) change his domestic policy,
2) proclaim a General Amnesty for political prisoners,
3) restore the Constitution of Finland,
4) declare the autonomy of Poland,
5) provide national minorities autonomy in the field of culture,
6) abolish restrictions against Jews,
7) end religious intolerance,
8) stop the harassment of legal trade union organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-libra.ru/read/351855-aleksandr-kerenskij-demokrat-vo-glave-rossii.html Alexander Kerensky. The Democrat in charge of Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rasputin==
In response to bitter resentments held against the imperial favourite [[Grigori Rasputin]] in the midst of Russia's failing effort in [[World War I]], Kerensky, at the opening of the Duma on 2 November 1916, called the imperial ministers "hired assassins" and "cowards", and alleged that they were "guided by the contemptible Grishka Rasputin!"&lt;ref&gt;''The Russian Provisional Government, 1917'': Documents, Volume 1, p. 16 by Robert Paul Browder, Aleksandr Fyodorovich Kerensky [https://books.google.com/books?id=LzWsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich]], [[Georgy Lvov|Prince Lvov]], and general [[Mikhail Alekseyev]] attempted to persuade the emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to send away the Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], Rasputin's steadfast patron, either to the [[Livadia Palace]] in Yalta or to England.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Kerensky (1965) ''Russia and History's turning point'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monarchists murdered Rasputin in December 1916, burying him near the imperial residence in [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. Shortly after the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Kerensky ordered soldiers to re-bury the corpse at an unmarked spot in the countryside. However, the truck broke down or was forced to stop because of the snow on Lesnoe Road outside of St. Petersburg. It is likely the corpse was incinerated (between 3 and 7 in the morning) in the [[cauldron]]s of the nearby boiler shop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804023731?lc=en Rasputin G. E.

==February Revolution of 1917==
[[File:Kerensky war minister.jpeg|thumb|Kerensky as Minister of War (sitting second from the right)]]

When the [[February Revolution]] broke out in 1917, Kerensky together with [[Pavel Milyukov]] was one of its most prominent leaders. As one of the [[Duma]]'s most well-known spacers from the monarchy and as a lawyer and defender of many revolutionaries, Kerensky became a member of the [[Provisional Committee of the State Duma]] and was elected vice-chairman of the newly formed [[Petrograd Soviet]]. These two instances, the Duma and the Petrograd Soviet, or their respective executive committees rather, soon became each other's antagonists on most matters except regarding the end of the Tsar's autocracy.

The Petrograd Soviet counted 3000-4000 members, and as their meetings drowned in a blur of everlasting orations, soon the '''Executive committee of Petrograd Soviet''' or [[Ispolkom]] was formed. Ispolkom was a self-appointed committee, with three members from all parties represented in the Soviet. Kerensky was one of them, representing the Social Revolutionary party.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes,1995, "The Russian Revolution", p104-106,s ''Swedish'' {{ISBN|91-27-09935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1.March 1917, without any consultation with the government, Ispolkom declared the infamous [[Petrograd Soviet Order No. 1|Order No. 1]], intended for the 160.000 men strong Petrograd garrison only, but which became interpreted to be valid also at the front. The order stipulated that all military units should form committees like the Petrograd Soviet. This led to confusion and "striping of officers", further "Order number 3" stipulated that the military, in every political perspective, was subordinated to Ispolkom. The ideas came from a group of Socialists and aimed to make the officers without power aside from the war. The socialist intellectuals believed the officers to be the most likely counterrevolutionary elements. Kerensky's role in these orders are unclear, but he participated in the decisions. But just like he before the revolution had defended many who disliked the Tsar, he now saved the lives of many of the Tsar's civil servants about to be lynched by mobs&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the Duma formed an executive committee which eventually became the so-called [[Russian Provisional Government]]. As there was little trust between Ispolkom and this Government, and as Kerensky was about to accept becoming Attorney General in the Provisional Government, he held a most passionate speech, not to the Ispolkom, but to the entire Petrograd Soviet. He then swore, as Minister never to fail the democratic values, and ended his speech with the words "''I cannot live without the people. In the moment you begin to doubt me, then kill me''". The huge majority (workers and soldiers) gave him great applause, and Kerensky now became the first and ''the only one'' that participated in both the Provisional Government and the Ispolkom. As a link between Ispolkom and the Provisional Government, the quite ambitious Kerensky could benefit from this position.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes,p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the first government crisis over [[Pavel Milyukov]]'s secret note re-committing Russia to its original war aims on 2–4 May, Kerensky became the [[Minister of War]] and the dominant figure in the newly formed socialist-liberal coalition government. On 10 May ([[Julian calendar]]), Kerensky started for the front and visited one division after another, urging the men to do their duty. His speeches were impressive and convincing for the moment, but had little lasting effect. Under Allied pressure to continue the war, he launched what became known as the [[Kerensky Offensive]] against the Austro-Hungarian/German South Army on 17 June (Julian Calendar). At first successful, the offensive was soon stopped and then thrown back by a strong counter-attack. The Russian army suffered heavy losses, and it was clear from the many incidents of desertion, sabotage, and mutiny that the army was no longer willing to attack.

[[File:KéresnkiEnUnDiscursoALosSoldadosDelFrenteMayo1917.png|thumb|left|Kerensky in May 1917]]

Kerensky was heavily criticised by the military for his liberal policies, which included stripping officers of their mandates and handing over control to revolutionary inclined "soldier committees" instead; the abolition of the death penalty; and allowing revolutionary agitators to be present at the front. Many officers jokingly referred to commander-in-chief Kerensky as "persuader-in-chief."

On 2 July 1917, the first coalition collapsed over the question of [[Ukraine]]'s autonomy. Following the [[July Days]] unrest in Petrograd and suppression of the Bolsheviks, Kerensky succeeded [[Georgy Lvov|Prince Lvov]] as Russia's Prime Minister. Following the [[Kornilov Affair]], an attempted military [[coup d'état]] at the end of August, and the resignation of the other ministers, he appointed himself Supreme [[Commander-in-Chief]] as well.

Kerensky's next move, on 15 September, was to proclaim Russia a republic, which was contrary to the non-socialists' understanding that the Provisional Government should hold power only until a [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] should meet to decide Russia's form of government, but which was in line with the long proclaimed aim of the Socialist Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;Party manifesto listed in McCauley, M ''Octobrists to Bolsheviks: Imperial Russia 1905‐1917'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; He formed a five-member Directory, which consisted of himself, minister of foreign affairs [[Mikhail Tereshchenko]], minister of war General Verkhovsky, minister of the navy Admiral [[Dmitry Verderevsky]] and minister of post and telegraph Nikitin. He retained his post in the final coalition government in October 1917 until it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks.

[[File:Kerensky.jpg|thumb|upright|Kerensky in office]]
Kerensky's major challenge was that Russia was exhausted after three years of its participation in World War I, while the provisional government offered little motivation for a victory outside of continuing Russia's obligations towards its allies. Russia's continued involvement in the war was not popular among the lower and middle classes, and especially not popular among the soldiers. They had all believed that Russia would stop fighting when the Provisional Government took power, and now they felt deceived. Furthermore, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[Bolshevik]] party were promising "peace, land, and bread" under a communist system. The army was disintegrating owing to a lack of discipline, leading to desertion in large numbers. By autumn 1917, an estimated two million men had unofficially left the army.

Kerensky and the other political leaders continued Russia's involvement in World War I, thinking nothing but a glorious victory was the only road forward.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing that the economy, already under huge stress from the war effort, might become increasingly unstable if vital supplies from France and the United Kingdom were cut off. The dilemma of whether to withdraw was a great one, and Kerensky's inconsistent and impractical policies further destabilised the army and the country at large.

Furthermore, Kerensky adopted a policy that isolated the right-wing conservatives, both democratic and monarchist-oriented. His philosophy of "no enemies to the left" greatly empowered the Bolsheviks and gave them a free hand, allowing them to take over the military arm or "voyenka" of the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets. His arrest of [[Lavr Kornilov]] and other officers left him without strong allies against the Bolsheviks, who ended up being Kerensky's strongest and most determined adversaries, as opposed to the right wing, which evolved into the [[White movement]].

==October Revolution of 1917==
During the [[Kornilov Affair]], Kerensky had distributed arms to the [[Petrograd]] workers, and by November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} On {{OldStyleDateNY|6–7 November|25–26 October}} 1917, the Bolsheviks launched the [[October Revolution|second Russian revolution]] of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Only one small force, a subdivision of the 2nd company of the [[Women's Battalion#1st Petrograd Women.27s Battalion|First Petrograd Women's Battalion]], also known as The Women's Death Battalion, was willing to fight for the government against the Bolsheviks, but this force was overwhelmed by the numerically superior pro-Bolshevik forces, defeated, and captured.&lt;ref name=gwar&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Soldiers in Russia's Great War|url=http://russiasgreatwar.org/media/military/women_soldiers.shtml|publisher=Great War|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolsheviks took less than 20 hours to seize the government.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

Kerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and fled to [[Pskov]], where he rallied some loyal troops for an [[Kerensky–Krasnov uprising|attempt to re-take the city]]. His troops managed to capture [[Tsarskoe Selo]] but were beaten the next day at [[Pulkovo Heights|Pulkovo]]. Kerensky narrowly escaped, and he spent the next few weeks in hiding before fleeing the country, eventually arriving in France. During the [[Russian Civil War]], he supported neither side, as he opposed both the Bolshevik regime and the [[White Movement]].{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Alexander Kerensky LOC hec 24462.jpg|thumb|upright|Kerensky at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] in 1938]]
Kerensky was married to Olga Lvovna Baranovskaya and they had two sons, [[Oleg Kerensky|Oleg]] and Gleb, whom both went on to become engineers. Kerensky's grandson (also named Oleg) played his grandfather's role in the 1981 film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Kerensky and Olga were divorced in 1939 and soon after he settled in Paris, and while visiting the United States he met and married 1939 the Australian former journalist Lydia Ellen "Nell" Tritton (1899–1946). The marriage took place in [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania]].

When [[Battle of France|Germany invaded France in 1940]], they emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160496b.htm Tritton, Lydia Ellen (1899–1946) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Kerensky offered his support to [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gEwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA76 Soviet's Chances].

She suffered a stroke in February 1946, and he remained there until her death on 10 April 1946.

The [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|local Russian Orthodox Church]]es in New York City refused to grant Kerensky burial, because of his association with [[Freemasonry]] and because they saw him as largely responsible for the Bolsheviks seizing power. A [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] also refused burial.

'''Ali ibn Hammud al-Nasir''' ({{lang-ar|الناصر علي بن حمود}} - al-nāṣir ʿalī ben ḥammūd) (died 22 March 1018) was the sixth [[Caliph of Córdoba]] from 1016 until his death. He was a member of the [[Hammudid dynasty]] of the [[Al-Andalus]].

He was named governor of [[Ceuta]] after 1013 by caliph [[Sulayman ibn al-Hakam]]. Taking advantage of the anarchy then existing in the reign, he conquered [[Tangiers]], also in [[Africa]], then, after occupying the Iberian port of [[Algeciras]], he moved to [[Málaga]]. After conquering also the latter, he moved with his North-African army to the capital, [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], capturing it on 1 July 1016. Caliph Suleyman was first imprisoned and then beheaded, when news arrived of the death of the former caliph, [[Hisham II al-Hakam]].

Ali was elected caliph, adopting the title (''[[laqab]]'') of ''al-Nasir li-din Allah ''("Defender of the Religion of God"). Initially the population welcomed him for his impartiality; however, later both his severity and the appearance of a ruler from the previous ruling dynasty of the Umayyads, [[Abd ar-Rahman IV]], his popularity fell down and he was assassinated on 22 March 1018. Abd ar-Rahman was elected caliph, but he was in turn ousted by Ali's brother, [[al-Qasim al-Ma'mun]], governor of [[Seville]].

'''Arbi Alautdinovich Barayev''' ({{lang-ce|Арби Алаутдинович Бараев}}; 27 May 1974&amp;nbsp;– 22 June 2001) was a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[warlord]], who in 1996 became the founder and first leader of the [[Special Purpose Islamic Regiment]] (SPIR) in [[Chechnya]]. 

Nicknamed '''The Terminator''', Barayev and the SPIR were regarded as one of the main violent [[criminal]] organizations operating in [[Chechnya]] during the lawless interwar period that followed the 1994–1996 [[First Chechen War]], driving out foreign [[journalists]] and [[humanitarian]] workers, while undermining the presidency of [[Aslan Maskhadov]] during Chechnya's ''de facto'' independence until 1999.&lt;ref name="Center for Defense Information"/&gt; 

After the restoration of [[Russian Federation|Russian Federal]] control, Barayev openly lived in his home village until he was killed on 22 June, 2001.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Arbi Alautdinovich Barayev was born on 27 May, 1974, in Alkhan-Kala, [[Chechen–Ingush ASSR]], [[Soviet Union]]. Barayev was a [[martial arts]] fan in his youth, and became a [[police officer]] in 1990 at the age of just 16.&lt;ref name="ARBİ BARAYEV"/&gt; In 1991, following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the subsequent declaration of independence [[Chechnya]] from the [[Russian Federation]], he became a personal bodyguard to his uncle, [[Vakha Arsanov]], the future vice president. Barayev also protected Vice President [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]], with whom he formed a close personal relationship, and [[Sultan Geliskhanov]], director of Chechnya's State Security Department.&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;Paul J. Murphy, ''The Wolves of Islam: Russia and the Faces of Chechen Terror'', p.68&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the [[First Chechen War]] began, where Barayev fought on the Chechen separatist side, and it was during this time he committed his first act of [[kidnapping]] when he and his men abducted for [[ransom]] a group of 29 Russian engineers from a [[power plant]] near the Chechen capital, [[Grozny]].

===Inter-war period===
The war ended in 1996, with a Chechen separatist victory establishing a ''de facto'' independent Chechnya. Barayev formed the [[Special Purpose Islamic Regiment]], where he and his associates became infamous for their alleged part in a wave of lawlessness which swept the devastated country. Crimes include including brutal killings and kidnappings as well as suspected involvement in two failed attempts to assassinate the Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]], and the successful assassinations of the Chechen interior minister Nasrudi Bazhiyev, and Shadid Bargishev, head of the newly formed anti-abduction service.&lt;ref name="kill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Littell"/&gt; The group, based around the town of [[Urus-Martan]], were linked to a series of high-profile crimes including the notorious murder of six foreign [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] employees shot dead in [[The ICRC hospital of Novye Atagi|the hospital of Novye Atagi]] in September 1996, as well as the kidnappings of [[Yelena Masyuk]], a Russian [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] journalist and personal friend of President Maskhadov, and Valenti Vlasov, Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s envoy to Chechnya. Other high-profile hostages allegedly kidnapped by Barayev included the [[Channel One (Russia)|ORT]] journalists Roman Pereveztsyev and Vladislav Tibelius, an [[Italy|Italian]] journalist Mauro Galligani, [[United Kingdom|British]] children-aid workers Camilla Carr and Jon James (during a failed operation to rescue them, the Chechen anti-kidnap unit commandos engaged in a deadly clash with "unknown terrorists", unofficially [[Salman Raduyev]]'s men; they were eventually ransomed by [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]) and others.

In 1997, Maskhadov signed a decree putting Barayev and his Special Purpose Islamic Regiment under the command of the Chechen interior ministry. Barayev, who also held the post of deputy commander of the National Guards, however refused to obey the order. When six of his men were detained in [[Ingushetia]], Barayev attacked an Ingush police post and took hostages; one of them was killed and the rest were prisoner-swapped. Two more of his men were captured in Chechnya and made to confess to kidnappings on the state TV. His militia and some [[Islamism|Islamist]] allies from Shariah Security forces fought with the Chechen government forces in a large-scale gun battle in the city of [[Gudermes]] in the summer of 1998. Between 50 and around 80 people were killed in the mutiny.&lt;ref name="crackdown"/&gt; The SPIR was not disarmed, but Barayev was stripped of his rank of [[Brigade General]] and declared as the "enemy of Ichkeria and the Chechen people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=159398&amp;apc_state=henicrs2002|title=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, Barayev proclaimed the Supreme Council of Islamic [[Jamia|Jamaats]], dug trenches around Urus-Martan and threatened to attack targets across and outside of Chechnya if Maskhadov tried to fight them.&lt;ref name="rebel"/&gt;

A commonly accusation against Barayev regarded the late 1998 abduction and beheading of [[1998 abduction of foreign engineers in Chechnya|four foreign mobile phone engineers]].&lt;ref name="crackdown"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/234180.stm Chechen president orders kidnap crackdown], [[BBC News]], December 13, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation]] (FSB) outbid the employers of kidnapped British engineers to get them decapitated by Barayev and his gang rather than be released; supposedly, the video and photographic materials of their executions fed the FSB anti-western propaganda efforts at beginning of [[Second Chechen War]].&lt;ref name="Littell"&gt;[http://www.psan.org/document551.html The Security Organs of the Russian Federation. A Brief History 1991–2004] by [[Jonathan Littell]], Psan Publishing House 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A former Russian hostage Abdurakhman Adukhov told the [[BBC]] that Barayev told him it was actually [[Osama bin Laden]] who paid him $30m for the atrocity, outbidding the ransom offer of $10m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1663278.stm Britons killed 'by Bin Laden ally'], [[BBC News]], 18 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Barayev himself denied that his group kidnapped and killed the foreigners.&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/TDT3/topic.research/topic3056.html|title=Current Projects - Linguistic Data Consortium|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Chechen War ===
In August 1999, Russia launched the [[Second Chechen War]] in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan]] by the [[Islamic International Brigade]]. Dagestan borders Chechnya to the east, and as part of the operation Russian troops entered Chechnya on 1 October to restore federal control over the country, effectively ending its ''de facto'' independence. In March 2000, during the early phase of the war, Barayev reportedly betrayed the Chechen field commander [[Ruslan Gelayev]] to the Russian military forces, resulting in the massacre of Gelayev's forces in the [[Battle of Komsomolskoye]].&lt;ref name="Littell"/&gt; According to another version, Barayev and his men merely [[bribed]] their way out of Komsomolskoye while leaving Gelayev and his people to their fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=23&amp;issue_id=1838&amp;article_id=17482|title=Programs - The Jamestown Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to the declaration of revenge on the part of Gelayev, whose fighters then blew up several houses belonging to Barayev in his home village of Alkhan-Kala near Grozny, killed a number of his men, and even attempted to assassinate Barayev in Ingushetia. According to federal authorities, more than 40 Chechens died as a result of these clashes.&lt;ref name="operation"&gt;[http://users.jyu.fi/~aphamala/pe/issue2/sanobar.htm "Russian anti-terrorist operation"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216170902/http://users.jyu.fi/~aphamala/pe/issue2/sanobar.htm |date=February 16, 2008 }}, ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]'', August 8, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechen surgeon [[Khassan Baiev]], who [[amputated]] a portion of the leg of [[Shamil Basayev]] after his injury on a [[minefield]], also had operated on Salman Raduyev and Arbi Barayev himself, however Barayev promised to kill him because he would also help wounded Russian soldiers. Baiev described Barayev as "''a born killer, and his men were [[Outlaw|desperados]] with blood vendettas proclaimed against them for murder. They joined Barayev for protection against the avengers in an endless cycle of violence. ... He owned a stable of expensive foreign cars, had several wives, and moved around with an escort of twenty to thirty guards. Everyone assumed that he was in the pay of Russian intelligence. Relatives of Arbi Barayev publicly denounced him for his crimes, saying that the family announced in the courtyard of the mosque that if anyone killed him, they would relinquish all claims. There would be no [[Feud|blood revenge]].''"&lt;ref name="Baiev"&gt;Khassan Baiev, Ruth Daniloff. ''The Oath: A Surgeon Under Fire.'' Walker &amp; Company. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8027-1404-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing death threats from Barayev as well as from the federal side, Baiev was eventually forced to seek [[political asylum]] in the [[United States]]. 

Following the Russian occupation of most of Chechnya, Barayev freely lived in Alkhan-Kala and frequently passed through Russian Army [[Security checkpoint|checkpoints]] without any problems, using identity papers of an FSB officer, and was also not included in the lists of people wanted "for participation in illegal armed groups".&lt;ref name="operation"/&gt; Once arrested, Barayev was said to be instantly released by the demand of Beslan Gantamirov, then the leading figure in the pro-Moscow government.&lt;ref name="back"/&gt; In May 2000, the Russian military intelligence [[GRU]] officer leaked papers about Barayev's affiliation with FSB to a Chechen journalist.&lt;ref name="Littell"/&gt; In April 2001, Barayev's men allegedly ambushed and killed [[Viktor Popkov]], a Russian dissident working in Chechnya as an [[aid worker]] and [[human rights]] activist since 1995, in the close vicinity of a military roadblock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/eng/memhrc/texts/app0302.shtml Appeal to the UN Commission for Human Rights], Memorial, 27.03.2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of State]], Barayev sent a group of his fighters to train in [[Taliban]]-controlled areas of [[Afghanistan]] in the spring of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaceinthecaucasus.org/reports/paper_statedepartment.htm |title=ACPC Reports |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426122632/http://www.peaceinthecaucasus.org/reports/paper_statedepartment.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On June 22, 2001, Barayev was reported killed during a raid by the Russian military special forces on Alkhan-Kala. According to a Russian military spokesman, 17 Chechens and at least one soldier were killed in the operation. The Russian media had reported his death several previous times, but every time he re-emerged unscathed; however, this time, the [[Kavkaz Center]] announced that "Special Islamic commander Arbi Barayev has [[Martyrdom in Islam|become a martyr]]." According to another version of Barayev's death, the GRU decided to eliminate him after the suspicious death of FSB chief Vice-Admiral [[German Ugryumov]], who allegedly provided cover for Barayev. In a well-prepared five-day operation, GRU agents recruited from Chechens in a blood feud with Barayev searched for him in Alkhan-Kala and then stormed a local FSB base where he ran for cover, killing an FSB agent in the process. Barayev was allegedly captured alive and then [[tortured]] to death.&lt;ref name="Littell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="back"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~aphamala/pe/2003/tsets-6.htm|title=The Background of Chechen Independence Movement VI: From the Dubrovka Theatre to "Black Widows"|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was given to his immediate family for a funeral (in contrast, when Maskhadov was killed in 2005, he was buried by the Russians in an unmarked secret grave), he was however barred from being buried in his home village by the local people.&lt;ref name="kill"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1406317.stm Russians kill Chechen warlord], [[BBC News]], 25 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4348273.stm Maskhadov body furore escalates], [[BBC News]], 14 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, the continuation of the SPIR carried out the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], led by Barayev's 22-year-old nephew and successor [[Movsar Barayev|Movsar]] and featured his widow [[Zura Barayeva]], both of whom died in the attack. The remnants of Barayev's group were reportedly integrated into the mainstream rebel forces following the theatre seizure.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Blackwell was born at Concho Indian Hospital in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]], on July 30, 1942.&lt;ref name=ada/&gt; He was raised in [[Tishomingo, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; His ancestry included Choctaw as well as Chickasaw. As a boy, he spent most summers with his grandparents, who were educators employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on the North Plains and New Mexico. This experience formed his deep ties to Picuris Pueblo in New Mexico and Loneman School on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Heals became fluent in Lakota, as well as the Chickasaw and Choctaw languages.&lt;ref name="WaPo-BlackwellObit"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?pid=162719189 "Charles W. Blackwell." ''Washington Post''. January 29, 2013.] AccessedDecember4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in education from [[East Central State College]] (present-day [[East Central University]]) in 1964, where he was named "Student of the Year" in 1964, served as editor of the college's newspaper, and was the founding president of the Epsilon Omega chapter of [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; After receiving his degree, he taught English at Window Rock High School in [[Fort Defiance, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="WaPo-BlackwellObit"/&gt;

In 1972, Blackwell received a [[law degree]] from the [[University of New Mexico School of Law]].&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; He held a position as a staff [[lawyer|attorney]] at the American Indian Law Center from 1972 to 1974 after graduating from law school.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; Blackwell then served as the Associate Director of the Special Scholarship Program in Law for American Indians from 1974 until 1977.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt;{{efn|Blackwell helped place more than 700 Native American and Native Alaskans in law schools throughout the U.S.&lt;ref name="WaPo-BlackwellObit"/&gt;}} He simultaneously became a [[Dean (education)|Assistant Dean]] and [[Adjunct Professor]] at the University of New Mexico School of Law, his [[alma mater]], from 1974 to 1977 as well.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt;

In 1979, Blackwell founded a group that was later named Native Affairs and Development Group and in 1985 relocated to Washington, D. C.&lt;ref name="WaPo-BlackwellObit"/&gt;

===Ambassador of the Chickasaw Nation (1995-2013)===
In 1990, [[Chickasaw Nation]] Governor [[Bill Anoatubby]] appointed Blackwell as delegate to the United States. He would serve as delegate until 1995, when Governor Anoatubby would elevate him to ambassador.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt;

The decision to send Blackwell to Washington D.C. as the Chickasaw delegate (from 1990-1995) and then ambassador (1995-2013) came after discussions between Anoatubby and Blackwell.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; According to Governor Anoatubby, "We agreed that there was a need for the tribes to revive a tradition of [[diplomatic relations]] with other governments...Appointment of an official ambassador helped to reinforce the formal government-to-government relationship the Chickasaw Nation had with the [[United States federal government|federal government]]. Over the years, Charles did a tremendous job of helping that relationship grow and improve."&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt;

In 1995, Governor Anoatubby appointed Blackwell as the first Ambassador of the Chickasaw Nation to the United States.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; Blackwell was not only the first Native American Ambassador to the U.S., but also the first tribal ambassador from any Native American government to the United States.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; He took office at a 1995 ceremony held in Washington.&lt;ref name=ada/&gt; Blackwell held the ambassadorship, which is based in [[Washington D.C.]], from 1995 until his death in office in January 2013.

During his tenure, Blackwell became a prominent advocate for Native American education, health and economic issues.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; Blackwell founded the First American Business Center, headquartered in Washington D.C. which promotes Native American economic development and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; He also served within the Western Governor's States Drought Coordination Council from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt; Ambassador Blackwell contributed to the [[Chickasaw Times]] as a frequent [[columnist]].&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt;

In 1997, [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Blackwell to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. He served on as the Council's only Native American member from 1997 until 2001.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt;

==Death==
Blackwell died in office in Washington D.C. on January 2, 2013, at the age of 70.&lt;ref name=kxii/&gt;&lt;ref name=ada/&gt; The cause of death was "...of respiratory complications following surgery."&lt;ref name="WaPo-BlackwellObit"/&gt; Chickasaw Governor Bill Anoatubby released a statement praising Blackwell, "Charles Blackwell embodied all the best qualities of a diplomat and statesman as the Chickasaw Nation Ambassador to the United States. He brought a tremendous level of wisdom, integrity, knowledge and passion to his duties as our emissary in Washington...As one who was fortunate enough to call Charles my friend, it is with great sadness that my condolences go out to his family and other close friends. This is a sad day for the entire Chickasaw Nation, as we have lost an irreplaceable friend and unrivaled advocate."&lt;ref name=anoatubby&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Chickasaw Nation Ambassador Charles W.

'''Elena Nicoladis''' is a professor in science and psychology for the [[University of Alberta]] in Canada. She is interested in how children acquire language as either monolinguals or bilinguals. She continues to do her research on the acquisition of the language and the morphology. Bilinguals hear less of each language than monolinguals so her interest is more focused on them because of their disadvantage in acquiring language.

== Selected research ==

=== The use of gestures in language to compensate or replace parts of the intended language ===
Elena Nicoladis is responsible for researching the use of gestures in language for those who seem to struggle with language. This includes: the elderly, a child learning their first language or someone learning their second language to become bilingual. Nicoladis and her colleagues were able to develop hypotheses around this subject and came up with some questions and answers that pertain. Their findings were that the use of gestures is found in the various groups to replace or aid in the absence and weak portions of an individual's language. Individuals use gestures called iconic or symbolic gestures which are gestures to depict the subject at hand without having to say a word. In other words they use this as their reference to what they are trying to convey to the audience. An example of an iconic gesture is when a child is flapping their hand to indicate a butterfly or when someone is moving their index finger and middle finger back and forth to represent someone walking (Nicoladis 2002). Ironically, the findings were that the people with more speaking experience, including: elders, deaf people, and bilinguals, used more iconic gestures in their speaking. Bilinguals use more iconic gestures in their native or stronger language and tend to use more conventional gestures. This was demonstrated using five second language with French as their first language and five with Swedish as their first language. (Nicoladis 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|date=2002|title=Some Gestures Develop in Conjunction with Spoken Language Development and Others Don't: Evidence from Bilingual Preschoolers|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1022112201348|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=26|issue=4|pages=241–266|doi=10.1023/a:1022112201348|issn=0191-5886|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main point out of this study is that gestures do help with the message that language tries to convey but the types of gestures and use is different for everyone. This does not necessarily mean that it is for assisting the absence or weakness of speech, rather that gestures are based on the higher proficiency of the language.

=== Syntactic awareness and judgment of monolingual-bilingual speakers ===
Nicoladis examines the syntactic awareness (children’s ability arrange words and phrases) of monolingual and bilingual children. She assesses their syntax through the grammatical accuracy of their sentences and by administering a vocabulary test. The study of syntactic awareness and judgment consisted of 39 French-English bilingual children and 51 English monolingual children all from Alberta, Canada. This study was intended to test two different predictions (Foursha-Stevenson, and Nicoladis).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foursha-Stevenson|first=Cassandra|last2=Nicoladis|first2=Elena|date=2011-11-07|title=Early emergence of syntactic awareness and cross-linguistic influence in bilingual children’s judgments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367006911425818|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|volume=15|issue=4|pages=521–534|doi=10.1177/1367006911425818|issn=1367-0069}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was that bilinguals were better aware of syntactic awareness compared to monolinguals. Nicoladis made this prediction because children have been shown to have experience assessing words and sentence arrangements from the age of two. This experience helps their language development because they have more practice with the language compared to monolinguals. Her second prediction was whether  bilingual children’s judgment of what is grammatically correct could be influenced by their other language. In the article Early emergence of syntactic awareness and cross-linguistic influence in bilingual children’s judgments, Nicoladis concludes that bilinguals produced higher accuracy scores compared to monolinguals (Foursha-Stevenson, and Nicoladis).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, on the grammatical accuracy,  monolinguals scored higher on vocabulary tests (Foursha-Stevenson, and Nicoladis).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Bilinguals must be able to  differentiate between two different languages which enhances their  attention for language choice. The results also indicated that language variability leads to greater susceptibility for cross-linguistic influence. Meaning that children’s judgment of what is acceptable syntactic structure can be influenced by the other language they speak. Children tend to link the two together when trying to determine acceptable syntactic structure.

=== Cross-linguistic transfer in adjective-noun strings by preschool bilingual children ===
In her study of bilingualism, Nicoladis investigated the effects of whether children who speak more than one language experience what is called “cross-linguistic influence”, which is when one language spoken by a bi/multi-lingual individual affects the way they use grammar in other languages.  Examples of this behavior would be different placements of object clitics in French-English bilinguals (Hulk, 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hulk|first=Aafke|title=The acquisition of the French DP in a bilingual context|date=2004|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/lald.32.12hul|work=Language Acquisition and Language Disorders|pages=243–274|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027252913|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; object dropping in Dutch-French and German-Italian bilinguals (Hulk and Muller, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hulk|first=Aafke|last2=Müller|first2=Natascha|date=2000-12-01|title=Bilingual first language acquisition at the interface between syntax and pragmatics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1366728900000353|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=3|issue=3|pages=227–244|doi=10.1017/s1366728900000353|issn=1366-7289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and verb-object compounds in French-English bilinguals (Nicoladis, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NICOLADIS|first=ELENA|date=2003-04-01|title=Cross-linguistic transfer in deverbal compounds of preschool bilingual children|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1366728903001019|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=6|issue=1|pages=17–31|doi=10.1017/s1366728903001019|issn=1366-7289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was performed with 89 children of preschool age (3;3-5;7), consisting of French-English bilinguals, English monolinguals, and French monolinguals. It found that its original hypothesis, that cross-linguistic transfer would occur in children due to structural overlap or ambiguity, was correct by showing that French-English bilingual children will reverse post-nominal adjectives more often than monolingual children. This objective of this study was not only to demonstrate that bilingual children engage in this behavior, but to close a gap of knowledge within bilingual research. Prior to this, studies had only been performed on experimental speech of children rather than the spontaneous. This study was performed with its focus primarily on the spontaneous speech of bilingual children.

=== Differences among bilingual and monolingual children ===

Nicoladis makes the claim that bilingual children are not disadvantaged but delayed in their language development since they are learning two languages simultaneously (Paradis &amp; Genesee, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|date=2011-02-07|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x|journal=Language Learning|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x|issn=0023-8333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, their vocabulary is much richer in one language over the other, an issue mono-linguistic speakers don't have. However, a longitudinal study of both monolingual and bilingual children would test if that assumption is warranted. Because of the diversity of child bilinguals, there are few studies that can address the possibility that young bilinguals might be delayed in language acquisition. Nicoladis also found that bilingualism doesn’t necessarily lead to delays in morphosyntactic acquisition. The main goal of this study was to test contrastively predictions of both the single‐ and dual‐route model for French‐English bilingual children's past tense production. As opposed to monolinguals, bilinguals are more likely to use perfect forms like “have seen” when they actually mean “saw” because of the influence of the periphrastic past tense in French; similarly, bilinguals are more likely to use single‐word imperfect forms in French rather than the compound past. Nicoladis et al. (2007) found no evidence of these forms of crosslinguistic transfer in their study on narrative. As a result, she infers that crosslinguistic transfer is not likely to affect the results of the study; that is, the bilingual children can be expected to be acquiring the past tense like monolinguals in their two languages.

In some religions, an '''exorcist''' is a person who is believed to be able to [[exorcism|cast out]] the [[devil]] or other [[demon]]s. A [[priest]], a nun, a monk, a healer, a [[shaman]] or other specially prepared or instructed person can be an exorcist. An exorcist is a person who performs  the ridding of [[demon]]s or other supernatural beings who are alleged to have [[demonic possession|possessed]] a person, or (sometimes) a building  or even an object.

==Exorcists in various religions==

===Catholicism===

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
In a Roman Catholic context, ''exorcist'' may refer to a cleric who has been ordained into the [[minor order]] of exorcist, or a priest who has been mandated to perform the rite of [[Exorcism in the Catholic Church|solemn exorcism]].

====The Minor Order of Exorcist====

Since at least the third century, the [[Latin Church]] has formally ordained men to the minor order of exorcist.&lt;ref name="CE-exorcist"&gt;Toner, Patrick. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05711a.htm "Exorcist"] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 21 May 2014 .&lt;/ref&gt; Text previously attributed to a fourth [[Council of Carthage (398)]], now identified as a collection called ''[[Collections of ancient canons#Statuta Ecclesi.C3.A6 Antiqua|Statuta Ecclesiæ Antiqua]]'', prescribes in its seventh canon the rite of ordination of such an exorcist: the bishop is to give him the book containing the formulae of exorcism, saying, "Receive, and commit to memory, and possess the power of imposing hands on [[wiktionary:energumen|energumens]], whether baptized or [[catechumens]]".

These exorcists routinely performed ceremonies over adults and infants preparing to be baptised. Authors such as [[Eusebius]] (3rd century) and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (4th century) provide details of these [[Minor exorcism in Christianity|minor exorcisms]]: Eusebius mentions the imposition of hands and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell, T. (1908). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03430b.htm ''Catechumen''] in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved May 21, 2014 from New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine noted that rites of exorcism by exsufflation (breathing upon the candidate) were also performed for the [[infant baptism|baptism of infants]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/15072.htm ''On Marriage and Concupiscence'' (Book II)]. Paragraph 50. Translated by Peter Holmes and Robert Ernest Wallis, and revised by Benjamin B. Warfield. From ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', First Series, Vol. 5. Edited by Philip Schaff. (Buffalo, New York: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1887) Revised and edited for New Advent by Kevin Knight.&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Exorcist was not a part of the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]] but as a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]] was instead first conferred on those who had the special charism to perform its duties and later to those studying for the [[priest]]hood.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Exorcist|author=Patrick Joseph Toner}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the twentieth century, the order had become purely ceremonial. As a minor order, exorcists wore the [[surplice]].

In 1972, the minor orders were reformed; men preparing to be ordained as [[Catholic priests]] or [[Deacon#Roman Catholicism|deacons]] would no longer receive the minor order of exorcist; the minor orders of [[lector#Ecclesiastical|lector]] and [[acolyte#Roman Catholicism|acolyte]] were retained, but redesignated as ''ministries''. It was left open to the Catholic bishops of individual countries to petition the Vatican to establish a ''ministry of exorcist'' if it seemed useful in that nation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html ''Ministeria quaedam''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103110807/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html |date=November 3, 2011 }}, II: "The orders hitherto called minor are henceforth to be spoken of as 'ministries'."&lt;/ref&gt;

The rite of conferral continues in societies that use the 1962 (or earlier) form of the [[Roman Rite]], such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St Peter]], [[Society of St. Pius X]], and also among groups not in communion with the current Bishop of Rome, such as the [[Society of St Pius V]]. Some believe{{Who|date=May 2014}} that attainment of the position of Acolyte in post-Council practices implies ordination to the minor orders which used to be below it, such as Exorcist and Porter, although this has not been officially defined (although Canon Law section 1009 does specifically state that the only "orders are the episcopate, the priesthood and the diaconate").

The Eastern Churches did not establish a minor order of exorcist, but simply recognised the calling of lay or ordained members of the faithful who had the appropriate [[spiritual gifts]].&lt;ref name="CE-exorcist" /&gt; In principle, every Christian has the power to command demons and drive them out in the name of Christ.&lt;ref name="Moshe Sluhovsky – Lay Exorcists"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fPGyeVQfgCUC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=Believe Not Every Spirit: Possession, Mysticism, &amp; Discernment in Early Modern Catholicism|quote= Yet we have seen that Johannes Nider and Heinrich Kramer found nothing wrong with the performance of exorcism by laypeople, as long as they did not usurp the clerical rite, which included some prayers only a priest could pronounce. Every Christian, Nider reminded his readers, had the power to command demons and drive them out in the name of Christ, but lay exorcists should be extremely careful not to use unknown characters and charms, and should be aware that the only mode to adjure demons is the imperative and never the supplicative.|publisher =University of Chicago Press|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mandated Exorcists====

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: "Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and office of exorcizing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm#1673 Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 1673.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1917 Code of Canon Law&lt;ref name="Church2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catholic Church|title=The 1917 Or Pio-Benedictine Code of Canon Law: In English Translation with Extensive Scholarly Apparatus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XbtF6Y21LUC&amp;pg=PA394|year=2001|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-0-89870-831-8|pages=394 (Canon 1151)}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly stated that the solemn exorcism of a person believed to be [[demonic possession|possessed]] may only be performed with the express authorisation of the local bishop or equivalent; 'this permission is only to be given to priests of the highest repute'. The revised 1983 Code of Canon Law similarly stated that the bishop is 'to give this permission only to a [[presbyter]] who has piety, knowledge, prudence, and integrity of life.'&lt;ref&gt;1983 Code of Canon Law, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P48.HTM Canon 1172]. Accessed 21 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church's [[Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications|Rite of Exorcism]] was revised in 1999. Paragraph 13 of its introduction states that a priest can be appointed by the local Bishop either for a single act of exorcism, or to the permanent position of 'exorcist'. The Rite then specifies that whenever it uses the word ''exorcist'' without qualification, it indicates a priest mandated in this way.

Among notable exorcists, [[Gabriele Amorth]] served as chief exorcist of the [[Diocese of Rome]]; he was the founder of the [[International Association of Exorcists]].

===Hinduism ===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
[[File:Kashtbhanjan.jpg|thumb|The image of [[Hanuman]] at the [[Shri Hanuman Mandir, Sarangpur|Hanuman temple in Sarangpur]] is said to be so powerful that a mere look at it by people affected by evil spirits, drives the evil spirits out of the people affected&lt;ref name="isbn0391024809"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rajaram Narayan Saletore | title=Indian witchcraft | publisher=Abhinav Publications | location= | year=1981 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETz3_bv8t0cC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=hanuman+sarangpur&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a# |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=May 14, 2009|page = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Beliefs and practices pertaining to the practice of exorcism are prominently connected with the ancient Dravidians in the south. Of the four [[Vedas]] (holy books of the Hindus), the [[Atharva Veda]] is said to contain the secrets related to magic and medicine. Many of the rituals described in this book are for casting out demons and evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werner|1994|p=166}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|1974|pp=25–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are particularly strong and practiced in [[West Bengal]], [[Odisha]] and southern states like [[Kerala]].

[[Vaishnava]] traditions also employ a recitation of names of Lord [[Narasimha]] and reading scriptures (notably [[Bhagavata Purana]]) aloud.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} According to [[Gita Mahatmya]] of [[Padma Purana]], reading the 3rd, 7th and 8th chapter of [[Bhagavad Gita]] and mentally offering the result to departed persons helps them to get released from their ghostly situation. [[Bhajan|Kirtan]], continuous playing of mantras, keeping scriptures and holy pictures of the deities (Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti etc. but especially of Narasimha) in the house, burning incense offered during a [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]], sprinkling water from holy rivers, and blowing conches used in ''puja'' are other effective practices.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Main Puranic resource on ghost- and death-related information is [[Garuda Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Emotional Exorcism: Expelling the Four Psychological Demons That Make Us Backslide|page=6|author=Holly A. Hunt|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gamaliel Bailey by Brady, 1857.jpg|thumb|Gamaliel Bailey in 1857]]
'''Gamaliel Bailey''' (December 3, 1807 &amp;ndash; June 5, 1859) was an American journalist, editor and publisher, working primarily in [[Cincinnati]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] An [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], he supported journalism that promoted the cause, persisting despite violent mob attacks on his offices in both cities during the 1840s.

==Biography==
Born and raised in [[Mount Holly Township, New Jersey]] in 1807, Bailey moved with his family to [[Philadelphia]] at the age of nine.{{sfn|Folsom|Ogden|1921|page=321}} He was educated at home and in local schools.

Bailey graduated from the [[Thomas Jefferson University#Jefferson Medical College|Jefferson Medical College]], [[Philadelphia]], in 1827. He moved to [[Baltimore]], where he served as editor of the ''Methodist Protestant'', a religious journal.

In 1831, Bailey moved to [[Cincinnati]], where he set up a medical practice. He also lectured on [[physiology]] at the [[Lane Theological Seminary]]. Attending the Lane Seminary debates in February 1834 between pro-slavery and the anti-slavery students, he became an ardent abolitionist. The anti-slavery students withdrew from the seminary in protest for its refusal to condemn slavery.

In 1836, Bailey joined [[James G. Birney]] in the editorial control of [[The Philanthropist (Cincinnati, Ohio)|the Philanthropist]] which was the official newspaper of the [[Ohio Anti-Slavery Society]]. The following year he succeeded Birney as editor. He directed the paper in publishing anti-slavery articles until 1847, in spite of threats and acts of violence&amp;ndash;the printing office of the ''Philanthropist'' was wrecked three times by pro-slavery mobs.

Beginning in 1843, Bailey also edited a daily paper, the ''Herald.'' In 1847, he assumed control of the new abolitionist publication, the ''[[National Era]],'' in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Gamaliel_Bailey|title=Gamaliel Bailey - Ohio History Central|website=www.ohiohistorycentral.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His offices were attacked by pro-slavery mobs; in 1848, he and his printers were under siege for three days as a mob held them hostage. This paper had a considerable circulation nationally. In 1851—1852, it published [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]],'' in serial form.

In 1859, Bailey died at the age of 51 at sea aboard the steamship ''Arago'' while en route to Europe.{{sfn|Folsom|Ogden|1921|page=322}} His body was originally buried in [[Congressional Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C. His wife, Margaret, died in 1888 and was buried at [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]], across the city. Bailey's son, Marcellus, had his father's remained disinterred and reburied in an unmarked grave next to Margaret.

==Early life==
Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (née Menzies) and [[William Newsom|William Alfred Newsom III]], a retired state [[appeal]]s court justice and attorney for [[Getty Oil]]. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman [[Thomas Addis]], was a pioneer scientist in the field of [[nephrology]] and a professor of medicine at [[Stanford University]]. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician [[Joanna Newsom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jody|last=Rosen|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07Newsom-t.html|title=Joanna Newsom, the Changeling|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 3, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newsom's parents separated when he was two and divorced in 1972. At age ten, Newsom moved with his mother and sister to nearby [[Marin County, California|Marin County]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/07/MNG313I2O41.DTL|title=Gonzalez, Newsom: What makes them run From modest beginnings, Newsom finds connections for business, political success|author=Julian Guthrie|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=December 7, 2003|accessdate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Port"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/02/23/MN245262.DTL|title=Newsom's Portfolio: Mayoral hopeful has parlayed Getty money, family ties and political connections into local prominence|author1=Chuck Finnie|date=March 23, 2003|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=March 11, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220060224/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2003%2F02%2F23%2FMN245262.DTL|archivedate=February 20, 2008|deadurl=yes|author2=Rachel Gordon|author3=Lance Williams|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Gavin-Newsom-Descended-from-King-of-France-117421858.html|title=Gavin Newsom Descended from King of France?|work=NBC Bay Area|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2002, he assisted in his mother's own suicide ("we gave her the drugs") following a five-year fight with [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Catherine|last=Bigelow|url=https://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Newsoms-fulfill-mom-s-last-wish-with-charity-3282408.php|title=Gavin Newsom, the Next Head of the California Resistance|publisher=[[sfgate.com]]|date=November 1, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Newsom later reflected that he did not have an easy childhood,&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt; he attended kindergarten and first grade at the French American bilingual school in San Francisco. He eventually transferred because of severe [[dyslexia]] that still affects him. His dyslexia has made it difficult for him to write, spell, read and [[Dyscalculia|work with numbers]].&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt; He attended third through fifth grades at Notre Dame des Victoires, where he was placed in remedial reading classes.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; In [[high school]], Newsom played [[basketball]] and [[baseball]] and graduated from [[Redwood High School (Larkspur)|Redwood High School]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Newsom was an outfielder in baseball and his baseball skills placed him on the cover of the ''[[Marin Independent Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

Tessa Newsom worked three jobs to support Gavin and his sister Hilary Newsom Callan, who is the president of the PlumpJack Group, named after the opera ''Plump Jack'' composed by family friend [[Gordon Getty]]. In an interview with ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', his sister recalled Christmas holidays when their mother told them there wouldn't be any gifts.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Tessa opened their home to foster children, instilling in Newsom the importance of public service.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/01/23/CMGD9AHK721.DTL|title=Newsom in Four Acts What shaped the man who took on homelessness, gay marriage, Bayview-Hunters Point and the hotel strike in one year|date=January 23, 2005|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|author=Mike Weiss|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's finances were strapped in part because of his tendency to give away his earnings.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt; Newsom worked several jobs in high school to help support his family.&lt;ref name="Reflects"/&gt;

Newsom attended [[Santa Clara University]] on a partial baseball scholarship, where he graduated in 1989 with a [[Bachelor of Sciences|B.S.]] in [[political science]]. Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara, but he threw his arm out after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since.&lt;ref name="Way"/&gt; He lived in the Alameda Apartments, which he later compared to living in a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] approach of Santa Clara that he said has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy. While in school, Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Santa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.thesantaclara.com/media/storage/paper946/news/2008/02/14/News/San-Franciscos.Gavin.Newsom.Sits.Down.With.The.Santa.Clara-3210314.shtml|title=San Francisco's Gavin Newsom sits down with The Santa Clara Newsom discusses how Santa Clara guides his career|author=Boffi|first=Kristen|date=April 12, 2008|work=The Santa Clara|accessdate=April 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426073753/http://media.www.thesantaclara.com/media/storage/paper946/news/2008/02/14/News/San-Franciscos.Gavin.Newsom.Sits.Down.With.The.Santa.Clara-3210314.shtml|archive-date=April 26, 2009|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newsom's aunt was married to [[Ron Pelosi]], the brother-in-law of former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt;

==Business career==
On May 14, 1991, Newsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. In 1992, the group started the [[PlumpJack Winery]] with the financial help&lt;ref name="SFWeekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2003-04-02/news/bringing-up-baby-gavin|title=Bringing Up Baby Gavin|last=Byrne|first=Peter|date=April 2, 2003|work=SF Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his family friend [[Gordon Getty]]. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses.&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt; Getty told the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of "the success of the first."&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt;

One of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Health Department requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store. The Health Department argued that wine was a food and required the store to install a $27,000 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'': "That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through."&lt;ref name="Way"/&gt;

The business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Café, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Café (1994), a [[PlumpJack Winery|winery]] in [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]] (1995), the Balboa Café Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Café at Squaw Valley (2000).&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt; Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Newsom's annual income was greater than $429,000 from 1996 to 2001.&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt; In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than $6.9 million.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Newsom gave a monthly $50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, "There can be no success without failure."&lt;ref name="Way"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1997/03/11/BUSINESS14992.dtl|title=Newsom's Way: He hopes business success can translate to public service |author= George Raine|work=[[The San Francisco Examiner]]|date=March 11, 1997|accessdate=March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco that included the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is currently the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between $141,000 and $251,000 in 2007 from his business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/01/BAC1VTCK2.DTL|title=Mayor has financial holdings at Napa, Tahoe|author=Cecilia M.

==Early political career==
Newsom's first political experience came when he volunteered for [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]]'s successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café.&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt; In 1996, Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission, and he was later elected president of the commission. In 1997, Brown appointed him to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] seat vacated by [[Kevin Shelley]]. At the time, he became the youngest member of San Francisco's board of supervisors and also, like Shelley before him, the board's only heterosexual Caucasian male.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/02/04/MN64501.DTL|title=S.F.'s New Supervisor -- Bold, Young Entrepreneur|author=John King|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=February 4, 1997|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Start"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/07/MNG313I2O41.DTL|title=Board gets a straight white male Mayor's new supervisor is businessman Gavin Newsom, 29|author=Ray Delgado|work=[[The San Francisco Examiner]]|date=February 3, 1997|accessdate=March 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, San Francisco's voters chose to exchange at-large elections to the board for the previous district system and Newsom was reelected in 2000 and in 2002 to represent the second district, which includes the [[Pacific Heights]], [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina]], [[Cow Hollow, San Francisco|Cow Hollow]], [[Sea Cliff, San Francisco|Sea Cliff]], and Laurel Heights. He faced no opposition in his 2002 reelection. His district had the highest income level and the highest Republican registration in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/09/15/MN61774.DTL|title=LONE CANDIDATE IS GOING ALL OUT IN DISTRICT 2 RACE Newsom has his eye on}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Newsom paid $500 to the San Francisco Republican Party to be on the party's endorsement slate.

As a San Francisco Supervisor, Newsom gained public attention for his role in advocating reform of the city's [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|Municipal Railway]] ("Muni").&lt;ref name="Appendage"/&gt; He was one of two supervisors endorsed by Rescue Muni, a transit riders group, in his 1998 reelection. He sponsored Proposition B to require Muni and other city departments to develop detailed customer service plans.&lt;ref name="Port"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/10/02/MN91413.DTL|title=Muni Riders Back Newsom And Ammiano|author=Edward Epstein|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 2, 1998|accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure passed with 56.6% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/11/05/MN85585.DTL|title=HOW SAN FRANCISCO VOTED|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=November 5, 1998|accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsom sponsored a ballot measure from Rescue Muni; a version of the measure was approved by voters in November 1999.&lt;ref name="Appendage"/&gt;

Newsom also supported allowing restaurants to serve alcohol at their outdoor tables, banning tobacco advertisements visible from the streets, stiffer penalties for landlords, and a resolution to commend [[Colin Powell]] for raising money for youth programs that was defeated.&lt;ref name="Appendage"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fights idea that he's a Brown "appendage'|first=Rachel|last=Gordon|date=October 16, 1998|work=San Francisco Guardian|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/10/16/NEWS2969.dtl|accessdate=March 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsom's support for business interests at times strained his relationship with labor leaders.&lt;ref name="Appendage"/&gt;

During Newsom's time as supervisor, he supported housing projects through public–private partnerships to increase homeownership and affordable housing in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; Newsom supported HOPE, a failed local ballot measure that would have allowed an increased condo-conversion rate if a certain percentage of tenants within a building were buying their units. As a candidate for mayor, he supported building 10,000 new housing units to create 15,000 new construction jobs.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

As supervisor, Newsom had as his centerpiece a voter initiative called [[Care Not Cash]] (Measure N), which offered care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists for the homeless in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; Many homeless rights advocates protested against the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion: Prop.

Newsom received 41.9 percent of the vote to Green Party candidate [[Matt Gonzalez]]'s 19.6 in the first round of balloting, but he faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff when many of the city's liberal groups coalesced around Gonzalez.&lt;ref name="Time for change"/&gt; The race was partisan with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of [[Ralph Nader]] in the 2000 presidential election and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/12/MNGR82VUTB1.DTL|title=Mayoral hopefuls come out swinging in debate|author1=John Wildermuth |author2=Rachel Gordon |work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 12, 2003|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Democratic importance"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/03/BAGSD3EQJ51.DTL|title=SF Campaign Notebook|author1=John Wildermuth |author2=Katia Hetter|author3=Demian Bulwa|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=December 3, 2003|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic leadership felt that they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 recall election]] to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name="Democratic importance"/&gt; National figures from the Democratic Party, including [[Bill Clinton]], [[Al Gore]], and [[Jesse Jackson]], campaigned on Newsom's behalf.&lt;ref name="Democratic importance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/feature/2003/12/09/newsom/|title=San Francisco's Greens versus Democrats grudge-match|author=Joan Walsh|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=December 9, 2003|accessdate=March 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724035849/http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/feature/2003/12/09/newsom/|archivedate=July 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez while Newsom received the endorsement of Willie Brown.&lt;ref name="Time for change"/&gt;&lt;ref name="See how they ran"/&gt;

===2007 election===
{{Main|San Francisco mayoral election, 2007}}
San Francisco's progressive community attempted to find a candidate to run a strong campaign against Newsom. Supervisors [[Ross Mirkarimi]] and [[Chris Daly]] considered running against Newsom, but both declined. Matt Gonzalez also decided not to challenge Newsom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/03/BAGSGQ6TAD1.DTL|title=SAN FRANCISCO Newsom faces few hurdles to re-election Position available: Progressives rally but fail to find a candidate|author1=Cecilia M.

When the August 10, 2007, filing deadline passed, the discussion around San Francisco shifted to talk about Newsom's second term. He was challenged in the election by 13 candidates that included George Davis, a [[nudism|nudist]] activist, and Michael Powers, owner of the Power Exchange sex club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/11/MNVVRFQM6.DTL|title=Newsom lacks serious challengers, but lineup is full of characters|author=Cecilia M.

==Mayoralty==

As mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|Hunters Point]] and [[Treasure Island (San Francisco)|Treasure Island]]. He signed the [[Healthy San Francisco]] Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with [[universal healthcare]]. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue [[same-sex marriage|marriage]] licenses to [[homosexuality|same-sex couples]], in violation of the [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|state law passed in 2000]].&lt;ref name="Lisa Leff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/08/10/state/n000208D48.DTL|title=Newsom set to endorse Clinton for president|author=Lisa Leff|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 10, 2007|accessdate=March 7, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209000025/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F08%2F10%2Fstate%2Fn000208D48.DTL|archivedate=December 9, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of Care Not Cash began on July 1, 2004. As part of his Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. {{As of |2007|10|21|df=US}}, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined [[UNITE HERE]] union members on a picket line in front of the [[Westin]] St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Unite Here Local 2, [https://www.unitehere2.org/history/ "History"], October 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow communities in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050701/news_1n1dogs.html|title=Cities, counties may be allowed to restrict specific dog breeds - The San Diego Union-Tribune|publisher=Utsandiego.com|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He requested that then state senator [[Jackie Speier]] introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2009, Newsom came under attack from the San Francisco Democratic Party for his failure to implement the City of San Francisco's [[sanctuary city]] rule, under which the city was to not assist [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/S-F-Dems-blast-mayor-in-sanctuary-city-case-3167150.php|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|title=S.F. Dems blast mayor in sanctuary city case|first=Heather|last=Knight|date=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he was sending immigrant suspects, including youths, to ICE before they were even given their day in court.

In 2009, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award along with Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] of New York City and three other public officials for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadershipforhealthycommunities.org/content/view/284/58|title=Top Policy Groups Take Action to Create Healthy Communities, Prevent Childhood Obesity|publisher=Leadership for Healthy Communities|accessdate=November 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630054147/http://www.leadershipforhealthycommunities.org/content/view/284/58|archivedate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he had hosted the Urban Rural Roundtable to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy affordable food,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/30/BA6A14C5S1.DTL|title=S.F. food policy heading in a healthy direction|first=Erin|last=Allday|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he secured $8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/mayor_index.asp?id=82219|title=PressRoom_NewsReleases_2008_82219 « Office of the Mayor|publisher=Sfgov.org|accessdate=November 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610091237/http://www.sfgov.org/site/mayor_index.asp?id=82219|archivedate=June 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes.

===Homelessness===
In 2002, then-San Francisco Supervisor Newsom promoted the [[San Francisco Proposition N (2002)|Care Not Cash]] program which cut county general assistance programs to be replaced with housing and other forms of service. He also promoted a 2003 ban (Proposition M: Aggressive Solicitation Ban) on aggressive panhandling which included a ban for panhandling on public transportation and near ATMs. It also prohibited repeatedly soliciting money, blocking the way, touching or following a person while soliciting, or intentionally trying to intimidate.

On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom pledged to fix San Francisco's homeless problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated that people who were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people being sent to the home of a willing family member or friend through the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue [[same-sex marriage|marriage]] licenses to [[homosexuality|same-sex couples]], in violation of the then-current state law.&lt;ref name="Lisa Leff"/&gt; In August 2004, the [[Supreme Court of California]] annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time. Still, Newsom's unexpected move brought national attention to the issues of [[gay marriage]], solidifying political support for Newsom in San Francisco and in the gay community.&lt;ref name="Reflects"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gaymarriage16-2008may16,0,6182317.story?page=2|title=California Supreme Court overturns gay marriage ban|last=Dolan|first=Maura|date=May 16, 2008|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008 election, Newsom was a prominent and vocal opponent of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], the ballot initiative to reverse the [[California Supreme Court]] ruling that there was a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/state&amp;id=6477948|title=San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom fights for same-sex marriage|date=October 29, 2008|publisher=Abclocal.go.com|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 8 supporters released a commercial featuring Newsom saying the following words in a speech regarding same-sex marriage: "This door's wide open now.

==Lieutenant Governor of California==

[[File:Newsom Brown rally.jpg|thumb|Gavin Newsom at a Jerry Brown campaign event, 2010]]
In April 2009, Newsom announced his intention to run for governor of California in the 2010 election. In September 2009, he received the endorsement of former president [[Bill Clinton]]. During the campaign, Newsom remarked that, if elected, he'd like to be referred to as "The Gavinator" (a reference to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's nickname, "The [[Governator]]"). Throughout the campaign, however, Newsom suffered low poll numbers, trailing Democratic frontrunner [[Jerry Brown]] by more than 20 points in most polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-08-24/bay-area/17175365_1_jerry-brown-san-francisco-mayor-san-franciscans|title=CAMPAIGN 2010/Mayor Newsom wants to move on up to the governor's place/Campaign expected to be very crowded and very expensive|first1=Phillip|last1=Matier|first2=Andrew|last2=Ross|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnnycalifornia.com/2008/11/12/governor-2010-new-field-poll-things-look-bad-for-newsom-not-so-bad-for-feinsteinvillaraigosa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507100129/http://johnnycalifornia.com/2008/11/12/governor-2010-new-field-poll-things-look-bad-for-newsom-not-so-bad-for-feinsteinvillaraigosa/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 7, 2010|title=Governor 2010: New Field Poll - Things Look Bad For Newsom, Not So Bad for Feinstein and Villaraigosa|publisher=Johnny California|date=November 12, 2008|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/31/local/me-newsom-out31|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Gavin Newsom drops out of California governor's race|first1=Mark Z.|last1=Barabak|first2=Evan|last2=Halper|date=October 31, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2010/election_2010_governor_elections/california/election_2010_california_governor_election] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104074643/http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2010/election_2010_governor_elections/california/election_2010_california_governor_election|date=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/us/31newsom.html|work=The New York Times|title=San Francisco Mayor Drops Governor Bid|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|date=October 31, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garofoli|first=Joe|url=http://sfchronicle.us/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?blogid=14&amp;entry_id=49142|title=Newsom: "Mark my words: These poll numbers will change dramatically"...d'oh!!! : SFGate: Politics Blog|publisher=Sfchronicle.us|date=October 8, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, Newsom dropped out of the gubernatorial race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Selway|first=William|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a0jLxmmMJdmU|title=San Francisco Mayor Joins Race for California Governor in 2010|publisher=Bloomberg|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2009-09-09/news/the-wrong-stuff|last=Harrell|first=Ashley|title=The Wrong Stuff|newspaper=SF Weekly|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.gavinnewsom.com/releases/statement_by_mayor_gavin_newsom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102065946/http://www.gavinnewsom.com/releases/statement_by_mayor_gavin_newsom|archivedate=November 2, 2009|title=Statement by Mayor Gavin Newsom|publisher=Gavin Newsom for a Better California|date=October 30, 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Newsom filed initial paperwork to run for [[Lieutenant Governor of California|lieutenant governor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=75568|title=Gavin Newsom, San Francisco mayor, files papers in lieutenant governor race|publisher=News10.net|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607083231/http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=75568|archive-date=June 7, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially announced his candidacy in March.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; He received the Democratic nomination in June,&lt;ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2010/06/california-election-results-gavin-newsom.html|title=PolitiCal|date=June 8, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the election on November 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/11/03/brown-newsom-boxer-elected/|title=Brown, Newsom, Boxer elected|accessdate=March 11, 2010|publisher=The Stanford Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsom was sworn in as lieutenant governor on January 10, 2011. The one-week delay was to ensure that a successor as mayor of San Francisco was chosen before he left office. [[Edwin M. Lee]], the city administrator, took office the day after Newsom was sworn in as lieutenant governor. In May 2012, he debuted on [[Current TV]] as the host of ''[[The Gavin Newsom Show]]''. In 2012, Newsom drew criticism for his negative view {{clarify|date=March 2017}} of California's state capital [[Sacramento]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/29/gavin-newsom-on-sacramento_n_1554208.html|title=Gavin Newsom on Sacramento|author=Aaron Sankin|work=Huffington Post|date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2014, Newsom was re-elected as lieutenant governor of California, defeating Republican [[Ron Nehring]] with 57.2% of the vote. His second term began on January 5, 2015, the same date when Governor Brown was sworn in for a second term after his [[California gubernatorial election, 2014|re-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/11/04/former-san-francisco-mayor-gavin-newsom-re-elected-california-lieutenant-governor |title=Former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom Re-Elected California Lieutenant Governor|publisher=CBS News|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=March 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology in government ===
Newsom released his first book, ''[[Citizenville|Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government]]'', on February 7, 2013{{nicg|date=October 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government|url=https://www.amazon.com/Citizenville-Square-Digital-Reinvent-Government/dp/1594204721|website=Amazon.com|isbn=978-1594204722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book discusses the [[Gov 2.0]] movement that is taking place across the United States. Following the release of ''Citizenville'', Newsom began to work with the [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] on the [[California Report Card]] (CRC).&lt;ref name="SFMag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lucas|first1=Scott|title=Gavin Newsom and a Berkeley Professor Are Trying to Disrupt Public Opinion Polls|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/gavin-newsom-and-berkeley-professor-are-trying-disrupt-public-opinion-polls|website=San Francisco Magazine|publisher=Modern Luxury|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC is a mobile-optimized platform that allows California residents to "grade" their state on six timely issues. The CRC exemplifies ideas presented in Newsom's ''Citizenville'', encouraging direct public involvement in government affairs via modern technology.&lt;ref name="Hearst"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noveck|first1=Beth|title='Citizenville,' by Gavin Newsom|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Citizenville-by-Gavin-Newsom-4321331.php|website=SFGate|publisher=Hearst Newspapers|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Newsom partnered with the Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy at California Polytechnic State University to launch Digital Democracy, an online tool that uses facial and voice recognition to enable users to navigate California legislative proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/data/Lt-Gov-Gavin-Newsom-Former-Sen-Sam-Blakeslee-Launch-Digital-Democracy.html |title=Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Former Sen. Sam Blakeslee Launch 'Digital Democracy' |website=Govtech.com |date=May 7, 2015 |accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
In November 2015, Newsom joined then-Long Beach City College Superintendent Eloy Oakley in an op-ed calling for the creation of the California College Promise, which would create partnerships between public schools, public universities and employers and offer a free community college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/11/12/gavin-newsom-and-eloy-ortiz-oakley-free-community-college-tuition-will-drive-california-economy/|title=Gavin Newsom and Eloy Ortiz Oakley: Free community college tuition will drive California economy|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2016, Newsom joined Oakland Mayor [[Libby Schaaf]] at the launch of the Oakland Promise and then-Second Lady [[Jill Biden]] and LA Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] at the launch of the LA Promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/w/oak056936|title=OAKLAND LAUNCHES PROMISE INITIATIVE TO TRIPLE NUMBER OF COLLEGE GRADUATES|website=City of Oakland|date=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lamayor.org/la-puts-higher-education-within-reach-all-students |title=L.A. puts higher education within reach for all students |website=City of Los Angeles|date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, the Lieutenant Governor helped secure $15 million in the state budget to support the creation of promise programs throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://a52.asmdc.org/press-release/californias-college-promise-celebrated-local-elected-officials-education-leaders |title=California's College Promise Celebrated by Local Elected Officials, Education Leaders |website=California State Assembly|date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Newsom called on the University of California to reclassify computer science courses as a core academic class in order to incentivize more high schools to offer computer science curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-computer-science-uc-calstate-admissions-20151202-story.html|title=Coalition calls for greater focus on computer science in UC, Cal State admissions|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Eric|url=http://www.recode.net/2015/12/2/11621054/silicon-valley-elite-call-on-california-schools-to-give-computer|title=Silicon Valley Urges Cal, CSU to Give Computer Science Full Credit in Admissions (Updated)|website=Recode.net|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsom sponsored successful legislation signed by Governor Brown in September 2016, that began the planning process for expanding computer science education to all California students, beginning as early as kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edsource.org/2016/gov-brown-signs-law-to-plan-expansion-of-computer-science-education/569895|title=Gov. Brown signs law to plan expansion of computer science education|newspaper=[[EdSource]]|date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Lieutenant Governor passed a series of reforms at the University of California to provide student-athletes with additional academic and injury-related support, and to ensure that contracts for athletic directors and coaches emphasized academic progress. This came in response to several athletics programs, including the University of California - Berkeley's football team, which garnered the lowest graduation rates in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article77062657.html|title=Gavin Newsom places his stamp on UC sports policy; it's a start|website=Sacbee.com|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leff|first=Lisa|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/0a1079e5ed7e424ab9fb56fe80de2bbc/university-considers-expanding-student-athlete-protections|title=University panel adopts expanded student-athlete protections|website=Bigstory.ap.org|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannabis legalization===
In 2014, Newsom was the only statewide politician to endorse [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|California Proposition 47]], a piece of legislation that decriminalized nonviolent offenses like drug and property crimes, turning them into misdemeanors as opposed to felonies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article142719649.html|title=California gubernatorial candidates share views on criminal justice changes|website=sacbee.com|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Newsom released the final report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report's recommendations to regulate marijuana were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cadelago|first=Christopher|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article28073746.html|title=Gavin Newsom's panel: Marijuana shouldn't be California's next Gold Rush|website=Sacbee.com|date=July 21, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In response to pro-enforcement statements made by Press Secretary [[Sean Spicer]], Newsom sent a letter on February 24, 2017, to Attorney General Sessions and President Trump, urging them not to increase federal enforcement against recreational cannabis firms opening up in California.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He wrote, "The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don't card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way that will let us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children, while targeting the bad actors." Newsom responded to comments by Spicer which compared cannabis to opioids saying, "Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration's focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Death penalty===
Newsom supported a failed measure in 2012 that sought to end capital punishment in California. He claimed the initiative would save California millions of dollars, citing statistics that California had spent $5 billion since 1978 to execute just 13 people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-newsom-endorses-proposition-to-abolish-1468966153-htmlstory.html|title=Essential Politics July archives|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=April 14, 2017|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newsom also supported failed [[California Proposition 62 (2016)|Proposition 62]] in 2016, which also would have repealed the death penalty in California.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; He argued that Prop 62 would get rid of a system "that is administered with troubling racial disparities." He also stated that the death penalty was fundamentally immoral and did not deter crime.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Governor of California==
On February 11, 2015, Newsom announced that he was opening a campaign account for governor in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2018|2018 elections]], allowing him to raise funds for a campaign to succeed Jerry Brown as the fortieth [[Governor of California]].&lt;ref name="gov2018" /&gt; On June 5, 2018, he finished in the top two of the nonpartisan blanket primary, and defeated Republican [[John H. Cox]] in the gubernatorial election on November 6.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/california/articles/2018-11-06/newsom-faces-newcomer-cox-in-california-governor-race&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Gavin Newsom and Jennifer Siebel at the 2008 Gay Parade.jpg|thumb|left|Newsom with then-fiancée [[Jennifer Siebel]] at the 2008 [[San Francisco Pride]] parade]]
Newsom was [[baptized]] and reared in his father's [[Roman Catholic]] faith. He describes himself as an "Irish Catholic rebel [...] in some respects, but one that still has tremendous admiration for the Church and very strong faith." When asked about the current state of the Catholic Church, he said the church was in crisis.&lt;ref name="Santa" /&gt; Newsom said he stays with the Church because of his "strong connection to a greater purpose, and&amp;nbsp;[...] higher being&amp;nbsp;[...]" Newsom identifies himself as a practicing Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-03/bay-area/17287812_1_scientology-press-briefings-human-rights|title=DOWN BY THE BAY/A blues story with all the requisite elements: love, booze and death|first=Rachel|last=Gordon|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that he has a "strong sense of faith that is perennial: day in and day out."&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt;

In December 2001, Newsom married [[Kimberly Guilfoyle]], a former San Francisco [[prosecutor]] and legal commentator for [[Court TV]], [[CNN]], and [[MSNBC]] and later became a prominent personality on [[Fox News Channel]]. The couple married at [[Saint Ignatius Church (San Francisco)|Saint Ignatius Catholic Church]] on the campus of the [[University of San Francisco]], where Guilfoyle attended [[University of San Francisco School of Law|law school]]. The couple appeared in the September 2004 issue of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', a fashion magazine, in a spread of them at the [[Getty Villa]] with the title the "New Kennedys."&lt;ref name="Reflects"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leah Garchik column|first=Leah|last=Garchik|date=August 5, 2004|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/08/05/DDGIG826VT1.DTL|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, they jointly filed for divorce, citing "difficulties due to their careers on opposite coasts."&lt;ref name="Coasts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/01/06/MNGJ1ALTGV1.DTL|title=Newsom, wife decide to end 3-year marriage Careers on opposite coasts take toll on mayor, TV star|author1=Phillip Matier|author2=Andrew Ross|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=January 6, 2005|accessdate=March 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce was finalized on February 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/10/MNGBAHM73D5.DTL&amp;hw=guilfoyle&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=462|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Rachel|last=Gordon|title=Gavin and Kimberly are officially divorced|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Newsom was selected as a Young Global Leader by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/young-global-leaders/gavin-newsom|title=WEF - Gavin Newsom|work=Gavin Newsom - World Economic Forum|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, it was revealed that Newsom had had a romantic relationship in mid-2005 with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his then campaign manager and former deputy chief of staff, Alex Tourk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-01-31/news/17229155_1_newsom-alex-tourk-mayor-s-office|title=Aide Quits As Newsom's Affair With His Wife Is Revealed/Campaign manager confronts mayor, who is 'in shock'|author1=Phil Matier|author2=Andrew Ross|author3=Cecilia M.

Newsom's affair with Rippey-Tourk impacted his popularity with male voters, who viewed the [[adultery]] as a betrayal of a close friend and ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Unforgivable-breach-of-Man-Code-2652345.php|title=Unforgivable breach of the Man Code|accessdate=April 11, 2015|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=C.W.|last=Nevius|date=February 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Janitor''' is a fictional character, played by actor [[Neil Flynn]] in the [[United States|American]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. Though he is a janitor at Sacred Heart, he is rarely referred to as ''the'' janitor, but rather just called Janitor.

Neil Flynn was originally billed as a recurring guest star throughout Season 1, although he appeared in all 24 episodes of that season. He was promoted to a series regular beginning with Season 2 and remained a regular through to Season 8. He made his final appearance in the Season 9 premiere, "[[Our First Day of School]]", as a guest star.

Janitor appeared in every episode during the first eight seasons except Season 2's "[[My Lucky Day (Scrubs episode)|My Lucky Day]]" and Season 8's "[[My Last Words]]", "[[My Absence]]" and "[[My Full Moon]]".

== Fictional character biography ==
In the series' [[My First Day|pilot episode]], [[protagonist]] [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D.]] sees Janitor fixing a [[sliding door]] that is stuck, and suggests someone might have stuck a [[penny]] in the door. Janitor immediately accuses J.D. of sabotaging the door, and swears revenge.&lt;ref name="My First Day"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My First Day|episodelink=My First Day|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=October 2, 2001|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of the series, Janitor makes it his personal mission to torment J.D. with insults, mind games and practical jokes. In the season eight finale, J.D. admits to accidentally sticking the penny in the door; Janitor replies he saw J.D. do it and began torturing him because he failed a "test of character" by keeping silent about it.&lt;ref name="My Finale"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Finale|episodelink=My Finale|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=ABC|airdate=May 6, 2009|season=8|number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Janitor's [[practical joke]]s have been on the severe side, such as destroying J.D.'s bike (twice),&lt;ref name="My Way Home"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Way Home|episodelink=My Way Home (Scrubs)|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=January 24, 2006|season=5|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; trapping him in a [[water tower]],&lt;ref name="his-story-3"/&gt; stranding him in the middle of nowhere,&lt;ref name="My Last Chance"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Last Chance|episodelink=My Last Chance|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=October 26, 2004|season=4|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tricking him into robbing a couple's house.&lt;ref name="My New God"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My New God|episodelink=My New God|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=January 17, 2006|season=5|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil Flynn has said: {{quote|"I think it's possible that he doesn't hate J.D. Maybe J.D. is as close to a friend as he has. For all we know, he just has poor [[social skills]]. I think that the Janitor constantly misreads J.D.'s motives and assumes he's a young punk."&lt;ref name="MOPNT" /&gt;}}

It is suggested in the episode "His Story III" that he is in some way responsible for a medical intern named Jill having a child.

During the first six seasons he has a crush on [[Elliot Reid|Dr. Elliot Reid]], but in season seven he meets his future wife [[List of characters on Scrubs#Ladinia Williams|Lady]], and they get married the following season.&lt;ref name="My Soul On Fire"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Soul On Fire|episodelink=My Soul On Fire|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=ABC|airdate=April 15, 2009|season=8|number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scrubs (season 9)|the first episode of season 9]], a flashback is seen of Janitor's last appearance the day after J.D. leaves Sacred Heart. Janitor believes that J.D. is simply hiding, as a practical joke, and will reappear. When Turk convinces him that J.D. has left for good, Janitor hands over his mop to Turk and leaves, never to be seen again.&lt;ref name="Our First Day of School"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Our First Day of School|episodelink=Our First Day of School|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=ABC|airdate=December 1, 2009|season=9|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Concrete information about Janitor's personal history is sparse and is confounded by his penchant for giving outrageous (and often conflicting) accounts of his past. Many of the stories he has told J.D. are patently absurd, some bordering on the surreal or fantastical.

He has claimed that his parents are also his siblings, has made multiple conflicting accounts of having been married and having children, has claimed that, in college, he came close to a world record in the 100m [[hurdles]] race, and has given an explanation for learning [[sign language]] so convoluted that he asks to have it read back to him when J.D. asks if any part of it is true. His childhood and family life are equally mysterious. The occasional flashback sequences imply that his parents were fastidious and mildly [[child abuse|abusive]]. One flashback implies the loss of a stuffed animal in the "clutter" of his bedroom led him to take on a janitorial career. He also claims that his great-grandfather was the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general [[Ambrose Burnside]] (mispronounced "Burnsides").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Therapeutic Month|episodelink=My Therapeutic Month|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=February 7, 2007|season=6|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is hinted on some occasions that Janitor's anecdotes are at times true to some degree, e.g. he does show a considerable skill in hurdles racing in the same episode in which he claims to almost have broken said world record.

Janitor speaks [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[American Sign Language]]. When the hospital support staff wants dental coverage, he becomes their spokesman.&lt;ref name="My Coffee"&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Coffee | episodelink = My Coffee | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC| airdate = December 14, 2006 | season  = 6  | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion Janitor indicates he does little actual work. He tells J.D. that he spends only an hour and a half a day performing his duties at work. He does, however, defend his sanitary responsibilities in the hospital whenever J.D. questions him about it, and he takes great pride in the cleanliness of the hospital's floors.&lt;ref name="My_Drive-By"&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Drive By | episodelink = My Drive-By | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = April 26, 2005 | season  = 4  | number = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he spends most of the series harassing J.D., on occasion Janitor will torment other characters such as [[Christopher Turk]].&lt;ref name="My Dirty Secret"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Dirty Secret|episodelink=My Dirty Secret|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=December 11, 2003|season=3|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually in response to a perceived wrong, such as another character creating a mess in the hospital or disrespecting him.

Several episodes show Janitor pretending to be a doctor ("Dr. Ján Ĩtor") and he also greatly enjoys one occasion when he is asked to assist during a medical emergency.&lt;ref name="his-story-3"&gt;{{cite episode|title=His Story III|episodelink=His Story III|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=April 18, 2006|season=5|number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, he uses a set of broken defibrillator paddles to pretend to revive a patient (in reality, a pair of pillows and a mop). He also pretends to be the chief of medicine when the real chief, [[Bob Kelso]], is away.&lt;ref name="My Road to Nowhere"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Road to Nowhere|episodelink=My Road to Nowhere|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=February 8, 2007|season=6|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janitor shows a softer side on several occasions.  He harbors a schoolboy crush on [[Elliot Reid]], to whom he usually refers as "Blonde Doctor". He has also shown genuine compassion for the hospital's patients; in one episode he spends the day talking to a patient with [[Locked-in syndrome]] just to keep him company.&lt;ref name="his-story-3"/&gt; In another, he joins the others in saying a heartfelt farewell to Nurse [[Laverne Roberts]], who dies of injuries suffered in a car accident. Later, as the hospital mourns Laverne's passing at a bar, Janitor buys them a round of drinks and raises his glass in salute.&lt;ref name="My Long Goodbye"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Long Goodbye|episodelink=My Long Goodbye|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=April 5, 2007|season=5|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later reveals he and Kelso had both slept with Laverne.&lt;ref name="My Cuz"&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Cuz | episodelink = My Cuz | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = April 22, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn had a small role in ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]''.  The show's writers took advantage of this, placing Janitor (in his fictional role) as the real actor in the film. J.D. notices this as he watches the movie. When J.D. confronts Janitor, he (eventually) admits that it really was him- after J.D. explains that he wanted it to be Janitor as it would show him to be more than a bitter wretch but a man who once had hopes and dreams, even if they didn't work out- but admonishes him not to tell anyone.&lt;ref name="My Friend the Doctor"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Friend the Doctor|episodelink=My Friend the Doctor|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=December 4, 2003|season=3|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janitor's father is portrayed as having treated him the way a drill instructor would treat a new recruit.  (His father is played by actor [[R. Lee Ermey]], who famously played a drill instructor in ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''.)&lt;ref name="My Old Man"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Old Man|episodelink=My Old Man (Scrubs)|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=April 9, 2002|season=1|number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Janitor later tells J.D. that his father died when he was young. When J.D. remembers meeting his father, Janitor responds mysteriously that "You met ''a man''."&lt;ref name="My Words of Wisdom"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Words of Wisdom|episodelink=My Words of Wisdom|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=April 12, 2007|season=6|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the eighth season, Maddox fires Janitor for pulling a prank on J.D. that could have resulted in serious injury. At the end of the episode, he is replaced.&lt;ref name="My Jerks"/&gt; He is rehired due to a clerical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Saving Grace|episodelink=My Saving Grace|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=ABC|airdate=January 13, 2009|season=8|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janitor is the self-appointed leader of the "Brain Trust", an unofficial club at the hospital that consists of a rotating cast of Sacred Heart staff members such as hospital lawyer Ted Buckland, surgeon Todd "The Todd" Quinlan, Dr. Doug Murphy (whom Janitor calls "Nervous Guy"), and Lloyd Slawski, a delivery man.  The Brain Trust originally had three other members, but Janitor became fed up with them during lunch, and joined the table behind him where the new members were sitting.

== Name ==
The mystery of Janitor's name is a [[running gag]] throughout the series. In several episodes, he calls himself "Janitor" (even in his own mind), and in many episodes he refers to himself as "Doctor Ján Ĩtor".

In "[[My Hero (Scrubs)|My Hero]]", Janitor chastises J.D. for not even knowing his name while Janitor knows many personal details about J.D.'s life (though it's later shown Janitor has been breaking into J.D.'s locker and reading his journal). When J.D. protests that he does in fact know Janitor's real name, Janitor asks him to say it aloud and quickly claps his hand over his name badge so J.D. can't read it.

In "[[My Manhood]]", Janitor tells Dr. Cox "I've been called a great many horrible names in my life: backstabber, zebra poacher, Josh..."
(In an interview before [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]] stated the Name of the Janitor is Josh, standing for (J)anitor (o)f (S)acred (H)eart but then said this was a joke. )

In the beginning of the eighth season, when Sacred Heart's new Chief of Medicine, Dr. Maddox (played by [[Courteney Cox Arquette]]), asks what Janitor's name is, he chuckles and makes reference to the fact she's new, alluding to the fact that  she's oblivious to the fact even the longest-standing members of staff don't know his name. She examines his name tag only to find it says "The Janitor."&lt;ref name="My Jerks"&gt;{{cite episode|title=My Jerks|episodelink=My Jerks|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=ABC|airdate=January 6, 2009|season=8|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Lawrence gave a hint toward Janitor's name at a speech at [[The College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] on January 29, 2009. He said that the only clue he had given was that Janitor's name is the same as the janitor on ''[[Clone High]]'' (Glenn, voiced by Neil Flynn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/dp-now-scrubs.j30,0,7059608.story|title='Scrubs' is ending, creator tells W&amp;M audience|last=Paitsel|first=Nicole|publisher=Dailypress|date=2009-01-30|accessdate=2009-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510231305/http://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/dp-now-scrubs.j30,0,7059608.story|archivedate=2009-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[My Finale|Season 8 finale]] Janitor tells J.D. that his name is '''Glenn Matthews''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/ithappenedlastnight/2009/05/scrubs-series-finale-maybe-bittersweet-symphony.html|title='Scrubs' series finale (maybe): Bittersweet symphony|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=2009-05-06|publisher=Zap2it|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The orderly does not say Tommy. Please see the source and talk page before editing. --&gt;"My Finale" was the series finale, in which Janitor's real name would be revealed.  When J.D. asks why Janitor is revealing his name only now, Janitor points out that J.D. has never before asked what his name is, and proves that J.D. has already forgotten it.  However just a few seconds later, someone else walks by and calls Janitor by another name, "Tommy," to which he responds.&lt;ref name="My Finale"/&gt;

In a [[Twitter]] post on April 5, 2011, Bill Lawrence confirmed that Janitor was telling the truth when he revealed his name as Glenn Matthews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/VDOOZER/status/55476378702839808|title=JANITOR'S NAME WAS GLENN MATTHEWS.  He told truth to J.D. for once.|last=Lawrence|first=Bill|publisher=Twitter|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figment of J.D.'s imagination==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Janitor penny.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|Janitor and [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D.]] begin their rivalry in the pilot episode "[[My First Day|My First Day"]]]] --&gt;
As revealed in the [[DVD]] commentary on several episodes, the Janitor character was initially to be used as a figment of J.D.'s imagination if the show had been canceled during the first season or the first half of the second.  This would have been revealed to the audience in the finale.

From the beginning of Season 2, Flynn joins the rest of the main cast appearing in the show's extended opening credits, but the credits were changed back due to objections by [[NBC]], who wanted longer episodes instead. However, he was still acknowledged as a main cast member by the producers as of the second season. Since the start of season two, Janitor has had encounters with most of the other regular characters. He has even had an entire episode ("[[His Story III]]") devoted mostly to him.&lt;ref name="his-story-3" /&gt; Along with this, in the season 1 episode "[[Scrubs (season 1)#Episodes|My Bad]]", Elliott throws coffee on the floor and as Janitor looks up in anger she seemingly engages with him and sarcastically says "sorry".

== Production notes ==
Flynn is an [[improvisational comedy|improv]] comedian and, as such, [[Ad libitum|ad-libs]] many of his lines.  Although it is often stated that Flynn ad-libs all of his lines, on several parts of the Season One DVD commentaries and special features, both Flynn and series creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]] say that it is generally a mix of ad-libbed lines and the original script, with Flynn usually building on the original lines. Lawrence has also said that the rest of the cast followed Flynn's lead and that he (Lawrence) would occasionally enter the rehearsal room with no idea what scene was taking place due to its lack of resemblance to the original script. Janitor's [[alter ego]], Dr. Ján Ĩtor, is a happy consequence of one such moment of inspiration. [[Sam Lloyd]] once commented on Flynn's improvising: "I opened my script up once and it said 'Janitor: Whatever Neil says,' and I just started laughing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Julie|title=Neil Flynn On Why He Left Scrubs and Life in The Middle|url=http://movieline.com/2010/01/06/the-middles-neil-flynn/|website=Movieline|publisher=PMC|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn originally auditioned for the role of Dr. Cox (which ultimately went to [[John C. McGinley]]). However, Lawrence asked Flynn if he would consider another part:  the mysterious custodian who makes tormenting J.D. his life's work.&lt;ref name="MOPNT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scrubs.mopnt.com/media/FLYNN.php?story=2003-04-10_mop_vs_scrubs |title = Mop vs. scrubs| accessdate = 2006-04-29| author = Sepinwall, Alan| date = 2003-04-10|work = My Own Personal 'Net Thing}} Interview with Neil Flynn and Bill Lawrence&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Janitor was originally devised as a one-time gag in the series' [[pilot episode]], Lawrence admitted: "When we watched the pilot, we knew instantly we had to keep this guy around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/about/scouts-neil-flynn.shtml|title=Last Comic Standing &amp;#124; Comedian Neil Flynn Information &amp; Professional Biography|publisher=Nbc.com|date=|accessdate=2012-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103053950/http://www.nbc.com/Last_Comic_Standing/about/scouts-neil-flynn.shtml|archivedate=2012-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In flashback scenes of Janitor's childhood, he is played by Brandon Waters.

'''Jawdhar''', surnamed '''al-Ustadh''', was a [[eunuch]] slave who served the [[Fatimid]] caliphs [[Al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah|al-Qa'im]] (r. 934–946), [[Al-Mansur Billah|al-Mansur]] (r. 946–953), and [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|al-Mu'izz]] (r. 953–975) as chamberlain and chief minister until his death in 973. He was an extremely powerful figure in the Fatimid court, and the accession of al-Mansur was probably due to his machinations. His collected documents and letters were published after his death by one of his assistants as the ''Sirat al-Ustadh Jawdhar'', and form one of the main historical sources for the governance of the Fatimid state in the period.

'''José María Pino Suárez''' ({{IPA-es|xosemaˈɾia ˌpinoˈswaɾes}}; 8 September 1869 – 19 February 1913) was a Mexican statesman, jurist, poet, journalist and revolutionary who served as the seventh and last [[Vice President of Mexico]] from 1911 until shortly before his assassination in 1913. In 1969, he was awarded the [[Belisario Domínguez Medal]] post mortem. He dedicated his short life to fighting for [[democracy]] and advocating against social injustices in [[Mexico]].

Born in the southern state of [[Tabasco]], he moved at a very young age to [[Mérida, Yucatán]], to pursue his education. Shortly after graduating from [[law school]], he established a [[law firm]] and began to write poetry, for which he was later offered a seat in the [[Spanish Academy]]. As an [[entrepreneur]], he also established the newspaper ''El Peninsular'' in which he made the public aware of the social injustices occurring in the Yucatán peninsula at the time. Joining the pro-democratic cause of [[Francisco I. Madero]], José Maria Pino Suárez was important in establishing the Antireelectionist party in the south of the Republic. Fighting against the political [[oligarchy]] that controlled [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], and to which he belonged through family and business ties, he was declared a candidate of the Antireelectionist party as [[Governor of Yucatán]] but was soon arrested by order of the official party. Fleeing from arrest, he joined presidential candidate Madero (himself fleeing from the oppression of the dictatorship of [[Porfirio Díaz]]) in the United States.) There Pino Suárez helped to draft the [[Plan of San Luis Potosí]], which declared the 1910 [[presidential elections]] to be null and void, and ignited the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Under the plan, Madero was declared substitute president and in his cabinet, Pino Suárez was declared [[Secretary of Justice|Minister of Justice]].

Following the capture of [[Ciudad Juárez]] by revolutionary troops, Pino Suárez was one of the key negotiators and signers of the [[Treaty of Ciudad Juárez]], which led to Porfirio Díaz resigning as president on 25 May 1911, and the end of his 30-year-long dictatorship. Returning to Yucatán, Pino Suárez was declared interim governor by the local assembly after the resignation of Enrique Muñoz Arristegui. In the [[special elections]] of 1911 he won a majority of votes and was sworn in as Constitutional Governor of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. His term, however was short. Soon after his victory the Progressive Constitutional Party (a successor of the Antireelectionist party) nominated him as vice presidential running mate of Madero. On 15 October 1911, he won the vice-presidency with a comfortable majority and he was subsequently sworn in on 6 November by the [[Congress of the Union]]. In 1912 alongside the Vice-presidency, he was also selected as [[Secretary of Public Education|Minister of Education and Fine Arts]].

In 1913, during the events of the [[Ten Tragic Days]], a group of convicted army officers escaped from prison and launched a military coup against the President. Although at first the coup was unsuccessful in taking over the seat of the executive, [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], and was contained to one small area of the centre of [[Mexico City]] known as La Ciudadela, soon the General appointed to quash the rebellion, [[Victoriano Huerta]] entered into negotiations with the American [[Ambassador]] [[Henry Lane Wilson]] and with the rebels. Turning sides, [[Huerta]] soon captured the unsuspecting President and his entire [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Pino Suárez who has been urged by many to flee the capital along with his family in case things came to worse, decided to remain by the side of the President while the usurpation was dealt with. Held in captivity along with the President in Palacio Nacional, both men were forced at gun point and under false premises to resign to their respective posts. Shortly thereafter, both were assassinated, provoking a national and international outcry that led to them becoming national martyrs. Pino Suárez has been labelled "el caballero de la lealtad" (the loyal gentleman) for his steadfastness to the President in such a difficult situation. Outrage for their deaths, was a main catalyst behind President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s decision to order the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in 1914, and in causing the fall of the unpopular Huerta Dictatorship, the last military dictatorship in [[Mexican history]]. Their sacrifice ultimately paved the way for the establishment of democracy in Mexico and for the promulgation of the [[Mexican Constitution|1917 Constitution]].

==Early years==
Pino Suárez was born on 8 September 1869 in [[Tenosique, Tabasco]], to Alfredo Pino Camára and Josefa Baltasara Suárez. He was a direct descendant of war hero [[Pedro Sainz de Baranda]] who famously led the capitulation of the fort of [[San Juan de Ulúa]] in 1825, thus conquering the last Spanish foothold in Mexican territory, and effectively ending the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. Other members of the distinguished Baranda family include two of Sainz de Baranda's sons, [[Joaquín Baranda]] and [[Pedro Baranda]] who were Pino Suárez's uncles. The former was a gifted historian, politician and writer who held the Governorship of Campeche on several occasions, as well as being appointed Minister of Justice by President [[Manuel González Flores|Manuel González]], a position he would hold for nearly twenty years thereafter. The latter, General Pedro Baranda would play a crucial role in the existence of the states of Campeche and Morelos, distinguishing himself as the first Governor of the latter. During the [[War of Reform]], General Pedro Barranda supported President [[Benito Juárez]]. Another uncle of José Maria Pino Suárez was [[Joaquín Demetrio Casasús]], a prominent jurist, economist, politician and writer. The grandparents of Pino Suárez were (paternally) Tomás Pino and Perfecta Salvatiel. On the maternal branch, his grandparents were José Eusebio Suárez and Baltasara Abreu. At a young adolescent age, Pino Suárez left Tenosique for Yucatán, where he studied at the Catholic School of San Idelfonso, which followed a programme closely linked to the French Lycée. On 12 September 1894, Pino concluded his legal studies at the Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia de Yucatán.

==Pino Suárez, a distinguished man of words==
[[File:Jose_Maria_Pino_Suarez.jpg|thumb|right|José María Pino Suárez]]
From a young age Pino Suárez was a member of the Literary Academy founded in 1875 in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]]. Here he would read and be influenced by the works of such figures such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Alfred de Vigny]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[George Sand]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Lord Byron]] and [[Eça de Queiroz]], among others. Pino Suárez acclaimed poetic works would first be published in the magazine ''Piminenta y Mostaza'', which included further collaborations from other recognized literary figures such as Manuel Sales Cepeda, Fernando Juanes and José I Novelo (who would later serve as the personal private secretary of Pino Suárez.)

Several of Pino Suárez's poetic works were included in the book ''Los Trovadores de Mexico'' published in Barcelona. This would catch the eye of prominent members of the [[Real Academia Española]], the Academy of the Spanish Language, of which he would later be a part. Two of his most famous books, ''Melancolias'' (1905) and ''Procelerias'' (1908) are anthologies of his distinguished poetic works. It should be noted, that much of Pino Suárez's early literary career was done simultaneously to his legal career. For three years from 1896–1899, Pino Suárez practised in his own legal firm in the capital before returning to Yucatán to carry out commercial activities with his wealthy father-in-law, Raymundo Camara-Luján. It was after his return to Yucatán that Pino Suárez's political career began with his founding of the newspaper, ''El Peninsular''. His newspaper soon caught the public eye for its criticism of the Diaz dictatorship and for the bad treatment of workers in the Henequen plantations of Yucatán. At a time of close censorship, it was favoured by many for its veracity and independence. Not surprisingly, in 1905, '' El Peninsular'' was closed by the Government of Yucatán, and Pino Suárez faced prosecution. It was at this time that he retired to his large sugar plantations of ''Polyuc''. While exiled in his hacienda, he wrote several other works of poetry including ''Sursum'' and the poem he dedicated to his various sons and daughters.

==The Antireelectionist Party==
While Pino Suárez's was in ''Polyuc'' from 1906 to 1909, the name of [[Francisco I. Madero]] first came to the light with his publication of the book ''La Sucesión Presidencial en 1910'' (1908). In this book Madero - himself a member of one of the richest families of Mexico - criticized President [[Porfirio Díaz]] who had for over three decades ruled as a dictator. Madero established in his book the necessity for clean elections in 1910, and for an end to the practice of re-election, which throughout Mexican history had seen a series of [[caudillo]]s perpetuating power. Among these caudillos were figures such as General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] and Porfirio Díaz. Madero's stirring book lead to the foundation of an Antireelectionist party. In 1910, they would try to take power by constitutional means, thus returning democracy to the Mexican Republic. This party included prominent public figures such as [[José Vasconcelos]], Paulino Martínez, [[Emilio Vásquez Gómez]], Toribio Esquivel Obregón, Felix F. Palavicini and [[Luis Cabrera Lobato|Luis Cabrera]] among others. The Antireelectionists began political activities in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, and Yucatán.
[[File:Madero II.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Francisco I Madero]]

It was during the 1909 visit of Madero to Yucatán, that the two met for the first time. Pino Suárez soon became President of the Antireelectionist Party in Yucatán, where the conditions were propitious for the growth of the party. Here Pino Suárez enlisted the aid of distinguished figures and personal friends, among them Calixto Maldonando, head of the [[freemasons]]. By 1910, the power of the party in Yucatán had grown to such a degree that by 1910, Pino Suárez would be elected [[Governor of Yucatán]].

==Revolution and the governorship of Yucatán==
When the sitting governor of Yucatán, [[Olegario Molina]] (himself a relative of Pino Suárez's spouse), resigned the governorship to become a [[cabinet minister]], he was replaced by [[Enrique Muñoz Arrístegui]], who was selected as interim governor until the upcoming elections of 1910. Soon, the public began to gossip of Muñoz Arrístegui as the Díaz-backed candidate. In those days, presidential backing was an assurance of victory, and so it was to be. With Muñoz as governor, soon the anti-reelectionist leaders were arrested. Pino Suárez, the anti-reelectionist candidate, managed to flee Yucatán. The anti-reelectionists were the only opposition to the dictatorship. With this, and other electoral fraud, Muñoz Arrestegui managed to cling on to power.

Pino Suárez escaped to his native Tabasco, and afterwards to the United States where he would meet with Madero. On 15 April, as the day of the elections came closer and closer, the members of the Antireelectionist club and of the Nationalist Democratic Party met under the chairmanship of Pino Suárez. It was at that convention, that Madero came out as the presidential nominee of the Antireelectionist Party, and Francisco Vázquez Gómez as the vice presidential nominee. José María Pino Suárez came out of the convention as a nominee for the [[Supreme Court of Justice]]. This convention was followed by rallies, [[speeches]], and [[propaganda]], which were swiftly ended with the order of President Díaz for the arrest of Madero on 7 June. The Antireelectionists had tried to gain power legally and pacifically but the Government had not allowed them to follow this strategy. Thus, Madero and his party were faced with no option but revolution, as Madero proclaimed "force must be met by force!".

At around the same time that Madero was arrested, people in [[Valladolid, Yucatán]], held a massive protest against the electoral fraud of Muñoz Arrestegui. Pino Suárez's duty was to return to his native south and penetrate Yucatán with the ideas of democracy. Although Pino Suárez had to flee to British Honduras (Belize) in order to escape prosecution from the government, from outside of the country he still led the revolution in the south. In this manner while Madero ignited revolution from prison in the north, Pino Suárez assured victory in the south.

Shortly after the imprisonment of Madero and the exile of Pino Suárez, President Díaz won the presidency for yet another term. It was at around this time that Madero, with the help of his very wealthy and influential father, managed to escape prison in San Luis Potosí, and flee across the border to [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. It was there in the United States that he issued the [[plan of San Luis Potosí]] calling the Mexican people to raise arms against oppression, effectively beginning the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In the plan of San Luis, Madero was quick to declare the elections of 1910 giving victory to Díaz to be null and void and declared himself to be the rightful president, thus forming a government in [[Ciudad Juárez]]. Pino Suárez was invited to join this government as [[Minister of Justice]]. Thus risking his own life, Pino Suárez went to Ciudad Juárez with Madero. The fall of Ciudad Juárez was a step too far for President Díaz. In May 1911, he called a council for peace. Representing the revolutionary cause in this council were Madero, Vázquez Gómez and Pino Suárez, while the government was represented by the [[Secretary of Finance]] [[José Yves Limantour]]. The council called for the resignation of Díaz, and of his vice president, [[Ramón Corral]] and for new and fair elections to be held later in 1911. Until these elections were held, the council agreed that [[León de la Barra]], the current [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] would remain as interim President. Under the [[Constitution of 1857]], the Secretary of Foreign Affairs was to succeed the vice president in the line of succession if the latter resigned. After giving up power Díaz left Mexico on 31 May for exile in Paris. Several members of his cabinet and close associates also followed him to exile in Europe.

Following the council of peace, several porfirian governors who had won by electoral fraud resigned. Among them was Muñoz Arrestegui, Pino Suárez's old rival to the governorship. With Muñoz gone the people called on to Pino Suárez to serve as interim [[Governor of Yucatán]]. Once in power, Pino Suárez set about calling for several reforms to a province that had suffered heavily during the revolution. Among these reforms was a law to reform rural education, which among other things decreed pensions for teachers and attempted to help stop [[illiteracy]] in the country. Several prisoners who had committed minor crimes and showed to be reeducated were also pardoned as a sign of good will and justice. This went hand in hand with other legal reforms to stop several corrupt practices, and fight vengeful justice. Steps were quickly taken for agrarian reform, although this would be a process that would last a long time. Pino Suárez also called for the protection of lobster, which was quickly becoming extinct. For an interim Governor, these reforms were several. However, Pino Suárez promised to do more should he be elected to governorship in elections to be held later that year. At last he was Governor of Yucatán by the will of the people.

Nevertheless, his time in office was short, for in November 1911 he would resign this post to become Vice President of the Republic, leaving behind his brother in law, [[Nicolás Camára Vales]], to remain as Governor of Yucatán in his absence.

==Vice President of the Republic and Secretary of Education==

Although the convention of 1910 presided by Pino Suárez had nominated Madero as President and Vázquez Gómez as Vice President, the situation by 1911 had changed. Causing much controversy, the convention of the newly created Progressive Constitutional Party (formerly the Antireelectionist Party) nominated Pino Suárez to be their Vice Presidential candidate instead of Vasquez Gomez. Winning the cleanest election in Mexican history by a clear and comfortable majority, by November Madero and Pino Suárez were inaugurated President and Vice President of the Republic by popular mandate. In February 1912, Madero also appointed him simultaneously  to the cabinet post of ''Secretario de Educacion y Bellas Artes'' (Secretary of Education and the Arts). In such a post, Pino Suárez showed his real concern for education as a necessity for the progress of the nation. He would work tirelessly to bring literacy to the most remote parts of the country, a job for which he was later praised by his 20th century successor [[José Vasconcelos]]. Pino Suárez education system called for a secular and intensive programme funded by the state. During his time as Secretary of Education, the [[Escuela Libre de Derecho]] was formed as a break away from the National School of Jurisprudence, which was headed by Pino Suárez appointed rector, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato|Luis Cabrera]].

==The coup d'état==
{{Main|La decena trágica}}
The Revolution of 1910 had been thought of as a means of overthrowing the dictator and establishing democracy. However, the result of it was very different from the intention causing widespread social upheaval. Although Madero tried to govern in the most constitutional, just and democratic of ways, several reactionary elements within the country wanted a return to the ways of the old Díaz dictatorship. With Porfirio Díaz a broken man exiled in Europe, his nephew, [[Félix Díaz (politician)|Félix Díaz]] was seen as a natural successor. Throughout Madero's government several rebellions were crushed and their leaders jailed. However, Madero never sanctioned the [[death penalty]] for any of the usurpers. In 1913, General [[Manuel Mondragón]] attacked the prison where rebels [[Bernardo Reyes]] and Félix Díaz were held, with the purpose of liberating them. With these three Generals allied against the Government, the ten tragic days (''la decena trágica'') would begin.

Accompanied by Pino Suárez, Gustavo Madero and the cabinet, Madero personally lead an army from the [[Castle of Chapultepec]], where he resided, to the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]], the seat of the executive, which was being attacked by the usurping generals. Soon the usurpers were forced to retire to la ciudadela, and area storing ammunition, here they would hold out against the Government. At this point Madero committed a mistake that would cost him his life: he appointed the seemingly loyal General [[Victoriano Huerta]] to head his army. Pino Suárez had never trusted Huerta, and soon his suspicions were to be proved correct when Huerta turned against Madero. With the help and support of the United States Ambassador, [[Henry Lane Wilson]], Huerta would take over the National Palace. Pino Suárez at this time was offered to retire to the Hacienda of a close friend, but he would stay loyal to Madero to the very end. Both Madero and Pino Suárez had for long refused to resign the job the people had elected them to lead. However, now prisoners of Huerta, there was no chance of their Government continuing. With the false promise that they would be allowed exile along with their families to Cuba, Madero and Pino Suárez resigned their respective jobs. The resignation, however, were not given to Huerta but to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, [[Pedro Lascurain]]. He was instructed not to hand the resignations over until Madero and Pino Suárez were aboard the cruiser ''Cuba'', which would take them to exile in the island of Cuba along with their families.

However, Lascurain was too weak-willed to refuse Huerta the presidency he craved, and so he handed the resignations over to the [[Congress of the Union]]. The Congress, held hostage at gun point by Huerta's men accepted the resignation. Following the resignation of the President and Vice President, Lascurain himself, as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, succeeded to the Presidency. He would last a mere 45 minutes (the shortest term in history), only long enough to appoint Huerta as [[Secretary of the Interior (Mexico)|Secretary of the Interior]], the next rank in the step of succession. Upon Lascurain's resignation, Huerta succeeded to the Presidency.

==Assassination==
No longer President and Vice President, Madero and Pino Suárez held few hopes of being allowed their promised exile. Before his death, Pino Suárez is quoted as saying in his last letter ever written, addressed to [[Serapio Rendón]] "we shall be greater in death than we were ever in life". This proved to be true. They had attempted to establish democracy, and now their reward was to be death. On 22 February 1913, Madero and Pino Suárez were assassinated before the [[Palace of Lecumberri]], while allegedly attempting to escape. It is well known that in fact the assassination had been ordered the night before by Huerta.

Pino Suárez died leaving several children orphans, and his young wife a widow. His body is now buried in the [[Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres]], along with several of his ancestors, after having died in the pursuit of liberty and democracy for Mexico. Not surprisingly, to this day, he is considered a national hero and several streets and public places in Mexico are named after him, including a main street in central Mexico City where the [[Supreme Court of Justice]] Building is situated and [[Metro Pino Suárez|Pino Suárez station]] on the [[Mexico City Metro]]. He was the last [[vice president]] of Mexico.

==Family==
In 1896, Pino Suárez married María Camara Vales, a scion of the old Camara family of "noble and impeccable lineage", which are part of the [[divine caste of Yucatán]]. They were a happy couple and had six children, all of whom were orphaned after the infamous events of ''la decena trágica''. The oldest María (Mimi), was 15, the youngest, Jordelia was 3 months old. Their other children were Alfredo, José Abigail, Aida, and Hortensia. Widowed and peniless (the revolution had consumed all of their family's assets and estates), María Carmen Vales was forced to go to Yucatán, where her brother, [[Nicolás Camára Vales]], was Governor (her husband's successor). In 1969, María Camara Vales was honoured with the [[Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor]] by the Mexican Congress. [[Ambassador]] [[Ismael Moreno Pino]] is his grandson.

'''Kakha Bendukidze''' ({{lang-ka|კახა ბენდუქიძე}}; 20 April 1956 – 13 November 2014) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] statesman, businessman and philanthropist, founder of the [[Knowledge Foundation]] and head of the supervisory board of Agricultural and [[Free University of Tbilisi|Free Universities]].

A biologist by education, Bendukidze started his own business, Bioprocess, which manufactured biochemicals for scientific research in 1987. Soon he became known as one of Russia's leading [[libertarian]]s. He led a working group on tax and currency within the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and pressed for changes in tax policy, which ultimately included adoption of a flat 13 percent [[tax rate]]. In Russia, he was a strong opponent of government intervention in the economy, a view that put him at odds with President [[Vladimir Putin]]. Soon Bendukidze sold his stake and moved back to Georgia.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herszenhorn |first1=David M.|title=Kakha Bendukidze Dies at 58; Pushed Post-Soviet Market Change|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/world/europe/kakha-bendukidze-dies-at-58-pushed-post-soviet-market-change.html?emc=edit_th_20141116&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=21209710&amp;_r=0|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Rose Revolution]], shortly after returning from Russia, he was appointed as Minister of Economy by former President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] and the late Prime Minister [[Zurab Jvania]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="tabula1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous Reformist Kakha Bendukidze Dies at 58 |url=http://www.tabula.ge/en/story/89804-famous-reformist-kakha-bendukidze-dies-at-58|website=tabula.ge|publisher=Tabula}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Minister of Economy (June–December 2004), Minister for Reform Coordination (December 2004 – January 2008) and Head of the Chancellery of [[Cabinet of Georgia|Government of Georgia]] (February 2008 – February 2009) and was the author of liberal reforms that overhauled Georgia's post-Soviet economy.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obituaries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/godfather-of-georgias-reforms-dies-at-58/2014/11/14/ea0cc3cc-6bef-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117083930/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/godfather-of-georgias-reforms-dies-at-58/2014/11/14/ea0cc3cc-6bef-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 November 2014|website=https://www.washingtonpost.com/|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the appointment Bendukidze, Georgia experienced a yearly 9.3% [[economic growth]] in 2004–2007 and almost four times more foreign investments. The government managed to decrease the taxes fourfold, the number of licenses by 90% and to liberalize the [[labour market]].&lt;ref name="tabula1"/&gt;

He created a charity called the [[Knowledge Foundation]], and he was the force behind the establishment of the [[Free University of Tbilisi]] and the [[Agricultural University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

Bendukidze took an active role in helping the new government of [[Ukraine]], amid its [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|confrontation with Russia]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

==Early life==
Bendukidze was born in [[Tbilisi]], USSR, and graduated from the Department of Biology of [[Tbilisi State University]] in 1977 and from the Postgraduate School of the [[Moscow State University]] in 1980. From 1981 to 1985, he worked for the ''Institute of Biology and Physiology of Micro-organisms'' in [[Puschino]]. From 1985 to 1988, he worked as the head of the ''Laboratory for Molecular Genetics'' at the ''Institute of Biotechnology''.

==Personal life==
Bendukidze has a daughter – Anastasia Goncharova (1990– ) – who adopted the surname of her father. She took over the Knowledge Fund management from 2016, and married Ivan Mkheidze in 2017 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnews.ge/en/news/61853-Kakha-Bedukidze%E2%80%99s-daughter-to-attend-his-fathers-funeral|title=Kakha Bendukidze's daughter to attend his father's funeral|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141213013712/http://cp.ge/ge/statiacci.php?ID=30176/ Daughter of Kakha Bendukidze]&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 1999, Bendukidze married Natalia Zolotova, who has 2 sons from the previous marriage; her first husband died.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordonua.com/heroes/kaha-bendukidze.html|title=Каха БЕНДУКИДЗЕ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the couple lived separately after 2004, since Kakha Bendukidze returned to Georgia

== Businessman in Russia ==
With the onset of [[Perestroika]], Bendukidze created a small business called ''Bioprocess''. In 1993, during the [[Voucher Privatization]], campaign he bought stock in [[Uralmash]]. Bendukidze became a board member and later, Director-General of this company. After merging [[Uralmash]] with [[Izhora Plants]] in 1996, Bendukidze became chairman and CEO (Director-General) of the merged company, ''Objedinennie Mashinostroitelnie Zavody'' ([[OMZ]]). Under Bendukidze, OMZ became one of Russia's largest heavy engineering companies and he was one of the top twenty business leaders with an influential voice on economic policy.&lt;ref name=ESI/&gt;

By 2004 the Russian government under President [[Vladimir Putin]] had tightened its grip on strategic industries. According to [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]: "Bendukidze does not belong to Putin's circle of friends and he understood sooner than everyone else that everything would be taken away from him... Bendukidze by far hasn't exhausted his potential but right now the Russian authorities do not need such talented people".&lt;ref name=ESI/&gt; Thus, he decided to move to his native Georgia.&lt;ref name=ESI&gt;[http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_-_georgias_libertarian_revolution_-_part_one_-_georgia_as_a_model_-_10_april_2010.pdf ESI], ''Georgia as a model'', April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, he left the position of Chairman of the [[OMZ]] and later sold his interest in the company. On 2 June 2004, he became Minister for Economics of Georgia.

==Georgian public figure==
Bendukidze returned to Georgia after the [[Rose Revolution]] victory, having been appointed Minister of Economy in the new Saakashvili cabinet. Since 14 December 2004 to 31 January 2008, he was State Minister for Reform Co-ordination, coordinating government efforts to liberalize the economy.&lt;ref name=ESI/&gt;

The ''Economist'' said of Bendukidze:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} "Mr Bendukidze made his name and fortune as an industrialist in neighboring Russia, putting together the country's biggest heavy-engineering group, OMZ, before returning to his native Georgia in June of this year with a mandate to reverse more than a decade of post-Soviet decay. He insists that he was taken by surprise when Georgia's president, Mikhail Saakashvili, and Prime Minister, Zurab Zhvania, nobbled him for a chat in the course of a private visit he made to Tbilisi in May, and then offered him a ministerial job the same evening. But having said yes, he is cracking ahead, doing everything that businessmen must dream of making governments do. He says that Georgia should be ready to sell 'everything that can be sold, except its conscience, and that is just the start.'"

He was known as a committed [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]&lt;ref name=ESI/&gt; and strong supporter of [[market economy]], [[deregulation]] and [[privatization]], stating that the Georgian government should sell everything except its honor. During 2004–2007, under his leadership, Georgia became the top-reforming country in the world, according to the World Bank's ''Doing Business'' report. In particular, Georgia jumped from 137th to 11th on the ease of doing business scale, ahead of Germany and France.

Bendukidze was pivotal in the libertarian reforms launched under Saakashvili, including one of the least restrictive labour codes, the lowest flat income tax rates (12%) and some of the lowest customs rates worldwide, along with the drastic reduction of licenses and permits for business.&lt;ref name=ESI/&gt;

In the January 2008 [[Cabinet of Georgia|cabinet]] reshuffle, Bendukidze became Head of the State Chancellery. During his tenure, he was considered one of the most influential Georgian politicians,&lt;ref name=Kommersant&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1115802 Каха Бендукидзе потерял аппаратный вес] [[Kommersant]] 9 February 2009 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not popular amongst opposition in the administration. He was criticized for repealing anti-monopoly legislation and introducing a liberal labor code. The opposition accused him of trying to sell off each of Georgia's strategic assets; such as sea ports, entire railway system, gas supply network, forests, etc.

In February 2009 Bendukidze retired from the public service to focus on tertiary education in Georgia, through the Knowledge Fund – a non-profit, charitable organization, founded by Bendukidze in 2007 to set up and support the Free University of Tbilisi and Agricultural University of Georgia. Between 2007 and 2012 Bendukidze had invested over 50 million USD to the Knowledge Fund – an unprecedented volume of private investment in tertiary education in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeuni.edu.ge/ge/node/770|title=ცოდნის ფონდი - თავისუფალი უნივერსიტეტი|first=Omedia|last=Studio|website=თავისუფალი უნივერსიტეტი}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Main|Knowledge Foundation}}

==Ukrainian public figure==
In September 2014 the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko created the National Reforms Council to support state reforms and strategic development process. Kakha Bendukidze acts as a member of  National Reforms Council 's Advisory Board along with the leading reformers of Northern and Central European countries: Valdis Dombrovskis&amp;nbsp;– former Prime Minister of Latvia, Leszek Balcerowicz&amp;nbsp;– former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Poland and Ivan Mikloš&amp;nbsp;– former Finance Minister of Slovakia. The main task of the Advisory Board is to provide efficient proposals on the implementation of reforms in Ukraine based on the international experience. Advisory board closely cooperates with the Executive Board of the Council which includes Prime Minister of Ukraine, Speaker of the Parliament and the Head of the National Bank.&lt;ref name="ua1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freeuni.edu.ge/ge/node/855|title=კახა ბენდუქიძე უკრაინაში რეფორმების ეროვნულ საბჭოს დაეხმარება - თავისუფალი უნივერსიტეტი|first=Omedia|last=Studio|website=თავისუფალი უნივერსიტეტი}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat earlier, in May 2014 Bendukidze also accepted the invitation of the President of Ukraine to become a member of the Economic Advisory Council. In an interview shortly after his appointment, Bendukidze said that Ukraine "has to take courageous steps to transform the economy." Proposed reforms included changes in tax system and a tough fight against corruption.&lt;ref name="ua1"/&gt;

The head of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko expressed condolences over the death of his Advisor, former Minister of economic reforms of Georgia Kakha Bendukidze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poroshenko|first1=Petro|title=Висловлюю щирі співчуття|url=https://twitter.com/poroshenko/status/533027070138650625|website=twitter.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bendukidze died on the 13 November 2014 in the [[InterContinental London Park Lane|InterContinental Hotel]] on Park Lane in London, after undergoing a [[stent]] heart surgery in [[Zurich]] a week prior. The former president of Georgia [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] had expressed interest for Bendukidze to be buried on mount Mtatsminda in Tbilisi, in the Pantheon of public figures and writers of Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rin.ru/eng/news///72909/|title=Kakha Bendukidze must be buried in the Pantheon, says Saakashvili|website=news.rin.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the wish of the family was that Bendukidze be buried next to his mother's grave in the Kukia Cemetery in Tbilisi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rin.ru/eng/news///72890/|title=Kakha Bendukidze will be buried in Tbilisi, close to the tomb of mother|website=news.rin.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==

The "'''Ladies of Llangollen'''", Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, were two upper-class [[Ireland|Irish]] women whose relationship during the late 18th and early 19th century scandalized and fascinated their contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ladies of Llangollen |first=Elizabeth |last=Mavor |authorlink=Elizabeth Mavor |location=[[Harmondsworth]], UK |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor Charlotte Butler''' (11 May 1739 – 2 June 1829) was a member of [[Butler dynasty|the Butlers, the Earls (and later Dukes) of Ormond]]. Butler was considered an over-educated bookworm by her family, who resided at the Butler family seat [[Kilkenny Castle]]. She spoke [[French language|French]] and was educated in a convent in [[France]]. Her mother tried to make her join a [[convent]] because she was remaining a [[spinster]].

'''Sarah Ponsonby''' (1755 – 9 December 1831) lived with relatives in [[Woodstock Estate|Woodstock]], [[County Kilkenny]], Ireland. She was a second cousin of [[Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough]], and thus a second cousin [[Cousin#Cousin chart|once removed]] of his daughter [[Lady Caroline Lamb]].{{refn|group=note|Shows extracts from other sources, see in particular, ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'', 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Miss Sarah Ponsonby |url=https://ladiesofllangollen.wordpress.com/miss-sarah-ponsonby/ |website=The Ladies of Llangollen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Their families lived 15 miles (25 km) from each other. They met in 1768, and quickly became close. Over the years they formulated a plan for a private rural retreat. It was their dream to live an unconventional life together.

==Welsh home==
[[File:Plas Newydd, near Llangollen - the seat of the late Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby (1132208).jpg|thumb|300px|Plas Newydd, near Llangollen, 1840]]
Rather than face the possibility of being [[forced marriage|forced into unwanted marriages]], they left [[County Kilkenny]] together in April 1778. Their families hunted them down and forcefully tried to make them give up their plans—but in vain.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Wales: A tale of two ladies ahead of their time |author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/wales/724170/Wales-A-tale-of-two-ladies-ahead-of-their-time.html |first=Anne Campbell |last=Dixon |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 May 2002 |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They moved to Wales with a servant, Mary Caryll, who lived and worked for them without pay for the rest of her life, and who was buried in the same plot and memorialized on the same grave marker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brideoake|first=Fiona|date=2004|title="Extraordinary Female Affection": The Ladies of Llangollen and the Endurance of Queer Community|url=https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/ron/2004-n36-37-ron947/011141ar/|journal=Romanticism on the Net|language=en|issue=36-37|doi=10.7202/011141ar|issn=1467-1255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting their plan into motion, they undertook a picturesque tour of the Welsh countryside, eventually settling in North [[Wales]]. Living first in a rented home in the village of [[Llangollen]], they moved in 1780 to a small cottage just outside the village they called [[Plas Newydd (Llangollen)|Plas Newydd]] or "new mansion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/maps/search/Llangollen,+United+Kingdom/@52.968835,-3.169148,17z?hl=en&amp;dg=dbrw&amp;newdg=1 |title=Llangollen |website=Google Maps |accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They proceeded to live according to their self-devised system, though they could rely on only a modest income from intolerant relatives, and eventually a [[Pensions in the United Kingdom#Civil List pensions|civil list pension]]. They "improved" Plas Newydd in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] with Welsh oak paneling, pointed arches, stained glass windows, and an extensive library, in which they received their many guests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They hired a gardener, a [[footman]] and two maids. This led to significant debt, and they had to rely on the generosity of friends.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

== Recognition and popularity ==
They devoted their time to hosting a range of friends and curious visitors, extensive correspondence, private studies of literature and languages, and improving their estate. Over the years they added a circular stone dairy and created a sumptuous garden. Eleanor kept a diary of their activities. Llangollen people simply referred to them as "the ladies".&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

After a couple of years, their life attracted the interest of the outside world. Their house became a haven for visitors travelling between Dublin and London, including writers such as [[Anna Seward]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Robert Southey]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://longreads.com/2018/04/17/the-ladies-who-were-famous-for-wanting-to-be-left-alone/|title=The Ladies Who Were Famous for Wanting to Be Left Alone|last=Hampl|first=Patricia|date=April 2018|work=Longreads|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|type=Excerpt adapted from ''The Art of the Wasted Day''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wordsworth]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Lord Byron]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but also the military leader the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the industrialist [[Josiah Wedgwood]];&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; aristocratic novelist [[Caroline Lamb]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; who was born a Ponsonby, came to visit too. [[Anne Lister]] from Yorkshire visited the couple, and was possibly inspired by their relationship to informally "marry" her own lover.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Feminist Frontiers |edition=8th |last1=Taylor |first1=Verta |last2=Whittier |first2=Nancy |last3=Rupp |first3=Leila J. |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-07340-430-1 |location=Boston, USA |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even travellers from continental Europe had heard of the couple and came to visit them, for instance [[Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau]], the German nobleman and landscape designer, wrote admiringly about them.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

The ladies were known throughout Britain, but have been said to have led "a rather unexciting life".&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/radio-documentary-an-extraordinary-affair-first-lesbians-ladies-of-llangollen.html|title=Documentary on One: An Extraordinary Affair|last=O'Donnell|first=Leeanne|date=30 April 2011|website=[[RTÉ Radio 1]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Charlotte]] wanted to see their cottage and persuaded [[King George III]] to grant them a pension. Eventually their families came to tolerate them.

==Personal lives==
Butler and Ponsonby lived together for 50 years. Their books and glassware carried both sets of initials and their letters were jointly signed. Towards the end of their lives, they both dressed in black [[riding habit]]s and men's top hats; some visitors thought it was eccentric and outdated – especially the hair powder – but neighbors thought the clothes were practical for living outdoors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rumors that they were in a sexual relationship floated around during their lives, and in 1791, a magazine described them and implied that they were in a sexual relationship.  According to [[Patricia Hampl]], they were appalled by this idea, and objected to the magazine's characterization to the point of consulting [[Edmund Burke]] over the possibility of suing the magazine for libel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In sharp contrast to the writings of their contemporary [[Anne Lister]], there is nothing in their extensive correspondence or diaries that indicates a sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Some consider Butler and Ponsonby's relationship to be a [[Boston marriage]], or a romantic relationship between two women who chose to live together and have "marriage-like relationships".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Others conclude that the two had a non-sexual [[romantic friendship]].  Norena Shopland says that modern attitudes designed to distinguish same-sex relationships from a romantic friendship indicate they had a sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shopland|first= Norena|chapter=Extraordinary Female Affection|title=Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales|publisher=Seren Books |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Fiona Brideoake, the description of [[queer]] is more appropriate than the anachronistic and specific label of [[lesbian]], particularly as queerness is a broad concept and significantly defined by its difference from typicality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fiona Brideoake also writes that their relationship was celebrated by other people as a form of mourning the relationships that they could not form.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Deaths &amp; legacy ==
[[File:Eglwys Sant Collen, Llangollen, Cymru St. Collen's Parish Church, Llangollen, Denbighshire, Wales. 47.JPG|thumb|Memorial in St Collen's Graveyard]]
Mary Caryll died in 1809.  Eleanor Butler died in 1829 at the age of 90. Sarah Ponsonby died two years later, age 76. They are all buried together at [[Collen|St Collen's Church]] in Llangollen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plas Newydd is now a museum run by [[Denbighshire|Denbighshire County]] Council. 

Butler's Hill, near Plas Newydd, is named in honour of Eleanor Butler. The Ponsonby Arms public house, a [[Grade II listed building]] on Mill Street in Llangollen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-1195-the-ponsonby-arms-p-h-mill-street-llangoll/osmap |title=The Ponsonby Arms PH, Llangollen, Denbighshire |website=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to take its name from Sarah Ponsonby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ponsonbyarmsllangollen.co.uk/ |title=The Ponsonby Arms |website=ponsonbyarmsllangollen.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428174314/http://www.ponsonbyarmsllangollen.co.uk/ |archivedate=28 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Wordsworth wrote a sonnet about them, "To the Lady E.B and the Hon. Miss P".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
*Anna Seward wrote about them in her 1796 poem, “Llangollen Vale”, in which she associates them with "chaste provinciality".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
*The Ladies appeared in a "thinly-veiled biographical novel", ''Chase of the Wild Goose'' by pioneering female physician and author, Mary Gordon, originally published in 1936 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press. The book was reprinted and retitled ''The Llangollen Ladies: The Story of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Sarah Ponsonby, Known as the Ladies of Llangollen''. In the late 1800s, Gordon is said to have seen the Ladies' apparitions at Plas Newydd, which inspired her to learn about their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Llangollen_Ladies.html?id=fVcKAQAAMAAJ |title=The Llangollen Ladies: The Story of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Sarah Ponsonby, Known as the Ladies of Llangollen |first=Mary |last=Gordon |date=29 July 2017 |publisher=John Jones |accessdate=29 July 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Gordon recounts in the final section of the book, "The Ladies Meet Me," she believed herself to be Butler and Ponsonby's "spiritual descendant,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  and hailed them as the feminist progenitors of the modernist female scholars, professionals, and "friends who prefer to live together."
*The ladies' story (along with their ghost story) is told in a chapter of the 2009 book, ''Queer Hauntings: True Tales of Gay and Lesbian Ghosts'' by Ken Summers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Queer-Hauntings-Tales-Lesbian-Ghosts/dp/1590212398 |title=Queer Hauntings: True Tales of Gay &amp; Lesbian Ghosts |first=Ken |last=Summers |date=18 September 2009 |publisher=Lethe Press |accessdate=29 July 2017 |via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In April 2011, the same month in which the first Irish civil partnerships took place under the [[Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010]], Irish state broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] broadcast a 45-minute radio documentary about the lives of Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby entitled ''An Extraordinary Affair''. It asked whether they were Ireland's first [[openly lesbian]] couple, but offered no evidence that their relationship was sexual.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt;
*In February 2016, the Ladies of Llangollen were featured on a series 3 episode of ''[[Mysteries at the Castle]]'' broadcast in the United States on the [[Travel Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/mysteries-at-the-castle/episodes/princes-plight-mad-king-ludwig-falling-for-love |title=Mysteries at the Castle - Prince's Plight, Mad King Ludwig, Falling for Love |website=Travel Channel |accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2014, Llangollen, the Ladies and Plas Newydd were featured in the introductory sequence of the BBC property buying series ''[[Escape to the Country]]'', series 22, episode 21, ''North Wales'' (available for online viewing in the U.S. via Netflix).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.netflix.com/watch/80160909?trackId=13589554 |title=Escape to the Country Collection |website=Netflix |access-date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leo Aurelio Marzolo''' (February 22, 1887 &amp;ndash; March 1964) was a [[Art conservation and restoration|restorer]] of paintings at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UuBXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OfUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2583,4501476&amp;dq=leo+a+marzolo&amp;hl=en|title=Declares Painting Authentic Raphael|date=20 July 1939|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also a painter. He was born in [[Martinez, California]], [[United States]].

He studied at the [[Chicago Gallery Association]] and the [[Palette and Chisel Academy]]. His work is in the [[Illinois State Museum]] at [[Springfield, Illinois]].

Marzolo may have restored the "[[La Madonna de Bogota (Raphael)|Madonna of Bogotá]]" painted by [[Raphael Sanzio]] of [[Urbino]] circa 1517. The Madonna keeps some resemblance to the ''[[Madonna of the Rose (Raphael)|Madonna of the Rose]]'' attributed to [[Raphael]] or [[Giulio Romano]] and is today at kept at the [[Prado Museum]]. Discovered by Santiago Martinez Delgado in his native city of [[Bogotá]], the Madonna was taken to [[New York City]] and later to [[Chicago]]. However, there are doubts as to whom restored the said Madonna of if a copy was made. The two possible candidates for either one of them were Leo A. Marzolo and Sheldom Keck.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

He retired in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/509386162.html?dids=509386162:509386162&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+01%2C+1956&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Art+Expert+Will+Retire+This+Fall&amp;pqatl=google|title=Art Expert Will Retire This Fall|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7584">'''Liliane Barrard''' (1948 - June 24, 1986) and '''Maurice Barrard''' (1941? &amp;ndash; June 24, 1986) were a French couple who gained fame climbing at high altitude, mainly in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] and [[Karakoram]] ranges, and emphasising 'Alpine'-style 'fast and light' ascents.

==Early life==
The couple met while climbing in South America, having previously worked mainly in teaching.
Billing themselves as the 'World's Highest Couple', they successfully climbed [[Gasherbrum II]] (8,035 m/26,360 ft) in 1982 with Liliane's brother, Alain Bontemps, and [[Nanga Parbat]] (8,126 m/26,658 ft) in 1984 (first female ascent of this peak for Liliane). Although narrowly failing to make the summit of [[Makalu]] (8,462 m/27,765 ft), they nevertheless put the finances together to attempt [[K2]] (8,611 m/28,268 ft) in 1986 with a small team consisting of themselves, Polish climber [[Wanda Rutkiewicz]] and French climber Michel Parmentier.

==K2==
The start to the Barrards' K2 expedition was not a promising one: Maurice and Liliane "had left their entire expedition budget -- thousands of dollars plus airline tickets and passports on the backseat of a taxi!"&lt;ref&gt;Curran, Jim, ''K2: Triumph and Tragedy.'' p.32.  Grafton, 1989. ({{ISBN|0-586-20569-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything was sorted out in due course, and the Barrards, [[Wanda Rutkiewicz]] and Parmentier arrived at the K2 motel at about the same time as  [[Alan Rouse]]'s British expedition, then headed to Base Camp.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, Jim, ''K2: Triumph and Tragedy.'' p.43, 47.  Grafton, 1989. ({{ISBN|0-586-20569-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barrards' expedition ascended the mountain very slowly, spending nights at 6300, 7100, 7700, 7900, and 8300 meters (20,669; 23,294; 25,262; 25,919; and 27,250 feet, respectively) on the climb. They spent their last night before their summit attempt bivouacked with a tent but no sleeping bags.  The Barrards, Rutkiewicz, and Parmentier all summited successfully by 11:00am on June 23, 1986.  [[Wanda Rutkiewicz]] was the first female ascender of K2, a mere 30 minutes before Liliane Barrard.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, p.65-66, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both women summited K2 without using supplemental oxygen.  

The four climbers descended only as far as their bivouac site from the night before, near the [[Bottleneck (K2)|Bottleneck]] (a treacherous terrain feature at around 8,300 m/27,250 feet).  The Barrards and their group had run out of fuel for their stoves (which are necessary to melt snow for water in order to prevent dehydration at high altitude).  Parmentier descended first, to try and borrow some stove fuel from a nearby pair of [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] climbers, [[Mari Abrego]] and [[Josema Casimiro]].  The others descended after him.  Rutkiewicz caught up with Parmentier; the Barrards lagged behind.  The Basque climbers had also run out of gas, and accompanied Parmentier and Rutkiewicz back to the French Camp Three, at 7800m/25,600 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, p.65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutkiewicz and the Basques continued down the mountain, and Parmentier waited for the Barrards to reach Camp Three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://outside.away.com/news/specialreport/alison/K2omag.html Child, Greg and Jon Krakauer, ''The Dangerous Summer'', Outside Magazine, March 1987] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416042251/http://outside.away.com/news/specialreport/alison/K2omag.html |date=2009-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The weather was deteriorating.  A French climber climbing with an [[Italy|Italian]] expedition, [[Benoît Chamoux]], tried to convince Parmentier to come down, without success, and left him a radio before turning around and heading back toward Base Camp.  Eventually Parmentier, who had tried to wait for some sign of the Barrards, began to descend, in white-out conditions and gale-force winds.  Parmentier was eventually guided down the mountainside via radio directions from Base Camp, about 3000m/9,843 feet below, based on the few landmarks he could find in the blizzard.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutkiewicz, suffering from frostbite, and Parmentier both reached Base Camp alive.  The Barrards were never seen alive again.  The morning after summiting, Maurice had been very tired, and he and Liliane had left their tent after their climbing partners.  It was windy and visibility was poor.  The most likely scenarios are that the Barrards wandered off-route in the storm; that they fell; or that they collapsed from exhaustion and possible [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;Curran, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A month later a Korean team found Liliane's body on a snow field at around {{convert|17500|ft|-1|disp=flip}}, nearly {{convert|10000|ft|-1|disp=flip}} lower than where she was last seen; Maurice's body was not found until 1998 on the glacier just above Base Camp, and both are now buried at the Gilkey Memorial at the base of K2.

==Notes==
* That summer, known as the ‘Black Summer of 1986’, saw 13 deaths and 27 ascents on K2.  
* During the 'Black Summer', many expeditions shared in a surfeit of tragedies.  An [[United States|American]] expedition to the South-South-West Ridge suffered two casualties --[[John Smolich]] and Alan Pennington were killed in an avalanche on June 21, after which their teammates left the mountain.  Maurice and Liliane Barrard were lost on their descent after a successful summit bid, on June 25.  A [[Poland|Polish]] climber, [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (mountaineer)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]], fell to his death after a successful summit of the Central Rib of the South Face, on July 10.  On July 16, [[Renato Casarotto]] fell into a crevasse, after an unsuccessful attempt at climbing the South-South-West Ridge, and died later that day after being pulled out.  [[Wojciech Wroz]], a Polish climber, died during his descent on August 3-4, after a successful ascent of the South-South-West Ridge.  On August 4, Mohammed Ali (Sirdar, or leader, of a South Korean expedition's high-altitude porters) was killed by stonefall on the Abruzzi Ridge.  [[United Kingdom|British]] climber [[Julie Tullis]] died after a successful summit attempt and forced descent to Camp Four, possibly from [[HACE|High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)]] on August 7.  Two [[Austria]]n climbers, [[Alfred Imitzer]] and [[Hannes Wieser]], died in a descent from Camp Four during a storm on August 10. British climber [[Alan Rouse]] is presumed to have died the same day; as was [[Dobroslawa Miodowicz-Wolf]], a Polish climber who disappeared on fixed ropes below Camp Three. Difficult weather conditions caused many other injuries and near-fatalities throughout the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, Jim, ''K2: Triumph and Tragedy.'' p.187-88.  Grafton, 1989. ({{ISBN|0-586-20569-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Barrards had planned to attempt the notorious East or Kangshung face of [[Everest]] (8,848 m/29,028 ft) following their K2 bid.

The [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA) is an undergraduate college in [[West Point, New York]] with the mission of educating and [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioning]] officers for the [[United States Army]]. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. It is not unusual for the service academies to have high dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated.&lt;ref name="zeilin2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Allan Reed|author2=Jack Shulimson |title=Commandants of the Marine Corps|publisher=US Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|year=2004|pages=85–96|isbn=0-87021-012-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qns8bW_SESYC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Jacob+Zeilin++military+academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (literature), [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] (art), [[Maynard James Keenan]] (music), [[Adam Vinatieri]] (football), and even the military: [[Jacob Zeilin]], [[Lewis Addison Armistead]], and [[Courtney Hodges]].

'''Mahienour El-Masry''' ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: ماهينور المصري, born 1986) is an [[Egypt]]ian human rights lawyer and political activist from [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Egypt’s ‘beacon of hope’ behind steel bars|url = http://egyptianstreets.com/2014/05/23/egypts-beacon-of-hope-behind-steel-bars/|website = Egyptian Streets|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has been engaged on the activist scene in the coastal city since the mid 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Run Mahienour run|url = http://www.madamasr.com/opinion/politics/run-mahienour-run|website = Mada Masr|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently serving a prison sentence for her anti-regime activities.

She has been organizing peaceful protests and supports activities for political prisoners, using social media to denounce human rights violations.&lt;ref name="Open Democracy"&gt;Acconcia, Giuseppe .

''[[Open Democracy]]''. 2014-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Often dubbed as a voice of the revolution and a champion of women’s rights, her activism covered a wide range of activities, as an Alexandrian scholar and friend notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There was not a single struggle that was off limits for Mahienour: human rights, student rights, women’s rights, labor strikes, legal aid, anti-police brutality, housing for the poor, corruption, anti-military trials, heritage preservation, right to the public space, state-led land reclamation from the poor, climate change, street children’s rights, Syrian refugees; the list goes on...Mahienour was always there, sleeping next to Syrian refugees in police stations to ensure they did not get tortured or deported, advocating for the twenty-one female supporters of the Brotherhood who were sentenced (and later acquitted) to eleven years in jail, and locating missing persons through the security labyrinth. Mahienour would rush to defend the victim’s rights—regardless of affiliation—and attend the funeral of people she had never met. Her very presence sent a message that this issue really mattered and raised protestors’ morale."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/18248/run-mahienour-run|title = Run Mahienour Run|date = 23 June 2014|accessdate = |website = Jadaliyya|publisher = |last = Ali|first = Amro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;El-Masry was sentenced to two years in prison for violating Egypt’s controversial protest law before having her sentence reduced to six months.&lt;ref name="FIDH"&gt;.

She was released in September 2014, only to be sentenced on a different charge, in May 2015, when under the Morsi presidency, El-Masry and a group of lawyers started a sit-in in front of El-Raml police station in Alexandria, demanding an official apology from the Ministry of Interior regarding the injury of their fellow lawyer at the hands of police personnel. The lawyers were then arrested and accused of attempting to break into the police station. An acquittal hearing for El-Masry and her colleagues was made in December 2015 but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/12/27/court-refuses-second-appeal-to-release-el-massry-shaaban-and-al-kahwagi/|title = Court refuses second appeal to release El-Masry, Shaaban, and El-Kahwagi|date = 27 December 2015|accessdate = |website = Daily News Egypt|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been declared a [[prisoner of conscience]] by [[Amnesty International]].

In June 2014, El-Masry was awarded the [[Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize]], an international honour given annually to a lawyer for contributions to the defence of human rights. She was the second person to be awarded the international award while in prison since Nelson Mandela in 1985.

}}'''Martín Marciales Moncada''', known as '''Martín Marciales, hijo''' (January 18, 1912 - March 6, 2001) was a [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] visionary, [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. He critically contributed to the development of the city of [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]] during the 20th century. Martín Marciales Moncada was one of the few financially successful Venezuelan entrepreneurs who was never involved in politics. President Velásquez referred to him as a “rarely seen prophet in his own land.” Historian Luis Hernández Contreras researched Martín Marciales Moncada’s personal and public life and published his biography in a three-volume tome entitled ''Martín Marciales, hijo'', which includes a prologue written by former Venezuelan President [[Ramón José Velásquez|Ramón J. Velásquez]]. Martín Marciales Moncada was one of very few recipients of the [[Order of Francisco de Miranda|Order Francisco de Miranda]], [[Knight Grand Cross]] (1st Class), the highest rank of the order. It was the only time President Velasquez traveled outside of the capital city to grant the National Order to a citizen.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Martín Marciales, hijo Volume I|last=Hernández Contreras|first=Luis|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=980-389-086-7|location=Venezuela|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Martín Marciales Jaime, Martín Marciales Moncada’s father,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Mart%C3%ADn-Marciales-Jaime/6000000004654424114|title=Martín Marciales Jaime|website=geni_family_tree|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[revolutionary]] in favor of Juan Pablo Peñaloza, the opposition leader to both [[Cipriano Castro]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]]. The opposition were then called “Yellow Liberals.” Martin Marciales Jaime was a carpenter who hid weapons in secret compartments in the furniture he made. The weapons were intended to arm the forces of the so-called “Yellow Revolutionaries” who hoped to oust then dictator Juan Vicente Gómez from power.

When Martín Marciales Moncada was eight years old, his father was sent to prison at El Castillo de San Carlos due to his revolutionary activities. The entire family relocated closer to the prison so they could visit and assist Martin Marciales Jaime. At that time, Martín Marciales Moncada started working to help support his family. He and his mother opened a small shop where they sold groceries and basic goods. Martín Marciales Moncada graduated from elementary school, but did not continue his education.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Return to San Cristóbal==
As a young teenager, Martín Marciales Moncada started working as a traveling merchant. He sold spare parts for vehicles, including tires, as well as other goods. In his early twenties, Martín Marciales Moncada returned to San Cristóbal. There, he bought from his father and began managing a [[Chevrolet]] car dealership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tochadas.net.ve/la-llegada-del--automovil-en-san-cristobal---copiar.html|title=La llegada del  Automóvil en San Cristóbal - Copiar - #Tochadasnetve|last=tochadastudio|website=tochadas.net.ve|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the [[Germans]] dominated most of local commerce in the area using their own [[monetary system]]; they paid local farmers with custom-made tokens, which could only be used in German-owned shops and businesses. As such, there was no real local currency in circulation. Martín Marciales Moncada played major role in disentangling the local economy from the German influenced system of tokens.

Later, at the age of 28, Martín Marciales Moncada began directly importing [[General Motors]] vehicles to San Cristóbal, and was one of two major importers of GM vehicles in the country. This business effort allowed Martín Marciales Moncada to develop enough financial power to contribute significantly to the city’s development. Martín Marciales Moncada’s biographer, Luis Hernández Contreras, described these efforts as Martín Marciales Moncada’s “own diverse ways of being useful.”

On April 7, 1945, Martín Marciales Moncada married Marina González Romero. The couple had four children: Marcial, Mariana, Mariela, and Mario. Marina still resides in San Cristóbal and is a renowned philanthropist and artist.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Martín Marciales, hijo Volume II|last=Hernández Contreras|first=Luis|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=980-389-086-7|location=Venezuela|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Lou Lord''' (born March 1, 1965) is an [[indie folk]] musician, [[busking|busker]] and recording artist.

==Life and career==
Mary Lou Lord first gained attention playing [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and singing in and around [[Boston]]'s [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|subway]] stations (particularly on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]], as noted by the name she chose for her music and lyric publishing company, On the Red Line Music, administered by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]].)

Lord became friends with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] front man [[Kurt Cobain]] in the fall of 1991, before the group's rise to mainstream fame; there has been much speculation on the relationship. In 2010 Lord published an explanation from her point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About me and Kurt (what you don't know)|url=http://www.oedipus1.com/home/?p=203|accessdate=13 October 2018|agency=Oedipus|date=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She met [[Elliott Smith]] though [[Slim Moon]], the owner of [[Kill Rock Stars]] and her boyfriend at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nugent|first1=Benjamin|title=Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing|date=2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780306813931|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rdPsQFU9HoC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord toured three separate times with Smith during the 1990s. Smith also wrote and helped Lord record a song called "I Figured You Out" in 1997.

Lord signed with the Sony subsidiary Work in 1997 and released the album ''Got No Shadow'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kemper|first1=Nick|title=Mary Lou Lord|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/309852/mary-lou-lord/biography|website=Billboard|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 31, 1998 Lord and Kevin Patey, from the band Raging Teens, had a daughter whom they named Annabelle Lord-Patey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mary Lou Lord Becomes a Mother|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431413/mary-lou-lord-becomes-a-mother/|accessdate=27 December 2015|agency=Viacom|date=January 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her recording of [[Daniel Johnston]]'s "Speeding Motorcycle" (which originally featured on her self-titled 8-song Kill Rock Stars release) was featured in commercials for [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores, after which her label reissued the song as the lead-off track of a CD single which also included two demo recordings from the sessions for ''Got No Shadow''.

In 2001, Lord released ''Live City Sounds''. This was a self-released disc of Lord playing live in the Boston subway. The disc was later re-released after she signed to [[Rubric Records]].

She announced in 2005 that she suffered from a rare vocal cord affliction known as [[spasmodic dysphonia]]. She thereafter became more involved in [[A&amp;R]] work and started a new management company with Kevin Patey, Jittery Jack Management.

In 2011, Lord used [[Kickstarter]] to record a new album titled ''Backstreet Angels'' which was self-released in 2015. In 2012 she began performing regularly once again.

'''Max Cady''' is a [[fictional character]] and the primary [[antagonist]] of the [[John D. MacDonald]] novel ''[[The Executioners (MacDonald novel)|The Executioners]]''. He was portrayed by [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' and [[Robert De Niro]] in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|remake]].

==Character overview==
[[Image:Robertmitchum.JPG|180px|thumb|Robert Mitchum as Max Cady in ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1962).]]
[[Image:Max-cady.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert De Niro as Max Cady in the 1991 [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|remake]].]]
In both film versions of MacDonald's novel, Cady is a criminal with an obsessive grudge against an attorney named Sam Bowden (played by [[Gregory Peck]] in the first film and by [[Nick Nolte]] in the remake) who sent him to [[prison]] for [[rape]]. While in prison, Cady teaches himself to read as he nurtures his hatred of Bowden, made especially intense when his wife [[divorce]]s him and takes their child. Upon his release, he terrorizes Bowden and his family, [[stalking]] his wife at their house and attempting to seduce Bowden's teenaged daughter. After Bowden's failed attempts to get rid of Cady with [[bribery]] and a [[restraining order]], he hires street thugs to rough Cady up, which only succeeds in making him angrier and more determined to make sure Bowden "learns all about loss". Cady tracks the family to its summer home in the titular [[North Carolina]] beach town of Cape Fear and nearly kills them all. In the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the first film, Bowden puts Cady under [[citizen's arrest]]; in the second, Cady apparently drowns after a fight with Bowden.

===Differences between the films===
Significant differences are seen between the way in which Cady is portrayed in the original film and the remake. Mitchum's characterization is that of a sleazy, degenerate [[con artist]], while De Niro's is of a homicidal [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]], who viciously attacks everything and everyone Bowden holds dear (he even beats and rapes one of Bowden's colleagues). The remake also sheds some light on Cady's background, revealing he grew up in a rural [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] family who [[snake handling|handled snakes]] and drank [[strychnine]]  to achieve [[religious ecstasy]]. 

Also, many differences occur in the films' portrayals of Cady and Bowden's relationship. In the first film, Bowden merely [[testimony|testified]] against Cady in court. In the remake, Bowden was Cady's attorney who deliberately suppressed evidence which may have lightened Cady's sentence or granted him an [[acquittal]]. Most notably, Cady's fate differs in the two films. In the 1962 version, Bowden manages to grab his revolver and shoot Cady in the leg during a fight between the two men. Rather than finish him off, Bowden spares Cady so he will be forced to spend the rest of his life in jail.
 
In the remake, Bowden is able to handcuff Cady's ankle to a railing in the houseboat before it hits submerged rocks and begins to break apart. The two exchange blows with rocks, and Bowden savagely attempts to bring a large rock down on Cady's head. Before he can do so, though, Cady is washed out into the river, still cuffed to part of the houseboat, madly crying out and [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]], and Bowden then watches as Cady is pulled to the bottom of the river and drowns.

===Differences between the book and the films===

In the novel by John D. MacDonald, Sam testified against Max back in [[World War II]], since he witnessed the latter raping a fourteen-year-old girl when he was stationed in [[Australia]]. Max was sentenced to life at a hard labor prison camp but was released thirteen years later. Max nurtured his grudge against Sam during his time which exacerbated due to his wife divorcing him and his only son dying in an accident. Unlike the films, Max refers to Sam as "lieutenant" instead of "counselor".

Max's background differs from the films in that he hails from [[West Virginia]] and has three brothers, all of whom were criminals (with one killed during a prison riot). They are not religious zealots like in the 1991 film. However, in the book, Max is very much a violent psychopath who has no remorse for anything he does which includes, among many other despicable acts, shooting one of Sam's children with a rifle. He is determined to kill Sam "six times". 

Cady's fate in the book is being shot by Sam as he flees from their home after attacking Sam's wife. In the wee hours of the morning during a police search, his body is found in the woods behind the Bowden home. He died of excessive blood loss from two of Sam's shots.

==Cultural impact==
*Mitchum's portrayal of Cady ranks number 28 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|list of the top 50 movie villains of all time]].
*Cady was parodied in a 1993 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[Cape Feare]]", in which [[Sideshow Bob]] stalks the Simpson family to a lake town to get revenge on [[Bart Simpson|Bart]].
*De Niro's portrayal of Cady was the inspiration for professional wrestler [[Dan Spivey]]'s Waylon Mercy character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Ryan |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/spiveypart2 |title=Dan Spivey: Part 2 |publisher=WWE.com |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208034155/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/spiveypart2 |archivedate=2010-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Windham Rotunda, another professional wrestler, portrays a character named [[Bray Wyatt]], who is also loosely modeled after De Niro's version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critics, not fans, should bite their tongues|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2013/07/15/pf-20975591.html|publisher=Slam!

Wark is known for their writings on [[media studies|media theory]], [[critical theory]], [[new media]], and the [[Situationist International]].  Their best known works are ''[[A Hacker Manifesto]]'' and ''[[Gamer Theory]]''. They are Professor of Media and Cultural Studies at [[The New School]] in New York City.

==Life==
'''Kenneth McKenzie Wark''' was born in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], Australia in 1961 and grew up with their older brother Robert and sister Susan. McKenzie's mother died when they were 6 years old. Brother Robert McKenzie Wark remembers reading to them as a young child and the three children were brought up by their architect father Ross Kenneth Wark. McKenzie received a bachelor's degree from [[Macquarie University]], a Master's from the [[University of Technology, Sydney]] and they received a PhD in Communications from [[Murdoch University]]. Wark is married to Christen Clifford. They have two children, Felix and Vera.

==Works==
In ''[[Virtual Geography]]'', published in 1994, Wark offered a theory of what they called the 'weird global media event'. Examples given in the book include the [[1987 stock market crash|stock market crash of 1987]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen square demonstrations of 1989]] and the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. They argued that the emergence of a global [[media space]] – a virtual geography – made out of increasingly pervasive lines of communication – vectors – was emerging as a more chaotic space than [[globalisation]] theory usually maintains.

Much of Wark's early engagement in public debate occurred in the Australian post-marxist quarterly [[Arena (first series)|''Arena'']], through a number of articles and exchanges about the character of real abstraction, the meta-ideological character of post-structuralism, and the consequences of these issues for emancipatory social theory.

In two subsequent books, ''[[The Virtual Republic]]'', published in 1997, and ''[[Celebrities, Culture and Cyberspace]]'' (1999), Wark turned their attention to the national [[culture|cultural]] space of their homeland, Australia. The first of these works examined the so-called 'culture wars' of the 1990s as symptomatic of struggles over the redefinition of Australian [[national identity]] and culture in an age of global media. The second of these 'Australian' books looked at the transformation of a [[social democratic]] idea of the 'popular' as a political idea into a more [[market-based]] and media-driven popular culture.

Both these studies grew out of Wark's experience as a [[public intellectual]] who participated in public controversies, mainly through his newspaper column in ''[[The Australian]]'', a leading national daily. They developed an approach based on [[participant observation]], but adapted to the media sphere.

Wark described the process of culture by which "the jolt of new experiences becomes naturalised into habit" or second nature and describes the information society as not being new but something that changes through culture the balance between space binding and time binding media.

They further describe the concept of "third nature" or telesthesia, where devices such as television and the telephone creates a platform which we use to communicate to people over large distances and not just a machine that we learn to operate individually.  This is described in his book ''The Virtual Republic'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;While it may feel natural for some to inhabit this media-made world, I suspect there is a fundamental change here that has a lot of people just a bit spooked. It's no longer a case of making second nature out of nature, of building things and getting used to living in the world people build. I think it might be interesting to consider telesthesia to be something fundamentally different. What gets woven out of telegraph, telephone, television, telecommunications is not a second nature but what I call third nature.{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wark emigrated to the United States in 2000. With the Australian poet [[John Kinsella (poet)|John Kinsella]], Australian novelist [[Bernard Cohen (Australian author)|Bernard Cohen]] and Australian memoirist [[Terri-Ann White]], Wark co-wrote ''[[Speed Factory]]'', an experimental work about distance and expatriation. The co-authors developed for this the speed factory writing technique, in which an author writes 300 words, emails it to the next author, who then has 24 hours to write the next 300 words.

''[[Dispositions]]'', another experimental work followed. Wark travelled the world with a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device and recorded observations at particular times and coordinates. The media theorist [[Ned Rossiter]] has called this approach a 'micro-[[empiricism]]', and sees it as derived from the work of the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]].

In 2004 Wark published their best known work, ''[[A Hacker Manifesto]]''. Here Wark argues that the rise of intellectual property creates a new [[Class conflict|class division]], between those who produce it, whom they calls the [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] class, and those who come to own it, the vectoralist class. Wark argues that these vectoralists have imposed the concept of property on all physical fields (thus having scarcity), but now the new vectoralists lay claim to intellectual property, a field that is not bound by scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2479/is_1-2_34/ai_n27023682/pg_5/ | title= Tactical media and the end of history}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the concept of intellectual property these vectoralists attempt to institute an imposed scarcity in an immaterial field. Wark argues that the vectoral class cannot control the intellectual (property) world itself, but only in its commodified form—not its overall application or use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/warktext.html | title = A Hacker Manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gamer Theory]]'' combined Wark's interest in experimental writing techniques in [[network media|networked media]] with their own developing media theory. ''Gamer Theory'' was first published by the Institute for the Future of the Book as a [[networked book]] with his own specially designed interface. In ''Gamer Theory'' Wark argues that in a world that is increasingly competitive and game-like, [[computer games]] are a [[utopian]] version of the world (itself an imperfect game), because they actually realise the principles of the [[level playing field]] and reward based on merit that is elsewhere promised but not actually delivered.

Wark's recent work explores the art, writing, and politics of the [[Situationist International]] (SI). In their book ''50 Years of Recuperation of the Situationist International'' (the result of a lecture given at Columbia University), Wark examines the influences of Situationist aesthetics on contemporary art and activist movements, from tactical media to the anti-globalism movement. Wark pays particular attention to often-neglected figures and works in the SI, including the utopian architectural projects of Constant, the painting of Giuseppe Pinot, The Situationist Times of Jacqueline de Jong and the novels of Michèle Bernstein.

In 2013 Wark, along with Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker, published the book ''Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation''. In the opening of the book the authors ask "Does everything that exists, exist to me presented and represented, to be mediated and remediated, to be communicated and translated? There are mediative situations in which heresy, exile, or banishment carry the day, not repetition, communion, or integration. There are certain kinds of messages that state 'there will be no more messages'. Hence for every communication there is a correlative excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;''Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation'', Alexander R. Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark (University of Chicago Press, 2013), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been referred to as the "New York School of Media Theory."&lt;ref&gt;Geert Lovnik, [http://www.e-flux.com/journal/54/59854/hermes-on-the-hudson-notes-on-media-theory-after-snowden/ "Hermes on the Hudson: Notes on Media Theory after Snowden"], e-flux #54 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[New School University|The New School]], Professor Wark teaches seminars on the Situationist International, the Militarized Vision lecture, as well as Introduction to Cultural Studies. Wark was an [[Eyebeam (organization)|Eyebeam]] resident in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = McKenzie Wark {{!}} eyebeam.org|url = http://eyebeam.org/people/mckenzie-wark|website = eyebeam.org|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
At the [[theoretical]] level, Wark's writing can be seen in the context of three currents: British [[Cultural Studies]], German Critical Theory and French [[Poststructuralism]]. Their earlier works combined British and French influences to extend Australian cultural studies to encompass questions of globalisation and new media technology. Their later works draw more from Critical Theory and much revised [[Marxism]]. Through their experimentation with new media forms, starting with listservers such as nettime.org and later with web interfaces such as the one developed for Gamer Theory, their works intersect with other new media theorists such as [[Geert Lovink]] and [[Mark Amerika]].

'''Melissa Merchiche '''(born August 21, 1985 in [[Marseille]]), better known by her stage name '''Melissa M''' or simply '''Melissa''', is a [[France|French]] [[R&amp;B]] [[singer]] of Algerian origin. Her debut album entitled ''Avec Tout Mon Amour'' and two successful singles, "Elle" and "Cette Fois" was on April 23, 2007. ''Avec Tout Mon Amour'' was ranked in the French Top 50.  Her second album entitled ''Melissa M'' was released in 2009. In November 2013 the single "Jump" was released to help promote her upcoming third album, which is still untitled. She currently lives in [[Gardanne]], [[France]].

==Biography==
Melissa M was born on August 21, 1985 in [[Marseille]], in the southern French region of [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]. Her parents are from the Algerian city of [[Bejaia]].

Passionate about music since her childhood, she began singing at the age of 10. She participated in various competitions in her hometown and while taking singing lessons. Her big sister entered a day at the age of 14 years at issuance Seeds star 4, but lost in the final. At 18 while preparing for her [[Certificat d'aptitude professionnelle|CAP]] salon, she met the French production duo Kilomaitre. Originally she wanted to use the stage name Melissa but that name had already been taken by another singer. So she added the letter ''M'', which is the first letter of her last name (Merchiche).

'''Clifford Neal Knox''' (June 20, 1935 &amp;ndash; January 17, 2005) was a board member and officer of the [[National Rifle Association]], gun magazine writer and editor, [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] activist, and prolific author of technical firearms articles and articles related to his interpretation of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] and views on firearms laws.

==Early life==
Born in [[Rush Springs, Oklahoma]] and raised in [[Texas]], Knox served eight years in the [[Texas National Guard]] and attended Abilene Christian College, now [[Abilene Christian University]], and [[Midwestern State University]] in Wichita Falls. He also began what would become a long career as a freelance writer and columnist; he started as a reporter for the ''[[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]] Daily Record'' before he moved on to the ''[[Times Record News]]'' in Wichita Falls.

==Career==
As an independent writer, Knox sold several articles to gun magazines including ''[[Guns &amp; Ammo]]'' and ''[[Guns (magazine)|Guns]]'' magazine between 1964 and 1966. He formally entered the firearms journalism trade in 1966, when he became the founding editor of ''Gun Week'', a weekly newspaper covering firearms issues of the day. The paper gave in-depth coverage to the bill that would eventually become the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]]. Knox left ''Gun Week'' in 1968, when he moved to Wolfe Publishing/as editor of ''Handloader Magazine'' and founding editor of ''Rifle Magazine''.

In 1978, Knox moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in order to lobby against gun control measures and work for the National Rifle Association. He served four years as the executive director of the [[Institute for Legislative Action]] (ILA), the lobbying arm of the NRA. At the ILA, Knox was instrumental in convincing friendly lawmakers to introduce a reform of the 1968 Act. The bill became the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]], which eventually passed in 1986.

From 1984 to his death, Knox was the chairman of the Firearms Coalition, an organization that he created, which lobbies against restrictive gun laws.

==Political activism==
One of the recurring themes throughout Knox's career was his uncompromising stance on gun laws and the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|2nd Amendment]], which he believed recognizes a pre-existing human right to self-defense. His views would lead him into many confrontations with other members of the NRA leadership and Congressional leadership. Knox publicly accused many NRA leaders of being too moderate. In 1977, Knox was among the hardliners who took control of the NRA.

The same hardliners fired Knox from the NRA five years later in 1982. Over the ensuing decade, Knox used his own columns in magazines popular with NRA members like ''Shotgun News'' and ''Guns &amp; Ammo'' to get himself and up to 10 allies elected to the NRA board in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray Davidson|first=Osha|title=Under Fire: The NRA and the Battle for Gun Control|year=1993|publisher=University of Iowa Press|url=https://www.amazon.com/Under-Fire-The-Battle-Control/dp/0877456461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a narrowly-divided NRA Board voted Knox out of the succession line for President of the NRA replacing him with [[Charlton Heston]], who was subsequently elected president of the organization.

==Death==
Knox died in 2005, aged 69, after a year-long struggle with [[colon cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Gun Week|title=Gun Rights Champion Neal Knox Dies|url=http://www.gunweek.com/2005/nealobit0201.html|publisher=Gun Week|accessdate=6 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617202544/http://www.gunweek.com/2005/nealobit0201.html|archive-date=2012-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, Jeff Knox, continues the ''Knox Report'' column which is published in ''[[Shotgun News]]'' and elsewhere. Another son, Chris Knox has compiled and edited a collection of his writing, ''Neal Knox: The Gun Rights War''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knox |first=Chris|title=Neal Knox − The Gun Rights War|year=2009|publisher=MacFarlane Press|asin=0976863308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1263">'''Nicholas Lambrinides''' (1879–1962) was an American entrepreneur who built the [[Skyline Chili]] chain of [[Cincinnati chili|chili]] [[restaurant]]s based in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]].

==Life==
Born a [[Greeks|Greek]] in [[Kastoria]], Greece, Lambrinides emigrated to the States in 1912 at the age of 33. In 1949 Lambrinides and his three sons, opened a small restaurant in what's now known Price Hill, naming it Skyline Chili because of its panoramic view of downtown [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19542695 | title=Nicholas Lambrinides | accessdate=2010-12-16 | author=Tate, Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cincinnati-style chili]] is a sauce usually used over [[spaghetti]] or [[hot dog]]s, that contains a blend of spices that with a distinct taste. The recipe for Skyline Chili is a well-kept family secret among Lambrinides' surviving children.

{{History of Morocco}}
The '''Oulad Delim''' ({{Lang-ar|أولأد دليم}}) is a [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] [[tribe]] of mainly [[Arab]] origins. They were formerly considered of [[Hassane]] status i.e. part of the ruling warrior stratum. The Oulad Delim speak [[Hassaniya Arabic]]. They traditionally live in the southern regions of [[Western Sahara]] ([[Río de Oro]]), especially around the city of [[Dakhla, Western Sahara|Dakhla]]. They have extensive tribal connections with northern [[Mauritania]]n tribes. They are [[Muslim]]s, adhering to the [[Maliki]] school of [[Sunni]] [[Islam]]. 

Their traditional lifestyle was [[nomad]]ic, based on [[camel]] herding. They were active in resisting [[Europe]]an [[colonialism|colonial]] advances during the 19th century, but after [[Spain]] consolidated its hold over [[Spanish Sahara]], many Oulad Delim enrolled in the [[Tropas Nómadas]] and other Spanish auxiliary forces.

'''Paul Bookout''' (born '''Paul Jerry Bookout'''; June 30, 1962) was the [[President pro tempore]] of the [[Arkansas Senate]] from 2011 to 2013, when he resigned from office. A member of the [[Democratic Party of Arkansas|Democratic Party]], Bookout served as an [[Arkansas House of Representatives|Arkansas Representative]] from 1999 until 2004 and as an Arkansas Senator from 2006 to 2013. Bookout was convicted of [[wire fraud]] in 2014.

==Early life and education==
Paul Bookout was born on June 30, 1962, in [[El Dorado, Arkansas]], to [[Jerry Bookout|Jerry]] and Loretta ([[née]] Langford) Bookout. He graduated from [[Arkansas State University]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Political career==
Bookout served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004, when he was elected to fill the seat of his late father, Jerry, who had held the seat from 1973 to 1997, and again from 2003 until his death.{{cn|date=July 2017}}  Paul Bookout then served in the Arkansas Senate from 2006 until 2013 during which time he also served as the President pro tempore of the Senate from 2011 to 2013.

==Criminal investigation and resignation==
Bookout resigned as the President pro tempore and as an Arkansas Senator in 2013 after it was discovered he spent campaign funds on personal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turnure |first=Jessi |url=http://www.kait8.com/story/23182372/ark-lawmaker-no-updates-about-legislative-office |title=Bookout announces resignation from Senate |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2013/aug/20/senator-paul-bookout-resigns/ |title=Senator Paul Bookout resigns |publisher=Arkansasonline.com |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2015, Bookout entered a negotiated plea in federal court to a felony mail fraud count for using interstate communications to file a false report in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilkey |first=Michael |title=Former Sen. Paul Bookout Pleads Guilty To Mail Fraud |url=http://talkbusiness.net/2015/03/former-sen-paul-bookout-pleads-guilty-to-mail-fraud/ |website=Talk Business &amp; Politics |accessdate=September 8, 2017 |date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 2016, he was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. U.S. District Judge Brian Miller also ordered Bookout to pay $150,048 in restitution, according to court records. He reported to prison on May 2, 2016. Under the agreement Bookout was ordered to pay about $150,158, though it is not certain who will get the money, the state or contributors. 

The crime could have carried a sentence up to 20 years. Judge Brian Miller noted he could depart from guidelines, in either direction. The amount he owes is the amount from two campaign cycles studied by prosecutors within the three-year period under which charges could be filed. But he spent far more over the years in a similar manner. Bookout was released from prison on July 17, 2017.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

'''Paula Kahumbu''' is a wildlife conservationist and Chief Executive Officer of [[WildlifeDirect]]. She is best known as a campaigner for elephants and wildlife, spearheading the Hands Off Our Elephants Campaign, which was launched in 2014 with Kenyan First Lady [[Margaret Kenyatta]].

== Education and Early Career ==
Kahumbu grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, and there attended  primary and secondary school at [[Loreto Convent Msongari]]. She was first mentored by the renowned conservationist [[Richard Leakey]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/campaigns/elephant-campaign/dr-paula-kahumbu-interview-africans-must-be-equal-partners-in-a-war-on-elephant-poachers-9123089.html|title=Dr Paula Kahumbu interview: Africans must be equal partners in a war|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/paula-kahumbu-02-out-africa|title=Paula Kahumbu *02: Out of Africa|date=2016-01-21|work=Princeton Alumni Weekly|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was granted a Government of Kenya Scholarship to study Ecology and Biology at [[University of Bristol]]. She then received her Master's degree in at [[University of Florida]] in Wildlife and Range Science in 1992. Her early studies and fieldwork centered on primates, writing her Masters thesis on the monkeys of the [[Tana River Primate National Reserve]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/11168036/Fighting-the-elephant-ivory-poachers-of-Kenya.html|title=Fighting the elephant ivory poachers of Kenya|last=Boynton|first=Graham|date=2014-10-18|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between undergraduate and graduate school, Kahumbu returned to Kenya to work for the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]]. There, she was charged with counting and measuring the ivory stockpile in the country's vaults in preparation for [[Richard Leakey|Richard Leakey's]] now-famous internationally televised burning of the tusks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/07/opinions/paula-kahumbu-china-ivory-elephants-extinction/index.html|title=Paula Kahumbu: China's ivory craze threatens elephants - CNN|last=CNN|first=Paula Kahumbu, Special for|work=CNN|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event changed her focus from primates to elephants of her doctoral work. She was granted a Petri scholarship to attend [[Princeton University]] to complete her PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from 1994 – 2002, where she studied elephants in the [[Shimba Hills National Reserve|Shimba Hills]] on the Kenyan coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3515213|title=The effects of elephants on their habitats in the Shimba Hills, Kenya / Paula G.

== Conservation Career ==
After receiving her PhD, Kahumbu returned to the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] and led the Kenyan delegation to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2007, Kahumbu became the executive director of [[WildlifeDirect]], a nonprofit organization co-founded in 2004 by her mentor [[Richard Leakey]] as an online platform to provide voice to African conservationists.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/using_the_power_of_blogs_to_protect_africas_wildlife|title=Using the Power of the Web To Protect Africa’s Wildlife - Yale E360|website=e360.yale.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has since become the largest wildlife blogging site in Africa and has covered a diverse array of conservation issues—from protecting chimpanzees in Sierra Leone to wild dogs in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Those who are inspired by the blog posts can then donate directly to the conservationists on the ground, circumventing administrative fees.

The "Hands Off Our Elephants" campaign launched by Kahumbu at WildlifeDirect to put an end to the poaching of elephants and trafficking of ivory, and has since gained the support of Kenyan First Lady [[Margaret Kenyatta]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamhurimagazine.com/index.php/tours-hotels/4269-kenya-first-lady-launches-hands-off-our-elephants-campaign.html|title=Jamhuri Magazine - Kenya First Lady launches "Hands off our Elephants" campaign|website=jamhurimagazine.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aims to leverage media to drive behavior change and to foster agency within the local community to take action. In tandem, the campaign has worked to propose concrete legislation to enforce against the illegal ivory trade.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilydrewry/2017/08/12/seat-of-power-episode-2-dr-paula-kahumbus-fight-to-save-the-elephants/|title=Seat Of Power Episode 2: Dr. Paula Kahumbu's Fight To Save The Elephants|last=Drewry|first=Emily|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the campaign began in 2014, more than 100,000 elephants across the African continent had been killed for their ivory over three years.

Kahumbu also teaches conservation to students as a lecturer at [[Princeton University]], where she leads an undergraduate course in community conservation during an annual field course in Kenya.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Public Engagement ==
Kahumbu has reached the public through a variety of mediums to advocate for conversation—from television to editorials to museums. She is the producer of NTV Wild, an award-winning wildlife documentary series, and NTV Wild Talk, a television shows hosted by [[Smriti Vidyarthi]] that covers conservation issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2016/feb/03/finally-kenyans-can-watch-their-own-countrys-wildlife-on-tv|title=Finally, Kenyans can watch their own country's wildlife on TV|last=Kahumbu|first=Paula|last2=Halliday|first2=Andrew|date=2016-02-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Nation-Group-wins-digital-media-awards/1840340-3401190-co4cl3/index.html|title=Nation Group wins digital media awards|date=2016-10-01|work=The Citizen|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also contributed regularly to [[The Guardian]], advocating for protection for elephants through a solutions-based approach—from ending corruption to inspiring a young generation of conservationist—and denouncing the ivory trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paula-kahumbu|title=Paula Kahumbu|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahumbu is also a Chairperson for [[National Museums of Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.museums.or.ke/board-members/|title=Board Members - National Museums of Kenya|work=National Museums of Kenya|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahumbu is also an accomplished children's book writer, co-authoring global best sellers like ''Owen and Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship'', based on the unlikely friendship of [[hippopotamus]] and an [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] [[Owen and Mzee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/142092.Owen_and_Mzee|title=Owen and Mzee|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Barry transitioned from training dolphins to instead advocating against industries that keep dolphins in captivity, after one of the ''Flipper'' dolphins died in his arms.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/whales/interviews/obarry2.html |title=Interviews - Richard O'barry &amp;#124; A Whale Of A Business &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, O'Barry founded the Dolphin Project, a group that aims to educate the public about captivity and, where feasible, free captive dolphins. He was featured in the Academy Award-winning film ''[[The Cove (film)|The Cove]]'' (2009), which used covert techniques to expose the yearly [[dolphin drive hunting]] that goes on in [[Taiji, Wakayama|Taiji]], Japan.

==''Flipper''==
Richard O'Barry started out capturing and training dolphins for the [[Miami Seaquarium]] and through the 1960s became the head trainer for the five dolphins who collectively played Flipper on the popular American TV show, while also serving as [[stunt double]] for show cast member [[Luke Halpin]].&lt;ref name="smile1988" /&gt; When, in early 1970, a few years after production of Flipper had ended, Kathy, the dolphin who most often played Flipper, did not resurface for air, O'Barry considered the possibility that she had committed suicide, and concluded that capturing, displaying and training dolphins to perform tricks is wrong.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

==Activism==

On [[Earth Day]] in 1970 he founded Dolphin Project, an organization dedicated to educating the public about the plight of dolphins in captivity. He also pioneered work to demonstrate rehabilitation and release as a viable alternative for captive dolphins. O’Barry has since rescued and released over twenty-five captive dolphins in Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Brazil, The Bahamas and the United States.

O’Barry was fined Civil penalties for taking by harassment and illegally transporting two dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico; a 1999 Commerce Department press release argued that they "were not prepared to survive in the wild and sustained life-threatening injuries".&lt;ref name="noaa99r134"&gt;[http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases99/june99/noaa99r134.html Activists Fined $59,500 In Sugarloaf Dolphin Release] 10 June 1999 Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the last 40 plus years O’Barry has spoken about the harmful effects of captivity on dolphins at lectures and conferences around the world. In 1991 in recognition of his contribution to the protection of dolphins, O’Barry received an Environmental Achievement Award, presented by the US Committee for the United Nations Environmental Program. In 2007, Ric and Helene O’Barry became consultants for the [[Earth Island Institute]]'s International Marine Mammal Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthisland.org/assets/2007AnnualReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

O'Barry resigned from his position at the Earth Island Institute in September 2014, due to disagreements with its management regarding the acceptance of funds from the tuna industry, and its use of [[Fish Aggregation Device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animals24-7.org/2014/12/23/fundraising-fads-dolphin-safe-why-ric-obarry-left-earth-island-institute|title=Fundraising,  FADS,  “dolphin safe,” &amp; why Ric O’Barry left Earth Island Institute|date=2014-12-23|work=Animals 24-7|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dolphinproject.net/blog/post/an-important-note-from-ric-obarry-2/|title=An Urgent Message From Ric O'Barry {{!}} Ric O'Barry's Dolphin Project|website=dolphinproject.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with Ric O'Barry's Dolphin Project, he leads an international effort to stop the killing of dolphins, end the trafficking in live dolphins to theme parks and captive swim-with-the-dolphins attractions and continues to lecture and speak out against the captivity industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthisland.org/immp/ |title=International Marine Mammal Project - Earth Island Institute |publisher=Earthisland.org |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
     
O’Barry is co-author of three books, ''Behind the Dolphin Smile'', ''To Free a Dolphin'' (both with Keith Colbourne) and most recently ''Die Bucht'' about dolphins and the making of ''The Cove'' published in Germany with Hans Peter Roth.  Richard O’Barry is a Fellow National in the [[Explorers Club]].

O’Barry lives in [[Coconut Grove, Florida]], US.&lt;ref name="smile1988" /&gt;  O’Barry is Founder and is Director of the non-profit organization, Ric O'Barry's Dolphin Project Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{quote|He wore tie-dyed shirts with tracksuit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways. To say that he was "on" would be a major understatement.&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;}}

Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who Reeve said was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers. According to Reeve, Skinner was bewildered by Williams, who could instantly perform in many accents, including Scottish, Irish, English, Russian, and Italian. Their primary acting teacher was [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], who was "equally baffled by this human dynamo".&lt;ref name="reeve" /&gt; Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his convincing role of an old man in ''The Night of the Iguana,'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]. "He simply ''was'' the old man," wrote Reeve. "I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together."&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;

Williams and Reeve remained close friends until Reeve's death in 2004. Reeve had struggled for years with being [[quadriplegic]] after a horse-riding accident.&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Their friendship was like "brothers from another mother" according to his son Zak Williams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/11/23/robin-williams-son-remembers-his-dad-and-christopher-reeve-friendship/ "Robin Williams' son remembers his dad and Christopher Reeve's friendship"], ''Fox News'', November 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Williams paid many of Reeve's medical bills and gave financial support to his family.&lt;ref name="reeve"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11027923/Robin-Williams-obituary.html |title=Robin Williams – obituary |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=August 12, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2014|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6TTTp9htz?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11027923/Robin-Williams-obituary.html|archivedate = October 20, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summers of 1974, 1975 and 1976, Williams worked as a [[busser]] at [[The Trident (restaurant)|The Trident]] in [[Sausalito, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetridentrestaurant.com/?p=281|title=We’ll Always Love You Robin!|date=August 13, 2015|website=Thetridentrestaurant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Juilliard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3104146/robin-williams-dead-marc-maron-podcast/ |title=Listen to Robin Williams Talk About His Struggles on a April 26, 2010 Podcast |date=August 12, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=August 22, 2014|last = Feeney|first = Nolan|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140922040220/http://time.com/3104146/robin-williams-dead-marc-maron-podcast|archivedate = September 22, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/remembering_robin_williams |title=WTF with Marc Maron – Remembering Robin Williams |date=August 11, 2014 |work=[[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF]] with [[Marc Maron]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812183127/http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/remembering_robin_williams|archivedate = August 12, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his junior year in 1976 at the suggestion of Houseman, who said there was nothing more Juilliard could teach him.&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/18/nyregion/commencements-for-juilliard-ex-student-hams-it-up.html |title=For Juilliard, Ex-Student Hams It Up |date=May 18, 1991 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=August 12, 2014|agency = The Associated Press|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121105042651/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/18/nyregion/commencements-for-juilliard-ex-student-hams-it-up.html|archivedate = November 5, 2012|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Freedman]], another of his teachers at Juilliard, said that Williams was a "genius" and that the school's conservative and classical style of training did not suit him; no one was surprised that he left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://charlotte.twcnews.com/content/news/710725/nc-comedian--robin-williams-was-my-hero--my-influence/ |title=NC Comedian: Robin Williams Was My Hero, My Influence |work=Time Warner Cable News |date=August 12, 2014|last = Blair|first = Caroline|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084944/http://charlotte.twcnews.com/content/news/710725/nc-comedian--robin-williams-was-my-hero--my-influence/|archivedate = August 19, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
[[File:Robin Williams in Camp Phoenix.jpg|thumb|Williams performing stand-up comedy at a [[United Service Organization|USO]] show on December 20, 2007]]
After his family moved to [[Marin County]], Williams began performing [[stand-up comedy]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the mid-1970s. He gave his first performance at the [[Holy City Zoo]], a comedy club in [[San Francisco]], where he worked his way up from tending bar.&lt;ref name=Zehme/&gt; In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a [[rock music]] renaissance, [[hippie]]s, [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], and a sexual revolution, and in the 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance", writes critic Gerald Nachman.&lt;ref name=Nachman&gt;Nachman, Gerald. ''Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s'', Pantheon, N.Y. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}  Williams says he found out about "drugs and happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of my time turned to mud".&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;

Williams moved to [[Los Angeles]] and continued performing stand-up at clubs including the Comedy Club. There, in 1977, he was seen by TV producer [[George Schlatter]], who asked him to appear on a revival of his [[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In|''Laugh-In'']] show. The show aired in late 1977 and was his debut TV appearance.&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt; That year, Williams also performed a show at the LA [[The Improv|Improv]] for [[Home Box Office]].&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH7crqRvhhc&amp;list=WL&amp;index=2 "Young Robin Williams at the Los Angeles Improv, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Laugh-In'' revival failed, it led Williams into a television career; he continued performing stand-up at comedy clubs such as the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] to help keep his improvisational skills sharp.&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;video: {{YouTube|id=LsIh5z7oYyY&amp;t=2m25s|title=Robin Williams at the Roxy, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Televised live performances===
Williams won a [[Grammy Award]] for the recording of his 1979 live show at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in [[New York City|New York]], "Reality...What a Concept". Some of his later tours, after he became a TV and film star, include ''An Evening With Robin Williams'' (1982–83), ''Robin Williams: At The Met'' (1986) and ''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway'' (2002). The latter broke many long-held records for a comedy show. In some cases, tickets sold out within thirty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Carter|title=Shazbot Robin Williams: Because we did, in fact, love him|url=http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-ureviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/|website=commdiginews.com|accessdate=August 12, 2014|publisher = Communities Digital News|date = August 11, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812224009/http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-reviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/|archivedate = August 12, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Williams released ''[[A Night at the Met]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benedictus|first1=Leo|title=Comedy gold: Robin Williams' A Night at the Met|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/06/robin-williams-night-met-comedy-gold|accessdate=December 3, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a six-year hiatus, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour, "Weapons of Self-Destruction". He said that this was his last chance to make jokes at the expense of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], but by the time the show was staged, only a few minutes covered that subject. The tour started at the end of September 2009 and concluded in [[New York (state)|New York]] on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO special on December 8, 2009.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Hardships in performing stand-up====
Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using [[drug]]s and [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] early in his career. He further said that he never drank nor took drugs while on stage but occasionally performed when [[Hangover|hung over]] from the previous day. During the period he was using [[cocaine]], he said that it made him [[Paranoia|paranoid]] when performing on stage.&lt;ref name="Grobel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Playboy Interview:Robin Williams|last=Grobel|first=Lawrence|date=January 1992|work=[[Playboy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians:
{{quote|It's a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyle—partying, drinking, drugs. If you're on the road, it's even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly they're hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need.&lt;ref name=Nachman/&gt;{{rp|34–35}}}}

Some, such as the critic [[Vincent Canby]], were concerned that his monologues were so intense that it seemed as though at any minute his "creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown."&lt;ref name="When the Laughter Stops"&gt;{{cite book | title=Robin Williams: When the Laughter Stops 1951–2014 | first=Emily | last=Herbert | publisher=John Blake Publishing Ltd. | location=London | date=November 15, 2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DpUCgAAQBAJ | isbn=9781784183004 | oclc=889523094 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer Emily Herbert described his "intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis ... [going] beyond energetic, beyond frenetic ... [and sometimes] dangerous ... because of what it said about the creator's own mental state."&lt;ref name="When the Laughter Stops"/&gt;

Williams felt secure he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt; He also explained that he often used [[Free association (psychology)#Characteristics|free association]] of ideas while improvising in order to keep the audience interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media | via=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI&amp;t=14m20s | |date=2002 | title=Robin Williams interview with Sir Michael Parkinson, 2002 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competitive atmosphere caused problems; for example, some comedians accused him of copying their jokes, which Williams strongly denied.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/robin-williams-accused-stealing-jokes-comedy-tell-all-book-1045397|title=Robin Williams Accused of Stealing Jokes in Comedy Tell-All Book|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kempa.com/robin-williams-prince-of-thieves/|title=Robin Williams: Prince of Thieves|website=Kempa.com|language=en-US|access-date=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brenner]] claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.&lt;ref name="Comedy at the Edge"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy at the Edge|author=Richard Zoglin|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|year=2008|isbn=978-1582346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/07/joke-stealing-comedy-conan-twitter/399800/|title=In Conan O'Brien Versus Twitter Comedians, Whose Joke Is It Anyway?|last=Sims|first=David|date=July 28, 2015|work=The Atlantic|access-date=July 20, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Whoopi Goldberg]] defended him, explaining that it is difficult for comedians not to reuse another comedian's material, and that it is done "all the time".&lt;ref name="rs comedy"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/robin-williams-fears-of-a-clown-20140811 | title = Robin Williams: Fears of a Clown | first = Jeff | last = Giles | date = February 21, 1991 | accessdate = August 17, 2014 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.&lt;ref name="rs comedy"/&gt;

During a ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, "There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If I stop trying, I get afraid." While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist [[Jerzy Kosiński]] to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt;

===''Mork &amp; Mindy''===

After the ''[[Laugh-In]]'' revival and appearing in the cast of ''[[The Richard Pryor Show]]'' on [[NBC]], Williams was cast by [[Garry Marshall]] as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the TV series ''[[Happy Days]]'', "[[My Favorite Orkan]]".&lt;ref name=Maslon/&gt;&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Robin Williams | series = Inside the Actors Studio | season = 7 | number = 710 | airdate = June 10, 2001 | network = Bravo | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | credits = James Lipton (host) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204093734/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Robin_Williams | archivedate = February 4, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sought after as a last minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |publisher=Biography Channel |accessdate=September 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212135/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robin-williams.html |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice. The cast and crew, as well as TV network executives were deeply impressed at his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Happy Days' Cast Reveals How Robin Williams Got Cast as a "Martian" in Show's "Worst Script" |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/happy-days-cast-reveals-how-750779 |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mork's appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'', which co-starred [[Pam Dawber]], and ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialog and behavior. Although he portrayed the same character as in ''Happy Days'', the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in [[Milwaukee]]. ''Mork &amp; Mindy'' at its peak had a weekly audience of 60 million and was credited with turning Williams into a "superstar."&lt;ref name="Maslon" /&gt; According to critic [[James Poniewozik]], the series was especially popular among young people as Williams became a "man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of invention."&lt;ref name="Corliss"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://time.com/3110842/robin-williams-the-heart-of-comedy/ |title=Robin Williams: The Heart of Comedy |magazine=Time |date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three [[HBO]] comedy specials, ''Off The Wall'' (1978), ''An Evening with Robin Williams'' (1983) and ''Robin Williams: Live at the Met'' (1986). Also in 1986, Williams co-hosted the [[58th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=John J |title=The Academy Awards Ceremony |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/movies/the-academy-awards-ceremony.html |accessdate=August 12, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times|date = March 26, 1986|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812213954/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/movies/the-academy-awards-ceremony.html|archivedate = August 12, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was also a regular guest on various talk shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''&lt;ref&gt;video clip; {{YouTube|iqdSagycCWc|"Robin Williams on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show – 1991"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', on which he appeared 50 times. Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at [[The Comedy Store]] in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. "He came in like a hurricane," said Letterman, who said he then thought to himself, "Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/08/19/david_letterman_s_robin_williams_tribute_the_late_show_host_remembers_when.html|title = Letterman Remembers the First Time He Met Robin Williams|date = August 19, 2014|accessdate = October 23, 2014|website = Slate|last = Lockett|first = Dee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His stand-up work was a consistent thread through his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) ''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway'' (2002). He was voted 13th on [[Comedy Central]]'s list "100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time" in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0429332/ | title = Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time | publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Robin Williams filmography}}

The first film role credited to Robin Williams is a small part in the 1977 low-budget comedy ''[[Can I Do It... 'Til I Need Glasses?]]''. His first major performance is as the title character in ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980). There, Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work; and the film's commercial disappointment was not blamed upon his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.philly.com/2014-08-13/news/52732960_1_golden-globe-aladdin-role |  title = Robin Williams, 63, comic genius | first = Steven | last = Rea | date = August 13, 2014 | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | work = The Philadelphia Inquirer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VF-20140812"&gt;{{cite web |last=Spitznagel |first=Eric |title=Popeye Is the Best Movie Robin Williams Ever Made |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/08/robin-williams-popeye |date=August 12, 2014 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=August 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stars as the leading character in ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]]'' (1982), which Williams considered "may have lacked a certain madness onscreen, but it had a great core".&lt;ref name=Zehme/&gt; He continued with other smaller roles in less successful films, such as ''[[The Survivors (1983 film)|The Survivors]]'' (1983) and ''[[Club Paradise]]'' (1986), though he said these roles did not help advance his film career.&lt;ref name=Zehme/&gt;

His first major break came from his starring role in director [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; The film is set in 1965 during the [[Vietnam War]], with Williams playing the role of [[Adrian Cronauer]], a radio [[shock jock]] who keeps the troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines. Over the microphone, he created voice impressions of people, including [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Gomer Pyle]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Mr. Ed]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name=Zehme&gt;{{cite news | last = Zehme | first =  Bill | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | pages = 29–32 | date = February 25, 1988 | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/robin-williams-the-rolling-stone-interview-19880225 | title = Robin Williams: The Rolling Stone Interview }}&lt;/ref&gt; "We just let the cameras roll," said producer Mark Johnson, and Williams "managed to create something new for every single take."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Inventing Vietnam: The War in Film and Television|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 1991|isbn = 9780877228622|pages = 238|series = Culture And The Moving Image: Vol 6|editor-last = Anderegg|editor-first = Michael|location = Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other roles Williams had in acclaimed dramatic films include ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]'' (1984), ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990), ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=allmovie_bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Sandra|title=Robin Williams|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/robin-williams-p116900|website=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', Williams portrayed a writer / killer on the run from a sleep-deprived Los Angeles policeman (played by [[Al Pacino]]) in rural Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Karl|title=Insomnia (2002)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/insomnia-v260290|website=Allmovie|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2002, in the psychological thriller ''[[One Hour Photo]]'', Williams played an emotionally disturbed photo development technician who becomes obsessed with a family for whom he has developed pictures for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deming|first1=Mark|title=One Hour Photo (2002)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/one-hour-photo-v260306|website=Allmovie|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Williams movie released during his lifetime was ''[[The Angriest Man in Brooklyn]]'', a film addressing the value of life.

Among the actors who helped him during his acting career, he credited [[Robert De Niro]], from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialog when acting, to portray the deep-driven man. From [[Dustin Hoffman]], with whom he co-starred in ''Hook'', he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. [[Mike Medavoy]], producer of ''Hook'', told its director, [[Steven Spielberg]], that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together, and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = You're Only as Good as Your Next One: 100 Great Films, 100 Good Films, and 100 for Which I Should Be Shot|last = Medavoy|first = Mike|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster (Altria)|year = 2002|isbn = 9780743400541|location = New York|pages = 228|others = Young, Josh (contributor)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams benefited from working with [[Woody Allen]], who directed him and Billy Crystal in ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997), as Allen had knowledge of the fact that Crystal and Williams had often performed together on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Conversations with Woody Allen: His Films, the Movies, and Moviemaking|last = Lax|first = Eric|publisher = Alfred A.

His performance in the role of a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]] in ''Good Will Hunting'' (1997) influenced some real therapists and won Williams an Academy Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-thomas-neace-/requiem-for-a-therapist-a_b_5670467.html?page_version=legacy&amp;view=print&amp;comm_ref=false |title=Requiem for a Therapist: A Tribute to Robin Williams |date=August 12, 2014 |work=[[HuffPost]] |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TYMul6HC?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-thomas-neace-/requiem-for-a-therapist-a_b_5670467.html?page_version=legacy&amp;view=print&amp;comm_ref=false |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Awakenings'' (1990), Williams played a doctor modeled on [[Oliver Sacks]], who wrote the book on which the film was based. Sacks later said the way the actor's mind worked was a "form of genius." In 1989 Williams played a private school teacher in ''Dead Poets Society'', which included a final, emotional scene which some critics said "inspired a generation" and became a part of pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/robin-williams-o-captain_n_5670177.html|title = Robin Williams and the 'O Captain' Scene That Inspired a Generation|last = Goodman|first = Jessica|date = August 11, 2014|work = HuffPost|accessdate = October 23, 2014|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6TYNZzpb6?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/robin-williams-o-captain_n_5670177.html|archivedate = October 24, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking over most of his filmography, one writer was "struck by the breadth" and radical diversity of most roles Williams portrayed.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/08/11/how-robin-williams-helped-us-grow-up/ |title=How Robin Williams helped us grow up |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Alyssa |last=Rosenberg |date=August 11, 2014|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6TYOdTnDH?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/08/11/how-robin-williams-helped-us-grow-up/|archivedate = October 24, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Gilliam]], who co-founded ''[[Monty Python]]'' and directed Williams in two of his films, ''The Fisher King'' and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988), said in 1992 that Williams had the ability to "go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable ... [Williams had] the most unique mind on the planet. There's nobody like him out there."&lt;ref name="Grobel"/&gt;

[[File:Robin Williams 2011c.jpg|thumb|Williams at the [[Australia]]n premiere of ''[[Happy Feet Two]]'' on December 4, 2011]]
Williams voiced characters in several animated films. His voice role as the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] in the animated musical ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) was written for him. The film's directors stated that they took a risk by writing the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akOo9XqAyxE&amp;t=2m24s|via=[[YouTube]]|title=Turning Robin Williams into 'Aladdin's' Genie|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Williams refused the role since it was a Disney movie, and he did not want the studio profiting by selling merchandise based on the movie. He accepted the role with certain conditions: "I'm doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything—as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/15/robin-williams-almost-didnt-make-aladdin-and-a-generation-of-children-are-grateful-that-he-did/|title=Robin Williams almost didn't make 'Aladdin,' and a generation of children is grateful that he did|last=McDonald|first=Soraya Nadia|date=August 15, 2014|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams improvised much of his dialogue, recording approximately 30 hours of tape,&lt;ref name="Kornbluth" /&gt; and impersonated dozens of celebrities, including [[Ed Sullivan]], [[Jack Nicholson]], Robert De Niro, [[Groucho Marx]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[William F.

He also voiced the holographic Dr. Know character in the live-action film ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' (2001).

Williams and his second wife Marsha founded a philanthropic organization called the Windfall Foundation to raise money for many charities.

In 2003, Williams started drinking alcohol again while working on a film in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=Greatest_dad /&gt; In 2006, he checked himself in to a substance-abuse rehabilitation center in [[Newberg, Oregon]], saying he was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2515796 |title=Robin Williams Comes Clean on 'GMA' |publisher=ABC News |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn_duke"&gt;{{cite news |last=Duke |first=Alan |title=Robin Williams, short of breath, takes a break |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/robin.williams.health/index.html?iref=nextin |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014|date = March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay published in the journal ''Neurology'' two years after his death, Susan Schneider revealed that the pathology of Lewy body disease in Williams was described by several doctors as among the worst pathologies they had seen. She described the early symptoms of his disease as beginning in October 2013. It included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear and anxiety, constipation, urinary difficulty, heartburn, sleeplessness and insomnia, a poor sense of smell, stress, and a slight tremor in his left hand. Eventually, she said, he suffered from paranoia, delusions, severe insomnia, memory loss, and high cortisol levels, indicating stress. According to Schneider, "Robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it ... He kept saying, 'I just want to reboot my brain.'"&lt;ref name="Neurology"/&gt;

British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] dedicated a song titled "Tears of a Clown" to Williams on their 2015 album ''[[The Book of Souls]]''. The song looks into his depression and suicide, as well as how he attempted to hide his condition from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan Britton|first1=Luke|title=Iron Maiden dedicate new song 'Tears Of A Clown' to Robin Williams|url=http://www.nme.com/news/iron-maiden/87791|website=[[NME]]|accessdate=August 24, 2015|date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 film ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'' features a tribute to Williams by mentioning his character Alan Parrish and using the piece that Williams used in the first ''Jumanji'' film. On the film's Blu-ray release, there is also a bonus feature in which the cast and crew pay homage to both Williams and the 1995 installment.

In 2018, [[HBO]] produced a documentary about his life and career.

== Influences ==
Williams credited comedians including [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Nichols and May]], and [[Lenny Bruce]] as influences, admiring their ability to attract a more intellectual audience with a higher level of wit.&lt;ref name="Nachman" /&gt;{{rp|43}} He also liked [[Jay Leno]] for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines and [[Sid Caesar]], whose acts he felt were "precious".&lt;ref name="Grobel" /&gt;

Jonathan Winters was his "idol" early in life; Williams, aged eight, first saw him on television and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career.&lt;ref name="Nachman" /&gt;{{rp|259}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/jonathan-winters-dead_n_3070474.html|title=Jonathan Winters Dead: 'Mork and Mindy' Star Dies At Age 87|date=April 12, 2013|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was inspired by Winters' ingenuity, realizing, he said, "that anything is possible, that anything is funny{{nowrap|. . .}} He gave me the idea that it can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily."&lt;ref name="Nachman" /&gt;{{rp|260}}

During an interview in [[London]] in 2002, Williams told &lt;!-- Not knighted until 2008. --&gt;[[Michael Parkinson]] that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', stating, "It doesn't get better than that." British comedy actors [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Peter Cook]] were also among his influences, he told Parkinson.&lt;ref&gt;video: {{cite interview|last=Williams|first=Robin|interviewer=[[Michael Parkinson]]|title=Robin Williams, Parkinson interview 2002|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robin Williams Aviano.jpg|thumb|Williams performing at a [[United Service Organizations]] holiday show held for the [[Aviano Air Base]] community on December 22, 2007]]
Williams was also influenced by [[Richard Pryor]]'s fearless ability to talk about his personal life on stage, with subjects including his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, he told Parkinson, it was "cheaper than therapy" and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.&lt;ref name="Nachman" /&gt;{{rp|121}}

==Legacy==
{{quote box | align=left | width=25% | quote=You can't look at any modern comic and say, "That's the descendant of Robin Williams", because it's not possible to be a Robin Williams rip-off. ... He raised the bar for what it's possible to do, and made an enormous amount of us want to be comedians. | source=[[Judd Apatow]]&lt;ref name="Browne"/&gt;}}

Although Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. He was considered a "national treasure" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.&lt;ref name=Grobel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure "Glenn Close on Friend and Colleague: 'Robin Williams Was a World Treasure'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525045202/http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure |date=May 25, 2017 }}, ''Showbiz411'', August 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

His on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression.&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0812/Robin-Williams-His-unscripted-riffs-were-not-merely-funny-but-observant-video "Robin Williams: His unscripted riffs were not merely funny, but observant"],(+video), ''Christian Science Monitor'', August 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, "probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person."&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

[[File:Robin Williams Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
[[File:Impronte di Robin Williams al TCL Chinese Theatre - Los Angeles - USA - agosto 2011.jpg|thumb|Williams's hands and footprints at Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]
Williams created a signature free-form persona in comedy, in a style that was so widely and uniquely identified with him, that new comedians imitated Williams personally. [[Jim Carrey]] impersonated his Mork character early in his own career.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|9zorOqE0j1c|"Jim Carrey Impersonates Robin Williams"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high-spirited persona has been generally credited with paving the way for the growing comedy scene which developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing his spontaneously diverse range: "one moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space."&lt;ref&gt;Rappoport, Leon. ''Punchlines: The Case for Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Humor'', Greenwood Publishing (2005)  p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Judd Apatow]], the eclectic performer's rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, but that his talent was so extremely unusual that no one else could possibly attempt to copy it.&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Browne |first=David |title=Robin Williams, 1951–2014 | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=September 11, 2014 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/robin-williams-final-days-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20140827 | pages=38–47 | accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry. Director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], who directed Williams in ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', says that watching him work "was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/aug/13/chris-columbus-speaks-about-life-with-ro/?print|title = Valley native Chris Columbus speaks about life with Robin Williams|date = August 13, 2014|accessdate = October 24, 2014|website = vindy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking over most of his filmography, Alyssa Rosenberg at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was "struck by the breadth" and radical diversity of most of his roles, writing that "Williams helped us grow up."&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt;

Janet Hirshenson later revealed in an interview that Robin Williams had expressed interest in portraying [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' films, but was rejected by Chris Columbus due to the "British-only edict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/robin-williams-was-turned-down-for-a-key-harry-potter-role/news-story/1590a9c7c2dd974a1fa9758053acc97f|title='He really wanted to be in the movie'|website=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Kynard "Roky" Erickson''' (born July 15, 1947) is an American singer-songwriter, harmonica player, and guitarist from [[Texas]]. He was a founding member of [[The 13th Floor Elevators]] and a pioneer of the [[psychedelic rock]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dorian Lynskey |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,2097535,00.html |title="The man who went too high". The Guardian. June 8, 2007 |publisher=Music.guardian.co.uk |date= June 8, 2007|accessdate=2011-11-02 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Erickson was interested in music from his youth, playing piano from age 5 and taking up guitar at 10. He attended school in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and dropped out of [[William B. Travis High School (Austin, Texas)|Travis High School]] in 1965, one month before graduating, rather than cut his hair to conform to the school dress code.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"The fall and rise of Roky Erickson. ''Austin American-Statesman'', July 12, 2007. p 13 (Xlent section).&lt;/ref&gt; His first notable group was The Spades, who scored a regional hit with Erickson's "[[We Sell Soul]]"; the song is included as an unlisted bonus track on Erickson's 1995 ''[[All That May Do My Rhyme]]'' CD and was adapted as "Don't Fall Down" by the 13th Floor Elevators for their first album. The Spades' original version of "[[You're Gonna Miss Me (song)|You're Gonna Miss Me]]", later a hit for 13th Floor Elevators, was featured on the compilation album ''The Best of [[Pebbles series|Pebbles]] Volume 1''.

===The 13th Floor Elevators years===
{{main article|The 13th Floor Elevators}}
Erickson co-founded the 13th Floor Elevators in late 1965.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} He and bandmate [[Tommy Hall (American musician)|Tommy Hall]] were the main songwriters. Early in her career, singer [[Janis Joplin]] considered joining the Elevators, but Family Dog's [[Chet Helms]] persuaded her to go to San Francisco instead, where she found major fame.

In 1966 (Erickson was 19 years old) the band released their debut album ''[[The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators]]''. The album had the band's only charting single, Erickson's "You're Gonna Miss Me". A stinging breakup song, the single remains probably Erickson's best-known work: it was a major hit on local charts in the U.S. southwest, and appeared at lower positions on national singles charts as well. Critic Mark Deming writes that "If Roky Erickson had vanished from the face of the earth after [[The 13th Floor Elevators]] released their epochal debut single, "You're Gonna Miss Me", in early 1966, in all likelihood he'd still be regarded as a legend among [[garage rock]] fanatics for his primal vocal wailing and feral harmonica work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deming |first=Mark |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r730748 |pure_url=yes}} |title=I Have Always Been Here Before: The Roky Erickson Anthology – Roky Erickson |publisher=AllMusic |date=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the band followed up with ''[[Easter Everywhere]]'', perhaps the band's most focused effort, featuring "[[Slip Inside This House]]", and a noted cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]".

The album ''[[Live (13th Floor Elevators album)|Live]]'' was put out in 1968 by [[International Artists]]. It featured audience applause dubbed over studio recordings of cover versions, alternate takes, and older material, and it had little to no input from the band.

''[[Bull of the Woods]]'', released in 1969, was the 13th Floor Elevators' last released album on which they worked as a group and was largely the work of Stacy Sutherland. Erickson—due to health and legal problems—and Tommy Hall were only involved with a few tracks, including "Livin' On" and "May the Circle Remain Unbroken".

===Mental illness and legal problems===
In 1968, while performing at [[HemisFair '68|HemisFair]], Erickson began speaking [[gibberish]]. He was soon diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and sent to a [[Houston]] [[psychiatric hospital]], where he involuntarily received [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The Elevators were vocal proponents of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[mescaline]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] use, {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and were subject to extra attention from law enforcement agencies. In 1969, Erickson was arrested for possession of a single [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] joint in Austin. Facing a potential ten-year incarceration, Erickson pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid prison. He was first sent to the [[Austin State Hospital]]. After several escapes, he was sent to the Rusk State Hospital in [[Rusk, Texas]], where he was subjected to more [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[Chlorpromazine|Thorazine]] treatments, ultimately remaining in custody until 1972. Six tracks from the 1999 Erickson collection ''Never Say Goodbye'' were recorded during his time there.

===Bleib Alien years===
In 1974, after having been released from the state hospital, Erickson formed a new band which he called "Bleib alien," ''Bleib'' being an anagram of Bible and/or German for "[[wikt:bleiben|stay]]," and "Alien" being a pun on the German word ''[[wikt:allein|allein]]'' ("alone") – the phrase in German therefore being "remain alone." His new band exchanged the psychedelic sounds of [[The 13th Floor Elevators]] for a more [[hard rock]] sound that featured lyrics on old [[horror film]] and [[science fiction theme]]s. "[[Two Headed Dog (Red Temple Prayer)]]" (produced by [[The Sir Douglas Quintet]]'s [[Doug Sahm]] and inspired by [[Vladimir Demikhov]]'s 1950s [[head transplant]] experiments) was released as a single.

The new band was renamed Roky Erickson and the Aliens. In 1979, after playing with the Reversible Cords on May Day at Raul's, Erickson recorded 15 new songs with producer [[Stu Cook]], former bass player of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]. These efforts were released in two "overlapping" LPs – "I Think of Demons" (CBS UK, 1980) and "The Evil One" (415 Records, 1981). Cook played bass on two tracks, "Sputnik" and "Bloody Hammer." Roky performed with [[The Nervebreakers]] as his backup band at The Palladium in [[Dallas]] in July 1979. A recording was issued on the French label [[New Rose]] and was recently re-issued elsewhere.

The Austin-based band the Explosives served as Roky's most frequent back-up band during the early [[Raul's Club]] era, between 1978 and the early 1980s. Billed as Roky Erickson and the Explosives, they were regulars at Raul's, the Continental Club, and other Austin venues. It was this incarnation that contributed two live tracks to the first "Live at Raul's" LP, released in 1980, with other Raul's top bands: [[The Skunks]], Terminal Mind, The Next, Standing Waves, and The Explosives (without Roky Erickson). The Roky Erickson tracks ("Red Temple Prayer" and "Don't Shake Me Lucifer")  were not included on the initial release for contractual reasons, but were included on a later release.&lt;ref&gt;interview with Fred Krc, June 17, 2015; Club Calendars of Raul's, Continental Club and Soap Creek Saloon, 1978--1982&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, Erickson asserted that a [[Martian]] had inhabited his body. He came to feel that, due to his being alien, human beings were attacking him psychically. A concerned friend enlisted a Notary Public to witness an official statement by Erickson that he was an alien; he hoped by declaring so publicly he would be in line with any "international laws" he might have been breaking. Erickson claimed the attacks then indeed stopped.

===Creative decline and renewed interest===
Beginning in the 1980s, Erickson developed a years-long obsession with the mail, often spending hours poring over random junk mail, writing to solicitors and celebrities (dead or living). He was arrested in 1989 on charges of mail theft. Erickson had picked up mail from neighbors who had moved and taped it to the walls of his room. He insisted that he never opened any of the mail, and the charges were ultimately dropped.

Several live albums of his older material have been released since then, and in 1990 [[Sire Records]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]] released a [[tribute album]], ''[[Where The Pyramid Meets The Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson]]'', produced by WB executive [[Bill Bentley (producer)|Bill Bentley]]. It featured versions of Erickson's songs performed by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[R.E.M.]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Poi Dog Pondering]], [[Julian Cope]], [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]], [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]], [[Doug Sahm]], and [[Primal Scream]], among others. According to the liner notes, the title of the album came from a remark Erickson made to a friend who asked him to define psychedelic music, to which Erickson reportedly replied "It's where the pyramid meets the eye, man," an apparent reference to the [[Eye of Providence]] and the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

===Return to music===

[[Image:Roky Erickson at 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.jpg|thumb|Roky Erickson performing at the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]
In 1995, Erickson released ''[[All That May Do My Rhyme]]'' on [[Butthole Surfers]] drummer [[King Coffey]]'s label [[Trance Syndicate]] Records. Produced by [[Texas Tornados]] bassist [[Speedy Sparks]], Austin recording legend [[Stuart Sullivan]], and [[Texas Music Office]] director [[Casey Monahan]], the release coincided with the publication of ''[[Openers II]]'', a complete collection of Erickson's lyrics. Published by [[Henry Rollins]]'s [[2.13.61]] Publications, it was compiled and edited by [[Casey Monahan]] with assistance from Rollins and Erickson's youngest brother [[Sumner Erickson]], a classical [[tuba]] player.

Sumner was granted legal custody of Roky in 2001, and established a legal trust to aid his brother. As a result, Roky received some of the most effective medical and legal aid of his life, the latter useful in helping sort out the complicated tangle of contracts that had reduced [[royalties|royalty payments]] to all but nothing for his recorded works. He also started taking medication to control his schizophrenia.

A documentary film on the life of Roky Erickson titled ''[[You're Gonna Miss Me]]'' was made by director [[Keven McAlester]] and screened at the 2005 [[SXSW]] film festival. In September of the same year, Erickson performed his first full-length concert in 20 years at the annual [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] with The Explosives with special guest and longtime associate [[Billy Gibbons]] of [[ZZ Top]].

In the December 30, 2005 issue of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', an alternative weekly newspaper in Austin, Texas, [[Margaret Moser]] chronicled Erickson's recovery, saying Erickson had weaned himself off his medication, played at 11 gigs in Austin that year, obtained a driver's license, bought a car (a [[Volvo]]), and voted.

In 2007, Erickson played his first ever gigs in New York City at Southpaw in Brooklyn, NY, as well as California's [[Coachella Festival]] and made a debut performance in England to a capacity audience at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London. Roky continued to play in Europe, performing for the first time in Finland at [[Ruisrock]] festival. According to the article in ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' June 8, 2007, the performance was widely considered the highlight of the festival day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Juha Merimaa |url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Ruisrockin+sympaattisin+esitys/1135228575848 |title="Ruisrockin sympaattisin esitys". '&amp;#39;Kulttuuri'&amp;#39;, July 13, 2007 |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2008, Scottish [[post-rock]] band [[Mogwai]] released the ''[[Batcat]]'' EP. Erickson is featured on one of the tracks, "Devil Rides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobson |first=Gareth |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/3390989 |title=News – Mogwai release new album and EP. Shows too |publisher=Drowned in Sound |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson performed alongside [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]-based indie rock band [[Okkervil River (band)|Okkervil River]] at the [[Austin Music Awards]] in 2008 and then again at the 2009 [[South by Southwest]] music festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2008/03/review-okkervil-river-roky-erickson-austin-music-hall/ |title=Review: Okkervil River &amp; Roky Erickson, Austin Music Hall |publisher=SPIN.com |date=March 13, 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erickson returned to the stage in 2008 to perform songs from the 13th Floor Elevators catalog that had not been performed in decades with fellow Austinites [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]] as his backing band. After months of practices and time recording in an Austin studio, they performed a show in Dallas followed by a West Coast tour. The Black Angels played a regular set and then backed Erickson as his rhythm section, playing 13th Floor Elevators songs as well as songs from Erickson's solo albums.

On April 20, 2010, Erickson released ''[[True Love Cast Out All Evil]]'', his first album of new material in 14 years. [[Okkervil River]] serves as Erickson's backing band on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Freedman |work=Dallas Observer |title=Dallas-born Roky Erickson To Release First Album of New Material in 14 Years.

In March 2012 Roky Toured New Zealand and Australia for the first time headlining Golden Plains Sixxx Festival in Meredeth as well as playing soldout side shows in Sydney and Melbourne.

On May 10, 2015, Roky performed with the reunited 13th Floor Elevators at [[LEVITATION]] (formerly Austin Psych Fest, the event was renamed "Levitation" after the song of the same title). The band consisted of original band members Erickson, Tommy Hall, John Ike Walton, and Ronnie Leatherman, joined by Roky's son Jegar Erickson, and guitarist Fred Mitchim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Freedman |work=Dallas Observer |title=Watch a full recording of The 13th Floor Elevators’ first performance in 47 years |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/05/watch-a-full-recording-of-the-13th-floor-elevators-first-performance-in-47-years/

'''Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient''', born '''Wilhelmine Schröder''' (6 December 1804{{spaced ndash}}26 January 1860), was a German operatic [[soprano]]. As a singer, she combined a rare quality of tone with dramatic intensity of expression, which was as remarkable on the concert platform as in opera. Today, she is remembered as the author of the most celebrated erotic novel in the German language.

== Biography ==
Schröder was born in Hamburg, the daughter of the actress [[Sophie Schröder]] and the tenor Friedrich Schröder.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Her first role was at the age of 15 as Aricia in [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s translation of [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s ''[[Phèdre]]'', and in 1821, aged 17, she was received with so much enthusiasm as Pamina in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' that her future career in opera was assured.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1823, she married [[Karl August Devrient|Karl Devrient]], becoming known as Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, but separated from him in 1828. Meanwhile, she had maintained her popularity at Dresden and elsewhere. She made her first Paris appearance in 1830, and sang in London in 1833 and 1837.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[Richard Wagner]], born in 1813, claimed to have seen her as Leonore in ''[[Fidelio]]'' when he was 16, but this is almost certainly fanciful. He did hear (and conduct) her in numerous roles after 1834, however, and continued to laud her stage artistry right up until his essay "On Actors and Singers" (1872) which is dedicated to her memory. She created several roles for Wagner – Adriano in ''[[Rienzi]]'', Senta in ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' and Venus in ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''. Had Wagner's political profile not been compromised by his involvement with the Dresden uprising in May 1849, Schröder-Devrient would have created Elsa in ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' which was advertised in 1849 as a forthcoming production in Dresden.

In 1847 she married David Oskar von Döring, an officer, but divorced him in 1848. She took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states#Saxony|Revolution of 1848]] and the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] and was later imprisoned. In 1850 she married {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich von Bock|de}}, a wealthy [[Livonia]]n land owner, who was 14 years her junior. They settled first in [[Trikāta parish|Trikāta]], Latvia, relocating later to von Bock's ancestral home in [[Viljandi Parish|Loodi]] (Kersel) in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mulgimaa.ee/turism/marsruudid/iv-heimtali--sinialliku--loodi--sultsi--tuhalaane--polli--karksi-nuia|title=IV Heimtali – Sinialliku – Loodi – Sultsi – Tuhalaane – Polli – Karksi-Nuia - Mulgimaa infoportaal|website=www.mulgimaa.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left her husband in the winter of 1858, planning to move to America; but her health began to deteriorate rapidly.

She died in [[Coburg]], Germany, on 26 January 1860.

== Apocryphal memoirs ==
After her death, a two-volume work entitled ''{{Lang|de|Memoiren einer Sängerin}}'' (Memoirs of a Songstress), purporting to be her erotic memoirs, was published in two instalments in 1868 and 1875. The first volume is a plausible account of her sex life, though various discrepancies with known facts have led many to doubt its complete veracity. The erotic adventures contained in the second volume, however seem to descend into complete sexual fantasy.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
While [[piracy]] was predominantly a male occupation, a minority of pirates were women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantherbay.com/bio_womenpirates.php Were there really woman pirates?]&lt;/ref&gt; On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the [[Pirate code|ship's contract]], which all crew members were required to sign.&lt;ref name="Pennell"/&gt; {{rp|303}}

Because of the resistance to allowing women on board, many female pirates did not identify themselves as such. [[Anne Bonny]], for example, dressed and acted as a man while on Captain [[Calico Jack|Calico Jack's]] ship.&lt;ref name="Pennell"/&gt;{{rp|285}} She and [[Mary Read]], another female pirate, are often identified as being unique in this regard.

This article contains a list of female pirates who are recognized by historians, listed in the time period they were active.

| '''Lady Mary Killigrew'''
|
| 1530-1570
| [[English people|English]]
| Mary was the daughter of a former Suffolk pirate. Mary's husband Sir Henry Killigrew, a former pirate himself, was made a Vice-Admiral by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and tasked with suppressing piracy. Whenever her husband went to sea, Mary engaged in piracy using the staff of her castle (Arwenack Castle in Cornwall) as crew and possibly with the Queen's knowledge. In 1570, she captured a German merchant ship off [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and her crew sailed it to Ireland to sell. However, the owner of this ship was a friend of Queen Elizabeth, who then had Lady Mary arrested and brought to trial at the Launceston assizes. Some sources say she was sentenced to death and then pardoned by the Queen, but this is due to confusion with another family member. According to sources, her family either bribed the jurors and she was acquitted, or Queen Elizabeth arranged a short jail sentence. Whatever transpired, she gave up piracy and took up fencing stolen goods until she died several years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/rodney.broome/pirfalmkilligrew.htm The Killigrews of Falmouth]&lt;/ref&gt;
|- valign="top"
| '''[[Elizabeth Trewinnard|Lady Elizabeth Killigrew]]'''

| Elizabeth and her husband Sir John lived in [[Pendennis Castle]] in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth Harbour]]. In early 1581 a Spanish ship, the ''Marie of San Sebastian'' was blown down Channel by a storm and was forced, dismasted, to take refuge in Falmouth harbour. Lady Elizabeth led an attack on the ship and then fenced the proceeds. Lady Elizabeth was later arrested and sentenced to death but pardoned. Her husband Sir John was ordered by the Privy Council to restore the vessel and goods to their owners but went into hiding along with the ship which resulted in several warrants for his arrest being issued for acts of piracy committed over the next eight years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-keverne.com/history/Diggens/d9.html Sea Borne Raiders of Cornwall] St Keverne Local Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female interaction with pirates in the 18th century==
{{tone|date=June 2013}}

===Business interactions===
During the Golden Age of Piracy, many men had to leave home to find employment or set sail for economic reasons.&lt;ref name="Pennell"&gt;Pennell, C. R. 2001. Bandits at sea : A pirates reader. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|283}} This left women with the responsibilities of taking on traditionally male roles and filling the jobs that were left behind. The need for women to fill these roles led them to be granted rights that had historically been exclusive to men.  Women were allowed to trade, own ships, and work as retailers. Often they were innkeepers or ran alehouses. In some seaside towns, laws were even written to allow widows to keep their husbands' responsibilities and property. This was important to local economies, as alehouses and other such establishments were centers of commerce, where pirates would congregate and trade with each other and with the people onshore.

As heads of these establishments, women had a considerable amount of freedom in business. They boarded and fed pirates, bought illegally pirated goods, acted as [[pawnbroker]]s for pirates, and even gave out loans - something many men, let alone women, viewed with great caution in that time period.&lt;ref name="Pennell"/&gt;{{rp|284}} At times, female business owners would even hide their clients when authorities came looking to arrest them for piracy.
[[File:Mary reed02.gif|thumb|225px|right| [[Mary Read]] (1690-1721) Engraving from ''General History of the Pyrates'' 1725]]

===Marriage===
Some women chose to marry pirates. These men were often very wealthy, but their wives tended not to gain wealth as a result of their marriages, as it was difficult for pirates to send home wages and booty earned overseas. These women's houses and establishments were often used as safe havens for pirates, who were considered enemies of all nations.&lt;ref name="Pennell"/&gt; {{rp|289–290}}

===Piracy===
Women sometimes became pirates themselves, though they tended to have to disguise themselves as men in order to do so. Pirates did not allow women onto their ships very often. Many women of the time were unable to perform the physically demanding tasks required of the crew. Additionally, women were often regarded as bad luck among pirates {{Citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=}}. It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women. On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the [[Pirate code|ship's contract]], which all crew members were required to sign.&lt;ref name="Pennell"/&gt; {{rp|303}}

Because of the resistance to allowing women on board, many female pirates did not identify themselves as such. Anne Bonny, for example, dressed and acted as a man while on Captain Calico Jack's ship.&lt;ref name="Pennell"/&gt;{{rp|285}} She and Mary Read, another female pirate, are often identified as being unique in this regard. However, many women dressed as men during the Golden Age of Piracy, in an effort to take advantage of the many rights, privileges, and freedoms that were exclusive to men.
