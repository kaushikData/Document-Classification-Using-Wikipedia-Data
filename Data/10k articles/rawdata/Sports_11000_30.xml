'''Abdinur Mohamud''' (born 13 September 1997) is a [[Somalia]]n [[footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] club [[Clube Ferroviário de Nampula]] and the [[Somalia national football team|Somalian national football team]].

==International career==
Mohamud made his international debut with Somalia in November 2011, however it is unclear whether he made his debut on November 1st against [[Djibouti national football team|Djibouti]], or on November 12th against [[Ethiopia national football team|Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/oldest-youngest.html#mypfn18 |title=Oldest and youngest international footballers |accessdate=25 March 2017 |work=RSSSF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whichever game he first appeared in, Mohamud is still regarded as the youngest male footballer to appear in a FIFA recognised international fixture, beating [[Aung Kyaw Tun]] of [[Myanmar]]'s 10 year record by between 13 and 25 days.

[[Image:ClemHill.jpg|thumb|200px|Clem Hill was a key member of the boycott.]]

The '''Big Six cricket dispute of 1912''' was a confrontation between the administrators and players of the sport of [[cricket (sport)|cricket]] in Australia. Six of Australia's leading [[cricketers]] refused an invitation to tour England for the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]]. The six players were [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[Vernon Ransford]], [[Victor Trumper]], [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Hanson Carter]], and [[Clem Hill]]. The dispute was the culmination of a series of arguments that followed the establishment of the Australian [[Cricket Australia|Board of Control for International Cricket]] in 1905. The ramifications of the dispute were far-reaching and affected the destiny of Australian cricket over the ensuing decades.

==Causes==
The immediate cause of the dispute was the insistence by the players that they had a right to select the managers of Australian cricket teams touring overseas. However the dispute was a wider one; a power struggle over who would have access to the revenue these tours raised.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  The players had the support of the [[South Australian Cricket Association]] and several unhappy members of [[Melbourne Cricket Club]]. The Board was dubbed tyrannical at rowdy public meetings, pamphleteers abounded, and funds were raised to send an independent team, inclusive of the Big Six, to England.

The boycott was initially successful in securing the support of public opinion and the performance and antics of the replacement team caused some embarrassment for the Board. Despite this, in the end the Board, supported by Queensland, was able to gain complete control of revenues and appointments for future tours, and the 1912 team went to England without the dissenters. The players were relegated to a subservient role that would not change until the next player rebellion in the 1970s that saw the establishment of [[World Series Cricket]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The 1911–12 [[The Ashes|Ashes tour]] against [[England cricket team|England]] took place in an environment of hostility between the players and the new Board. Contrary to previous arrangements when the Board was established in 1905, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted rights of the players to appoint the team manager when touring England. In response, the group of senior players, "the Big Six" threatened to withdraw from the next tour, to take place in 1912, unless their choice, [[Frank Laver]] was appointed.&lt;ref name="Telegram"&gt;Haigh, pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Matters came to a head when [[Clem Hill]], the Australian captain and member of the Big Six sent a telegram to fellow selector, [[Peter McAlister]], urging the inclusion of the New South Wales [[all-rounder]] [[Charlie Macartney]] in the team for the Fourth Test in Melbourne.&lt;ref name="Telegram"/&gt; The reply from McAlister – a member of the Board of Control to Hill's request was "...Still opposed to Macartney's inclusion. If [[Frank Iredale|Iredale]] (another selector) agrees with you as to Macartney's inclusion, I favour yourself standing down not [[Roy Minnett|Minnett]]."&lt;ref name="Telegram"/&gt; At a meeting held after the Test, the Board of Control rejected the players' petition and declared that the manager would be appointed by the Board alone. At a "special meeting" two weeks later, the Board appointed George Crouch from Queensland to the position.&lt;ref name="Telegram"/&gt;

The following day, 3 February 1912, the selection committee met in Sydney to decide the team for the Fourth Test. It was the first time Hill and McAlister had met since the exchange of telegrams. The pair exchanged insults with McAlister sharply criticising Hill's captaincy. Hill retorted, "In England, Armstrong wouldn't play under you. Did you ever win any except second rate games?"&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, pp. 116–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

McAlister replied, "I am a better captain than Trumper, Armstrong and yourself put together. You are the worst captain I have ever seen,"&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Hill then warned McAlister to stop insulting him, McAlister repeated the remark. Losing control, Hill struck McAlister a blow across the face. The two then grappled for around ten minutes.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Blood was drawn, staining their clothes and splashing on the other men present, Iredale and secretary Sydney Smith. At one stage, fearing that one or both combatants would fall through the window and onto the street, Smith grabbed hold of Hill's coat-tails. The fight ended with a bloody McAlister lying on the floor and Hill, unmarked standing over him. Hill told Smith he could no longer work with McAlister and was asked to put his resignation in writing; the Board accepted it that evening.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

When the Board announced that George Crouch would be manager of the Australian team for [[1912 Triangular Tournament]] in England, rather than [[Frank Laver]], outright rebellion ensued. Armstrong, Hill, Trumper, Carter, Cotter and Ransford announced that they would be unavailable to join the touring party. The team, under the captaincy of [[Syd Gregory]], left without these players.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was not a success on any front: the Australians winning only eight games and losing nine in a wet season and Crouch on return to Australia reported to the Board that "some of the players had conducted themselves so badly in England as to lead to the team being socially ostracised."&lt;ref name="Wisden1913"&gt;{{cite web

'''Haji Agus Salim Stadium''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], [[West Sumatera]], [[Indonesia]]. It is currently used mostly for [[Association football|Football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[Semen Padang F.C.]] and [[PSP Padang]]. The stadium has a capacity of 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://liga1indonesia.net/semen-padang-kabau-sirah/&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is also known as a venue for [[rugby union]] matches and athletics.

==History==
The stadium was named after [[Agus Salim]], a Muslim intellectual and [[National Hero of Indonesia|national hero]] of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] from the area where the stadium is located. The [[2009 Sumatra earthquakes]] heavily damaged the stadium. The stands were destroyed and there was damage to facilities, including lighting. The dressing rooms were also damaged, and the resultant condition of the field rendered the stadium unfit for use. Repairs were completed in 2012.

== Structure and facilities ==
The stadium has 4 tribune categories for spectators, west for VIPs with single seats, east for public, south for [[Spartacks]] and north for [[The Kmers]].

'''Jason Dasey''' (born 11 April 1962) is a Singapore-based journalist, broadcaster and media executive. He is best known as the first Australian sports host on [[CNN International]] and [[BBC World News]] and the original anchor of ESPN's [[SportsCenter Asia]] and [[SportsCenter India]] (English edition). Based in Asia since 2001, Jason is a former vice-president at Malaysian network [[Astro (television)|ASTRO]] who works as an [[ESPN]] anchor in India and host for Singapore station [[Money_FM_89.3]] through his company, Cockatoo Media.

==Early career==
The eldest of four brothers, Jason grew up in [[Sydney]] where he attended [[North Sydney Boys High School]] and was co-editor of the school's magazine. His father was an advertising copywriter and artist, while his mother was a cooking book author and cooking teacher. Jason's first newspaper articles were published in the [[North_Shore_Times]] in 1977. From 1978, he became a freelance sports reporter for [[Australian Associated Press]]. At the start of 1980, Jason joined [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], Australia's oldest newspaper, as a cadet journalist. In December 1980 at the age of 18, he broke his first major story, securing an exclusive interview with a Soviet defector who jumped ship in Sydney Harbour to seek political asylum.  

Towards the end of his four years with the Herald, Jason's personal vacation to [[New York City]] in September 1983 coincided with Australia winning sailing's [[America's Cup]]. Jason borrowed a blazer and talked his way into the [[New York Yacht Club]] before sending back an insider's account to the Sydney Morning Herald on the night the United States lost the America's Cup for the first time after 132 years.

==Move to Television==
That front-page story from a famous edition of the Herald helped 21-year-old Jason land a job at Australia's Seven Network in Sydney where he worked between 1983 and 1985 as an on-air reporter for Seven News and its nightly 'Willesee' current affairs show. At the end of 1985 after a six-month stint as a researcher for [[BBC_Nine_O'Clock_News]] in London, he became a producer and reporter for [[SBS-TV]] in Sydney.

In 1987, Jason returned to London where he would base himself for most of the next decade. Initially, he freelanced as a producer/reporter for [[SBS-TV]], [[Fairfax Media]], Reuters TV and BBC TV for whom he was an assistant producer on [[Breakfast Time]], contributing to its coverage of Australia's Bicentenary, including producing a back-stage interview with [[Barry Humphries]] in London's West End. In January 1989, Jason became a sports producer and reporter for European satellite network [[Sky News]] as it launched in Britain. A year later at Sky, he gained his first regular experience in the studio, as a weekend sports presenter.

==BBC and CNN Jobs==
Jason's biggest break came at the end of 1994. As a freelance producer and occasional presenter for [[BBC World Service Television]] in London, he was promoted to senior sports anchor on the re-branded [[BBC World News]] after a fill-in stint as host. It made him the first Australian newsreader on the global network as part of ‘Newsday’, a breakfast show for Europe, with co-hosts [[Philip Hayton]], Melinda Wittstock and [[Richard Quest]].

After three years in London with the BBC, Jason moved to the U.S. in 1997. After serving as a freelance reporter for BBC World Service and Denver local station, KUSA-TV 9-News (NBC), Jason re-located to Atlanta in early 1999 to take up a job at CNN International. He was initially a news producer/writer, but in May 1999, Jason became the first Australian sports anchor on CNN International's World Sport, broadcasting daily to more than 200 countries, often in partnership with [[Pedro Pinto]]. That year, he also made his first forays into digital journalism with a regular column for the [[CNN_Sports_Illustrated]] website.

==ESPN career==
In November 2001, Jason left CNN to become the senior news presenter at Asian network [[ESPN Star Sports]], based in [[Singapore]]. After hosting the India-focused Sportsline, Jason was the original anchor as [[SportsCenter Asia]] was launched in earnest in May 2002 and when [[SportsCenter India]] was reshaped as an English-language show in October 2003. With Jason as co-host, [[SportsCenter Asia]] was voted Best Sports Programme at the 2003 [[Asian Television Awards]]. In 2005, he appeared as a judge on the first [[Dream Job]] Asia series, including the final with Pakistan cricket legend [[Wasim Akram]].

In addition, Jason presented major sporting events for [[ESPN STAR Sports]], including three tennis Grand Slams in 2003 and 2004, the [[2005_United_States_Grand_Prix]], international cricket, rugby, plus the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] where he was an on-site 'live' reporter in [[Germany]]. He also wrote a weekly column called Dasey Direct for [[Espnstar.com]].

After hosting more than 1000 news programmes over five years at ESPN STAR, Jason relocated to ESPN's world headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut in late 2006 to be an anchor for the launch for two more international versions of SportsCenter while reporting on major events like the [[2008 Masters Tournament|2008]] [[Masters Tournament]] and [[2008 French Open]]. He also conducted in-depth SportsCenter Conversations with sports legends that included [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Nadia Comăneci]] and [[George Foreman]]. His meeting with Foreman in [[Houston]] for ESPN was featured in Episode 6 of the [[Family Foreman]] reality TV series, airing in August 2008 on [[TV Land]].

In November 2008, Jason moved back to Asia, setting up a base in Hong Kong while freelancing for [[ESPN]], primarily as a feature interviewer of sports identities like [[Nick Faldo]], [[Bernhard Langer]], [[Venus Williams]] and [[Justin Langer]] while continuing to write a weekly column on Asian and Australian football for [[ESPN Soccernet]].

==ASTRO==
After almost eight years within the [[ESPN]] group, Jason joined Asian satellite network [[Astro (television)|ASTRO]] in 2009 as vice-president and sports' executive producer. Based in [[Kuala Lumpur]], he built an in-house production team, was chief anchor for Astro's [[Premier League]] coverage and hosted seven major tournaments, including [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2012]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He also devised new programming like [[FourFourTwo TV Show]], Bola@Mamak, BPL Turning Points &amp; Stadium Unplugged. In November 2011, two of the shows were nominated for [[Asian_Television_Award]] in non-sports categories: Best Talk Show &amp; Best Comedy Show.

Away from football, he hosted the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] and presented 26 episodes of an interview-based show, ''[[Golfing Greats: In Their Own Words]]'' for [[Golf Channel]] in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] and conducted in-house trainings for Astro anchors, reporters and writers. As a weekly sports columnist, Jason wrote for several regional newspapers including ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' and '[[South China Morning Post]]" plus the Stadium Astro website. For two years he was chief columnist and consulting editor of the Malaysia/Singapore edition of [[FourFourTwo]] magazine and hosted a popular weekly football podcast, Football Fever. In 2009 and 2012, he emceed the [[Asian Football Confederation]] Annual Awards in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. In December 2012, Jason received a nomination for Best Sports Presenter/Commentator at the [[Asian_Television_Award]].

==Return to ESPN==
In 2014, Jason re-joined [[ESPN]] through [[The Walt Disney Company]] in a management role with a focus on creating digital content and Southeast Asian commercial opportunities for [[ESPN FC]], having initially worked as a consultant, while winding down his [[Astro (television)|ASTRO]] commitments. His last hosting for ASTRO was the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] from Brazil, including the July 13th final. After helping set up the daily [[ESPN FC]] Indonesia TV show on Jakarta-based [[NET.]] Media, premiering in June, Jason oversaw the November 2014 launch of the Southeast Asia edition of [[ESPN FC]]. Later that month, he co-hosted the [[2014 AFC Annual Awards]] in Manila, marking the confederation's 60th anniversary. In January 2015, he reported from Australia from the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] for both web and [[ESPN FC]] TV show. In December 2015, Jason was nominated for a second time in the Best Sports Presenter/Commentator category at the Asian TV Awards. In April 2016, he interviewed top Asian coaches at the draw for [[2018_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_–_AFC_Third_Round]] in Kuala Lumpur. In January 2017, Jason hosted the [[2017 Australian Open]] tennis for [[Sony_ESPN]], marking a return to the Indian TV market after an 11-year absence. In June 2017, Jason joined ex-Liverpool striker [[Emile Heskey]] for preview and analysis shows around the [[2017_UEFA_Champions_League_Final]] for an invited audience at [[Singapore National Stadium]] which were streamed live on the [[ESPN FC]] Facebook page. Between August and November, Jason covered the successful qualification, including two playoffs, of Australia's [[Socceroos]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. On November 30, he co-hosted the 2017 [[AFC Annual Awards]] in Bangkok to coincide with his 40th anniversary in journalism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">'''Kyadondo Rugby Club''' is a [[rugby union]] ground in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]].

It was built in 2000. Facilities include main ground, a training pitch and a club house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyadondo.co.ug/Club Kyadondo Rugby Club - About us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground is home to several club teams, among them [[Heathens RFC]], a leading rugby club in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;The Observer, November 29, 2010: [http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6212&amp;Itemid=80 Utl Kobs, MTN Heathens’ contrasting story in rugby]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also hosted home games of the [[Uganda national rugby union team]], but the [[Uganda Rugby Union]] is considering hosting games at the [[National Stadium (Uganda)|National Stadium]] or [[Nakivubo Stadium]] due to limited capacity of Kyadondo.&lt;ref&gt;New vision, March 31, 2010: [http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/30/714769 Namboole stadium to host rugby cranes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has also been a concert venue, [[Beenie Man]] is among the high-profile performers.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Monitor, December 7, 2009: [http://www.monitor.co.ug/LifeStyle/Entertainment/-/812796/818562/-/view/printVersion/-/2q9adb/-/index.html Beenie Man exhilarates Kampala]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second attack, consisting of two explosions in quick succession, occurred at {{Nowrap|11:18&amp;nbsp;pm}} at Kyadondo Rugby Club, where state-run newspaper ''[[New Vision]]'' was hosting a screening of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/10/10/725548 |title=33 die in Kampala bomb attacks |work=[[New Vision]] |date=11 July 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714023549/http://newvision.co.ug/D/10/10/725548 |archivedate=14 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to eyewitnesses, there was an explosion near the 90th minute of the match, followed seconds later by a second explosion that knocked out the lights at the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/07/12/uganda.bombings/?hpt=T1 |title=Death toll rises to 64 in Uganda twin bombings |first=Faith|last=Karimi|publisher=CNN|date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explosion went off directly in front of a large screen that was showing the telecast from South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/725545 |title=Over 40 die in Kampala bomb blasts |work=[[New Vision]] |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715054623/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/725545 |archivedate=15 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; killing 49 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6818">The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] has many [[ski area]]s no longer in operation. These include [[alpine skiing]] resorts and [[cross-country skiing]] stations. Some of these are quite famous or historic.

===Eastern Townships===

====Ski Shefford====
'''Ski Shefford''' ({{coords|45.954672|N|74.144244|W|display=inline}}) was a ski hill on what was originally Quebec Highway 1, now Route 112, located on [[Mont Shefford]], close to [[Ski Bromont]]. Ski Mont Shefford closed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= https://skimap.org/skiAreas/view/76 |title= Mont Shefford |publisher= SkiMap.org }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Laurentians===
Chalet Cochand 

The confluence of ski schools, ski trains, and rope tows in the Laurentians in turn gave rise to North America’s first concentration of inns designed to host skiers. The earliest of the ski inns, founded in 1914, was Chalet Cochand at Ste-Marguerite, its business bolstered by the proprietor’s ski school.

At the end of the station operating history, it was composed of a base chateau, four ski lifts, three T-bars and a magic carpet, five pistes, two green (runs 40, 60), a blue (run 80), a black diamond (run 100), and a glade double black diamond (run 120 or "Bois joli").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://skimap.org/SkiAreas/view/2228 |title= Les Cotes 40/80 Ski Trail Map |publicationdate= 2008 |date= 13 March 2009 |accessdate= 30 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages= 183 |title= Montreal &amp; Quebec City |edition= 2006 |work= Frommer's |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |date= 20 March 2006 |isbn= 9780471787709 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} vertical and the longest run was {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Skiing1986Oct-LaurentiansGlance&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jmB8VZ3qWEUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA128&amp;dq=%22C%C3%B4tes+40-80%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eMI3U_XDOtTgqAHhgIGYBQ&amp;redir_esc=y |pages= 14 |work= Skiing |title= The Laurentians: At A Glance |issn= 0037-6264 |date= October 1986 |volume= 39 |number= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, it was the cheapest lift ticket in the Laurentians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |work= Skiing |title= The Laurentians |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NGDzCYkYZy0C&amp;dq=%22C%C3%B4tes+40-80%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |author= Association Touristique des Laurentides |date= January 1988 |pages= 152 |issn= 0037-6264 |volume= 40 |number= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Malta]]''' participated in the '''[[1960 Summer Paralympics|inaugural Paralympic Games]]''' in 1960 in [[Rome]]. The country sent four representatives (three men and a woman) to compete in athletics, snooker and table tennis. Each of them won a medal in his or her event. Malta won more medals than at any other edition of the Paralympic Games, and won its only silver medals to date; it would win bronze, at best, in subsequent Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=MLT&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Malta at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pakistani cricket team toured England in the [[2006 English cricket season]], following [[England cricket team|England]]'s [[English cricket team in Pakistan in 2005–06|winter tour of Pakistan]] where [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] had won a three-Test series 2–0 and the ODI series 4–1. As a result of this series, Pakistan rose two spots to be ranked second in the world Test rankings before this series, and England dropped to third after the 12 July annual update of the [[ICC Test Championship]]. The series was marred by a [[ball-tampering]] controversy on the fourth day of the Fourth Test, which culminated in Pakistan refusing to take the field after the tea interval in protest to a contentious decision by the umpires to penalise the Pakistani team for what they believed were acts of ball-tampering. This led the umpires to award the game to England, who thus won the Test series 3–0. In 2008, the ICC controversially declared the result of the final Test as a draw, altering the scoreline to 2–0; however, after criticism, not least by the MCC, this was subsequently reversed in February 2009 and the result restored as an England victory.&lt;ref name="BBC Sport"&gt;{{cite news |title=Result U-turn for 2006 Oval Test |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7863464.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A steady start of 60 for England before losing their first wicket turned sour as skipper [[Andrew Strauss]] fell for the second wicket, also at 60. It seemed that England were to fall cheaply as big-hitter [[Kevin Pietersen]] fell 28 runs later but [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Paul Collingwood]], echoing their February performance on [[South Asia]], made a partnership of 322 (105 and 187 respectively.) The two, who many see as stand-ins for the unfit members of the team, along with the third stand-in [[Ian Bell]] (100*) kept the fledgling team alive, nobody else making a half-century before they declared on the second day.

The wicket proved to be helpful to the touring side too after a similar opening (the first and second wicket – a duck – falling cheaply on 28) and another duck leaving them at 68/4 however a well-paced strike rate from [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]], making a double century in the nick of time as he stood until the last wicket, and a half century from skipper [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], keeping his record against England alive, proved the team would stand as strong as the home team. [[Stephen Harmison]]'s bowling, which had been under scrutiny over the Winter months, improved greatly at his least favourite pitch as he took 4–94 but the next best, [[Matthew Hoggard]] at 3–117 proved the tourists had victory in their sights. A special note must go to Pietersen who made a rare attempt at bowling for two overs, taking wicket keeper [[Kamran Akmal]] for 58 at figures of 1–11.

However, seeing as the second innings did not start for England until the fourth day a result seemed unlikely. Strauss made up for his first effort by making a 128 but little else from the team was worth mention as they declared a few overs into the last day, leaving the tourists with a deficit of 379 to chase in 73 overs. After [[Salman Butt]] fell from the first delivery to Hoggard, things seemed hopeful, even more so after [[Imran Farhat]] fell at 33 but [[Faisal Iqbal]]'s slow, but firm scoring rate took them to before tea, leaving Inzy and [[Abdul Razzaq (Pakistani cricket player)|Abdul Razzaq]] to bat out the last session for 73 before a draw was confirmed.

With [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]]'s run of half-centuries against England finally stopped, as he was caught by [[Kevin Pietersen]] off [[Steve Harmison]]'s bowling for a duck, England recorded an innings victory over Pakistan to take a 1–0 lead into the third Test. In the first innings, Pakistan lost the last eight wickets for 29 to post 119 with no batsmen making a half-century; England surpassed that score for the loss of two wickets, and with [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Ian Bell]] both making hundreds (127 and 106* respectively), England could eventually declare near the end of day two having made 461. It took England 63 overs to clean up, with Harmison and [[Monty Panesar]] sharing the ten wickets evenly (the only wicket takers in both innings) with the help of wicket keeper [[Geraint Jones]], who caught five despite his fractured finger. Panesar took his second five-wicket-haul in three months, and was praised by opposition coach [[Bob Woolmer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/5229112.stm Panesar tipped for greatness], from BBC, retrieved 31 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After their innings defeat in the second test, Pakistan dropped [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Abdul Razzaq (Pakistani cricket player)|Abdul Razzaq]], and had to swap [[Imran Farhat]] out due to injury. They brought in [[Salman Butt]] and [[Taufeeq Umar]] to open the innings, plus the bowling of [[Shahid Nazir]]. England only made one change, which was to swap the struggling wicketkeeper [[Geraint Jones]] for [[Chris Read]]. The wicketkeeper position had been the subject of much debate. Read was perceived as the better keeper, although Jones’ batting skills were considered to be superior. However, Jones had not scored a significant innings for some time and Read was given an opportunity to impress for the first time since the West Indies tour of 2004.

The first day of the test prompted some interesting incidents as England won the toss and batted first. In the morning, there were three rogue decisions from the umpires (who had been testing the use of earpieces to communicate with off-field officials); in the afternoon Kevin Pietersen left the field in bizarre circumstances, and Pakistan responded with 11 overs of very mediocre bowling, using their opening batsmen to bowl during the period before the second new ball was due.

In amongst all this, Pietersen scored his 5th test century, and helped propel England to 347/6 by the end of the day. England continued on day 2, with [[Ian Bell]] posting his third consecutive test century, and the lower order added useful runs before England were bowled out for 515.

Pakistan's openers once again struggled, and they fell quickly to leave the tourists on 36/2. However, the experienced combination of [[Younis Khan]] and [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] then combined to produce the largest partnership for Pakistan against England of 363 for the third wicket. They batted well into the afternoon session of the third day, before Yousuf gloved [[Stephen Harmison]] through to the keeper having scored 192.

Pakistan then lost some of their advantage in a bizarre passage of play leading up to the tea interval. Younis was run out on 173, [[Faisal Iqbal]] fell lbw to his first delivery faced (giving [[Paul Collingwood]] his first test wicket), and [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] lost his wicket in a comical way, overbalancing while attempting to sweep a [[Monty Panesar]] delivery and falling onto his stumps.

The lower order batsmen tried to accelerate the scoring, but lost regular wickets in the process, and Pakistan were finally bowled out for 538.

England's second innings started well, with the openers putting on 158 for the first wicket. [[Andrew Strauss]] went on to score 116, and [[Chris Read]] scored 55 down the order, but the other wickets fell quite regularly as England attempted to set up a position where they could push for a win on the final day. Pakistan's bowling attack shared the wickets between them, and eventually bowled England out for 345. Pakistan needed 323 runs on the final day to win.

England's bowlers performed well on the final day, and took 5 wickets in the first session ensuring the 323 run target was well out of Pakistan's reach. The run out of [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] for a single figure score was a key moment in the innings – in fact, Pakistan lost 3 of their top order batsmen to run outs during the game. [[Sajid Mahmood]] struck twice in an over shortly before lunch to remove [[Faisal Iqbal]] and [[Kamran Akmal]], and would go on to record test best figures of 4/22.

[[Monty Panesar]] also demonstrated his promising talent, taking 3 wickets in the second innings to follow up on 3 wickets in the first, on a pitch not typically associated with assisting spinners. His dismissal of [[Younis Khan]] during the afternoon session was spectacular, with a wonderfully flighted delivery that just clipped the bail of the off stump.

From this point, it was a matter of time before England took the honours.

As a result of a rib injury obtained during the course of the Test (and determined to be an ''internal'' injury rather than an ''external'' one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/5253966.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rib injury keeps Inzamam waiting | date=7 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the Pakistan Captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], was unable to bat for 4h20m in the Pakistan 2nd innings, or until the fall of the 5th wicket (whichever came first). As England took five wickets in the first session of the last day, he was able to come in at number 7 in the order. His wicket was eventually the last to fall, being stumped off the bowling of [[Monty Panesar]], and Pakistan were all out for 155.

England won the match by 167 runs, and took an unassailable 2–0 lead in the series, with one left to play.

Pakistan made three changes to their side for the final test. The uncertainty of the opening pair continued, with [[Salman Butt]] and [[Taufeeq Umar]] being dropped in favour of [[Imran Farhat]] and [[Mohammad Hafeez]]. The tourists' bowling ranks were boosted by the return of [[Mohammad Asif]], for whom [[Mohammad Sami]] made way.

Pakistan won the toss and chose to field in cloudy conditions. This proved to be a good decision, as Pakistan's seamers [[Umar Gul]] and [[Mohammad Asif]] took eight wickets between them on the way to bowling England out for 173. Asif in particular caused problems for England's batsmen, and left people wondering what the outcome of the series would have been had he not been injured for the earlier tests.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Late on day 1, Pakistan began their reply confidently, and their fourth opening partnership combination of the series proved to be the most successful one. Hafeez hit some good shots before retiring hurt with a knee problem. He would return to complete his innings and score 95, while Farhat scored 91. England's poor first day was complete when they dropped [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] twice before he reached double figures. He went on to score 128, his third century of the series.

Pakistan continued their dominance of the match on day 2, with the close of play score at 336/3, a lead of 163. On day 3, England finally managed to start taking wickets in between frequent rain and bad light interruptions, but they were not able to curtail Pakistan's scoring. [[Faisal Iqbal]] ended on 58 not out, his first contribution in the series. Pakistan were finally bowled out for 504, a lead of 331.

[[Marcus Trescothick]] was dismissed early in England's second innings, in what would be his last test match appearance for England to date. [[Andrew Strauss]] and [[Alastair Cook]] then progressed the score to 78/1 at the close of play.

The (what would prove to be eventful) fourth day began with Strauss and Cook continuing on the improved batting performance before Strauss fell lbw to [[Danish Kaneria]] with the score on 115. [[Kevin Pietersen]] came in and played an aggressive innings, hitting 96 from 114 deliveries, and only falling when he chased a wide delivery in an attempt to bring up his century.

The dismissal of Cook for 83 off the bowling of [[Umar Gul]], with a delivery of reverse swing, resulted in umpires [[Darrell Hair]] and [[Billy Doctrove]] calling a halt to play so a set of used balls could be brought out to the middle. England were awarded 5 penalty runs and this event was the catalyst for the subsequent refusal to continue the match after tea by the Pakistan team. Based on the laws of cricket, the umpires declared Pakistan to have forfeited the game and [[Result_(cricket)#Awarded|awarded]] England the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/5268886.stm |title=Lengthy talks fail to save Test |publisher=BBC |date=20 August 2006 |accessdate=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/5269906.stm |title=Inzamam charged in cheating row |publisher=BBC |date=21 August 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC later changed the result of the match to a draw,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/359329.html |title=ICC changes Oval forfeiture to draw |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=21 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then later reversed this decision on 1 February 2009.&lt;ref name="award2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cricket: England awarded Oval Test 'win' against Pakistan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/01/england-pakistan-oval|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Racketlon''' is a combination [[sport]] in which competitors play a sequence of the four most popular [[racket sport]]s: [[table tennis]], [[badminton]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], and [[tennis]]. It originated in [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/92037 | title=Czechs among superpowers in fast growing sport of racketlon | work=[[Czech Radio]] | date=4 June 2007 | accessdate=28 August 2014 | author=Dita Salavová}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was modeled on other combination sports like the [[triathlon]] and [[decathlon]].

== Rules ==
In racketlon a player competes against an opponent, or a doubles pair, in each of the four biggest racket sports: table tennis, badminton, squash and tennis.

One set is played in each sport, in the order from the smallest to the biggest racket. Each of the four sets are played with running score to 21 points, with a margin of two points needed to finish a set. In team competitions, however, the individual matches are played to 11 points.

Each player serves two serves at a time, and except in table tennis, this is always one serve from the right side and one serve from the left side of the court. Lots are drawn to decide who starts serving in table tennis, and this player will also start serving in squash.

The winner of a racketlon match is the player or doubles pair who has won the most points in total. When a player leads a match with more points than there are points left for the opponent to obtain, the match is over.

If the score is tied after all four sports, a "gummiarm"-point is played. This is a single extra point played in tennis, with only one serve to start off the rally. Lots are drawn to decide the server, and the winner of this rally wins the entire match.

In doubles, the squash set is played individually. One player from each pair plays until someone reaches 11 points. From here, the rest of the game is finished by the two remaining players.

With the exception of the above-mentioned rules, all rules that apply to the four individual sports also apply for racketlon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racketlon.net/content/rules|title=Rules {{!}} Federation Internationale de Racketlon|website=www.racketlon.net|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1929, Fred Perry won the table tennis world championships. Five years later he won three consecutive Wimbledon titles, and also became the first player ever to win all four grand slams. Little did he know that he was a racketlon pioneer.

The first known multi-racket sports probably originated somewhat simultaneously and independently in different European countries, although suggestions have been made that the more organised form of racketlon had Finland and Sweden as pioneering countries.

In the mid 1980s in Finland, a member from each of the four national racket federations got together and formed a game called "mailapelit". In this game, the order of play was determined by a draw, and the scoring system was as it is today. The first Finnish national championships were held in Helsinki in 1986.

In Sweden, racketlon can be traced back to the late 1980s, where the first tournaments were organized by Peter Landberg, who later named the game. Before that, the game was called ''racketmästerskap'', meaning "racket championships". The first Swedish national championship was held in 1990. The original counting methods of the individual sports was preserved. To decide the winner of a match, complicated conversion tables were used. The simpler Finnish scoring system was adopted in 1994 at the Swedish national championship. In Swedish competitions there was a fixed order of play, starting with table tennis, then squash, then badminton and finally tennis. In order to simplify the sport, the order was later changed to the current format, going from the smallest to the biggest racket. This order also minimised the squash players' advantages of running their opponents tired. In the beginning, each player would serve five serves at a time. Later on, this was changed to the current format of two serves at a time, to make the number of serves in a set more equally distributed.

Other European countries also had multi-racket sports forming at this time. Germany had their "Mehrslägerturniere", Austria their "Racket 4 kampf", France had their "Tournoi des Quatre Raquettes," and in Belgium they had their "King of Rackets" tournament. This tournament was a huge knock-out tournament played in groups. In England there are vague traces of something called "Quintathlon," which included golf.

In 2001 the first ever international racketlon tournament took place. It was the Gothenburg Racketlon World Open in Sweden, and it was considered the first ever world championship in racketlon. There were participants from six countries (Finland, Sweden, Scotland, France, Germany and Bulgaria), and Finland won it all. Katja Aminoff became the first female World Champion in racketlon, and Mikko Kärkkäinen the first male World Champion. On the way to his victory, he defeated the Swede Magnus Eliasson in the quarterfinal, and that match became their first encounter in a year-long rivalry. International participants from the 2001 World Championship then traveled home and became local racketlon pioneers themselves, by arranging international tournaments in their own countries. 

Since then one milestone after another have been reached. The first official world ranking system was introduced right after the 2001 World Championship. The first international racketlon tournament in Finland was played in 2002, and in the same year, the first racketlon tournament outside Scandinavia took place, in Scotland. The English Open also had its debut in 2002. At the second World Championships in Gothenburg 2002, a national team competition was added for the first time. The premiere of the International World Tour was in 2003, and in 2005 competitions in doubles were made possible. The international Racketlon Federation (IRF) was formed in 2003, and changed its name to Fédération Internationale de Racketlon (FIR) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racketlon.com/rackpres.html|title=The history of Racketlon|website=www.racketlon.com|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racketlon.net/content/fir-history|title=FIR History {{!}} Federation Internationale de Racketlon|website=www.racketlon.net|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosecroft Raceway''', nicknamed the '''"Raceway by the Beltway"''' for being close to [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Interstate 495]], is a [[harness racing]] track in [[Fort Washington, Maryland]]. It first opened in 1949 and was owned by William E. Miller, a horse trainer and breeder. Rosecroft quickly became [[Prince George's County]]'s political and social center, drawing thousands of people there each racing day. In the early 1950s, average attendance was more than 7,000 per day. After Miller died in 1954, his son John owned Rosecroft until his death in 1969. Rosecroft hosted memorial stake races annually for both William and John until 1995. Following the death of John Miller, Earle Brown controlled operations until he moved to a different position in 1980; William E. Miller II took over following Brown.

Rosecroft was sold to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several mistakes that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, he was arrested for possession of [[cocaine]], and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft was sold to Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the [[grandstand]] caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to [[lawsuits]] and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized [[casino]]s to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, [[Penn National Gaming]] purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a [[racino]], and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.

Throughout Rosecroft's history, it has featured notable races. From 1984 to 1988, it hosted segments of the [[Breeders Crown]]. Starting in 1990 and ending in 1995, the racetrack hosted the [[Messenger Stakes]], the second leg of the [[Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers]]. Rosecroft hosted the Potomac Stakes, Maryland most successful harness race, from 1990 to 1992. Rosecroft features the Maryland Sire Stakes, which showcases the best [[standardbred]] horses in Maryland. Besides the races, Rosecroft has had famous people and horses work and race at the track. John Wager, Maryland's all-time most winning driver, has been working at Rosecroft since 1974. Several famous people—[[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Nancy Pelosi]], among others—have visited Rosecroft. [[Cam's Card Shark]] raced at Rosecroft in 1994 and challenged the single-season record for most money won in a season by winning over $2 million, and [[Robust Hanover]] set a track record while winning the Breeders Crown in 1985.

Mark Vogel, a Maryland [[Real estate broker|real estate agent]], purchased both Rosecroft and [[Casino at Ocean Downs|Ocean Downs Racetrack]] in 1987 for $6 million in cash plus $5.5 million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Bergstein | first=Stanley | date=November 23, 1987 | url=http://www.harnesstracks.com/docdatabase/htamembers/3883.pdf | title=Rosecroft Sold, Present Management Team to Remain | journal=Weekly Track Topics | publisher=Harness Tracks of America | page=2 | accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosecroft was awarded another Breeders Crown race in 1988, making it their fifth straight—but final—year of hosting them.&lt;ref name="theharnessedge" /&gt; Vogel had three main goals when he became owner: to construct a $10 million grandstand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Nowakowski | first=Jack | date=February 19, 1988 | title=Vogel Plans New Grandstand, Bigger Track at Rosecroft | newspaper=The Washington Post | page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[simulcast]] Rosecroft races at other racetracks throughout Maryland to attract a larger market,&lt;ref name="simulcast"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Nowakowski | first=Jack | date=August 9, 1989 | title=Vogel Eyes Simulcast of Rosecroft Races | newspaper=The Washington Post | page=F10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have more racing days.&lt;ref name="simulcast" /&gt; In 1989, Vogel purchased Freestate Raceway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Smith | first=C.

According to ''[[The Washington Times]]'' writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did not know the horse racing business and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the [[parimutuel betting#Parimutuel bet types|betting pools]] to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow [[off-track betting]] and to lower the [[State taxation in the united states|state tax]] on betting pools.&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Snider | first=Rick | date=October 3, 1990 | title=Vogel should have Focused more on the Horse Business | newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] | page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this citation is for the whole paragraph" --&gt;

In 1991, two people were interested in buying the track: Fred Weisman, a California businessman, and former [[National Football League]] player [[Mark May]].

The handle was decreasing, and the officials could not afford the purses for the races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Nowakowski | first=Jack | date=September 1, 1992 | title=Rosecroft to Drop Five Stakes Races | newspaper=The Washington Post | page=E7}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help increase the handle, Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter-track simulcasting between all Maryland tracks and authorized off-track betting parlors throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Peddicord | first=Ross | date=October 4, 1993 | title=Tracks Pull on Simulcast Handle OTB, Intertrack Boosting Betting for Laurel, Pimlico | newspaper=The Baltimore Sun | page=10C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1995, Rosecroft was forced to cut costs. Its owners lowered the amount of purse money, eliminated stake races, and reduced the number of racing days. They decided to sell both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs to Cloverleaf Enterprises, a horseman's organization, in mid-1995 for $11 million.&lt;ref name="closing1995" /&gt; Weisman's Colt Enterprises reported that if the racetrack could not be sold, the company would have to file for bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="bankruptcy"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Perrone | first=Vinnie | date=March 18, 1995 | title=Rosecroft Owners May File for Bankruptcy | newspaper=The Washington Post | page=H10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloverleaf accepted a $10.6 million loan from [[Bally Entertainment]] in hopes that a casino would be allowed at Rosecroft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Perrone | first=Vinnie | date=June 30, 1995 | title=Maryland Board Approves Sale; Casino and Racing Groups Team to Buy Rosecroft, Delmarva | newspaper=The Washington Post | page=B9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn National also announced its intent to spend $1 million in the coming year to renovate the property, which would include razing old horse barns, putting a new roof on the betting parlors, and upgrading the [[HVAC]] system.&lt;ref name="LiuDraws"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.gazette.net/article/20110901/NEWS/709019926/1010/rosecroft-raceway-draws-hundreds-on-reopening-day&amp;template=gazette | last=Liu | first=Mimi | title=Rosecroft Raceway Draws Hundreds on Reopening Day | newspaper=Maryland Gazette | date=September 1, 2011 | accessdate=December 22, 2011}} {{Dead link |date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill was introduced into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County.

[[File:GBNYShotgun.jpg|thumb|right|330px|The [[Green Bay Packers]] (left) in the shotgun in a game against the [[New York Giants]] in [[2007 NFL season|2007]]]]

The '''shotgun formation''' is a [[Formation (American football)|formation]] used by the [[offensive team]] in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]]. This formation is used mainly for passing plays, although some teams use it as their base formation. In the shotgun, instead of the [[quarterback]] receiving the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] at the [[line of scrimmage]], he stands farther behind the line of scrimmage, often five to seven yards back. Sometimes the quarterback will have a back on one or both sides before the snap, while other times he will be the lone player in the backfield with everyone spread out as receivers. 

The shotgun formation can offer certain advantages. The offensive linemen have more room to maneuver behind the scrimmage line and form a tighter, more cohesive oval “pocket” in which the quarterback is protected from “blitzing” by the defense.  If the quarterback has speed, mobility or both, he can use this formation to scramble before his pass; or, to run to an open field position in the defensive secondary or to the sideline, usually gaining first-down yardage.  

The formation also has weaknesses. The defense knows a pass is more than likely coming up (although some running plays can be run effectively from the shotgun) and there is a higher risk of a botched snap than in a simple center/quarterback exchange.  If the defense is planning a pass rush, this formation gives fast defensive players more open and exposed targets in the offensive backfield, with less cluttered “blitzing” routes to the quarterback and any other [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] in the offensive backfield.

Shotgun combines elements of the [[short punt formation|short punt]] and spread formations — "spread" in that it has receivers spread widely instead of close to or behind the interior line players. The origins of the term are thought to be that it is like a "shotgun" in spraying receivers around the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1184750-25-craziest-football-terms-and-where-they-come-from|title=BleacherReport, Craziest Football Terms and Where They Come From}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The alignment of the players also suggests the shape of an actual shotgun.) Formations similar or identical to the shotgun used decades previously would be called names such as "spread double wing".  Short punt formations (so called because the distance between the snapper and the ostensible punter is shorter than in long punt formation) do not usually have as much emphasis on wide receivers. 

[[File:Shotgun Formation.svg|thumb|350px|right|A typical Shotgun formation—many variables can be modified, but this is the basic setup many teams use]]

==History==

The shotgun evolved from the [[single wing]] and the similar double-wing spread; famed [[triple threat man]] [[Sammy Baugh]] has claimed that the shotgun was effectively the same as the version of the double-wing he ran at [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;David, Howard and Johnny Unitas (1981?). "History of the Forward Pass". [[Mizlou Television Network]]. Available at FrontRowSportsEntertainment.com; retrieved 2010-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of the 1940s, the Philadelphia Eagles, under Hall of Fame Coach Earl "Greasy" Neale, implemented the shotgun formation in their offensive attack with quarterback Tommy Thompson.

The formation was named by the man who actually devised it, [[San Francisco 49ers]] coach [[Red Hickey]], in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/31/local/me-passings31.2 | title=Red Hickey, 89; NFL Player, Coach Invented Shotgun Formation | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=2006-03-31 | accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brodie]] was the first NFL shotgun quarterback, beating out former starter [[Y. A. Tittle]] largely because he was mobile enough to effectively run the formation. 

The [[New York Jets]] briefly experimented with the shotgun during the middle of the [[Joe Namath]] era to give the bad-kneed and often immobile quarterback more time to set up plays by placing him deeper in the backfield. Three years before Dallas ushered in the modern era of the shotgun to the NFL, [[Joe Theismann]] of the [[Toronto Argonauts]] regularly employed the formation north of the border in the CFL. &lt;ref&gt; "Tell me to my Face", by Angelo Mosca with Steve Milton, Lulu Publishing, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt; But the formation was not used on a regular basis in the NFL until the 1975 season, and then only by the [[Dallas Cowboys]], who used the shotgun frequently with [[Roger Staubach]] at quarterback.  The Cowboy shotgun differed from the 49er shotgun as Staubach generally had a back next to him in the backfield (making runs possible), where Brodie was normally alone in the backfield. 

Since no other NFL teams used the formation during this time, some believed it had been invented by [[Tom Landry]]. Instead, Landry simply dusted off the old innovation to address a pressing problem: keeping Staubach protected while an unusually young and inexperienced squad (12 rookies made the 1975 Cowboys roster) jelled.   The Cowboys ended up in the Super Bowl that season, in no small part due to its new use of the old formation.  The shotgun became a "signature" formation for the Cowboys, especially during third down situations.

The shotgun was adopted by more teams throughout the pass-happy late 1980s, and was part of almost every team's offense in the 1990s, eventually becoming a base formation for some teams in the late 2000s.

==Recent use==

In recent years, the shotgun has become vastly prevalent. Many college quarterbacks&amp;mdash;such as [[Tim Tebow]], who almost exclusively used the shotgun at [[Florida Gators football|Florida]]&amp;mdash;have difficulty adapting to NFL offenses where about a third of snaps are taken under center. However, with the [[spread offense]] increasingly used in the NFL, the shotgun is more popular, since the spread allows for more effective running.
[[File:Patriots on offense at Super Bowl XXXIX 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tom Brady]] in the shotgun at a Super Bowl.]]
The shotgun formation is often run during 2nd-and-long or 3rd-and-long situations to give the quarterback enough time to allow the receivers to run deep routes. However, [[Peyton Manning]], formerly of the [[Indianapolis Colts]], often [[Quarterback#Special_tactics|audibled]] to plays that use this formation in order to better read defenses and to take advantage of fast receivers like [[Marvin Harrison]] and [[Reggie Wayne]] and gain extended yardage in a single play. In 2007, the [[New England Patriots]] used the shotgun with great effectiveness as a base formation for the offense that scored the then-record 587 points in a 16-game season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=11 December 2012|url=http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/greatest-scoring-offenses-all-nfl-history/6100/|title=Cold Hard Football Facts - Greatest Scoring Offenses, all of NFL history|publisher=Cold Hard Football Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; (since broken by the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[2013 Denver Broncos season|2013]]); in fact, the 2007 Patriots were the first team in NFL history to use it for the majority of their offensive plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/sports/football/articles/2008/08/24/players_must_pull_together/?page=full Players must pull together] Boston.com Football Notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The Patriots have also used the formation to directly snap the ball away from the quarterback, snapping it instead to a running back (usually [[Kevin Faulk]]); the Patriots scored a [[two-point conversion]] via such a direct snap to Faulk in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] and again against the [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers]] in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.

[[File:ShotgunFormationAFAvCSU.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Side view of the shotgun formation]]

Though the shotgun is a pass-dominated formation, a cleverly designed halfback [[draw play]] can put defenses off guard and a fast halfback can get good yardage before the defense recovers from their mistake. A further development of the play is a [[halfback option pass]], with the [[quarterback]] being one of the eligible receivers. [[Roger Staubach]]'s backup and successor, [[Danny White]], twice caught such a pass for a touchdown. It was noted at the time that he was only eligible because of the shotgun formation (an NFL quarterback who takes a snap from underneath the center was and still is an ineligible receiver, a rule not found in any amateur level of American football). 

The shotgun is also used in college, but running is used more often than in the NFL. Most offenses in college who run in the shotgun have a fast quarterback. They often use a play where the quarterback has an option of handing the ball off to the running back who runs to the side opposite the side he was lined up on. The quarterback can also run the opposite way depending on how the defense reacts. [[Urban Meyer]] and the [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] used this effectively from 2006 to 2009 with [[Tim Tebow]].

==Related formations==

The [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]] currently employs a formation called the "[[pistol offense|pistol]]", in which the running back, instead of lining up next to the quarterback, lines up behind the quarterback, who in turn has lined up two to three yards behind the center.

Coach [[Urban Meyer]] has added elements of the [[option offense]] to the shotgun offense he employed as coach at [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green State University]], the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]], and [[Florida Gators football|University of Florida]]. This "[[Spread offensive|spread option]]" offense is also used by the [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri Tigers]], [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] and other college teams with quarterbacks who can run as well as throw effectively.

==Use in Canadian football==

At times the formation has been more common in [[Canadian football]], which allows only three downs to move ten yards downfield instead of the American game's four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=13 August 2011|url=https://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/publications/2008rulebook.pdf|title=CFL Official Playing Rules 2008|publisher=[[Canadian Football League|cfl.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian teams are therefore more likely to find themselves with long yardage to make on the penultimate down, and therefore more likely to line up in the shotgun to increase their opportunities for a large gain. Canadian teams also have the advantage that backs positioned behind the line of scrimmage can run forward and cross the line running as the ball is snapped.

==Disability classifications==
{{main article|Disability sport classification}}
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five [[Summer Paralympic Games#Disability categories|disability categories]]; [[amputation]], the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; [[cerebral palsy]]; [[wheelchair]] athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; [[visual impairment]], including [[blindness]]; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example [[dwarfism]] or [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name=class1&gt;{{cite web |title=Paralympics categories explained |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=3 September 2008 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/03/2354016.htm?site=paralympics/2008 |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=class2&gt;{{cite news |title=Making sense of the categories |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=6 October 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/paralympics/959701.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[Paralympic Games#Summer sports|Paralympic sport]] then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|athletics]], divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|swimming]], group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.&lt;ref name=class3&gt;{{cite news |title=A-Z of Paralympic classification |publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] |date=28 August 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/7586684.stm |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Billy "The Great" Hope is an undefeated [[Professional boxing|professional boxer]] living in the suburbs of [[New York City]] with his wife Maureen and their daughter Leila. Billy's particular style of fighting often leaves him beaten and bruised. During a match in which he defends his [[light heavyweight]] world title, Billy sustains an eye injury as well as heavy blows to the face and body, leaving him coughing up blood for days. He is finally convinced by Maureen to retire before he becomes forever "punch-drunk". During the press conference at the post-match, an up-and-coming boxer Miguel "Magic" Escobar taunts Billy and tries to get Billy to fight him. At a charity event for the orphanage where he and his wife both grew up, Escobar is in attendance, and as Billy is leaving, Escobar threatens he'll take Maureen and his title away from him, and while Maureen tells Billy to let it go and go home with her, Billy's anger gets the best of him, leading to a brawl in which Maureen is accidentally shot and killed by Miguel's brother Hector, who flees.

Billy begins abusing alcohol and drugs while obsessively searching for Hector. He eventually gets a tip about Hector's whereabouts but only finds Hector's drug-addicted wife Maria, and leaves after learning Hector is a father. Billy attacks a referee out of frustration after throwing a fight and is suspended for a year, leaving him with no income and a six figure fine for ref assault. Furthermore, the networks are suing him for breach of contract, leaving him indebted and his house and belongings being repossessed. He continues to spiral out of control and nearly dies after crashing his car in a suicide attempt; he loses custody of Leila as a result, and she is put under care of [[Child Protective Services]] officer Angela Rivera. The incident drives Billy to sober up, but Leila cuts ties with him, blaming him for their predicament.

At the behest of his friends, Billy gets a job as a cleaner at a gym owned by seasoned boxer Titus "Tick" Wills, and tries to convince Tick to become his trainer. Billy's former manager, Jordan Mains, who is currently managing Miguel, arranges a fight between the two that could put Billy back in the spotlight. Tick is reluctant to train Billy, fearful he might be blinded by his vendetta against Miguel, but is motivated to do so when another of his students, Hoppy, is killed by his abusive father while attempting to defend his mother.

Seeing Billy's hard work after securing a job and keeping it, and his ability to show responsibilities of a father, a judge removes his visitation restrictions and congratulates him for his good work. Billy then takes Leila to his apartment where they have breakfast together and Leila asks if she can attend the fight. Billy, reluctant to let his daughter go to the fight because Maureen never wanted to expose their daughter to the violence in boxing, says he is unsure because Maureen used to make all the decisions for him. Leila asks if they can go visit Maureen's grave, where Leila convinces Billy to let her go to the fight to have someone by his side. Billy tells Leila that there will be people at the fight saying some harsh things, so Leila makes an agreement to go to the fight but stay only in the locker room with Angela, watching the fight via closed circuit television in the locker room.

As the match begins, Miguel has the upper hand against Billy, but, with Tick's advice, Billy has the chance to turn the tables in the final round by using the [[Boxing styles and technique#Defense|Philly shell defense]] and countering more aggressively with his left. As the round reaches its final minute, Billy pivots hard and, although fighting from a traditional stance, delivers a powerful left uppercut which knocks the champion down to the ground. Miguel manages to get up before the count is over and is saved by the bell. Billy is declared the winner by a split-decision and reunites with Leila in the locker room, where she forgives his past mistakes and they embrace.

==Production==
[[Eminem]] was originally supposed to play the role of Billy Hope. The film's screenwriter [[Kurt Sutter]] said the project was inspired by the rapper's personal struggles. He stated that he had taken meetings with Eminem's producing partners over the past seven years, looking for something to do together. "I know he's very selective and doesn't do a lot. But he shared so much of his personal struggle in this raw and very honest album, one that I connected with on a lot of levels. He is very interested in the boxing genre, and it seemed like an apt metaphor, because his own life has been a brawl. In a way, this is a continuation of the ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' story, but we are doing a metaphorical narrative of the second chapter of his life. He'll play a world champion boxer who really hits a hard bottom, and has to fight to win back his life for his young daughter. At its core, this is a retelling of his struggles over the last five years of his life, using the boxing analogy. I love that the title refers to Marshall being a lefty, which is to boxing what a white rapper is to hip hop; dangerous, unwanted, and completely unorthodox. It's a much harder road for a [[southpaw]] than a right-handed boxer."&lt;ref name="deadline5"/&gt; Producers Alan and Peter Riche have given a slightly different story about Eminem's involvement however stating that they set out to make a boxing movie similar to ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' but wanted to make the story about a father-daughter relationship as opposed to ''The Champ''{{'}}s father-son story.&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt; Recalling Eminem's strong relationship with his daughter, they asked him and he was immediately receptive.&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt;

On December 13, 2010, [[DreamWorks]] acquired the script, with Eminem eyed to play the lead role,&lt;ref name="deadline5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/dreamworks-teams-with-eminem-and-kurt-sutter-for-southpaw/ |title=DreamWorks Teams With Eminem And Kurt Sutter For 'Southpaw' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the following August the studio dropped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/eminem-antoine-fuqua-boxing-drama-southpaw-dropped-by-dreamworks-but-still-seeking-to-answer-bell/ |title=Eminem-Antoine Fuqua Boxing Drama 'Southpaw' Dropped By DreamWorks But Still Seeking To Answer Bell |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] picked up the film that October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeff Sneider |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/mgm-closes-eminem-pic-southpaw-1118044796/ |title=MGM closes Eminem pic ‘Southpaw’ |publisher=Variety |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2012, Eminem dropped out of the film to focus instead on his music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminems-second-movie-put-on-hold-20120510 |title=Eminem delays second movie, 'Southpaw' to focus on music. |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Fuqua]] signed on to the project in March 2014 with [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] replacing Eminem.&lt;ref name="deadline1"/&gt; Other casting news was announced in May 2014 with [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], and [[Rachel McAdams]] officially joining the cast.&lt;ref name="deadline2"/&gt; In August of that year, it was announced that [[Naomie Harris]] would be replacing Nyong'o.&lt;ref name="deadline6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/08/naomie-harris-jake-gyllenhaal-southpaw/ |title=Naomie Harris Joins Jake Gyllenhaal In 'Southpaw' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Springbok colours''' is the name given to green and gold blazers awarded to members of the [[South Africa national rugby union team]]. They were historically awarded to teams and individuals representing [[South Africa]] in international competition of any sport, following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name ''Springbok'' was abandoned by the various control boards since they felt that the term had been abused by the previous [[apartheid]] governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement.&lt;ref name=bok /&gt; An exception was made in the case of the national rugby union team, who have retained the practice of awarding colours.

== History ==
The first Springbok colours were created in 1906 during the [[1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour]] of the Northern Hemisphere as none had been provided for them and the captain [[Paul Roos (rugby player)|Paul Roos]] decided that the team need to create their own emblem and nickname to prevent the British press creating one for them. Using the guidelines that the director of the [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB) had given for the playing kit of myrtle green jerseys and a gold collar, Roos instructed that a green blazer with gold [[Piping (sewing)|piping]] and a Springbok emblem on the breast pocket would be made for the team in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/south_africa.html |title=South Africa |publisher=Rugby Football History |date= |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, not many colours were made as they were not standard issue at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/3691122.stm |title=Rare rugby blazer put up for sale |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-26 |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on they became standard issue for all sportsmen representing South Africa internationally but primarily was used by rugby union as the creators.&lt;ref name=rr /&gt;

[[File:1937 span 011.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The South Africa rugby union team wearing Springbok colours in 1937]]
The first dispute over Springbok colours came from the rise of [[rugby league in South Africa]] in the 1950s. SARB felt it was their duty as members of the [[World Rugby|International Rugby Football Board]] to defend amateur rugby union against professional rugby league after several Springboks had defected to rugby league.&lt;ref name=thir /&gt; In 1959, the SARB declared that all players that represented South Africa in rugby union had to sign a declaration they would not turn professional for two years. Any player who refused this was obliged to return his Springbok colours and was not permitted to purchase a replacement.&lt;ref name=thir&gt;Conellisen, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the SARB took the step of copyrighting the Springbok emblem and Springbok colours as a badge under the [[Heraldry Act]]&lt;ref name=cr&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blogs.sun.ac.za/iplaw/files/2011/12/SPORT-AS-A-BRAND-AND-ITS-LEGAL-PROTECTION-IN-SOUTH-AFRICA.pdf |title=Sport as a brand and its legal protection in South Africa |publisher=Stellenbosch University |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pre-empt any other sporting body copyrighting it. The board initially declared, it was happy to share the Springbok colours providing that they were only awarded to white amateur sportspeople representing South Africa internationally.&lt;ref name=sarb&gt;Conellisen, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; It was also an attempt to try and stop the [[South Africa national rugby league team]] from using the colours, though [[South African Rugby League|Rugby League South Africa]] circumvented this by developing their own version of the Springbok colours.&lt;ref name=sarb /&gt; Later legislation in 1971 was passed in order to enforce [[apartheid]] so that only white South Africans could be awarded Springbok colours&lt;ref name=bok&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-187035625.html |title=The time when it was right to ban the Springbok has long passed |work=The Mercury |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}} {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this later extended to those deemed as "[[honorary whites]]".&lt;ref name=Chinese /&gt; This came after three black Africans were awarded Springbok colours for competing in the World Paraplegic Games. Later as a result of the legislation, Glen Popham was not awarded Springbok colours following winning a gold medal in [[Karate]] in the 1969 [[South African Games]] alongside his white team, as his race was officially classified as [[Coloured]] which the [[South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee|South African National Olympic Committee]] were not aware of prior.&lt;ref name=rr&gt;{{cite book | first=Muriel |last=Horell | title =A Survey of Race Relations in South Africa |publisher = University of California Press | edition =   | year = 1972 | isbn = 0869820109 |page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; As non-whites were not eligible to be selected for South African national sports teams, the Springbok colours came to be viewed as a symbol of white supremacy in apartheid South Africa because they were only awarded to white sportspeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Maurice |last=Hommel | title =Conversations and Soliloquies: A Window on South Africa |publisher = iUniverse | edition =   | year = 2012 | isbn = 1462084079 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post apartheid ==
Following the repeal of apartheid legislation, Springbok colours started to be issued to non-whites.&lt;ref name=Chinese&gt;{{cite book | first =Melanie| last =Yap  | title =Colour, Confusion and Concessions: The History of the Chinese in South Africa | publisher = Hong Kong University Press | edition =   | year = 1996 | isbn = 9622094244 | page = 394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, following the election of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the [[African National Congress]], the National Colours Board was set up to control the distribution of Springbok colours.&lt;ref name=cr /&gt; Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours, following the replacement of the Springbok by the [[Protea]] by government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the [[South African Rugby Union]] as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.&lt;ref name=bok /&gt;

In 2008, the South African Sports Minister claimed under the National Sport and Recreation Act, 1998, that the Springbok colours copyright had been transferred to the government and the SARU had been issuing it illegally and requested they cease using it. However, legal writers stated that the South African government's claim had expired in 2007 while SARU's copyright still was valid and pursuant to the case of ''In re: Certification of the Constitution of the RSA 1996'', if the government tried to stop the SARU issuing Springbok colours, then the government would be liable to pay millions of [[South African Rand|Rands]] in compensation.&lt;ref name=cr /&gt; In 2013, as part of their "Yesterday's Heroes" programme, SARU retrospectively awarded Springbok colours to all non-whites who had played for a South African national team such as the black [[SAARB Leopards (rugby team)|SAARB Leopards]] and the Coloured [[Proteas (rugby union)|Proteas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/goolams-long-wait-finally-over-1134437 |title=Goolam's long wait finally over |work=Manchester Evening News |date= |accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Springbok colours are only awarded to South Africans. Australian [[Eddie Jones (rugby union)|Eddie Jones]], who worked as a technical advisor to South Africa for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], was not allowed Springbok colours as a non-South African&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keohane |first=Mark |url=http://www.iol.co.za/sport/thanks-eddie-but-you-dont-get-a-bok-blazer-577774 |title=Thanks Eddie, but you don't get a Bok blazer |publisher=IOL |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was obliged to wear a South Africa tracksuit when pitchside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolford |first=Anthony |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/who-eddie-jones-how-good-10467741 |title=Who is Eddie Jones?

In protest at Jones not being issued with colours, [[Bryan Habana]] gave his to Jones and the team attended the awards dinner in suits instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henson |first=Mike |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/35478033 |title=Eddie Jones: Meet England's new coach for Six Nations 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Galatasaray Arena South-East Corner.jpg|thumb|View of the stadium from the southeast stand corner, June 2017]]

Football (soccer) was first played in Istanbul by some British players in a field known as [[Papazın Çayırı]] ("Priest’s Field") in the area that is now the site of [[Fenerbahçe]]'s [[Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium]]. With the opening of the [[Taksim Stadium]] in 1921, it was this new stadium that became the new football headquarters. In the urban development of 1939, the military barracks in which the Taksim Stadium was located was demolished in 1940. The stadium was thus lost. In this period, Fenerbahçe bought the land encompassing Papazın Çayırı and built the Fenerbahçe Stadium, while the Beşiktaş Club moved into the [[Şeref Stadium]], located in the area where today’s [[Çırağan Palace|Çırağan Palace Hotel]] stands. It was Galatasaray that experienced the biggest problem with the use of a stadium in that period.

The first steps to overcome this problem were taken in the initial years of the 1930s. The first initiative to acquire a plot of land for Galatasaray was in 1933, when the then president of the club Ali Haydar Barşal showed an interest in a mulberry orchard in [[Mecidiyeköy]]. In the period between 1933 and 1935, negotiations with the government resulted in the allocation of a plot of land outside of the city limits in Mecidiye Köyü (Mecidiye Village, present-day Mecidiyeköy quarter of the [[Şişli]] district) for a stadium to be built for Galatasaray. Excavations for the construction began in 1936. The President of the Turkish Sports Organization at the time, Adnan Menderes, provided financial assistance for the project. However, the efforts were left in the excavation stage.

In 1940, the matter of the stadium came up again under the presidency of Tevfik Ali Çınar. The same plot of land was leased to Galatasaray for a term of 30 years at a symbolic yearly rental fee of 1 lira. Galatasaray thus acquired the right to the use of the land. In leasing the land, Galatasaray committed to building a modern stadium as well as a bicycle velodrome. The construction could not start, however, due to limited funds and the general atmosphere of the war years. In 1943, Osman Dardağan led an initiative to build a modest stadium that would answer the immediate need. In the atmosphere of war, only a small open tribune was allowed in the stadium, which was set on a field of earth and inaugurated under the presidency of Muslihittin Peykoğlu in 1945. However, its distance from the city center in those days, its inaccessibility by public transportation, and the rough winds that characterized the district were factors that contributed to a long period in which the stadium would lay idle and football games never took place.

When the [[İnönü Stadium]] in the center of the city was opened in that period, Galatasaray abandoned the stadium building project in Mecidiyeköy, putting the project aside before fruition. In 1955, 30 more years were added to the right of utilization agreement, which at the time had 22 years to go, extending the terms until 2007. When the Club failed to undertake the building of the Stadium, the project was taken on by the Physical Education General Directorate. The construction started in 1959. In 1961, during the presidency of Refik Selimoğlu, a new agreement was signed with the Physical Education General Directorate whereby the utilization rights of the newly completed stadium were explicitly given to Galatasaray.

The stadium was opened on an eventful December 20, 1964. In the midst of the extreme crowds present, panic broke out, resulting in the death of one spectator and the injury of 80 others. In 1965, the stadium was illuminated for the first time. Despite this, however, not many night games were played. At the beginning of the 1970s, the stadium was abandoned for another period during which the İnönü Stadium began to be used again. In the 1970s, the stadium was mostly used by Galatasaray for training sessions. In those years, it remained in a squalid state of neglect.

In 1981, grass was planted on the field and the stadium was opened again. The lighting system was renewed in 1993, after which night games began to be played once more. In the same year, the system of combined tickets was initiated in Turkey at the [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]]. Also in the same year, the stadium was furnished with seats to replace the old benches. The capacity of the stadium was thus reduced from 35,000 to an all-seater capacity of 22,000. In 1997, the Galatasaray administration assigned a Canadian architectural firm for the task of designing Turkey's first multi-function, modern stadium to be built in place of the [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]], which was planned to be torn down.

On 10 December 2013, a [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] match between Galatasaray and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] had to be abandoned due to heavy snow in the 32nd minute with the score 0–0, the remaining minutes of the match were played the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2521580/Galatasarays-game-Juventus-abandoned-extreme-weather.html|title= Galatasaray's crunch clash with Juventus abandoned due to extreme weather|date=10 December 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New stadium projects===

====Faruk Süren project====
The new stadium project was launched in 1998 and it attracted wide interest. During the promotion of the modern loge system, the entire loge section was sold at a symbolical fee. The proposed capacity was 40,484. However, the mayor and the state did not allow of a stadium to be built.

====Mehmet Cansun project====
Over the period of 2001–2002, a revision was made in the project with an eye toward reducing the amount needed for financing but this time, although costs were brought down, the economic crisis of 2001 stood in the way of overcoming the financial issue. Capacity was reduced to 35,000.

====Özhan Canaydın: Back to Süren's project====
In the 2002–04 season, the old project came up again but was abandoned in favor of building a new and modern stadium. Again, financing needs could not be met. After a general renovation that took place in the 2004–05 season, the club returned to the [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]]. Following the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]], the old Open Tribune was demolished and replaced in the 2005–2006 season for safety reasons.

====Özhan Canaydın: Leaving Mecidiyeköy, new home in Aslantepe====
Because Mecidiyeköy was now a part of the city center, state authorities objected to the expansion of the stadium in this district. A new piece of land was suggested to Galatasaray as an alternative.

The search for financing for the new stadium that would be built on this new plot continued over the period of 2004–07. In 2007, discussions with state authorities regarding the erection of a new Galatasaray stadium in Aslantepe yielded positive results. It was decided that the new stadium would be built within two years on the new land plot that would be transferred to Galatasaray, in exchange for the club's property in Mecidiyeköy on which the [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]] stood.

====A dream comes true====
[[File:Galatasaray Arena North-East Corner.jpg|thumb|View of the stadium from the northeast stand corner, June 2017]]
At the end of 2007, ten years after the initial announcement of the project in 1997, the groundbreaking for the new stadium was carried out (December 13, 2007) at a ceremony attended by state officials. The old project was put aside and a new project was contracted to Mete Arat in Germany.
2008, In Galatasaray’s last year at the [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]], the Lower Closed Tribune was renovated in line with UEFA standards.
2009, The construction of the new stadium, the Türk Telekom Stadium, gained speed when the contracting company was changed.
2010, It was announced that the official opening of the new stadium would take place on January 15, 2011, with Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] presiding. But in the opening ceremony, he was protested by spectators of Galatasaray.

== Aslantepe ==
[[File:Ali Sami Yen Spor Kompleksi Türk Telekom Arena6.jpg|thumb|300px|Exterior view]]
In recent years, numerous proposals had been put forward to demolish the current stadium and build a new, larger one on the same location, but this was impossible due to the lack of space. Finally, the club's stadium, [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]], was now going to be replaced with a new stadium near [[Maslak]] financial district. The former name of the district, ''Seyrantepe'', was changed to ''Aslantepe'' (Lion Hill) after [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]] purchased the land; ''Aslan'' ("Lion") being Galatasaray's symbol. The idea was to realize a stadium on the model of [[Arena AufSchalke]] in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The stadium will feature a world-class retractable roof—the first of its kind in Turkey. The design team headed by 'asp' Architekten Stuttgart combines the engineering expertise of the renowned firms Obermeyer Planen+Beraten (Munich), Schlaich – Bergermann and Partner (Stuttgart) and Yüksel Proje (Ankara).

=== Auction process ===
Galatasaray have been in cooperation with TOKİ (one of the biggest construction organizations of Turkey, budgeted by the Turkish government).

Among the four companies that tendered proposals, the best offer was put forward by the Eren Talu Architecture – ALKE Partnership. The contract for the tender held for the construction of Galatasaray's new stadium was signed between TOKİ and Eren Talu-ALKE consortium on 23 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galatasaray.org/english/detail.asp?PID=1160&amp;HID=2&amp;haberID=301015] {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The contract of the tender was realized by TOKİ and came to be known as the "Aslantepe Tender", covering the construction of a multi-purpose sports complex with 52,652 spectator capacity on Aslantepe (formerly known as Seyrantepe) premises in return for building "Urban Social Infrastructure Areas" on 34.640 sq meters of land on which the present Ali Sami Yen Stadium is located.

There is a set period of 720 days for the construction of the stadium that will be built on the Aslantepe (formerly known as Seyrantepe) premises. The box count is 198 Part of the catering areas Turk Telekom Stadium consists of, is a VIP lounge room, VIP Market Area, Premium Food Court, Galatasaray Museum, Galatasaray Mega Store, 11 Galatasaray Store and a VIP restaurant. The modern stadium, contains five top and four underground levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turktelekomarena.com.tr/stad-bilgileri |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104060207/http://www.turktelekomarena.com.tr/stad-bilgileri |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnership ===
Once the Eren Talu-ALKE consortium had won the tender for the stadium project, they proceeded to find a foreign technical partner with previous experience in sports-construction related projects. They were introduced to the Abu Dhabi Group and Al Zarooni Group, both headquartered in the UAE. Abu Dhabi Group (also known as Dhabi Group), the largest foreign investor group in Pakistan, and the Al Zarooni Group are investors in the gigantic 5.5 million sq.m. [[Dubai Sports City]] project that is currently under construction in Dubai. The Chairman of Abu Dhabi Group is His Highness [[Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan]], who is also the Federal Minister for Higher Education &amp; Scientific Research of the UAE and a very important member of Abu Dhabi's Ruling Family. The Dhabi-Zarooni consortium acquired 51% of the Eren Talu-ALKE consortium’s shares to co-invest a total of $650 million with them in the Aslantepe (New Stadium) and [[Mecidiyeköy]] (Old Stadium) projects. 
 
Stating that a total amount of $650 million will be invested for the entire project, Eren Talu said, "$170 million of this amount will be spent for the stadium, in addition to $180 million which is the guaranteed TOKİ share, a $50 million additional TOKİ share and the remaining $250 million+ to be invested in the [[mixed-use development]] project intended in Mecidiyeköy". Talu added that TOKİ's participation in the project provides great advantage for the partnership and continued, “our partners had confidence in the public benefit of the project and decided to join within a short period of just 2 months". Talu said they have already spent $37 million so far in order to construct up to the current level of the stadium. Stating that the stadium is to be delivered on time on 29 October 2010, Talu said, “We are casting 1,500 cubic meters of [[concrete]] every day. We have driven 4,500 meters of piles into the ground. A labour force of above 350 workers is busy at the construction site 24 hours a day. The stadium is going to be so strong that it may even be used as a catastrophe relief center if required."

Talu said the project being contemplated on the land in Mecidiyeköy in lieu of the old Ali Sami Yen Stadium will be initiated in June 2009, and added, “the mixed-use development project that we are going to build on land measuring 34,600 square meters will include apartments, a large shopping center, offices and a five-star hotel. A total of $650 million will be invested in these two projects, and in return, we expect an income of about $1.3 billion when the Mecidiyeköy mixed-use complex is completed. Therefore, this is a highly profitable venture."

The total stadium construction is expected to cost around US$191 million, not including the US$145+ million which will be spend on upgrading the nearby infrastructure.

The construction of the stadium stopped twice a time. When Talu had financial problems once again, TOKİ cancelled the process in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/spor/futbol/11987786.asp |title=TOKÄ° Seyrantepe Projesi'ni iptal etti – Futbol Haberleri |website=Hurriyet.com.tr |date=2009-02-07 |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After termination of TOKİ-Talu agreement, TOKİ announced a new auction. Varyap-Uzunlar consortium won the auction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emlakkulisi.com/22375_varyap-uzunlar_seyrantepe_de_one_cikti_ |title=Varyap-Uzunlar Seyrantepe'de öne çıktı! |website=Emlakkulisi.Com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction restarted in September 2009. Galatasaray and TOKİ had an agreement that the stadium would be opened without retractable roofs which will be installed at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;Dilek Taş, [http://www.sabah.com.tr/Ekonomi/2010/07/23/seyrantepenin_catisini_galatasaray_kapatacak "Seyrantepe'nin çatısını Galatasaray kapatacak"], ''[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'', 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundbreaking ceremony===
[[File:Türk Telekom Arena yapım aşaması.JPG|thumb|300px|Site preparation (March 2006)]]
As of 13 December 2007, the construction has officially started after a glitzy reception where the club's board, some players, the minister of sports for [[Turkey]] and many other ministers attended. In the ceremony, then President [[Özhan Canaydın]] stated, in summary: "The Turkish World of Sports will gain another big facility with the Ali Sami Yen Sports Complex and we've gathered here to celebrate its groundbreaking ceremony. This work, which will be a value add to Istanbul and Turkey along with Turkish Sports, will also serve as an honorable monument that will signify the advanced position Turkish Sports has achieved and the phases it has passed through."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galatasaray.org/english/detail.asp?PID=1160&amp;HID=1&amp;haberID=302796] {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The [[naming rights]] were sold to [[Türk Telekom]] for a period of 10 years for US$10.25 million a year. The stadium has officially replaced the [[Ali Sami Yen Stadium]] at the middle of the 2010–2011 [[Süper Lig]] season, under the name of '''Türk Telekom Arena'''.

==History==
Originally manufactured in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], the Pro Staff line was Wilson's answer to the Prince Graphite, Yonex Rex series, and the [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] Max 200G. The original graphite Pro Staff was 110 square inches; the 85, 95, and 125 sizes were developed from it. [[Pete Sampras]], who used the racquet for his entire professional career, established the reputation of the Pro Staff 85 (graphite/Kevlar) as a legendary racquet more than any other player. Other first-rate players who have used the Pro Staff 85 Kevlar during their professional careers include [[Jimmy Connors]], [[Jim Courier]], [[Stefan Edberg]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Roger Federer]], and [[Mary Pierce]].

The first Pro Staff was the high-end [[Jack Kramer]] standard wooden model. It was stiffer than the extremely popular [[Jack Kramer]] Autograph model and favored by professional players for that reason. This racquet established the "Pro Staff" branding as being Wilson's finest product. However, as Wilson transitioned away from wood, steel, and aluminum, the company's first graphite models were not given this name.

Instead, early Wilson models were the 1980 Ultra, the 1981 Javelin, the 1982 Sting, and the graphite/boron Ultra II. As with the earlier Sting and Ultra II, the first graphite/Kevlar Pro Staff model was a "large head" 110 square-inch oversize. The Pro Staff design combined the braided construction of the earlier Ultra line with the most of the shape of the Sting (that was produced without a throat bar). The Pro Staff models also were of medium stiffness, again reflecting a design philosophy that blended the Ultra II, which was very stiff, and the Sting, which was flexible. Contrary to popular belief, the stiffer and heavier Ultra II, not a member of the Pro Staff line, was Wilson's most expensive racquet until the 1987 Profile debuted.

Wilson produced many lesser-known models with the Pro Staff mold, including the [[Jack Kramer]] Pro Staff 85 (80% graphite and 20% fiberglass), the Matrix, the Graphite Cruncher, the Graphite Aggressor, the Ceramic, and several others. These variants were less stiff than the well-known graphite/Kevlar model. [[Chris Evert]] used the Jack Kramer model to reach the final of the 1984 [[French Open]] where she was defeated in straight sets by [[Martina Navratilova]], who was using the [[Yonex]] R-27, a graphite/boron design similar to the Ultra II. She defeated Navratilova in 1985 with the graphite/Kevlar Pro Staff 85. Navratilova, meanwhile, had switched back to the less stiff R-22, a graphite/fiberglass model.

==Naming Issue==
The name "ProStaff Original 6.0" is not what the racquet was known by for many years. Only for later productions did Wilson add "6.0" to the paint job. In fact, there is nothing "original" about this model, as it is not the first Wilson graphite racquet by any means, and the 110 square inch model was the original in the line, not the longer-lived 85 square inch variant. A similarly misapplied "original" refers to the very famous Prince Graphite oversize. In the case of the Prince, the name is more apt, but even that racquet went through a number of major revisions, including the addition of grommets and a change of hoop shape.

The "Original" in the ProStaff name is likely due to the multitude of Wilson releases using the ProStaff title.  Wilson has arguably overused the ProStaff brand to the point of watering down its prestige. The first composite version associated with Tour success will always date back to the composite racquet used by the first ProStaff-using number one ranked tennis professionals, Chris Evert &amp; Stefan Edberg. Theirs were the first composite ProStaff and thus, the "Original" (composite) ProStaff.

==Specifications==
While the Pro Staff Original was a true midsize racket at 85 square inches in head size, it is however significantly smaller, heavier and thinner than almost all modern pro-level rackets, which tend to range around 95+ square inches in head size and 21+ mm in beam, and down toward the lower 300s in weight in grams for men and high 200s for women.

The Pro Staff 6.0 version was manufactured in four head sizes: 85, 95, 110, and 125 square inches. The 85 is unforgiving for the currently popular semi-western topspin style with its 12.6 [[ounce]] (357 g)  weight and low power. The 95 is more forgiving of off-center shots with an overall weight of 12.2 ounces (346 g) and a lower [[swingweight]] (317 as opposed to the 85's 326). However, it has a higher flexibility, particularly in the upper hoop, due to its larger head size, which has been described as undesirably "whippy". Both have a 16x18 string pattern making the frame more open and easier to generate spin albeit the user must generate much of the spin's power with timing and wrist pronation. The Prostaff 6.0 also performs admirably well with flatter hitters (as evidenced by the success of Pete Sampras, Chris Evert, and Mary Pierce) as a result of its considerable heft and control. A flat hitting power-oriented game will therefore benefit considerably from the inherent control and stability of the frame. The small headsize of the 85 and Perimeter Weighting System also minimize the torque on off-centre hits, further enhancing control at impact.

Of particular interest is the frame composition of 80% graphite and 20% kevlar. The high percentage of graphite allows for a 'softer' feel, while the kevlar provides more strength in the frame. Also unique is that the graphite in the Pro Staff Original is braided. While more modern racquets consist of many pieces of graphite spliced to the framework of the racquet, the braided graphite construction of the Pro Staff Original was such that only a single, long piece of graphite is used, which is then 'braided' around the frame. This created more strength and stability in the racquet, while increasing the weight of the frame.

==Pete Sampras==

While many top professionals receive custom-designed frames which differ from the stock version, Pete Sampras used production frames from the St Vincent factory, which he chose for their slightly greater stiffness. However, the handles were custom-built and lead was also added during balancing and weight work by his personal stringer, bringing the mass of the racket to just under 400g. Sampras used natural gut, the norm for top professionals at that time, but the frames were strung at around 75&amp;nbsp;lb tension, well above the frame's stock recommended range of 50-60&amp;nbsp;lb. Sampras also had all frames re-strung daily during tournaments, whether used or not - a consistency which, along with his choice of just one racket model and those from just one factory, illustrate his preference for his rackets to be as familiar, and therefore as predictable, as possible.

Only upon returning to play exhibition, World Team Tennis and Senior Tour matches post retirement from the ATP, did Sampras switch rackets (to a similar model as that used by Roger Federer at the time) before Wilson produced a new model especially for Sampras, the K Pro Staff 88.

==Successor==
Wilson has since produced numerous Pro Staff models, including some based closely on the design of the Original. The "descendants" of the Pro Staff 6.0 usually bear the moniker 6.1 in the frame title and have incorporated larger head sizes (90–95 sq in) and more modern graphite composites in their manufacturing, including the production of curved beam rackets instead of the traditional box beam design used in the original Pro Staffs. Most professionals using these rackets choose the {{convert|95|sqin|adj=on}} head size, with the notable exception of Roger Federer. In recent years, Wilson has phased out the box beam for a more modern curved beam on most of the 6.1 rackets with the exception of the Tour/90 model, which retained the box beam design. However, in 2012 Wilson rereleased the box beam design by separating the 6.1 rackets into two categories, 6.1 ProStaff (which retained the box beam design), and 6.1 (which kept the curved beam design). They further clarified the division in 2014, removing the "6.1" label and releasing the ProStaff as a stand-alone racket series.

In the 1990s, Wilson produced a range of lighter Pro Staff models called "Pro Staff Classic Lite." They featured larger head sizes (95 and 110 sq in) and a more flexible frame than either the 6.0 or the 6.1. The series produced [[Steffi Graf]]'s racquets of choice in the 1990s as she signed an endorsement deal with Wilson in 1994 after having played with Dunlop since the beginning of her career. Graf first played with the 7.0 model, then switched to the 7.5 model in 1996 and finally to the 7.1 model in 1998, which she played until her retirement the following year. She used 95 square inch frames for all three models.

Wilson produced the throwback [K]Pro Staff 88 &lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, a Pete Sampras signature model, produced for Sampras post-retirement and which he has used in the Senior Tour and other events since its introduction. This model retained the thin 17&amp;nbsp;mm beam throughout its length but has increased weight from 12.6 oz (357.20 g) to 12.8 oz (362.87 g) strung, is slightly less head-light (six points rather than eight), with an {{convert|88|sqin|adj=on}} head size, up from 85 in the Pro Staff Original (the Pro Staff 6.0 was produced in a number of sizes) and with 19 rather than 18 crosses in the string pattern (retaining the 16 mains). The material composition utilized nanotechnology to bond new molecules that fill spaces between the racket's graphite fibers (branded [K]arophite Black) to the graphite itself, rather than the unbonded fill used in Wilson's prior N-Code racket series. Most published reviews of this racket feel that the heavy weight and relatively small head size are ill suited to modern stroke production techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Reviews/PSRF85/PSRF85Review.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tennisnerd.net/gear/racquets/wilson-pro-staff-rf-85/5524&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Wilson reintroduced the Prostaff line with their Amplifeel series of rackets. Among the new rackets were 3 "Pro Staff" branded models: a 90, 95, and 100 square inch headsize. There has been a noticeable difference in swing-weight in these rackets, with the 90 having a 327 swing-weight, the 95 having a 306 swing-weight, and the 100 having a 304 swing-weight. The more modern Pro Staffs have also a reduction in weight; the 95 and 100 boast 11.5 and 11.3 oz strung weight, respectively. In comparison, the original Pro Staffs were very heavy, at 12+ oz.

The frames of the latest 2014 Pro Staff models feature graduated lines at 3 and 9 o'clock, prompting players to customize the rather low stock racquet weight with lead tapes.

Federer has since switched to a larger, 97 sq inch headsize racket for the 2014 season, and such the ProStaff line is expecting a major update in the design of the racket. Federer's new Prostaff removes the box beam in favor of a modern, angular beam. However, Wilson claims the same production and materials have been used in this racket line, blending the iconic Prostaff's graphite and kevlar blend with a modern design process. The new line of Prostaff is expected to be released fall 2014.

==Rerelease==
Wilson reintroduced the ProStaff Original 6.0 85 in May 2011 via an exclusive arrangement with Tennis Warehouse in the USA. The main differences on the new release are:

1. The gold BLX butt cap in place of the original white &amp; red butt cap.  
2. Stiffness RA rating lowered from the original stiffer 67 to a flexier 62 as listed on Tennis Warehouse web site.

The ProStaff Original 6.0 85 maintains a large enough following to continue as one of their best selling racquets as of December 2013.

==Significance==
Besides being used by many pros and club players in its heyday, the Pro Staff Original continues to have a cult-like following. The racket has brought on many variations such as the 6.1 models and the ROK models, both of which are still favoured in the tennis world. The St. Vincent factory products, used by Sampras to the exclusion of all other versions, has become the collector's choice of preference. Since the St. Vincent factory closed down, demand for the iconic St. Vincent Pro Staff Original continues to raise its value.
