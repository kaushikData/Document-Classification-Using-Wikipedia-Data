'''Anglo-Indian Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Anglo-Indian]] heritage. Many Anglo-Indian Canadians have roots in the [[Republic of India|Indian Subcontinent]]. Some of the earlier generations of Indians have [[Indian British]] heritage.

==History==
Indians from the subcontinent have migrated overseas to many countries such as South Africa, Great Britain, Oceania, Caribbean, North America, and South East Asia due to political conflicts, economic opportunities, education and search of a better life. Indian migration to Canada recently is due to economic opportunities as well as education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workpermit.com/news/2006_11_14/canada/india_china_immigration_shift.htm|title=India challenges China as top immigration source to Canada|publisher=Workpermit.com|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Igbo sentiment''' refers to the existence of hostility against [[Igbo people]], or their [[Igbo culture|culture]].

==Pre-Civil War sentiments==
During the beginning years of [[Nigeria]]'s colonial independence, the Igbo people increasingly were perceived as a disproportionately-favored ethnic group with affluence and multi-regionalistic opportunity because the Igbo had been employed within the [[colonial Nigeria]] by the colonial authorities and in the public sector in regions throughout the country. This aroused the ire of others toward the Igbo.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/africabeyond/africanarts/19292.shtml|title=Remembering Biafra|work=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916153404/http://www.bbc.co.uk/africabeyond/africanarts/19292.shtml|archivedate=September 16, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was emphasized by the short-lived government of General [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], whose military junta consisted mostly of Igbo and who abolished the federated regions; this led to his assassination in a counter-coup led primarily by [[Hausa people|Hausa]]/[[Fula people|Fulani]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] participants. It was followed by the massacre of thousands of Igbo in [[Pogrom|pogroms]] in the two aforementioned regions, which drove millions of Igbos to their homeland in [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]; ethnic relations deteriorated rapidly, and a separate republic of [[Biafra]] was declared in 1967, leading to the [[Biafran War]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Anti-Igbo Pogrom==
{{main|1966 anti-Igbo pogrom}}

The '''1966 anti-Igbo pogrom''' was a series of massacres directed at [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and other people of southern Nigerian origin living in northern [[Nigeria]] starting in May 1966 and reaching a peak after 29 September 1966.&lt;ref name=Abbott-2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Charles|last2=Anthony|first2=Douglas A.|title=Poison and Medicine: Ethnicity, Power, and Violence in a Nigerian City, 1966-86|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|date=2003|volume=36|issue=1|pages=133–136|doi=10.2307/3559324|registration=yes|jstor=3559324}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period 30,000-50,000 Igbo civilians were murdered throughout northern Nigeria by [[Hausa–Fulani]] soldiers and civilians who sought revenge for the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état]], carried out by six Majors and three Captains, and resulted in the deaths of 11 Nigerian politicians and army officers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/features/80138&lt;/ref&gt; These events led to the secession of the eastern Nigerian region and the declaration of the Republic of [[Biafra]], which ultimately led to the [[Nigeria-Biafra war]].&lt;ref name=Abbott-2003 /&gt; The 1966 massacres of southern Nigerians have been described as a [[holocaust]] by some authors&lt;ref name="Greene -1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|title=The Struggle for Secession 1966-70: A Personal Account of the Nigerian Civil War by N.

==Biafran War==
{{main|Nigerian Civil War}}

The [[Republic of Biafra]], was a secessionist state in eastern Nigeria that existed from 30 May 1967 to January 1970. It took its name from the [[Bight of Biafra]], the Atlantic bay to its south. The inhabitants were mostly the Igbo people who led the secession due to economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria. Other ethnic groups that constituted the republic were the [[Efik people|Efik]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], [[Annang people|Annang]], [[Ekoi people|Ejagham]], [[Eket]], [[Ibeno]] and the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18574">{{Arab culture}}
'''Arabic weddings''' ({{Lang-ar|زفاف}}, {{Lang|ar|فرح}}, or {{Lang|ar|عرس}}) have changed greatly in the past 100 years. Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day [[Bedouin]] weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same country. it must be mentioned that what some people today call "Bedouin" wedding is in fact the original true traditional Arab Islamic wedding without foreign influence.

The marriage process usually starts with meetings between the couple's families, and ends with the wedding's consummation (''leilat al-dokhla'').  For a wedding to be considered Islamic, the bride and groom must both consent, and the groom is welcomed into the bride's house—although only in the presence of her parents to maintain purity between both sides.

Given the diversity of [[Arab people]], most are Muslim and some Christian and other faiths. The most common events that are held in the Muslim marriage include variations of the following: marriage proposal, engagement, henna, ''nikah'', registration, reception, ''walima'', and honeymoon. The only Islamic requirement is to hold the ''nikah'' and ''walima''. Other events are cultural additions and registration is usually a legal requirement.&lt;ref name="Perfect Muslim Wedding"&gt;[http://www.perfectmuslimwedding.com/10-muslim-wedding-events-from-proposal-to-honeymoon/ Muslim Weddings], PerfectMuslimWedding.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arranged marriages==
[[Image:Frederick Goodall RA - Passionate encounter.jpg|thumb|upright|Arab couple (&lt;small&gt;Passionate Encounter&lt;/small&gt;)]]
[[Arranged marriages]] still happen in the [[Arab world]]. The traditions of conservative Arab society and [[Islam]] forbid couples to have sex or socialize before marriage (however forced marriages are against Islamic teachings). Therefore, when it is time for a young man to get married, his family will look around to identify a number of potential brides.&lt;ref&gt;Marriage Customs of the World. Hutchinson, pg 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Arranged marriage is a tradition of [[Arab nations]] of [[West Asia]] and [[North Africa]], but with the difference that between 17% to majority of all marriages in these countries are also consanguineous marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, M. M. (2012). The practice of consanguineous marriage in Oman: prevalence, trends and determinants. Journal of biosocial science, 44(5), 571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hussain, R. (2005). The effect of religious, cultural and social identity on population genetic structure among Muslims in Pakistan. Annals of Human Biology, 32(2), 145-153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saadat, M., Ansari-Lari, M., &amp; Farhud, D. D. (2004), Short Report Consanguineous marriage in Iran, Annals of human biology, 31(2), pages 263-269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khoury, S. A., &amp; Massad, D. (1992). Consanguineous marriage in Jordan, American Journal of Medical Genetics, 43(5), pages 769-775&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saudi Arabia]], majority (65%+) of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous arranged marriages. More than 40% of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous in [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Kuwait]], [[UAE]], [[Oman]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]] and [[Mauritania]]; and over 1 in 5 marriages in [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Bittles A. [http://www.consang.net The global prevalence of consanguinity]; access date: September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Among these Arab people, arranged marriages include endogamous and non-consanguineous marriages, and therefore exceed the above observed rates of endogamous and consanguineous marriages. [[Arab Christians]]&lt;ref&gt;Patai, Raphael (Winter, 1965). The structure of endogamous unilineal descent groups, Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, Vol. 21, No. 4, pages 325-350&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Coptic Christians]] in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Somervill, Barbara 2007 page 41-43"&gt;Somervill, Barbara (2007). Teens in Egypt. Capstone; {{ISBN|978-0756532949}}; page 41-43, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage was a central feature of traditional Aboriginal societies. Freedom of marriage was restricted to ensure children were produced according to the correct family groups and affiliations and avoid marriages with certain close relatives or marriages with any one outside the group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/12.%20Aboriginal%20Marriages%20and%20Family%20Structures/marriage-traditional-aboriginal-societie|title=Marriage in Traditional Aboriginal Societies|last=|first=|date=2016|website=ALRC|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, opinions vary on whether the [[phenomenon]] should be seen as exclusively based on Islamic practices as a 1992 study among Arabs in Jordan did not show significant differences between [[Arab Christians|Christian Arabs]] or [[Arab Muslims|Muslim Arabs]] when comparing the occurrence of [[consanguinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.as.wvu.edu/~kgarbutt/QuantGen/Gen535Papers2/Inbreeding.htm "The pattern was also independent of religious beliefs as both Christians and Muslims showed similar results."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the process of investigation takes into consideration the girls' physical beauty, her behavior, her cleanliness, her education and finally her qualities as a housewife.&lt;ref&gt;Arab wedding Customs, Muhammad Dhul Salaim, pg 74&lt;/ref&gt; In carrying out this traditional investigation parents also take the behaviour of the prospective bride's family into account.

The first meeting usually takes place between the bride, groom, and their respective mothers. They meet, usually in a public place or in the bride's house, and get to know each other. The bride, groom, and their chaperones will typically sit separately, but within sight of each other, in order to get to know each other. Nowadays, the man might suggest to his family who he would like them to consider, and it may be that the man and the woman already know each other. It is also nowadays common in urban families for a bride and the groom to agree to marry before the groom approaches the bride's family for their permission.

== Tulba ==
[[Image:Wearing of engagement ring.JPG|thumb|widthpx|Wear engagement ring during wedding ceremony in Tunisia]]
''Tulba'' ({{Lang-ar|طولبة}}) is basically a formal request of hand. The event is more private, limited to the relatives of the bride and groom. This occurs after both families have agreed to the couple's decision to jail. In "Tulpa", the groom, along with his family members, asks the bride, with her family for her part, to her hand in marriage. Families then formally recognize that the couple will be married.

==Engagement==
Engagements ({{Lang-ar|خطوبة}}) '{{transl|ar|khetbah}}' in Saudi as well as in earlier Arabic and Islamic jurisprudence [[fiqh]]. However, it is called {{lang|ar|خطوبة}} '{{transl|ar|khutubah}}' in Egypt and the Levant) in the Arab world are usually much like a simpler wedding party or a dinner for the families, the bride wears any dress she pleases and there is no ''[[zaffah]]'' procession. Usually, the bride and groom dress in matching colors. They exchange rings, putting the rings on each other's right-hand [[ring finger]] they are very common

== Radwa ==
This event usually occurs one or two days before the wedding day. It is a small gathering of close male relatives on both sides of the bride and groom, usually in the home of the bride's family. In this exchange, the men on the groom's side make sure that the bride's family is satisfied with the party. Male family members on the groom side also make sure to resolve any last minute issues before the wedding. After all, the eldest man on the side of the groom congratulates all the male relatives on both sides.

==Henna night (Ghomrah)==
[[File:Takfout a special ancient tradition performed during wedding ceremonies in the region of Tafilate (Tilwine).jpg|thumb|left|Takfout, a special ancient henna tradition, performed during wedding ceremonies in the region of Tafilate (Tilwine)]]
[[File:An Arab bride a basic, hand-tied rose bouquet, on her hands henna (cropped).jpg|thumb|An Arab bride a basic, hand-tied rose bouquet, on her hands henna]]
In Old Palestine, the henna night was a night used to prepare all the necessary wedding decorations and last minute arrangements. It was also a chance for the families to celebrate together before the wedding. The groom's family would ''sahij'' or dance through the streets of the village until reaching the house of the bride. Once there, the family would mix henna together, which would then be used to decorate the bride and grooms hands (with the groom's being merely the initials of his bride and himself), and then offer the bride her mahr (usually gold as it does not decline in value like other wealth). The families would then dance and sing traditional [[Palestinian music]].

In modern times, particularly those not living in Palestine, the henna night remains traditional in customs, but is very similar to a [[bachelorette party]]; the bride's female friends and relatives join her in celebrating, which includes food, drinks, and a lot of dancing. A women's group plays Arabic music,  sometimes Islamic music, while everyone dances. A woman draws henna or [[mehndi]], a temporary form of skin decoration using [[henna]], on the bride and guests' skin — usually the palms and feet, where the henna color will be darkest because the skin contains higher levels of [[keratin]] there, which binds temporarily to [[lawsone]], the colorant of henna.
[[Image:Djerba Henné et Harkous.JPG|thumb|left|widthpx|Henna decorations from [[Djerba]], Tunisia]]
The men will also have a party, in which the groom's family and friends will dance to traditional Palestinian music. In some village customs, the groom's face is shaven by a close family member or friend in preparation for his wedding. The tradition of giving the bride her gold is also still used. The groom will enter where the bride is, they well both get their henna done, and the groom will then offer the bride her mahr. Thus, the wedding being merely dancing and celebration.

An important element of the henna night in both traditional and non-traditional henna parties, is the dress adorned by the Palestinian women and the groom. The women dress in traditional (usually hand embroidered) gowns, known as Palestinian ithyab. The brides thobe would be extravagant and exquistely embroidered. The groom will wear the usual traditional Arab men's [[thobe]] and hata (head covering).

The henna wedding tradition has remained popular with Jewish descendants of predominantly Moslem countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/style/bride-wedding-jewish-yemen.html?action=click&amp;module=Editors%20Picks&amp;pgtype=Homepage|title=For Jewish Israelis of Yemenite Heritage, Reviving a Past|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/jewish-and/embracing-a-jewish-henna-wedding-tradition/|title=Embracing A Jewish Henna Wedding Tradition {{!}} My Jewish Learning|date=2015-10-07|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sahrah==
In some areas (e. g. Palestine) also the male friends and relatives celebrate an evening party (''sahra'' in Arabic {{lang|ar|سهرة}}) in the garden or on the street in front of the groom's house. Music and dance groups perform and the men dance with the groom. Women are not allowed and may view the program via video projection inside the house or the closed off garden. In strict Islamic families this is the only way to allow males from outside the family to attend the wedding.

==Wedding reception/party==
Weddings usually include a ''[[zaffa]]'', a procession that loudly announces the couple's wedding. The ''zaffa'' differs from region to region. In Egypt, for example, the Dumiyati ''zaffa'' is popular in the north. In the Levant, the traditional ''[[dabkeh]]'' is popular. Other versions of the ''zaffa'' can be found in North Africa and the Arabian peninsula as well as the ''[[Khaleeji culture|khaliji]]''; the ''zaffa'' even reached Malaysia with the first Arab traders, called the [[Zapin]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Urban weddings===
[[Image:La Nagafa et les époux.JPG|thumb|widthpx|Moroccan wedding]]
After the ''zaffa'' / ''zefaf'', the bride and the groom (this is mostly in Egypt) sit on a dais, or ''kosha'' ({{Lang|ar|كوشة}}), which usually consists of two comfortable seats in front of the guests, from which the bride and groom reign as though [[king]] and [[Queen regnant|queen]]. As soon as the bride and groom are seated in the ''kosha'', a ''sharbat'' drink is passed to the guests, and all drink to their health.

The bride and groom then switch rings from their right hand to the left index. This is probably an old Christian tradition,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} but it is done whether the couple is [[Muslim]] or [[Christian]]. With this ritual, the festivities begin. The bride and groom have the first dance, after which the other wedding guests join in. Usually a belly dancer or a singer entertains the guests, but more luxurious weddings will have more than one entertainer. Guests will dance and sing with the newlywed couple, and the groom will sometimes be tossed in the air by friends. In modern weddings, after the formal entertainment, a [[disc jockey]] will extend the festivities.

Next comes the cutting of the cake. As is done elsewhere in the world, the bride and groom cut the cake, which is several layers high. The bride then tosses her bouquet behind her back to other hopeful women. By tradition, whomever catches the bouquet is seen as lucky, because she is foretold to be the next to marry. Next, the couple opens the buffet for the guests, which is usually a wide variety of salads, meats, stews, sweets, fruits, and other [[Arab cuisine]] dishes. Food is considered one of the factors that reflect the wealth of the families of the bride and groom. 
[[Image:Pâtisseries marocaines.JPG|thumb|left|widthpx|Pastries at a Moroccan wedding]]
After the guests have eaten, many of the guests, particularly those who are not close family or friends of the couple will leave after congratulating the couple. In some weddings, there may be more entertainment including a DJ, dancing and sometimes a singer or a band which continue until very late in the night. The bride and groom then usually receive a complimentary stay of a night or two at the hotel where the wedding was held.

In a strict Muslim families, men may not dance with women or even watch women in unmodest dresses. So only the female guests and children enter the hall together with the wedding couple. Also photographers and other personnel must be women, the DJ, if male, has to operate behind a closed door. Men wait outside in a separate room or garden.  At the end of the party women cover their shoulders and male family members may enter the hall. Family by family visit the couple to offer congratulations and money presents. At the end they may dance together.

Modern [[Urban culture|urban]] weddings are influenced by Western traditions—for example, the cutting of the cake and tossing of the bouquet. This is not the case with rural areas or for example most parts of Saudi Arabia where they still do the original traditional Arab Islamic wedding style. In rural areas of countries like Egypt, after the ''zaffa'', the wedding ceremony will usually take place in a big clearing, where a huge Arabic tent called a ''sewan'' ({{Lang|ar|صوان}}) has been set up. The entertainment includes a belly dancer or singer, sometimes both. Drinks are passed to guests, and food is served on huge plates. The customary food is ''fattah, pieces of lamb meat embedded in rice and bread dipped in stew. The [[bride]] and [[Bridegroom|groom]] will leave the wedding early, but the guests continue the festivities.

{{See also|Muslim wedding}}

===Reading of the Fatiha===
[[Image:Interior del Museo de Etnografía de Tetuán 05.jpg|thumb|widthpx|An [[Jebala people|Arab Jebala]] wedding costume]]
In Egypt and Parts of Palestine and Jordan, the bride's family hosts a reception in their home, where the groom formally asks for the bride's hand in marriage from her father or the eldest man in the family. After the father agrees, the families read the [[Fatiha]] (the first ''[[sura]]'' in the [[Quran]]) and serve ''[[sharbat]]'', a sweet cordial prepared from flowers or fruit (usually in [[Egypt]]) or [[Arabic coffee]] (usually in the [[Levant]]).

===Marriage contract===
The marriage contract, called ''Aqd Nikah'', ''Aqd Qiran'', ''Aqd Zawaj'', ''Katb el-Kitab'', is the focus of the official marriage ceremony. It starts with a ''[[sheikh]]'' or ''[[imam]]'' giving a short speech about how the Prophet honored his wives, how to honor women, and how women should treat their husbands and honor them. Then the ''imam'' tells the groom to heed the speech that was just given, and the father (or eldest male of the bride's family) accepts the proposal. The ceremony resembles the reading of the Fatiha, but this when the legal documents are filled out and then filed. Two witnesses, usually the eldest men in each family, sign their names to the marriage contract, and the couple is now officially married.

In the [[Levant]], this event is usually held in the house of the either the bride or the groom's family, or sometimes in the wedding hall itself, in a mosque, or in court if the couple decide to do so.

==Christian practices==

The large minority of [[Arab Christians]], who mainly live in the [[Levant]] region and in Egypt, belong mainly to [[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox Christian]] Churches and they use ancient symbolic rituals in their marriages.

'''''Aujourd'hui''''' ({{IPA-fr|oʒuʁdɥi|lang}}, ''Today'') was a [[daily newspaper]] which styled itself as "independent" and which was created in August 1940 by [[Henri Jeanson]], to replace ''[[le Canard enchaîné]]'' under agreement with the Germans.
 
The first issue appeared on 10 September, 1940.  In November 1940, the German authorities pressured the director into taking a public position against the [[Jew]]s and in favour of politics of collaboration with the [[Vichy regime]]. Jeanson resigned, and was succeeded by the [[journalist]] [[Georges Suarez]]. 

''Aujourd'hui'' was far from innocent in its pursuit of those responsible for the 1940 defeat of France, resorting to the myth of the "clean sweep of the broom" in its notorious [[Anglophobia]].  It began to reflect the narrative of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] and of German [[propaganda]].  The paper was in favour of the [[Riom trials]] which were set up to punish the members of the pre-war government who were allegedly responsible for France's defeat in 1940.

[[Georges Suarez]] was shot in 1944.

'''Bulgarians in Lithuania''' refers to ethnic Bulgarians living in [[Lithuania]]. It is a very small minority; according to the 2001 Census, only 171 people identified themselves as Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/population.html ArmenianDiaspora website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511084353/http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/population.html |date=May 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number has decreased since 1989, when [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet 1989 census]] identified 237 [[Bulgarians]] in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=8|title=Демоскоп Weekly - Приложение.

The Bulgarians live mainly in [[Vilnius]] (75) and [[Klaipėda]] (30).

In 1999 ethnic Bulgarians in Lithuania established their community ''Madara''.

The '''Constantian Society''' was a political group in the [[United States]] devoted to promoting the system of [[constitutional monarchy]] as a superior form of government. It was founded in 1970. The official publication of the Constantian Society was ''The Constantian; Journal of the Constantian Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Constantian Society - Newsletter About Monarchy | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NR&amp;d_origin=transcripts&amp;z=NR&amp;p_theme=nr&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F5837EA34EA53DE&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=Morning Edition via NPR Transcripts |publisher= |date=January 9, 1991 |accessdate=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randall J. Dicks (1951 &amp;ndash; 1999) was the founder of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas, Jr.  |last=Ferrick  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Less Than Regally, Monarchists Convene |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB295CC948A85A5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM   |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher= |date=July 18, 1983 |page=A01|accessdate=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Georgetown University]] student Dicks was chosen to ask a question of President [[Richard Nixon]], and in commenting to reporters on the President's reply said that "monarchy was the superior form of government."  Nixon's aides had been unaware of Dicks' political beliefs.&lt;ref name="nixonland"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nixonland: the rise of a president and the fracturing of America | first=Rick | last=Perlstein | page=428 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dM_enWzoghoC&amp;pg=PA428&amp;lpg=PA428&amp;dq=monarchists+randall+dicks+-site:put.com&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6dxgl8mJzt&amp;sig=9TeGgJ1A7esTamSHCAsmfkGdKvE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iwwVTs2NAdCRgQfmtZAI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn=0-7432-4302-1 | year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the society participated in a [[Funeral Mass|Mass]] for the repose of the souls of [[Louis XVI]], [[Marie Antoinette]] and other victims of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="steinfels"&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Steinfels |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Let Louis XVI Rest in Peace; A Funeral Mass in Manhattan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/world/let-louis-xvi-rest-in-peace-a-funeral-mass-in-manhattan.html |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=July 17, 1989 |accessdate=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poles]] come from different [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[tribe]]s living on territories belonging later to Poland in the early [[Middle Ages]] (see: [[Prehistory of Poland (until 966)|Prehistory of Poland]]). 
{{TOC right}}

== Kingdom of Poland (966–1569) ==
Around the year 1000, the population of Polish lands is estimated at about 1,000,000&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; to 1,250,000.&lt;ref name="historica"/&gt; Around 1370 Poland had 2 million inhabitants with a population density of 8.6 per square kilometre.&lt;ref name=cam727/&gt; Poland was less affected by the [[Black Death]] than [[western Europe]].&lt;ref name=cam727/&gt;

Although the population of the [[History of Poland (966–1385)|Kingdom of Poland in late Middle Ages]] consisted mostly of [[Poles]], influx of other cultures was significant: particularly notable were [[Jewish]] and [[Germans|German]] settlers, who often formed significant minorities or even majorities in urban centers. Sporadically migrants from other places like [[Scotland]], [[Netherlands]] settled in Poland as well. At that time other notable minorities included various incompletely assimilated people from other [[Slavic tribes]] (some of whom would eventually merge totally into the Polish people, while others merged into neighboring nations).

Around 1490, the combined population of Poland and Lithuania, in a [[personal union]] (the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]) since the [[Union of Krewo]] a century before, is estimated at about 8 million.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; An estimate for 1493 gives the combined population of Poland and Lithuania at 7.5 million, breaking them down by ethnicity at 3.25 million [[Poles]], 3.75 million [[Ruthenians]] and 0.5 million [[Lithuanians]].&lt;ref name="Pogonowski1"/&gt; The Ruthenians composed most of the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: this is the reason that the late [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|GDL]] is often called a Slavic country, alongside [[Poland]], [[Russia]] etc. In time, the adjective "Lithuanian" came to denote a Slav of the Grand Duchy.&lt;ref name="burzub4"/&gt; 

Eventually the Lithuanian speakers came to be known as [[Samogitia]]ns (see also [[Samogitian nobility]]), after the province in which they were the dominant majority.&lt;ref name=burzub4/&gt; Another estimate for the combined population at the beginning of the 16th century gives 7.5 million, roughly split evenly, due to much larger territory of the Grand Duchy (with about 10-15 people per square km in Poland and 3-5 people per square km in the Grand Duchy, and even less in the south-east Cossack borderlands).&lt;ref name=cam727/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; By 1500, about 15% of Poland's population lived in urban centers (settlements with over 500 people).&lt;ref name="bid_jef"/&gt;

[[File:Population density per voivodeships in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1790 1.PNG|thumb|Population density per voivodeships in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1790]]

== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795) ==
By 1600, about 25% of Poland's population lived in urban centers (settlements with over 500 people).&lt;ref name=bid_jef/&gt; Major towns in Poland included: [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig) (70,000), [[Kraków]] (28,000), [[Warsaw]] (20,000-30,000), [[Poznań]] (20,000), [[Lwów]] (Lviv) (20,000), [[Elbląg]] (Elbing) (15,000), [[Toruń]] (Thorn) (12,000), [[Sandomierz]] (4,000-5,000), [[Kazimierz Dolny]] (4,000-5,000) and [[Gniezno]] (4,000-5,000).&lt;ref name=bid_jef/&gt;

The population of the Commonwealth of both nations was never overwhelmingly either [[Roman Catholic]] or Polish. This resulted from Poland's possession of [[Ukraine]] and federation with Lithuania; in both these countries ethnic Poles were a distinct minority. The Commonwealth comprised primarily three nations: [[Poles]], [[Lithuanians]], and [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] (the latter two usually referred to together as [[Ruthenians]]). Shortly after the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569), at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, the Commonwealth population was around 7 million, with a rough breakdown of 4.5m Poles, 0.75m Lithuanians, 0.7m Jews and 2m Ruthenians.&lt;ref name="Ftazee"/&gt; In 1618, after the [[Truce of Deulino]] the Commonwealth population increased together with its territory, reaching 12 millions that could be roughly divided into: Poles - 4.5m, Ukrainians - 3.5m, Belarusians - 1.5m, Lithuanians - 0.75m, Prussians - 0.75m, Jews - 0.5m, Livionians - 0.5m; at that time nobility formed 10% and [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], 15%.&lt;ref name="Pogonowski"/&gt; Population losses of 1648-1667 are estimated at 4m.&lt;ref name="Pogonowski"/&gt; Coupled with further population and territorial losses, by 1717 the Commonwealth population had fallen to 9m: roughly 4.5m Poles, 1.5m Ukrainians, 1.2m Belarusians, 0.8m Lithuanians, 0.5m Jews, 0.5m others&lt;ref name="Pogonowski"/&gt; The urban population was hit hard, falling to below 10%.&lt;ref name="bid_jef2"/&gt;

To be ''Polish'', in the non-Polish lands of the Commonwealth, was then much less an index of [[ethnicity]] than of religion and [[Hierarchy|rank]]; it was a designation largely reserved for the [[landed noble class]] (szlachta), which included Poles but also many members of non-Polish origin who [[Religious conversion|converted to Catholicism]] in increasing numbers with each following generation. For the non-Polish [[nobility|noble]] such conversion meant a final step of [[Polonization]] that followed the adoption of the [[Polish language]] and [[Polish culture|culture]].&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; Poland, as the culturally most advanced part of the Commonwealth, with the royal court, the capital, the largest cities, the second-oldest university in Central Europe (after [[Prague]]), and the more liberal and democratic [[social institutions]] has proven an irresistible magnet for the non-Polish nobility in the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Gella"/&gt;

As a result, in the eastern territories a Polish (or Polonized) aristocracy dominated a peasantry whose great majority was neither Polish nor Roman Catholic. Moreover, the decades of peace brought huge [[colonization]] efforts to [[Ukraine]], heightening the tensions among [[nobility|nobles]], [[Jew]]s, [[Cossack]]s (traditionally Orthodox), Polish and Ruthenian peasants. The latter, deprived of their native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, turned for protection to [[cossack]]s that facilitated violence that in the end broke the Commonwealth. The tensions were aggravated by conflicts between [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] following the [[Union of Brest]], overall discrimination of Orthodox religions by dominant Catholicism,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; and several [[Cossack]] uprisings. In the west and north, many cities had sizable [[German people|German]] minorities, often belonging to [[Reformed churches]]. The Commonwealth had also one of the largest [[Jewish diaspora]]s in the world.

Until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the ''szlachta'' were mostly [[Catholic]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]]. However, many families quickly adopted the [[Reformed]] religion. After the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the [[Roman Catholic Church]] regained power in Poland, the ''szlachta'' became almost exclusively Roman Catholic, despite the fact that [[Roman Catholicism]] was not a majority religion (the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches counted approximately 40% of the population each, while the remaining 20% were [[Jew]]s and members of various [[Protestant]] churches).&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; The [[Counter-Reformation]] in Poland, influenced by the Commonwealth tradition of [[religious tolerance]], was based mostly on [[Jesuit]] [[propaganda]], and was very peaceful when compared to excesses such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] elsewhere in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Bosmajian2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Haig A. Bosmajian|title=Burning Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkAXPuObVBUC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2208-1|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BideleuxJeffries2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Bideleux|author2=Ian Jeffries|title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdGEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=10 April 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-71984-6|pages=150–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the first  statistical estimates of Commonwealth population appeared. [[Aleksander Busching]] estimated the number of Commonwealth population for 8,5 millions; [[Józef Wybicki]] in 1777 for 5,391,364; [[Stanisław Staszic]] in 1785 for 6 millions; and [[Fryderyk Moszyński]] in 1789 for 7,354,620.&lt;ref name="stat"/&gt; Modern estimates tend to be higher; by 1770, on the eve of the [[partitions of Poland|partitions]], Commonwealth had a population of about 11m&lt;ref name="bid_jef3"/&gt;-14m,&lt;ref name="davies132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2001-96"/&gt; about 10% of that - Jewish.&lt;ref name=bid_jef3/&gt; The nobility constituted about 10%, the burghers, about 7-8%.&lt;ref name=bid_jef3/&gt;

== Partitions (1795–1918) ==
By the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition]] in 1772, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211 000&amp;nbsp;km² (30% of its territory, amounting at that time to about 733 000&amp;nbsp;km²),&lt;ref name=Davies394&gt;{{cite book| first=Norman |last=Davies |title=God's Playground.

The Origins to 1795 |volume=I |edition=revised | page=394 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-925339-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a population of over four to five million people (about a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions).&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2001-96"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jerzy Lukowski|author2=W. H.

After the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]], Commonwealth lost about 307 000&amp;nbsp;km², being reduced to 223 000&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=Davies394/&gt; Only about 4 million people remained in Poland at that time, which makes for a loss of another third of its original population, about a half of the remaining.&lt;ref name="lz"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jerzy Lukowski|author2=W. H. Zawadzki|title=A Concise History of Poland: Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpMxTvBuWHYC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=8 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55917-1|pages=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]], overall, Austria had gained about 18 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (130,000&amp;nbsp;km²) and about 32 percent of the population (3.85 million people).&lt;ref name="Wandycz"/&gt; Prussia had gained about 20 percent of the former Commonwealth territory  149,000&amp;nbsp;km²) and about 23 percent of the population (2.6 million people).&lt;ref name="Wandycz"/&gt; Russia had gained about 62 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (462,000&amp;nbsp;km²) and about 45 percent of the population (3.5 million people).&lt;ref name="Wandycz"/&gt;

An estimate for 1815 gives 11 million Poles, out of which 5m were under Russian control (4 million in [[Congress Poland]] and 1 million in the territories incorporated into the Russian Empire), 3.5m in the Prussian partition territories and 3m in the Austrian partition territories.&lt;ref name="Pogonowski2"/&gt;

[[Congress Poland]] had a population of about 4.25 million around 1830.&lt;ref name="Luk2"/&gt; In the Russian partition, the [[Pale of Settlement]] resulted in resettlement of many [[Russian Jews]] to the western fringes of [[Russian Empire]], which now included [[Congress Poland|part of Poland]]. This further increased the sizable community of [[Polish Jews]]. By 1914, about 31 million people inhabited the territories that would become the [[Second Polish Republic]], the [[First World War]] saw the population of those territories drop to 26 million.&lt;ref name=davies132/&gt;

== Second Polish Republic and World War II (1918–1945) ==
Before World War II, the Polish lands were noted for the variety of their ethnic communities. Following the [[Polish–Soviet War|Polish-Soviet War]], a large part of its population belonged to national minorities. The census of that year allocates 30.8% of the population in the minority.&lt;ref name="MJ"/&gt; In 1931, the population of Poland was 31,916,000, including 15,428,000 males and 16,488,000 females. By January 1939, the population of Poland increased to 35,100,000. This total included 240,000 in [[Zaolzie]] which was under Polish control from October 1938 until August 1939.&lt;ref name="polex"/&gt; The population density was 90 persons per square km. In 1921, 24% of the population lived in towns and cities, by 1931 the ratio grew to 27%. Altogether, in 1921, there were 611 towns and cities in the country, by 1931 there were 636 municipalities. The six biggest cities of Poland (as for January 1, 1939) were [[Warsaw]], [[Łódź]], [[Lwów]], [[Poznań]], [[Kraków]] and [[Vilnius]] (Wilno). In 1931, Poland had the second largest [[Jew]]ish population in the world, and one-fifth of all Jews resided within Poland's borders (approx. 3,136,000, roughly 10% of the entire Polish population).&lt;ref name="MJ"/&gt;

According to historian [[Norman Davies]] the [[Polish census of 1931]]  listed the nationalities by language as Polish, 69% of the population, Ukrainian, 15%, Jews 8.5%, Belarusian, 4.70%, German, 2.2%, Russian 0.25%, Lithuanian, 0.25%, Czech 0.09%,&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]], Gods Playground Vol 2,  p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Norman Davies]] included the [[Rusyn language|Ruthenians]] with the Ukrainians however the Polish census figures list them as separate group with 3.82% of the population. The classification of the ethnic groups in Poland during the [[Second Polish Republic]] is a disputed topic, [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] maintains that the 1931 Polish census "involved questionable methodology, especially the use of mother tongue as an indicator of nationality", noting that it had underestimated the number of non-Poles. The official figures for nationality from the 1931 Polish census based on the mother tongue put the percentage of ethnic Poles at 68.9%, Jews 8.6% and other minority groups 22.5%., Piotrowski cited a study by the Polish historian Jerzy Tomaszewski that puts that the adjusted census figures(taking religious affiliation into account) of ethnic Poles at 64.7%, Jews 9.8% and other minority groups 25.5% of Poland's population.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Piotrowski  ''Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide in the Second Republic, 1918-1947'' McFarland &amp; Company, 1997 {{ISBN|0786403713}} page 294&lt;/ref&gt; Polish demographer Piotr Eberhardt maintains that it is commonly agreed that the criterion of declared language to classify ethnic groups led to an overestimation of the number of Poles in pre-war Poland. He notes that in general, the numbers declaring a particular language do not mesh with the numbers declaring the corresponding nationality. Members of ethnic minority groups believe that the language criterion led to an overestimation of Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Eberhardt, Ethnic Groups and Population Changes in Twentieth-Century Central-Eastern Europe: History, Data, Analysis M.E. Sharpe, 2002{{ISBN|0-7656-0665-8}} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southeast, Ukrainian settlements were present in the regions east of [[Chełm]] and in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] east of [[Nowy Sącz]]. The three main native higlander populations were [[Lemko|Łemko]]wie, [[Bojko]]wie and [[Hucul]]i. In all the towns and cities there were large concentrations of [[Yiddish]]-speaking Jews. The Polish ethnographic area stretched eastward: in eastern [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and western [[Ukraine]], all of which had a mixed population, Poles predominated not only in the cities but also in numerous rural districts. There were significant Polish minorities in [[Daugavpils]] (in [[Latvia]]), [[Minsk]] (in Belarus), [[Bucovina]] (in [[Romania]]), and [[Kiev]] (in Ukraine) (see [[Polish minority in the Soviet Union]], [[Polish Autonomous District]]).

In the beginning of the war (September 1939) the territory of Poland was divided between the [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[USSR]]. By late-1941 following [[Operation Barbarossa]] Nazi Germany controlled the entire territory of the former [[Second Polish Republic]], but in 1944-1945 the [[Red Army]]'s offensive claimed the region for the USSR.

After both occupiers divided the territory of Poland between themselves, they conducted a series of actions aimed at [[Polish culture during World War II|suppression of Polish culture]] and [[World War II crimes in Poland|repression of much of the Polish people]]. In August 2009 the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead (including Polish Jews) at between 5.47 and 5.67 million (due to German actions) and 150,000 (due to Soviet), or around 5.62 and 5.82 million total.&lt;ref name="Tomasz Szarota 1945"/&gt; About 90% of [[Polish Jews]] were killed during the [[Holocaust]]; many others emigrated in the succeeding years.

'''1. Population 1939''' -Polish sources allocate the population by the [[First language|primary language]] spoken, not by religion. Most Jews spoke [[Yiddish]], however included with the Poles are about 200,000 Polish speaking Jews who are classified with the Polish group. Included with the Poles are 1,300,000 [[Eastern Orthodox]] &amp; [[Greek Catholic]] adherents who are sometimes classified with the Ukrainian and Belarusian groups.&lt;ref name="population"/&gt;

'''2. Natural Increase October 1939-December 1945''' -After the war Polish demographers calculated the estimated  natural population growth that occurred during the war.&lt;ref name="population4"/&gt;

'''3. Transfer of German Population''' Most of the ethnic German population fled during the war. In 1950 only about 40,000 of the pre-war ethnic German group remained in Poland in 1950, most of whom emigrated later in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="wysiedlenie"/&gt;

'''4. War Dead''' In August 2009 the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) put the figure of Poland's dead at between 5,620,000 and 5,820,000. The IPN's figures include 3 million Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust (200,000 included with Polish speakers); as well as 150,000 victims of Soviet repression. The figures also include [[Poles]] killed in 1943-44 during the [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia]]&lt;ref name="remembrance5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thenews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PQ"/&gt;

'''Deaths Due to German Occupation'''&lt;br&gt;
'''Poles'''-The [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) figure for deaths of Poles due the German occupation is 2,770,000. This figure includes "Direct War Losses" -543,000; "Murdered in Camps and in Pacification" -506,000; "Deaths in prisons and Camps" 1,146,000; "Deaths outside of prisons and Camps" 473,000; "Murdered in Eastern Regions" 100,000; "Deaths in other countries" 2,000. These figures include about 200,000 Polish speaking Jews who are considered Poles in Polish sources.&lt;ref name="remembrance6"/&gt;

'''Jews-'''Polish researchers have determined that the Nazis murdered 1,860,000 Polish Jews in the extermination camps in Poland, plus another 1.0 million Polish Jewish deaths in prisons and ghettos. In addition 970,000 Jews from other nations were murdered in the Nazi extermination camps in Poland.&lt;ref name="remembrance7"/&gt;

Included in the Polish figures of war dead are 2.0 million Polish citizens in the  [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]&lt;ref name="Kersten"/&gt; Contemporary Russian sources also include these losses with Soviet war deaths.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;

'''Deaths Due to Soviet Occupation'''

The Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were murdered due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation.&lt;ref name="remembrance8"/&gt; [[Andrzej Paczkowski]] puts the number of Polish deaths at 90–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="repression"/&gt;

'''5. [[Polish minority in the Soviet Union|Population Remaining in the USSR]]''' The number of Poles and Jews who remained in the USSR after the war was estimated at about 1.4 million by Polish scholar and historian Krystyna Kersten. Included with the Poles remaining in the USSR are about 700,000 [[Eastern Orthodox]] &amp; [[Greek Catholic]] adherents who are sometimes classified with the Ukrainian and Belarusian groups.&lt;ref name="Kersten"/&gt;

'''6. Emigration to the West''' Poles and Jews who remained in non communist countries after the war.

'''7. Population gain [[Recovered Territories]]''' Germans remaining in Poland after the war in the [[Recovered Territories]].  This group included 1,130,000 bi-lingual Polish-German persons who declared their allegiance to Poland. Also remaining in 1950 were 94,000 German nationals, 36,000 Germans from pre-war Danzig and 1,500 ethnic Germans of other nations. Most of this group emigrated to Germany after 1956.  The ethnic German population remaining in the 1990s was about 300,000.&lt;ref name="wysiedlenie9"/&gt;

'''8. Reimmigration 1946-50''' Poles resident in western Europe before the war, primarily in Germany and France, who returned to Poland after the war.&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

'''9. Natural Increase 1946-1950''' This is the official Polish government data for births and [[Death by natural causes|natural deaths]] from January 1946 until the census of December 1950.&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

'''10. Population December 1950 Per Census''' The total population per the December 1950 census was 25 million. A breakdown by ethnic group was not given. However, we can estimate the Jewish population based on the postwar census taken by the Jewish community.Data for the Germans and others who remained in Poland after the war can be estimated using the 1946 Polish census&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

==Post-Second World War (1945–present)==

===Early post-war period===
Before [[World War II]], a third of Poland's population was composed of [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]. After the war, however, Poland's minorities were mostly gone, due to the 1945 [[revision of borders of Poland (1945)|revision of borders]], and the [[Holocaust]]. Under the [[National Repatriation Office]] (''Państwowy Urząd Repatriacyjny''), millions of Poles were [[expulsion of Poles after World War II|forced to leave their homes]] in the eastern [[Kresy]] region and settle in the western [[Recovered Territories|former German territories]]. At the same time approximately 5 million remaining Germans (about 8 million had already fled or had been expelled and about 1 million had been killed in 1944-46) were similarly [[expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] from those territories into the Allied occupation zones. [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarus]]ian minorities found themselves now mostly within the borders of the Soviet Union; those who opposed this new policy (like the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] in the [[Bieszczady Mountains]] region) were suppressed by the end of 1947 in the [[Operation Vistula]].

The population of [[Jew]]s in Poland, which formed the largest Jewish community in pre-war Europe at about 3.3 million people, was all but destroyed by 1945. Approximately 3 million Jews died of starvation in [[ghetto]]s and [[labor camp]]s, were slaughtered at the German [[Nazi extermination camp]]s or by the [[Einsatzgruppen]] death squads. Between 40,000 and 100,000 Polish Jews survived the Holocaust in Poland, and another 50,000 to 170,000 were repatriated from the Soviet Union, and 20,000 to 40,000 from Germany and other countries. At its postwar peak, there were 180,000 to 240,000 Jews in Poland, settled mostly in Warsaw, [[Łódź]], [[Kraków]] and [[Wrocław]].&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

According to the national census, which took place on February 14, 1946, population of Poland was 23 930 000, out of which 32% lived in cities and towns, and 68% lived in the countryside. The 1950 census (December 3, 1950) showed the population rise to 25 008 000, and the 1960 census (December 6, 1960) placed the population of Poland at 29 776 000.&lt;ref name="statistical"/&gt; In 1950, Warsaw was the biggest city of the country, with population of 804 000. Second was Lodz (pop. 620 000), third Kraków (pop. 344 000), fourth Poznan (pop. 321 000), and fifth Wroclaw (pop. 309 000).

Females were in the majority in the country. In 1931, there were 105.6 women for 100 men. In 1946, the difference grew to 118.5/100, but in subsequent years, number of males grew, and in 1960, the ratio was 106.7/100.

===Current situation===
[[File:Poland-demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Poland, Data of [[FAO]], 1961-2010 ; Number of inhabitants in millions.]]
{{details|Demographics of Poland}}
Most [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|Germans were expelled from Poland]] and the annexed east German territories at the end of the war, while many [[Ukrainians]], Rusyns and [[Belarusians]] lived in territories incorporated into the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Small Ukrainian, Belarusian, [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] minorities reside along the borders, and a German minority is concentrated near the southwestern city of [[Opole]] and in Masuria. Groups of Ukrainians and Polish Ruthenians also live in western Poland, where they were forcefully resettled by communists.

As a result of the migrations and the Soviet Unions radically altered borders under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], the population of Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world. Virtually all people in Poland claim Polish nationality, with [[Polish language|Polish]] as their native tongue. Ukrainians resp. Rusyns, the largest minority group, are scattered in various northern districts. Lesser numbers of Belarusians and Lithuanians live in areas adjoining Belarus and Lithuania. The Jewish community, almost entirely Polonized, has been greatly reduced. In [[Silesia]] a significant segment of the population, of mixed Polish and German ancestry, tends to declare itself as Polish or German according to political circumstances. Minorities of Germans remain in Pomerania, Silesia, East Prussia, and [[Lubus]].

Small populations of Polish [[Tatars]] still exist. Some Polish towns, mainly in northeastern Poland have [[mosque]]s. Tatars arrived as [[mercenary]] soldiers beginning in the late 14th century. The Tatar population reached approximately 100,000 in 1630 but is less than 500 in 2000. See also [[Islam in Poland]].&lt;ref name="MSWIA"/&gt;

[[21st century economic migration of Poles|A recent large migration]] of Poles took place following Poland's accession to the [[European Union]] and opening of the EU's labor market; with an approximate number of 2 million primarily young Poles taking up jobs abroad.&lt;ref name=onet&gt;http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/swiat/sueddeutsche-zeitung-polska-przezywa-najwieksza-fale-emigracji-od-100-lat/yrtt0"Sueddeutsche Zeitung": Polska przeżywa największą falę emigracji od 100 lat&lt;/ref&gt;

( In 1938 the birth rate was 2.45%, [[Death by natural causes|natural deaths]] 1.4%.

The '''Duna–Pogaya languages''' are a proposed small [[language family|family]] of [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] in the classification of Voorhoeve (1975) and [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Ross]] (2005). However, connections between the two languages, [[Duna language|Duna]] and [[Bogaya language|Bogaya]], are tenuous, and proposed connections to the larger [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] family are not convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|boga1247|Bogaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Durave''' or '''Durava'''  are Southern coastal [[Caste system in Sri Lanka|Sinhalese caste]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. Many believes that they are descendants of the ancient [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nagas]], of royalty and aristocracy, of soldiers and elephanteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sunday Observer |date=2 September 2001 |url=http://www.infolanka.com/org/srilanka/cult/54.htm |title=The Durava: Toddy tappers or royalty? |first=Asiff |last=Hussein |accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
They were converted to Catholic religion soon after arrival of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonials in 1505 ACE. Using this opportunity they have upgraded themselves in relation to the dominant [[Govigama]] caste.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

They along with other southern Sinhalese castes such as [[Karave]]  and [[Salagama]] have played an important role in the historically left political and right parties. They are mostly [[Theravada]] Buddhists today and were instrumental in the revival of Buddhism during the British colonial period. The un-Buddhistic practice of caste discrimination introduced into the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] by the [[Siyam Nikaya]] in the late 18th century has been overcome by patronising the [[Amarapura Nikaya]] and the [[Ramanna Nikaya]]s. Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) was the last nongovigama monk to receive upasampada before the 1764 [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddhism in Sinhalese Society, 1750-1900: A Study of Religious Revival and Change |first=Kitsiri |last=Malalgoda |page=91 |isbn=978-0-52002-873-9 |publisher=University of California Press |url=http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520028739 |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Materialism''' is a personal attitude which attaches importance to acquiring and consuming material [[Good (economics)|goods]]. 

The use of the term materialistic tends to describe a person's personality or a society tends to have a negative or critical connotation. Also called acquisitiveness, it is often associated with a [[value system]] which regards [[social status]] as being determined by [[affluence]] (see [[conspicuous consumption]]), as well as the belief that possessions can provide happiness. [[Environmentalism]] can be considered a competing orientation to materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Green Is My Value: Exploring the Relationship Between Environmentalism and Materialism|first1=Bobby|last1=Banerjee|first2=Kim|last2=McKeage|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=21|date=1994|pages=147–152|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/7575/volumes/v21/NA-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413081416/http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/7575/volumes/v21/NA-21|archivedate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materialism can be considered a pragmatic form of [[enlightened self-interest]] based on a prudent understanding of the character of [[market-oriented economy]] and society. 

==Definition==
Consumer research typically looks at materialism in two ways: one as a collection of personality traits;&lt;ref name=Belk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belk|first=Russell W.|date=1985|title=Materialism: Trait aspects of living in the material world|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=12|pages=265–280|url=http://www.hh.umu.se/kursweb/ht08/2fe045mom1/index.php?download=Belk_Materialism.pdf|doi=10.1086/208515}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other as an enduring belief or value.&lt;ref name="Richins+Dawson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richins|first1=Marsha L.|last2=Dawson|first2=S.|date=1992|title=A consumer values orientation for materialism and its measurement: Scale development and validation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=19|pages=303–316|doi=10.1086/209304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materialism as a personality trait ===
[[Russell W. Belk]] conceptualizes materialism to include three original personality traits.&lt;ref name=Belk/&gt;
* ''Nongenerosity'' – an unwillingness to give or share possession with others.
* ''Envy'' – desire for other people's possessions.
* ''Possessiveness'' – concern about loss of possessions and a desire for the greater control of ownership.

=== Materialism as a value ===
Acquisition centrality is when acquiring material possession functions as a central life goal with the belief that possessions are the key to happiness and that success can be judged by a person's material wealth and the quality and price of material goods she or he can buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richins|first1=Marsha L.|date=1994|title=Valuing things: The public and the private meanings of possessions|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=21|pages=504–521|doi=10.1086/209414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing materialism in the western world==
In the western world, there is a growing trend of increasing materialism in reaction to discontent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/out-the-darkness/201203/the-madness-materialism|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223205307/https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/out-the-darkness/201203/the-madness-materialism|archivedate=23 December 2015|title=The Madness of Materialism: Why are we so driven to accumulate possessions and wealth?|first=Steve|last=Taylor|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in the United States shows that recent generations are focusing more on money, image, and fame than ever before, especially since the generations of [[Baby Boomers]] and [[Generation X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twenge|first1=Jean M.|last2=Campbell|first2=W. Keith|last3=Freeman|first3=Elise C.|date=2012|title=Generational differences in young adults' life goals, concern for others, and civic orientation 1966-2009|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=102|issue=5|pages=1045–1062|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-102-5-1045.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331032715/http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-102-5-1045.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2016|doi=10.1037/a0027408|pmid=22390226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one survey of Americans, over 7% said they would murder someone for $3&amp;nbsp;million and 65% of respondents said they would spend a year on a deserted island to earn $1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanner|first=Bernice|date=2001|title=Are You Normal about Money?|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Bloomberg Press|isbn=9781576600870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by the [[University of California]] and the [[American Council on Education]] on 250,000 new college students found that their main reason for attending college was to gain material wealth. From the 1970s to the late 1990s, the percentage of students who stated that their main reason for going to college was to develop a meaningful life philosophy dropped from more than 80% to about 40%, while the purpose of obtaining financial gain rose from about 40% to more than 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=David G.|author-link=David Myers (academic)|date=2000|title=The funds, friends, and faith of happy people|journal=American Psychologist|volume=55|issue=1|pages=56–67|url=http://www.davidmyers.org/davidmyers/assets/Funds.friends.faith.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409100406/http://www.davidmyers.org/davidmyers/assets/Funds.friends.faith.pdf|archivedate=9 April 2016|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materialism and happiness==
A series of studies have observed a correlation between materialism and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Scientific American|title=Can money buy happiness?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-money-buy-happiness|date=August 10, 2010|first=Sonja|last=Lyubomirsky|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810214534/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-money-buy-happiness|archivedate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/materialism-system-eats-us-from-inside-out|title=Materialism: a system that eats us from the inside out|first=George|last=Mobiot|author-link=George Monbiot|date=10 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310134607/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/materialism-system-eats-us-from-inside-out|archivedate=10 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in the United States have found that an increase in material wealth and goods in the country has had little to no effect on the well-being and happiness of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=Robert H.|date=1999|title=Luxury fever: When money fails to satisfy in an era of excess|location=New York|publisher= Free Press|isbn=0-7432-2340-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Easterlin|first=Richard A.|date=1995|url=http://ipidumn.pbworks.com/f/EasterlinIncomesandHappiness.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064722/http://ipidumn.pbworks.com/f/EasterlinIncomesandHappiness.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|title=Will raising the incomes of all increase the happiness of all?|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization|volume=27|pages=35–47|doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibor Scitovsky]] called this a "joyless economy" in which people endlessly pursue comforts to the detriments of pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scitovsky|first=Tibor|author-link=Tibor Scitovsky|date=1976|title=The joyless economy: The psychology of human satisfaction|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using two measures of subjective well-being, one study found that materialism was negatively related to happiness, meaning that people who tended to be more materialistic were also less happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Russell W.|last=Belk|date=1984|title=Three scales to measure constructs related to materialism: reliability, validity, and relationships to measure of happiness|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=11|pages=291–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people derive a lot of pleasure from buying things and believe that acquiring material possessions are important life goals, they tend to have lower [[life satisfaction]] scores.&lt;ref name="Richins+Dawson"/&gt; Materialism also positively correlates with more serious psychological issues like depression, [[narcissism]] and paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasser|first1=Tim|author-link1=Tim Kasser|last2=Ryan|first2=Richard M.|date=1993|title=A dark side of the American dream: Correlates of financial success as a central life aspiration|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=22|pages=280–287|url=https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/1993_KasserRyan_DarkSide.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425054051/http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/1993_KasserRyan_DarkSide.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the relationship between materialism and happiness is more complex. The direction of the relationship can go both ways. Individual materialism can cause diminished well-being or lower levels of well-being can cause people to be more materialistic in an effort to get external gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Boven|first1=Leaf|last2=Gilovich|first2=Tom|title=The social costs of materialism|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=9|issue=2|date=June 2005|pages=132–142|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, research shows that purchases made with the intention of acquiring life experiences such as going on a family vacation make people happier than purchases made to acquire material possessions such as an expensive car. Even just thinking about experiential purchases makes people happier than thinking about material ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Boven|first=Leaf|date=2005|title=Experientialism, materialism, and the pursuit of happiness|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=9|issue=2|pages=132–142|url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~vanboven/research/publications/vanboven_rgp_2005.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520134124/http://psych.colorado.edu/~vanboven/research/publications/vanboven_rgp_2005.pdf|archivedate=20 May 2016|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and Economic Growth==
[[Image:Religion economy.png|thumb|550px|The average annual income of countries correlates negatively [[Importance of religion by country|with national levels of religiosity]].&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web|last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062403/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Studies suggests there is a channel from religious behaviours to macroeconomic outcomes of economic growth, crime rates and institutional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=People's opium? Religion and economic attitudes |journal=Journal of Monetary Economics |date=1 January 2003 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=225–282 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3932(02)00202-7 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393202002027 |language=en |issn=0304-3932|last1=Guiso |first1=Luigi |last2=Sapienza |first2=Paola |last3=Zingales |first3=Luigi |citeseerx=10.1.1.194.9800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars hypothesise religion impacts economic outcomes through religious doctrines promoting thrift, work ethic, honesty and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barro |first1=Robert J. |last2=McCleary |first2=Rachel M. |title=Religion and Economic Growth across Countries |journal=American Sociological Review |date=2003 |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=760–781 |doi=10.2307/1519761 |jstor=1519761|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3708464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
The correlation between religion and economic outcomes can be interpreted in two ways: (1) a feature intrinsic to religion which affects growth or (2) a feature correlated to religion but not religion itself which affects growth. Existing cross-country literature is criticised for inability to distinguish between the two explanations, a problem termed [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogenity bias]]. Controlling for country [[fixed effects]] mitigates bias but more recent studies utilise field and natural experiments to identify the causal effect of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iyer |first1=Sriya |title=The New Economics of Religion |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |date=June 2016 |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=395–441 |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/255321/cwpe1544.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and Individual Behaviour==
Research highlights the importance of [[Orthodoxy|religious orthodoxy]] on moral behaviours and versions of the [[Golden Rule]] “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you” comprise most major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Batson |first1=Charles Daniel |last2=Schoenrade |first2=Patricia |last3=Ventis |first3=W. Larry |title=Religion and the Individual: A Social-Psychological Perspective |date=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195062083 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=L58jAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=batson+1993+religion+and+morality&amp;dq=batson+1993+religion+and+morality |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue it promotes cooperation and trust within culturally defined groups or clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iannaccone |first1=Laurence R. |title=Introduction to the Economics of Religion |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |date=1998 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=1465–1495 |jstor=2564806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies compare the complementary effects of religious values such as charity, forgiveness, honesty and tolerance and religious social groups where membership instils favouritism or discrimination towards in or outgroup members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cooperation and the in-group-out-group bias: A field test on Israeli kibbutz members and city residents |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization |date=1 June 2006 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=147–163 |doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2004.07.007 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268105001046 |language=en |issn=0167-2681|last1=Ruffle |first1=Bradley J. |last2=Sosis |first2=Richard |citeseerx=10.1.1.740.7036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Believing===
The believing channel of religion behaviours concerns costly effort concerned with divine reputation. Azzi and Ehrenberg (1975) propose individuals allocate time and money to secular and religious institutions to maximise utility in this life and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azzi |first1=Corry |last2=Ehrenberg |first2=Ronald |title=Household Allocation of Time and Church Attendance |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 1975 |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=27–56 |doi=10.1086/260305 |language=en |issn=0022-3808|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/articles/633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonisation of religious minds by the morally concerned supernatural or “Big Gods”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norenzayan |first1=Ara |title=Big Gods: How Religion Transformed Cooperation and Conflict |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1400848324 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2VMtfYiQCXEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+gods#v=onepage&amp;q=big%20gods&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; diffused behaviours derived from moral instruction.

===Belonging===
As Iannaconne (1998) argues "religious behavior is anything but an individual matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iannaccone |first1=Laurence R. |title=Introduction to the Economics of Religion |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |date=1998 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=1465–1495 |jstor=2564806}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belonging approach to religion considers the social notion of between and within religious groups. Iannaconne (1998) assigns religion as a `club good' from a [[rational choice]] perspective where costly rituals exclude [[Free-rider problem|free-riders]] from in-group benefits. Field experiments also evidence religious people are more trusting and cooperative with fellow religious adherents. Many experimental studies suggest group belonging has a greater influence on behaviour than belief orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hougland |first1=James G. |last2=Wood |first2=James R. |title=Control in Organizations and the Commitment of Members |journal=Social Forces |date=1980 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=85–105 |doi=10.2307/2577834 |jstor=2577834}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Darwin (1874) among others argue, the promotion of cooperative in-group behaviours is not unique to religious networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=Penny Edgell |last2=Dhingra |first2=Pawan H. |title=Religious Involvement and Volunteering: Implications for Civil Society |journal=Sociology of Religion |date=2001 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=315–335 |doi=10.2307/3712353 |jstor=3712353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental Economics of Religion==

Experimental methods can be applied to isolate the effect of religion on behaviour patterns and to distinguish between believing versus belonging channels. Experimental methods are useful in the '''Economics of Religion''' to standardise measurement and identify causal effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffmann |first1=Robert |title=THE EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS OF RELIGION |journal=Journal of Economic Surveys |date=January 2012 |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=no |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6419.2011.00716.x |language=en |issn=0950-0804|citeseerx=10.1.1.227.6634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods include looking at religion in various games – [[Prisoner's dilemma]], [[public goods game]], [[ultimatum game]], [[dictator game]] and [[Choice under uncertainty|parametric choice]]. Generally, as Hoffman's (2011) survey few statistically significant results have been identified which commentators attribute to opposing positive versus negative effects between and within individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Obadia |first1=Lionel |last2=Wood |first2=Donald C. |title=Economics of Religion: Anthropological Approaches |date=2011 |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |isbn=9781780522296 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8KCmbdDlByMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=anthropological+approaches+to+religion#v=onepage&amp;q=anthropological%20approaches%20to%20religion&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{Further|Demographics of Afghanistan}}
There are about a dozen [[ethnic groups in Afghanistan]], they include: [[Pashtuns]], [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]], [[Uzbeks]], and others who make up less than 2% each.&lt;ref name=Gearon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gearon|first=Liam|title=Human Rights and Religion|year=2002|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1902210940|edition=1st|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent figures on the ethnic affiliations comes from a survey conducted by the [[Asia Foundation]] in 2014. According to the representative survey, 40% of the people identified themselves as Pashtun, 36% as Tajik, 10% as Hazara, 8% as Uzbek, 2% as [[Turkmens|Turkmen]], 1% as [[Baloch people|Baloch]], 1% as [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], 1% as [[Aimaq people|Aimaq]], 1% as [[Afghan Arab|Arab]], 1% as [[Pashayi people|Pashaye]], 1% as [[Sadat]], 0.5% as [[Qizilbash]], and 0.5% as [[Safi (Pashtun tribe)|Safi]].&lt;ref name="survey2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/Afghanistanin2014final.pdf |format=PDF|title=Afghanistan in 2014 – A survey of the Afghan people |pages=211|quote=''D-11.

== Taliban rule ==
{{Further|Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)}}
After the [[Taliban]] rose to power in the mid 1990s, they began committing atrocities against their opponents, the Shias Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks. In 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN's World Food Program to 160,000 hungry and starving people (most of whom were Hazaras and Tajiks) "for political and military reasons".&lt;ref&gt;http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F8B4F98500EA0F8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Associated Press: U.N. says Taliban starving hungry people for military agenda&lt;/ref&gt; The UN said the Taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.N. says Taliban starving hungry people for military agenda|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F8B4F98500EA0F8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=Associated Press|date=7 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	 		 	
On August 8, 1998 the Taliban launched an attack on [[Mazar-i Sharif]]. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately based on their ethnicity, especially Hazaras and Uzbeks. Men, women and children were  hunted by Taliban forces in response to between 1500-3000 Taliban fighters executed by the Uzbek [[Junbish-i Milli]] militia.&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan Justice project, 120&lt;/ref&gt; This [[ethnic cleansing]] left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 dead.&lt;ref name=Armajani&gt;{{cite book|last=Armajani|first=Jon|title=Modern Islamist Movements: History, Religion, and Politics|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405117425|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clements3&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1851094028|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fall of the Taliban ==
{{Further|Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif}}
In 2001, [[Human Rights Watch]] voiced the fear that [[ethnic violence]] in Afghanistan was likely to increase due to the conflict between the different factions escalating.&lt;ref name=HRW1&gt;{{cite news|title=Afghanistan: Armed conflict poses risk of further ethnic violence|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/06/afghanistan-armed-conflict-poses-risk-further-ethnic-violence|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=8 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Pashtun people became refugees as they fled Uzbek [[Junbish-i Milli]] troops some of whom were reported as looting, raping and kidnapping when they were disarming Pashtuns accused of being former Taliban supporters in northern Afghanistan during the early stages of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] which removed the dominantly Pashtun Taliban from power.&lt;ref name=Gall&gt;{{cite news|last=Gall|first=Carlotta|title=A NATION CHALLENGED: ETHNIC VIOLENCE; Pashtuns, Once Favored by Taliban, Now Face Retribution in Afghanistan's North|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/23/world/nation-challenged-ethnic-violence-pashtuns-once-favored-taliban-now-face.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=23 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political measures ==

In 2010 the Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]] set up a panel to investigate continuing ethnic violence as he believes it is hampering the military efforts to contain the [[Taliban insurgency]].&lt;ref name=Nakamura&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakamura|first=David|title=Panel investigates Afghanistan's ethnic violence|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/14/MNCB1EU5KU.DTL|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''event monitoring''' is the process of collecting, analyzing, and [[Signal (information theory)|signaling]] event occurrences to subscribers such as [[operating system]] [[Process (computing)|processes]], active [[database]] rules as well as human operators. These event occurrences may stem from arbitrary sources in both [[software]] or [[computer hardware|hardware]] such as operating systems, [[database management system]]s, [[application software]] and [[Microprocessor|processor]]s. Event monitoring may use a [[time series database]].

== Basic concepts ==
Event monitoring makes use of a [[computer bus|logical bus]] to transport event occurrences from [[communication source|source]]s to [[observation|subscriber]]s, where ''event sources'' signal event occurrences to all event subscribers and ''event subscribers'' receive event occurrences. An event bus can be distributed over a set of physical [[Node (networking)|node]]s such as standalone computer systems. Typical examples of event buses are found in [[graphical user interface|graphical systems]] such as [[X Window System]], [[Microsoft Windows]] as well as development tools such as SDT.

''Event collection'' is the process of collecting event occurrences in a filtered [[Data logging|event log]] for analysis. A ''filtered event log'' is logged event occurrences that can be of meaningful use in the future; this implies that event occurrences can be removed from the filtered event log if they are useless in the future. [[#Event log analysis|''Event log analysis'']] is the process of analyzing the filtered event log to aggregate event occurrences or to decide whether or not an event occurrence should be signalled. ''Event signalling'' is the process of signalling event occurrences over the event bus.

Something that is monitored is denoted the ''monitored object''; for example, an application, an operating system, a database, hardware etc. can be monitored objects. A monitored object must be properly conditioned with event [[sensor]]s to enable event monitoring, that is, an object must be instrumented with event sensors to be a monitored object. ''Event sensors'' are sensors that signal event occurrences whenever an event occurs. Whenever something is monitored, the [[probe effect]] must be managed.

==Monitored objects and the probe effect==
As discussed by Gait,&lt;ref&gt;J. Gait (1985). A debugger for concurrent programs. ''Software-Practice And Experience'', 15(6)&lt;/ref&gt; when an object is monitored, its behavior is changed. In particular, in any [[concurrent system]] in which processes can run in [[parallel computing|parallel]], this poses a particular problem. The reason is that whenever sensors are introduced in the system, processes may execute in a different order. This can cause a problem if, for example, we are trying to localize a [[fault (technology)|fault]], and by monitoring the system we change its behavior in such a way that the fault may not result in a failure; in essence, the fault can be masked by monitoring the system. The ''[[probe effect]]'' is the difference in behavior between a monitored object and its un-instrumented counterpart. 

According to Schütz,&lt;ref&gt;W. Schütz (1994). Fundamental issues in testing distributed real-time systems. ''Real-Time Systems'', 7(2):129–157&lt;/ref&gt; we can avoid, compensate for, or ignore the probe effect. In critical real-time system, in which timeliness (i.e., the ability of a system to meet time constraints such as deadlines) is significant, avoidance is the only option. If we, for example, instrument a system for testing and then remove the instrumentation before delivery, this invalidates the results of most testing based on the complete system. In less critical real-time system (e.g., media-based systems), compensation can be acceptable for, for example, [[Performance test (assessment)|performance testing]]. In non-concurrent systems, ignorance is acceptable, since the behavior with respect to the order of execution is left unchanged.

==Event log analysis==
Event log analysis is known as event composition in [[active database]]s, chronicle recognition in [[artificial intelligence]] and as real-time logic evaluation in real-time systems. Essentially, event log analysis is used for [[pattern matching]], filtering of event occurrences, and aggregation of event occurrences into composite event occurrences. Commonly, [[dynamic programming]] strategies from [[algorithm]]s are employed to save results of previous analyses for future use, since, for example, the same pattern may be match with the same event occurrences in several consecutive analysis processing. In contrast to [[general rule processing]] (employed to assert new facts from other facts, cf. [[inference engine]]) that is usually based on [[backtracking]] techniques, event log analysis algorithms are commonly [[greedy algorithm|greedy]]; for example, when a composite is said to have occurred, this fact is never revoked as may be done in a backtracking based algorithm.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for event log analysis: [[finite state automata]], [[Petri nets]], [[procedural programming|procedural]] (either based on an imperative programming language or an object-oriented programming languages), a modification of [[Boyer–Moore string search algorithm]], and simple [[temporal network]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="81192">'''Moroccan genetics''' encompasses the genetic history of the people of [[Morocco]], and the genetic influence of this ancestry on world populations. It has been heavily influenced by geography.

In prehistoric times, the Sahara desert to the south and the Mediterranean Sea to the north were important geographical barriers. West Asia and Northeast Africa form a single land mass at the Suez. The Maghreb and Southwest Europe are separated by only 15&amp;nbsp;km (9&amp;nbsp;mi) at the Straits of Gibraltar, and a similar distance separates the Horn of Africa from the Arabian peninsula at the Bab el-Mandeb strait. At periods of low sea-levels, such as during a glacial maximum, islands that are currently submerged in the Mediterranean, and possibly in between the Gibraltar straits, would have been habitable. These may have encouraged bidirectional demic diffusion between Africa and Europe. During wetter phases of the Sahara, some populations in central Africa would have moved north into southern parts of North Africa. West Asian populations would have also been attracted to a wet Sahara, arriving either through the Suez, the Bab el-Mandeb or the Mediterranean.

As a result of these geographic influences, the genetic profile of the Moroccan population is a complex mosaic of autochthonous Maghrebi lineages, as well as Northeast African, European, West Asian and West African elements in variable degrees. Though Northwest Africa has experienced gene flow from the surrounding regions, it has also undergone long periods of genetic isolation in some parts. This has allowed distinctive genetic markers to evolve in some Maghrebi populations, especially in certain isolated Berber-speaking groups.

==Prehistory and antiquity==
The area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since [[Paleolithic]] times, sometime between 90,000 and 190,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/files/irhoud.htm Field Projects – Jebel Irhoud ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112002657/http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/files/irhoud.htm |date=2017-01-12 }}. Department of Human Evolution. Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Upper Paleolithic]], the [[Maghreb]] was more fertile than it is today, resembling a [[savanna]] more than today's arid landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubella |first=D. |title=From hunters to farmers the causes and consequences of food production in Africa |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0520045742 |pages=41–56 |editor=J.D.

Brandt |chapter=Environmentalism and Pi Paleolithic economies in the Maghreb (c. 20,000 to 5000 B.P.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22,000 years ago, the [[Aterian]] was succeeded by the [[Iberomaurusian]] culture, which shared similarities with Iberian cultures. Skeletal similarities have been observed between the Iberomaurusian [[Mechta-Afalou]] burials and European [[Cro-Magnon]] remains. The Iberomaurusian industry in Morocco was succeeded by the [[Capsian culture]].

North Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging [[Mediterranean]] world by the [[Phoenicians]], who established trading colonies and settlements in the early Classical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Megalithic Portal |author2=Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17926 |title=C. Michael Hogan, '&amp;#39;Mogador: Promontory Fort'&amp;#39;, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogador was a Phoenician colony as early as the early 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Moscati, Sabatino (2001) ''The Phoenicians'', Tauris, {{ISBN|1-85043-533-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}

Morocco later became part of a North African empire headquartered in [[Carthage]]. The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the [[Mauretania|Berber kingdom of Mauretania]] under king [[Bocchus I]]. This kingdom in northern Morocco, not to be confused with the present state of [[Mauritania]], dates at least to 110 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70880/Bocchus-I |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |title=Bocchus I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] controlled this region from the 1st century BC, naming it [[Mauretania Tingitana]]. [[Christianity]] was introduced in the 2nd century AD and gained converts in the Roman towns, among [[slaves]] and some Berber farmers.

In the 5th century AD, as the Roman Empire declined, the region was invaded from the north first by the [[Vandals]] and then by the [[Visigoths]]. In the 6th century AD, northern Morocco was nominally part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]]. Throughout this time, the Berber inhabitants in the high mountains of the interior of Morocco remained unsubdued.

==Early Islamic era==
In 670 AD, the first Islamic conquest of the [[North Africa]]n coastal plain took place under [[Uqba ibn Nafi]], a general serving under the [[Umayyad]]s of [[Damascus]]. The [[Umayyad]] Muslims brought their language, their system of government, and Islam to Morocco. Many of the Berbers slowly converted to Islam, mostly after Arab rule had receded. The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the [[Kingdom of Nekor]], an emirate in the [[Rif Mountains]]. It was founded by [[Salih I ibn Mansur]] in 710, as a client state to the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. After the outbreak of the [[Great Berber Revolt]] in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the [[Miknasa]] of [[Sijilmasa]] and the [[Barghawata]].

According to medieval legend, [[Idris ibn Abdallah]] had fled to Morocco after the Abbasids' massacre of his tribe in Iraq. He convinced the [[Awraba]] Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs in [[Baghdad]] and he founded the [[Idrisid Dynasty]] in 788. The Idrisids established [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major [[regional power]]. The Idrissids were ousted in 927 by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the [[Maghrawa]] of Sijilmasa in 980.

In the 13th and 14th centuries the [[Merinid Dynasty|Merinids]] held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] by military campaigns in Algeria and Spain. They were followed by the [[Wattasid dynasty|Wattasids]]. In the 15th century, the [[Reconquista]] ended Muslim rule in central and southern Spain and many [[Muslim]]s and [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Jews]] fled to Morocco.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/392604/Morocco |title=Morocco – History |publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portugal|Portuguese]] efforts to control the Atlantic coast in the 15th century did not greatly affect the interior of Morocco. According to Elizabeth Allo Isichei, "In 1520, there was a [[famine]] in Morocco so terrible that for a long time other events were dated by it. It has been suggested that the population of Morocco fell from 5 to under 3 million between the early sixteenth and nineteenth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Allo Isichei, Elizabeth (1997).

===Sharifian dynasties===
In 1549, the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]]: first the [[Saadi dynasty]] who ruled from 1549 to 1659, and then the [[Alaouite Dynasty|Alaouite dynasty]], who remained in power since the 17th century.

[[File:Augustins - Le Sultan du Maroc - Eugène Delacroix.jpg|thumb|The Sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Abderrahmane of Morocco]], by [[Eugène Delacroix]].]]

Under the Saadi Dynasty, the country repulsed [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] incursions and a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] invasion at the [[battle of Ksar el Kebir]] in 1578. The reign of [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a large expedition to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Songhay Empire]] in 1591. However, managing the territories across the [[Sahara]] proved too difficult. After the death of al-Mansur the country was divided among his sons.

In 1666 Morocco was reunited by the [[Alaouite Dynasty]], who have been the ruling house of Morocco ever since. Morocco was facing aggression from Spain and the Ottoman Empire lies pressing westward. The Alaouites succeeded in stabilizing their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy. Against the opposition of local tribes [[Ismail Ibn Sharif]] (1672–1727) began to create a unified state.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.webcitation.org/5kx6nGq9m?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572952_8/Morocco.html Morocco (Page 8 of 9)]".

Morocco was the first nation to recognize the fledgling United States as an independent nation in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/22/joint-statement-united-states-america-and-kingdom-morocco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=5V77mdCXHJcC&amp;pg=PA114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=41811&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=41811 |title=Cohen Renews U.S.-Morocco Ties |accessdate=2009-03-12 |author=Kozaryn, Linda D.|work=U.S. Department of Defense }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the [[American Revolution]], American merchant ships in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] were subject to attack by the [[Barbary pirates]]. On 20 December 1777, Morocco's Sultan [[Mohammed III of Morocco|Mohammed III]] declared that American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage. The [[Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship]], signed in 1786, stands as the U.S.'s oldest non-broken friendship [[treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Priscilla H. and Richard S.

==Genetic evidence==
The genetic proximity observed between [[Moroccans]] and [[Southern Europe]]ans is due to the fact that both these groups shared a common ancestor either in the [[Upper Paleolithic]], and in the [[Neolithic]] or, alternatively, during history with the invasion and the occupation during nearly seven centuries of the Iberian Peninsula by the [[Moorish]] troops.&lt;ref name=pmid19053990&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coudray | first1 = C. | last2 = Olivieri | first2 = A. | last3 = Achilli | first3 = A. | last4 = Pala | first4 = M. | last5 = Melhaoui | first5 = M. | last6 = Cherkaoui | first6 = M. | last7 = El-Chennawi | first7 = F. | last8 = Kossmann | first8 = M. | last9 = Torroni | first9 = A. |last10 =  Dugoujon | first10=J.

Recent studies make clear no significant [[genetics|genetic]] differences exists between Arabic-speaking Moroccan populations and non-Arabic speaking Moroccan populations. The human leukocyte antigen [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] [[DNA]] data suggest that most [[Moroccans]], both those of non-Arab [[ethnolinguistic]] identity and those of Arab ethnolinguistic identity, are of [[Berber people|Berber]] origin, and that the genealogical true [[Arabs]] from Arabia who invaded not only Morocco, but the rest of [[North Africa]] plus [[Spain]] in the 7th century, did not substantially contribute to the gene pool.&lt;ref name="Ballais, Jean-Louis 2000 pp. 125"&gt;Ballais, Jean-Louis (2000) "Chapter 7: Conquests and land degradation in the eastern Maghreb" ''In'' Barker, Graeme and Gilbertson, David (2000) ''The Archaeology of Drylands: Living at the Margin'' Routledge, London, Volume 1, Part III – Sahara and Sahel, pp. 125–136, {{ISBN|978-0-415-23001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gomez-Casado | first1 = E. | last2 = Del Moral | first2 = P. | last3 = Martinez-Laso | first3 = J. | last4 = Garcia-Gomez | first4 = A. | last5 = Allende | first5 = L. | last6 = Silvera-Redondo | first6 = C. | last7 = Longas | first7 = J. | last8 = Gonzalez-Hevilla | first8 = M. | last9 = Kandil | first9 = M. | doi = 10.1034/j.1399-0039.2000.550307.x   &lt;!-- This article has 11 authors. --&gt;| title = HLA genes in Arabic-speaking Moroccans: Close relatedness to Berbers and Iberians | journal = Tissue Antigens | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–249 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10777099| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moorish refugees from [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] settled in the coast-towns.&lt;ref name="google290"&gt;{{Cite book

In fact, according to a 2000 article in ''[[European Journal of Human Genetics]]'', Moroccans from North-Western Africa were genetically closer to [[Iberians]] than to either [[Sub-Saharan African]]s of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnicity and [[Middle East]]erners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosch | first1 = E. | last2 = Calafell | first2 = F. | last3 = Pérez-Lezaun | first3 = A. | last4 = Clarimón | first4 = J. | last5 = Comas | first5 = D. | last6 = Mateu | first6 = E. | last7 = Martínez-Arias | first7 = R. | last8 = Morera | first8 = B. | last9 = Brakez | first9 = Z.   &lt;!-- This article has 14 authors. --&gt;| doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200464 | title = Genetic structure of north-west Africa revealed by STR analysis | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 360–366 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10854096| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results suggest either a pre-historic kinship of Moroccans with Spaniards, or is a result of Moorish (i.e. Berber) input into Spain from Morocco, or is the result of genetic input into Morocco from Islamized indigenous Spaniards exiled to Morocco after the expulsion of Muslims from Spain following the Catholic Reconquista (where the Muslim expellees included not only the Moorish population who were the foreign-origin Muslim population which was ultimately mainly of Moroccan Berber origin in any event, but also many, if not mostly, Muslim expellees who were in fact indigenous Spanish converts to Islam) which resulted in a genetic input of Spanish DNA into Morocco far greater than any genetic input that genealogical Arabs from Arabia had on Moroccans during the Arab conquest of Morocco.

The different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] studied revealed close similarity between the [[Berber people|Berbers]] and other North African groups, mainly with Moroccan Arabic-speakers, which is in accord with the hypothesis that the current Moroccan population has a strong Berber background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harich | first1 = N. | last2 = Esteban | first2 = E. | last3 = Chafik | first3 = A. | last4 = López-Alomar | first4 = A. | last5 = Vona | first5 = G. | last6 = Moral | first6 = P. | doi = 10.1080/03014460110104393 | title = Classical polymorphisms in Berbers from Moyen Atlas (Morocco): Genetics, geography, and historical evidence in the Mediterranean peoples | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 473–487 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12396367| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[population genetics]] studies along with historians such as Gabriel Camps and Charles-André Julien lend support to the idea that the bulk of the gene pool of modern [[Northwest Africa]]ns, irrespective of linguistic group, is derived from the [[Berber people|Berber]] populations of the pre-Islamic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

According to '''the X-Chromosome SNP analyses''', the authors reported a high genetic homogeneity between berbers and Arabs in NW Africa, so they suggested that the [[Arabisation]] of this area was a cultural phenomenon, which '''did not''' imply a replacement of the ancestry population. Our results give support the hypothesis of an early settlement of northwest Africa. The original berber population seem to have received a low genetic influx from the surrounding areas. Different hypothesis have been suggested to explain the genetic differentiation of the Moroccan population. An initial genetic drift could have caused differences in allele frequency distribution that have not been re-established due to a certain level of geographic isolation. The Strait of Gibraltar has been described by several authors as an important genetic barrier. Even a certain level of genetic exchange probably occurred between NW Africa and the South of the Iberian Peninsula, sharp frequency changes have been described in this area. Also the Sahara desert has been suggested as responsible of the genetic isolation of NW African populations from Sub-Saharan populations. There is no consensus about the impact of the Neolithic demic diffusion in the Mediterranean area. According to our results, a low impact of the Neolithic expansions and/or later migration events on NW African populations would have occurred.

[[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] (E-M215) is the most prevalent haplogroup in North Africa. E-M215 and its dominant subclade E-M35 is thought to have emerged in East-Africa about 22,400 years ago, and would have later dispersed into North Africa and from there into West Asia.&lt;ref name="Cruciani2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cruciani | first1 = F. | last2 = La Fratta | first2 = R. | last3 = Santolamazza | first3 = P. | last4 = Sellitto | first4 = D. | last5 = Pascone | first5 = R. | last6 = Moral | first6 = P. | last7 = Watson | first7 = E. | last8 = Guida | first8 = V. | last9 = Colomb | first9 = E.

The '''E1b1b1''' clade is presently found in various forms in [[Morocco]]. Total '''E1b1b1 (E-M35)''' frequencies reached at 93.8% in [[Moroccans]].&lt;ref name="alvarez2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alvarez | first1 = L. | last2 = Santos | first2 = C. | last3 = Montiel | first3 = R. | last4 = Caeiro | first4 = B. | last5 = Baali | first5 = A. | last6 = Dugoujon | first6 = J.

E-M215 has two ancient branches that contain all known modern E-M215 men, E-M35 and E-M281. Of these two, the only branch that has been confirmed in a native population outside of [[Ethiopia]] is E-M35, which in turn has four known branches, [[Haplogroup E-V68 (Y-DNA)|E-V68]], [[Haplogroup E-Z827 (Y-DNA)|E-Z827]], E-V6 and E-V92. E-V68 and E-V257 have been found in highest numbers in [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]; but also in lower numbers in parts of the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]], and in isolated populations of [[Southern Africa]].

E1b1b is dominant among [[Afro-Asiatic language|Afro-Asiatic speakers]]. The linguistic group and carriers of its E-M35 lineage have a high probability to have arisen and dispersed together from the [[Afro-Asiatic Urheimat|region of origin of this language family]], amongst populations with an Afro-Asiatic speaking history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ehret|Platt|Haber|Xue|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Keita|Boyce|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All major sub-branches of E-M35 are thought to have originated in the same general area as the parent clade: in [[North Africa]], [[Horn of Africa]], or nearby areas of the [[Near East]]. Some branches of E-M35 left Africa many thousands of years ago. For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Battaglia|Fornarino|Al-Zahery|Olivieri|2007}} estimated that E-M78 (called E1b1b1a1 in that paper) has been in Europe longer than 10,000 years.

===E-M81===
[[File:Y Hap EM-81.PNG|thumb|250px|Distribution of Y haplotype E-M81 E1b1b1b in North Africa, West Asia and Europe.]]
'''E1b1b1b1 (E-M81)''', formerly '''E1b1b1b''', '''E3b1b''', and '''E3b2''', is the most common Y chromosome haplogroup in [[Morocco]], dominated by its subclade '''E-M183'''.

It is thought to have originated in North Africa 14,200 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yfull.com/tree/E-M81/|title=E-M81 YTree|website=www.yfull.com|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its parent clade [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b (E-M215)]] is believed to have first appeared in Horn of Africa about 42,600 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yfull.com/tree/E-M215/|title=E-M215 YTree|website=www.yfull.com|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This haplogroup reaches a mean frequency of 85% in [[North Africa]]. It decreases in frequency from approximately 80% or more in some Moroccan Berber populations, including Saharawis, to approximately 28% to the east of this range in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Arredi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alvarez|Santos|Montiel|Caeiro|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kujanová|first=Martina|last2=Pereira|first2=Luísa|last3=Fernandes|first3=Verónica|last4=Pereira|first4=Joana B.|last5=Cerný|first5=Viktor|date=2009-10|title=Near eastern neolithic genetic input in a small oasis of the Egyptian Western Desert|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=140|issue=2|pages=336–346|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21078|issn=1096-8644|pmid=19425100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the clade's prevalence among these Berber groups and others such as [[Mozabite people|Mozabites]], [[Riffians]], [[Chleuhs]], [[Middle Atlas]] and [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]], it is sometimes referred to as a genetic '''Berber marker'''.

===E-M78===
[[File:Y Hap EM-78.PNG|thumb|250px|Distribution density of E1b1b1a (E-M78) in select areas of Africa and Eurasia.]]
The most basal and rare [[E-M78]]* paragroup has been found at lower frequencies in Moroccan Arabs. 
The sub-clade E-V65 is found in high levels in the [[Maghreb]] regions of far northern Africa. {{Harvcoltxt|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} report levels of about 20% amongst [[Libya|Libyan Arab]] lineages, and about 30% amongst [[Demographics of Morocco|Moroccan Arabs]]. It appears to be less common amongst [[Berber people|Berbers]], but still present in levels of &gt;10%. The authors suggest a North African origin for this lineage. In Europe, only a few individuals were found in Italy and Greece.

{{Harvcoltxt|Capelli et al.|2009}} studied the beta cluster in Europe. They found small amounts in Southern Italy, but also traces in Cantabria, Portugal and Galicia, with Cantabria having the highest level in Europe in their study, at 3.1% (5 out of 161 people).

Other frequencies of '''E1b1b1a1c (E-V22)''' is reported by Cruciani et al. (2007) include Moroccan Arabs (7.27%, 55 people) and [[Moroccan Jews]] (8%, 50 people).

=== J-P209 ===
[[File:Haplogroup J (Y-DNA) Map.png|thumb|250px|Haplogroup J (Y-DNA) distribution]]
Haplogroup J-P209 is believed to have arisen roughly 31,700 years ago in [[Southwest Asia]] (31,700±12,800 years ago according to {{harvnb|Semino|2004}}).
Haplogroup J-P209 is found in greatest concentration in Southwestern [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Outside of this region, haplogroup J-P209 has a presence in [[North Africa]]: [[Algeria]] (up to 35%) {{harv|Semino|2004}}, [[Tunisia]] (up to 31%),&lt;ref&gt;31% is based on Combined Data
*{{harvnb|Semino|2004}}: 30%
*{{harvnb|Arredi|2004}}: 32%
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morocco]] (up to 20%) {{harv|Semino|2004}}, Egypt (up to 20%) {{harv|Luis|2004}}.

It also has a moderate presence in Southern Europe (especially in central and southern Italy, Malta, Greece, and Albania), [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]], particularly in the form of its subclade J-M172. Haplogroup J-P209 is also found in north [[East Africa]], particularly in the form of its J-M267 subclade. The J-M410 subclade is found mostly in Greece, Anatolia, and southern Italy.

=== Other haplogroups ===
[[File:Y Hap EM-123.PNG|thumb|250px|Haplogroup E-M123 (Y-DNA) Map.]]

'''Concerning E-M123 without checking for the E-M34 SNP''' is found at small frequencies in Morocco A Low regional percentages for '''E-M123''' was reported in [[Moroccan Berbers]] around 3%.

Eurasian haplogroups such as [[Haplogroup J1|Haplogroup J]] and [[Haplogroup R1b|Haplogroup R1]] have also been observed at very minimal frequencies. A thorough study by Cruciani et al. (2004) which analyzed populations from Morocco concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both [[Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA)|J1]] and R1b haplogroups) is largely of Neolithic origin, which suggests that the Neolithic transition in this part of the world was accompanied by demic diffusion of Berber-speaking pastoralists from the Algerian Desert into Eastern Morocco, although later papers have suggested that this date could have been as long as ten thousand years ago, with the transition from the Oranian to the [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] culture in North Africa.&lt;ref name="semino2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Semino | first1 = O. | last2 = Magri | first2 = C. | last3 = Benuzzi | first3 = G. | last4 = Lin | first4 = A.

==Haplogroup distributions in Moroccan Populations==
[[File:Morocco Y-DNA Distribution.png|alt=|thumb|350x350px|Moroccan Y-DNA Haplogroups Distribution Chart]]
The major components of Y-DNA haplogroups present in Moroccan Berbers (E3b ; 94%) are shared with European and neighboring North African and Near Eastern populations. Minor share of haplogroups also include those related to North West Africans (E1a, A1a; 1%), Near Easterners (J, G, T; 2,4%), Sub Saharans Africans (E3a; 1,7%) and Europeans (R1b, I1; 2%) affinity.

Some of the major percentages identified were:

*[[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]]: 56% ({{harvnb|Aboukhalid|2010}}) to 93.8% ({{harvnb|Alvarez|2009}}) - Typical of [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations.
*[[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J-P209]]: 1.60% ({{harvnb|El-Sibai|2009}}) to 20.4% ({{harvnb|Semino|2004}}) - Typical of populations of the Arabian peninsula, the [[Levant]] and [[Caucasus]], with a moderate distribution in [[Southeast Europe]], North Africa, the Horn of Africa, [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]].
*[[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]]: 0.8% to 6.8% ({{harvnb|Bosch|2001}}) - Typical of [[Western Europe]]ans, some [[West Asian]] peoples, the [[Sudan]]ese [[Fulbe people|Fulani]] and the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]]-speaking peoples of Central Africa, and some Central Asian peoples (such as the [[Bashkirs]], [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and [[Uyghurs]]).&lt;ref&gt;Y Haplogroups of the World [http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mcdonald/WorldHaplogroupsMaps.pdf Online Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|G]]: 0.4% - Typical of people from the Caucasus, and to a lesser extent the [[Middle East]].
*[[Haplogroup A1a (Y-DNA)|A1a]]: 0.5% - Typical of [[Haratin]]-related groups in [[Northwest Africa]].
*[[Haplogroup E1a (Y-DNA)|E1a]]: 0.5% - Rare haplogroup that has been found amongst [[Moroccans|Moroccan]] [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]], Southern Europeans, and some Chadic speakers in the Sahel.
*[[Haplogroup E1b1a (Y-DNA)|E1b1a]]: 1.7% - Typical of Niger-Congo-speaking populations.
*[[Haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]]: 0.4% - Widely distributed around West Eurasia.
*[[Haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA)|I]]: 0.4% - It can be found in the majority of present-day European populations, with peaks in Northern and South-Eastern Europe. Haplogroup I1 Y-chromosomes have also been found among some populations of the [[Near East]], the Caucasus, Northeast Africa and [[Central Siberia]].

==Berber Genetic Identity of Moroccans==
[[File:A big group shot!.jpg|thumb|250px|Berber children in Morocco.]]
The prehistoric populations of Morocco, who were ancestral to Berbers, were related to the wider group of Paleo-Mediterranean peoples.
The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family probably originated during the Mesolithic period, perhaps in the context of the [[Capsian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Abdallah Laroui, ''The History of the Maghrib'' (Paris 1970; Princeton 1977) at 17, 60 (re S.W.Asians, referencing the earlier work of Gsell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Camps|first=Gabriel|year=1996|title=''Les Berbères''|publisher=Edisud|pages=11–14, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA analysis has found commonalities between Berber Moroccan populations and those of the [[Sami people]] of Scandinavia showing a link dating from around 9,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Achilli | first1 = A. | last2 = Rengo | first2 = C. | last3 = Battaglia | first3 = V. | last4 = Pala | first4 = M. | last5 = Olivieri | first5 = A. | last6 = Fornarino | first6 = S. | last7 = Magri | first7 = C. | last8 = Scozzari | first8 = R. | last9 = Babudri | first9 = N. | doi = 10.1086/430073 | title = Saami and Berbers—An Unexpected Mitochondrial DNA Link | journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 883–886 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15791543 | pmc =1199377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 5000 BC, the populations of North Africa were primarily descended from the makers of the [[Iberomaurusian]] and Capsian cultures, with a more recent intrusion associated with the [[Neolithic revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Desanges, "The proto-Berbers" 236-245, at 237, in ''General History of Africa, v.II Ancient Civilizations of Africa'' (UNESCO 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The proto-Berber tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the Late Bronze to Early Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Mário Curtis Giordani, ''História da África. Anterior aos descobrimentos'' (Petrópolis, Brasil: Editora Vozes 1985) at 42-43, 77-78. Giordani references Bousquet, ''Les Berbères'' (Paris 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic Prehistoric Expansions==

DNA evidence suggests that during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], a period between 25,000 and 19,000 years ago, large ice sheets over a kilometer thick covered much of Northern Europe, making the region uninhabitable to humans. It is believed that human populations retreated south to warmer regions near the Mediterranean. Refuges during this period are believed to have been in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]]. There was some [[gene flow]] from [[Morocco]] into [[Iberia]].&lt;ref name="malyarchuk2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Malyarchuk | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Derenko | first2 = M. | last3 = Perkova | first3 = M. | last4 = Grzybowski | first4 = T. | last5 = Vanecek | first5 = T. | last6 = Lazur | first6 = J. | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2008.70 | title = Reconstructing the phylogeny of African mitochondrial DNA lineages in Slavs | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 1091–1096 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18398433| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the glacial maximum, when the European climate warmed up, the refuges are thought to have been the source from which Europe was repopulated. Berber lineages that had been introduced into the Iberian refuge would have then dispersed all over Europe with the Northward expansion of humans. This could explain the presence of genetic lineages in Eastern Europe and as far north as Russia, that appear to have prehistoric links to Northwest Africa, mainly [[Morocco]] (see [[African admixture in Europe#mtDNA|mtDNA]]).&lt;ref name="malyarchuk2008"/&gt; The expansion of human populations from Iberian refuges is also believed to have moved back to [[Morocco]] and [[Northwest Africa]].&lt;ref name="cherni2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cherni | first1 = L. | last2 = Fernandes | first2 = V.

===Neolithic to the end of the prehistoric===

The change from [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to agriculture during the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was a watershed in world history. The societies that first made the change to agriculture are believed to have lived in [[North Africa]] and Middle East around 10,000 BCE. Agriculture was introduced into Europe by migrating farmers from the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brace | first1 = C.

===Genetic Berber Heritage continuity of Moroccan Arabs===

The cultural differentiation present in North Africa between Berber and Arab samples seems not to reflect genetic differences between both groups, as shown in the AMOVA analyses, and the MDS and PC analyses. If [[Arabs]] in Northern Africa were mostly descendants of Middle Eastern Arabs, the frequencies of haplogroups such as N, U1, U3, U7, and HV that are much more prevalent in the Middle East than elsewhere should be larger in North African Arabs than in Berbers. However, the opposite is observed : these haplogroups add up to 5% in North African Arabs but to 10% in Berbers.

The lack of differentiation between North African Arabs and Berbers has also been observed using other genetic markers such as classical markers (Bosch et al. 1997); autosomal STRs (Bosch et al. 2000), Alu insertion polymorphisms (Comas et al. 2000); and Y-chromosome lineages 
This pattern suggests that the Arabization of the area was mainly a cultural process, rather than a demographic replacement of the Berber populations that inhabited the region where the Arabic expansion took place.&lt;ref name="Fadhlaoui-Zid 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fadhlaoui-Zid | first1 = K. | last2 = Plaza | first2 = S. | last3 = Calafell | first3 = F. | last4 = Ben Amor | first4 = M. | last5 = Comas | first5 = D. | last6 = Bennamar | first6 = A. | last7 = Gaaied | first7 = E. | doi = 10.1046/j.1529-8817.2004.00096.x | title = Mitochondrial DNA Heterogeneity in Tunisian Berbers | journal = Annals of Human Genetics | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 222–33 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15180702| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, some papers suggested that the distribution of the main L haplogroups in Morocco was mainly due to trans-Saharan slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harich | first1 = N. | last2 = Costa | first2 = M.

==Genetic influence of Moroccans on Southern Europe==
[[File:Map of African admixture in European populations.png|thumb|Map of North and Sub-Saharan African admixture in European populations]]
Trombetta et al. (2011) felt that V257 showed a parallel with its sibling clade [[E1b1b1a|E-V68]] in the way that both clades show signs of having migrated from North West Africa Likely Morocco to southwestern Europe across the Mediterranean sea. They found 6 "E-V257*" individuals in their samples who were E-V257, from a Moroccan Marrakesh Berber, a Corsican, a Sardinian, a southern Spaniard and a Cantabrian.

{{Quote|Within E-M35, there are striking parallels between two haplogroups, E-V68 and E-V257. Both contain a lineage which has been frequently observed in North West Africa mainly Morocco (E-M78 and E-M81, respectively) and a group of undifferentiated chromosomes that are mostly found in southern Europe. An expansion of E-M35 carriers of E-V68* and E-V257* in the Northern Africa makes a maritime spread between Morocco and southern Europe a more plausible hypothesis.|{{Harvcoltxt|Trombetta |2011}}}}

A study from Semino (published 2004) showed that [[Y-chromosome]] [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|haplotype E1b1b1b]] (E-M81), is specific to [[Morocca]]n populations and almost absent in Europe except [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) and Sicily.

Y-chromosome analysis of the Iberian peninsula according to which haplogroup E1b1b1b surpasses frequencies of 10% in Southern Spain. The study points only to a very limited influence from northern Africa and the Middle East both in historic and prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/EJHG_2004_v12_p855.pdf |title=Reduced Genetic Structure for Iberian Peninsula: implications for population demography.

A study restricted to [[Portugal]], concerning Y-chromosome lineages, revealed that "The mtDNA and Y data indicate that the Berber presence in that region dates prior to the Moorish expansion in 711 AD. ...

Haplotype V(p49/TaqI), a characteristic Moroccan haplotype, may be also found in the Iberian peninsula, and a decreasing North-South cline of frequency clearly establishes a gene flow from Morocco towards Iberia which is also consistent with [[Moors|Moorish]] presence in the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lucotte | first1 = G. | last2 = Gerard | first2 = N. | last3 = Mercier | first3 = G. | doi = 10.1353/hub.2001.0066 | title = North African Genes in Iberia Studied by Y-Chromosome DNA Haplotype 5 | journal = Human Biology | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 763–769 | year = 2001 | pmid =  11758696| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This North-South cline of frequency of halpotype V is to be observed throughout the Mediterranean region, ranging from frequencies of close to 30% in southern Portugal to around 10% in southern France.

The '''Great Cocky Count''', also known as the '''Great Cockatoo Count''', is an annual [[census]] designed to provide accurate data about the number and distribution of [[black cockatoo]]s. It is the largest single survey of black cockatoos in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org.au/projects/southwest-black-cockatoo-recovery/great-cocky-count-swbc|title=Great Cocky Count|accessdate=3 September 2016|year=2016|publisher=Birdlife Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The count is a [[citizen science]] survey and is conducted at sunset one night in autumn, usually in early April.&lt;ref name=nmr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southcoastnrm.com.au/140-2016-great-cocky-count|title=2016 great cocky count|accessdate=3 September 2016|year=2016|publisher=Southcoast Natural Resource Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first held in 2009 and has been conducted each year since.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-02/record-number-of-volunteers-sign-up-for-great/5362128|title=Record number of volunteers sign up for Great Cocky Count|date=2 April 2014|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 450 volunteers participated in the 2014 count at hundreds of locations between [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] and [[Esperance, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

The 2015 count had over 600 volunteers surveying over 300 sites, with the endangered [[Calyptorhynchus latirostris|Carnaby's black cockatoo]] being the main focus of the count but the vulnerable [[Calyptorhynchus baudinii|Baudin's black cockatoo]] and [[red-tailed black cockatoo|forest red-tailed black cockatoo]] also being counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencewa.net.au/-events/item/4160-great-cocky-count-takes-the-avon-valley|title=Great Cocky Count takes the Avon Valley|author=Rhiannon Bristow-Stagg|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=4 September 2016|publisher=Science Network Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weekendnotes.com/great-cocky-count/|title=Join the Great Cocky Count 2016|accessdate=15 September 2016|work=Weekend Notes|year=2016|publisher=On Topic Media Pty. Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a total of 426 roost sites were surveyed by approximately 700 volunteers. The results included:
*16,392 white-tailed black cockatoos recorded at 100 occupied roosts.
*1,907 forest red-tailed black cockatoos recorded at 66 occupied roosts
*4,897 Carnaby’s black cockatoos were found at a single roost site
It was estimated that 27% of the black cockatoos that inhabit the south west of Western Australia were counted in a single night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacc.com.au/great-cocky-count-update/|title=Great cocky count update|accessdate=15 September 2016|year=2016|publisher=Northern Agricultural Catchments Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term results from the surveys, which have been conducted since 2009, have found that the Carnaby’s black cockatoo population of the Perth-Peel coastal plain declined at a rate of roughly 15 per cent each year. There has been a reduction in flock size and fewer occupied roost sites around Perth, mostly as a result of increased urban sprawl. 46% of the population are found in the [[Gnangara, Western Australia|Gnangara]] pine plantation, which is scheduled to be cleared by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/perths-urban-sprawl-driving-out---carnabys-black-cockatoos/news-story/9643a621de289dc289e50e211e8349af|title=Perth’s urban sprawl driving out Carnaby’s black cockatoos|date=30 October 2015|work=Perthnow|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in numbers is mostly a result of clearing breeding grounds and reducing their range. Currently the birds are thought to be using all available habitat, which is barely enough to support the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecu.edu.au/news/latest-news/2016/04/cocky-count-how-perths-green-growth-plan-could-wipe-out-was-best-loved-bird|title=Cocky count: how Perth’s ‘green’ growth plan could wipe out WA’s best-loved bird|date=6 April 2016|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=[[Edith Cowan University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hadendoa''' (or '''Hadendowa''') is the name of a [[nomad]]ic subdivision of the [[Beja people]], known for their support of the [[Mahdist War|Mahdiyyah rebellion]] during the 1880s to 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Hugh (1899) ''Kassala: An Historical Sketch'' in {{cite book|title=The United Service Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6M6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA58|year=1899|publisher=William Clowes &amp; Son|location=London|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area historically inhabited by the Hadendoa is today parts of [[Sudan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Eritrea]].

==Etymology==
According to Roper (1930), the name ''Haɖanɖiwa'' is made up of ''haɖa'' 'lion' and ''(n)ɖiwa'' 'clan'. Other variants are ''Haɖai ɖiwa'', ''Hanɖiwa'' and ''Haɖaatʼar'' (children of lioness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roper|first1=E.

==Language==
The language of the Hadendoa is a dialect of [[Beja language|Bedawi]].&lt;ref name="At war with Bisharin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="language religion" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:SAAES-Hadendoa.png|thumb|Hadendoa man (1913).]]
The southern Beja were part of the Christian kingdom of [[Axum]] during the sixth to fourteenth centuries.
In the fifteenth century, Axum fell to the [[Islamization of the Sudan region]], and although the Beja were never entirely subjugated, they  were absorbed into Islam via marriages and trade contracts. In the seventeenth century, some of the Beja expanded southward, conquering better pastures. These became the Hadendoa, who by the eighteenth century were the dominant people of eastern Sudan, and always at war with the [[Bisharin tribe]].&lt;ref name="At war with Bisharin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burckhardt|first1=John Lewis|title=Travels in Nubia: by the late John Lewis Burckhardt|date=1819|publisher=Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vE4GAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive anthropological research was done on Egyptian tribes in the late 1800s and a number of skulls of people of the Hadendoa tribe were taken to the Royal College of Surgeons to be measured and studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIRxMmigw8wC|page=607|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anthropological studies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foole|first1=Reginald Stuart|title=The Egyptian Classification|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1887|volume=16|pages=370–379|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofroyalan16royauoft/journalofroyalan16royauoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hadendoa were traditionally a [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] people, ruled by a hereditary chief, called a Ma'ahes.  One of the best-known chiefs was a Mahdist general named [[Osman Digna]].  He led them in the battles, from 1883 to 1898, against the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]- Britain and Egypt were exercising joint sovereignty in Sudan.&lt;ref name="Image with caption"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/574/|website=World Digital Library - Library of Congress|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They fought the British [[infantry square]] in many battles, such as in the [[Battle of Tamai]] in 1884 and in the [[Battle of Tofrek]] in 1885&lt;ref name="Dinga, Oman (Dervish)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monick|first1=S.|title=The Political Martyr: General Gordon and the Fall of Kartum|journal=Military History Journal|date=1985|volume=6|issue=6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned an unenviable reputation for their savagery. After the reconquest of the [[Egyptian Sudan]] (1896–98),&lt;ref name="Battle of Tofrek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=W.H.|title=The Battle of Tofrek|date=1887|publisher=Galloway|edition=4th|url=http://www.1rtr.net/tofrek.html|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hadendoa accepted the new order without demur.&lt;ref name = "true"&gt;F.R. Wingate, "The True Story of Osman Dinga", ''The Graphic'', June 16, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB Public Domain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadendoa|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hadendoa|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125112025/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hadendoa|archivedate=25 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, the Hadendoa allied themselves with the British against [[Italy in World War II|the Italians]] who were in turn supported by the [[Beni-Amer]] tribe.&lt;ref name="language religion"&gt;Orville Boyd Jenkins, [http://strategyleader.org/profiles/beja.html Profile of the Beja people] (1996, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa - The Impact of Firearms|url=https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2016/08/04/africa-the-impact-of-firearms-i/|website=Weapons and Warfare|accessdate=November 25, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125111946/https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2016/08/04/africa-the-impact-of-firearms-i/|archivedate=November 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Their elaborately styled hair gained them the name [[Fuzzy-Wuzzy]] among British troops during the [[Mahdist War]] after which [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote the poem by same name.&lt;ref name="Atlantic June 2002"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/06/a-man-of-permanent-contradictions/302512/|title= A Man of Permanent Contradictions |last= Hitchens| first= Christopher|  authorlink= Christopher Hitchens |date= June 2002 |website= |publisher= [[The Atlantic]]| accessdate= 5 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31891">[[Greece]] is a transit and destination country for women and children who are subjected to [[human trafficking]], specifically [[forced prostitution]] and conditions of [[Unfree labour|forced labor]] for men, women, and children. Female sex trafficking victims originate primarily in [[Eastern Europe]] and former [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]] countries. Traffickers use physical, emotional, and sexual abuse for coercion. Greece's [[European Union]] membership, coupled with a shared border with [[Turkey]], means the country sees massive flows of [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] looking to enter the EU. Traffickers also use Greece not only as a destination but a transit stop on the way to [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="papadimos"&gt;Papanicolaou, Georgios. "The Sex Industry, Human Trafficking and the Global Prohibition Regime: A Cautionary Tale from Greece." Trends in Organized Crime 11.4 (2008): 379-409. Springer. Web. 19 Sept. 2012. &lt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/508lh06x47238413/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Politics of Greece|Government of Greece]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government made clear progress in prosecuting labor and sex trafficking offenses, identifying victims, implementing a child victim protection agreement with [[Albania]], and advancing prevention activities. Concerns remain about trafficking-related police complicity, inadequate victim identification among the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]], border police, and vice police, as well as inadequate funding for anti-trafficking NGOs.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Greece".

[[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European sovereign-debt crisis|economic crisis]] in Greece also places strains on allocation of funding and resources towards anti-trafficking efforts.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of human trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking}}

The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) defines [[human trafficking]] as "the recruitment, transport, transfer, harboring or receipt of a person by such means as threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation." &lt;ref name="UNODC"&gt;UNODC (2012). Human Trafficking FAQs. Retrieved March 26, 2012, from http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt; All of the world’s countries are affected by human trafficking, either as a source, destination, or transit country, or a combination of the three. According to the [[International Labour Organization]], an estimated 2.4 million people are victims of trafficking at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;ILO Trafficking in persons (2009). Retrieved February 20, 2012, from http://www.ilo.org/public/&lt;/ref&gt; Global trade in women is estimated to be worth between 7 and 12 billion dollars annually; the chair of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) stated that human trafficking may even have overtaken [[illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] as a lucrative criminal enterprise.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Hughes, Donna M. "The "Natasha" Trade: The Transnational Shadow Market of Trafficking in Women." Journal of International Affairs 52.2 (2000): 625-51. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="konrad"&gt;Konrad, Helga. "Trafficking in Human Beings: The Ugly Face of Europe." Helsinki Monitor 13.3 (2002): 260-71. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, an estimated 270,000 people are trafficking annually in [[Europe]], with 40,000 women and children aged 12–25 trafficked annually to [[Greece]], as well as an even larger number that are trafficked through Greece to the rest of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;Kim, Jeong-Yeoul.

==Destinations==

===Greece as destination===
According to the 2001 [[Greek census 2011|Greek census]], there were 797,091 documented foreigners living in Greece, with a large number from [[Albania]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], and the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="anton"&gt;Antonopoulos, Georgios A. "'Are the 'Others' Coming?': Evidence on 'Alien Conspiracy' from Three Illegal Markets in Greece." Crime, Law, and Social Change 52.5 (2009): 475-93. Springer. Web. 19 Sept. 2012. http://www.springerlink.com/content/c834m745566710wv/.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years before that, the number of legal immigrants was only 30,000.&lt;ref name="sitar"&gt;Sitaropoulos, Nikolaos, Immigration Law and Management in Greece: Towards an Exodus from Underdevelopment and a Comprehensive Immigration Policy (December 5, 2002). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1950049 or {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.1950049}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the immigrant population had expanded to 1.2 million in a country of just of 11 million citizens—legal immigrants make up more than 10% of the Greek population, and the number of [[illegal immigration in Greece|illegal immigrants]] increases the percentage of immigrants even more.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; The exponential increase in [[immigration to Greece|migration to Greece]] serves as a cover for traffickers, and facilitates their transportation of women for work in the [[sex industry]] in Greece.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Because of the ease with which traffickers can disguise foreign victims among the immigrant population, Greeks are not typically the targeted victims of traffickers; instead women are brought in from outside the country to fuel the sex industry.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; Women are brought to Greece from a variety of places, but a large number come from [[Eastern Europe]]—a full 50–55% of sex workers in [[Athens]] are from former [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]] countries.&lt;ref name="karak"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karakatsanis | first1 = Neovi M. | last2 = Swarts | first2 = Jonathan | year = 2003 | title = Migrant Women, Domestic Work and the Sex Trade in Greece: A Snapshot of Migrant Policy in the Making | url = | journal = Greek Review of Social Research | volume = 110 | issue = | pages = 239–70 | doi=10.12681/grsr.9174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece is also a destination country for a large number of trafficked [[Moldova|Moldavians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tavcer | first1 = D.

===Gateway to the European Union===
A large number of trafficked persons are trafficked through Greece on their way to [[Italy]] or other [[Western Europe|Western]] countries.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; From the 1970s onwards, migrants from [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] began to enter Greece as a temporary stop on their way to other, more developed Western European countries.&lt;ref name="sitar" /&gt; Since then, [[Immigration to Greece|immigration into Greece]], legally and [[Illegal immigration in Greece|illegally]], in order to gain access to the rest of the [[European Union]] has increased, and traffickers have taken advantage of this as well. There are two main trafficking routes that go through Greece in order to reach the European Union. The first is the Balkan Route, through which victims are moved from the [[Balkans]] into [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], and [[Greece]], and from there to the rest of the EU. The second is the Eastern Mediterranean Route, which moves victims from [[Turkey]] through Greece into [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="konrad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; Some accounts have estimated that Greece’s border with Turkey serves as the “back-door” entry point for close to 90% of the illegal immigrants to the European Union, and this number includes those transported illegally for purposes of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="levers"&gt;Levers, Lisa L., and Debra Hyatt-Burkhart. "Immigration Reform and the Potential for Psychosocial Trauma: The Missing Link of Lived Human Experience." Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy 00.00 (2011): 1-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
Experts struggle to profile [[human trafficking]] victims because they come from a wide variety of countries and backgrounds and experience different forms of economic and sexual exploitation and abuse. There are certain characteristics that many victims in Greece share, and they face similar challenges and dangers even after being rescued.&lt;ref name="hayle"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoyle | first1 = Carolyn | last2 = Bosworth | first2 = Mary | last3 = Dempsey | first3 = Michelle | year = 2011 | title = Labeling the Victims of Sex Trafficking: Exploring the Borderland between Rhetoric and Reality | url = | journal = [[Social &amp; Legal Studies]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 313–29 | doi=10.1177/0964663911405394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breuil | first1 =  | last2 = Carina Oude | first2 = Brenda | last3 = Siegel | first3 = Dina | last4 = Von Reenen | first4 = Piet | last5 = Beijer | first5 = Annemarieke | last6 = Roos | first6 = Linda | year = 2011 | title = Human Trafficking Revisited: Legal, Enforcement and Ethnographic Narratives on Sex Trafficking to Western Europe | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v631u7x072024xx1/ | journal = Trends in Organized Crime | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 30–46 | doi=10.1007/s12117-011-9118-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Over 60% of all migrants to Greece, legal and illegal, are female, and over 20,000 migrant women are trafficked annually to work in Greece.&lt;ref name="konrad" /&gt; Approximately 40,000 women and children aged 12–25 are trafficked each year in Greece.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; The majority of these women today are from [[Eastern Europe]]an and [[Balkans|Balkan]] countries, such as [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]], [[Albania]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Moldavia]], but there are a fair number from Asia and Africa as well.&lt;ref name="emke"&gt;Emke-Poulopoulos, Ira. "Trafficking in Women and Children: Greece, a Country of Destination and Transit." Mediterranean Migration Observatory (2001): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half the women trafficked in Greece are estimated to be from [[Russia]] and the [[Ukraine]] alone.&lt;ref name="monzini"&gt;Monzini, Paola. "Trafficking in Women and Girls and the Involvement of Organised Crime, with Reference to the Situation in Central and Eastern Europe."International Review of Victimology 11.1 (2004): 73-88. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; One study from 2001 estimates that 75% of trafficked women in Greece are brought into the country under false pretenses and, believing that an opportunity for lawful employment awaits them in Greece, suddenly find themselves sold to those involved in the [[sex trade]] and threatened with violence and deportation if they refuse to cooperate, and they become too frightened to report it.&lt;ref name="lazaridis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="karak" /&gt; The average age of a sex worker in Greece is also lowering, and currently sits at about 12–15 years of age.&lt;ref name="karak" /&gt;&lt;ref name="emke" /&gt; Trafficked women work anywhere from 6 to 12 hours a day and see anywhere from 40-110 clients a day.&lt;ref name="lazaridis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="emke" /&gt; 70% or more of their earnings, however, go to the brothel owners or pimps in order to keep the women in [[debt bondage]].&lt;ref name="emke" /&gt; Trafficked women are likely to face [[physical abuse]], threats, intimidation, [[psychological abuse|emotional abuse]], [[sexual abuse]], and to experience [[drug addiction|drug]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol addiction]], injuries resulting from violence, and various mental health problems as a result of the trauma they are exposed to.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; Women who are victims of trafficking also often suffer from [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and other [[infectious disease]]s.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were [[HIV]] positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive.&lt;ref name="lazaridis" /&gt;

===Challenges after trafficking===
Even after having been freed from entrapping situations, victims may face symptoms consistent with [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] as a result of the physical, emotional, and sexual trauma to which they were exposed.&lt;ref name="levers"/&gt; Additionally, victims may be stigmatized, marginalized, and discriminated against as a result of their experiences. They often find it difficult to go back to their home countries, where they are no longer considered respectable women, and they find it equally difficult to start a new life in the country into which they have been trafficked.&lt;ref name="lazaridis" /&gt; [[Albania]]n women, for instance, are often stereotyped by Greeks as uneducated, dirty and cheap, but returning to Albania after engaging in prostitution, forced or not, results in shame and loss of honor for the victim's family.&lt;ref name="emke" /&gt;

Women freed from trafficking situations face the added danger of a possible return to the [[sex trade]], whether because it is the only life they know or because they are not adequately protected. An estimated 80% of women deported from Greece by train never make it back to their home country because it is common practice for the traffickers to board the trains and force them back to Greece before they reach their destination.&lt;ref name="karak" /&gt;

==Traffickers==
Traffickers involved in Greece are largely [[Albanians|Albanian]], [[Romanians|Romanian]], and [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]], and while Greeks are infrequent victims of trafficking, Greek citizens do participate in the trafficking of non-Greek nationals.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; Traffickers recruit victims through false advertisements for low skilled jobs with good salaries, such as waitresses, nannies, dancers, or hostesses; one study of newspapers in [[Ukraine]] showed each newspaper contained 5–20 suspicious adverts.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Traffickers sometimes use a woman’s legal documents and visas to get her into Greece and then confiscate them so she cannot leave.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Additionally, traffickers use threats, intimidation, and physical, emotional, and sexual abuse to control these women and force them into prostitution.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

==Contributing factors to trafficking==

===Historical factors===
During the 1980s, the majority of foreign prostitutes in Greece originated from [[Asia]], specifically [[Thailand]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="emke" /&gt; However, after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], trafficking in women from former [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]] countries rapidly expanded as women looked to improve their social and economic standings by moving West. This meant they could be taken advantage of by traffickers with the promise of a job in Western European countries.&lt;ref name="emke" /&gt; Former Soviet republics such as [[Belarus]], [[Latvia]], [[Russia]], and the [[Ukraine]] have become major sending countries for trafficked women.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Today, 50-55% of trafficking victims in Athens are from former Soviet bloc countries, and more than half of the women trafficked into Greece overall are estimated to be from [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="karak" /&gt;&lt;ref name="monzini" /&gt;

===Political factors===
The political situation in Greece regarding [[immigration to Greece|immigration]], legal and illegal, facilitates the trafficking of women into and through Greece. Greece experienced massive immigration from the [[Balkans|Balkan]] region in the 1980s and from Central and Eastern Europe in general in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="triand"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Triandafyllidou | first1 = Anna | year = 2009 | title = Greek Immigration Policy at the Turn of the 21st Century. Lack of Political Will or Purposeful Mismanagement? | url = | journal = European Journal of Migration and Law | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 159–77 | doi=10.1163/157181609x440013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, Greece’s legal immigrant population had expanded to 1.2 million, or 10% of the Greek population.&lt;ref name="triand" /&gt; At the time when these immigration flows were rapidly expanding, the [[Government of Greece|Greek government]] and immigration policies were unprepared to deal with such a large number of immigrants; Greece's ability to deal with the multitudes of illegal immigrants was even less developed.&lt;ref name="triand" /&gt; The challenges Greece has faced with its large immigrant population and implementing successful immigration policy allows migrants that are trafficked and forced into prostitution to slip through the cracks and allows traffickers to hide them among the general migrant population.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Greece’s European Union membership, coupled with its geographical location between East and West, also contributes to its role as a transit nation in trafficking routes. As a gateway to Western Europe, victims are often trafficked through Greece in order to reach other EU countries.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; Greece’s border with [[Turkey]] is also a hotspot for illegal immigrants looking to find their way into the European Union; from 1991–2001 over 2.2 million migrants who had entered Greece illegally were deported, and the vast majority of these had arrived in Greece through Turkey.&lt;ref name="sitar" /&gt; In 2001, 6,471 immigrants were apprehended at sea trying to reach Greece from Turkey.&lt;ref name="sitar" /&gt; An estimated 90% of the illegal immigrants to the entire European continent enter the EU through Greece’s border with Turkey; this migration number includes the tens of thousands of trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="levers" /&gt; On January 20, 2000, the Greco-Turkish Agreement was signed. Both countries aimed at “combating crime, especially terrorism, organized crime, illicit drug trafficking and illegal migration” as part of the agreement, in addition to human trafficking between the two countries.&lt;ref name="sitar" /&gt;

===Socio-cultural factors===
Strong [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] tendencies in Greece also contribute to trafficking. Various studies and polls continuously report Greece as the most xenophobic country in Europe.&lt;ref name="karak" /&gt; There is a perception among Greeks that foreign ethnicities are involved in [[organized crime]].&lt;ref name="anton" /&gt; Inherent xenophobia in Greece has allowed the trafficking of outsiders; ethnic bias against [[Albanians]] and other foreigners has potentially prohibited Greece from recognizing and properly caring for victims who are not of Greek origin.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt;

==Governmental anti-trafficking efforts==
There are several international standards for combating [[human trafficking]]. The UN [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]], also known as the Palermo Protocol, lays down universal, fundamental regulations for international organization and cooperation for combating trafficking. Greece signed the Protocol on December 13, 2000 and proceeded to completing the ratification process on January 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-12-a&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en#EndDec [[UN]] CHAPTER XVIII, PENAL MATTERS, 12 .a Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] has developed an anti-trafficking response that underpins the ‘3P’s of the Palermo Protocol—prosecution of traffickers, protection of victims, and prevention of trafficking.&lt;ref name="karak" /&gt; Since 2000, the [[United States Department of State|U.S State Department]] has created an analysis of anti-trafficking efforts country by country around the world that ranks each country based on their anti-trafficking efforts, resulting in the annual Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP).&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; From 2001 to 2003, Greece was placed on the Tier 3 list of the TIP report, which means the government was essentially ignoring the human trafficking problem.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; As the government made strides to address issues of human trafficking, it was moved to the Tier 2 Watch List in 2004, and in 2006 was placed on Tier 2, where it remains as of 2012.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt;

===Prosecution===
The government demonstrated clear progress in its prosecution of trafficking offenders, though a high-profile case of trafficking-related complicity remained pending in court as of 2010. Under the Alien Act law 1975/1991, which lasted until June 2001, there were penalties for trafficking human beings but there was no legislation specifically criminalizing trafficking.&lt;ref name="lymouris"&gt;Lymouris, Nikolaos (2007), "Trafficking in Greece", Conference Presentation, 3rd PhD Symposium, London School of Economics / Hellenic Observatory, available at http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/3rd_Symposium/PAPERS/LYMOURIS_NIKOLAOS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Greece passed law 3064/2002, the first Greek law to criminalize human trafficking and outlaw trafficking for sexual and labor exploitation.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; Police conducted 66 human trafficking investigations in 2009, a 65 percent increase over the 40 investigations in 2008. The government reported 32 new convictions of trafficking offenders in 2009, compared with 21 convictions in 2008.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; The average sentence for trafficking offenders was approximately 11 years with fines. The [[Minister for Justice, Transparency and Human Rights (Greece)|Ministry of Justice]] reported two suspended sentences in 2009. Some convicted trafficking offenders continued to be granted bail pending their lengthy appeals. The media continues to allege that trafficking-related complicity exists among some local police and vice squad officers. In a case cited in the 2010 TIP Report, a trafficking victim was allegedly raped while in police custody in 2006.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; In a positive development in 2009, one active and one retired officer were held without bail pending prosecution for alleged involvement in sex trafficking. In 2009, the Greek police reported cooperation with counterparts in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], and [[Russia]] on trafficking cases.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; As of 2011, Greece has laws and penalties pertaining to Article 2 of the [[Directive (European Union)|European Directive of 2011]], which states all EU Member States must have legislation that punishes traffickers, regardless of the type of trafficking.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt;

===Protection===
The government has demonstrated some progress in ensuring that victims of trafficking were provided access to essential services. Before 2001, a person who made his or her living from [[prostitution]] was liable to prosecution; since then, laws have been implemented that seek to care for the victim and punish the trafficker instead.&lt;ref name="lazaridis" /&gt; In 2000 a Task Force against human trafficking was created to identify and assist victims, and in 2007 the largest trafficking ring known to date in [[Thessaloniki]] was dismantled.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; In 2003, Presidential Decree 223/2003 introduced measures for the assistance and protection of victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref name="lymouris" /&gt; In August 2004, a National Action Plan was developed to implement a wide variety of counter-trafficking efforts, including collecting facts and statistics, establishing procedures to identify victims, establish shelters, provide victims with legal recourse, and educating police, judges, and other member of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="lymouris" /&gt; The [[Minister for Health and Social Solidarity (Greece)|Ministry of Health]] trained nurses, medical admissions staff, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers on the identification of trafficking victims. Similarly, experienced anti-trafficking police continued to provide training to border police, vice police, and the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] on victim identification. Greece provided officially-identified trafficking victims with access to legal and medical services through government-run shelters, public healthcare, and intermittent funding to NGOs.

In 2005, law 3386/2005 was passed to better assist victims of trafficking; however, victim identification continues to be a weak point of Greek anti-trafficking efforts.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; The government officially identified only 125 human trafficking victims in 2009, an improvement over the 78 victims identified in 2008.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; The government continued to operate a short-term shelter, which could accommodate children, in addition to two long-term shelters for women. The government also referred child victims to orphanages or detention centers that did not have specialized facilities for trafficking victims. One NGO reported that authorities released unaccompanied foreign minors onto the street with little support after detention. The government encouraged victims to participate in prosecutions by offering a 30-day reflection period, a time for victims to receive immediate care while they consider whether to assist law enforcement, but according to NGOs, authorities did not always provide the reflection period consistently during the reporting period. Victims who assisted with law enforcement prosecutions qualified for temporary, renewable residence permits as a legal alternative to removal. NGOs reported excellent cooperation with specialized anti-trafficking police units. Overall, the government did not penalize victims for unlawful acts that may have been committed as a direct result of being trafficked. However, some NGOs reported that the coast guard and border police, overwhelmed with processing refugees and undocumented migrants, had little time to use victim identification procedures. As a result, they sent many potential victims, including vulnerable unaccompanied minors, to migrant detention centers, where they often faced poor conditions. In a positive development, the government implemented a child repatriation agreement with [[Albania]], repatriating six Albanian child victims in cooperation with NGOs.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

===Prevention===
The government has demonstrated steady progress in the prevention of trafficking. In 2009, a state television station aired a special on human trafficking in Greece in addition to other programs on the topic.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] spoke out against trafficking, and since October 2009, anti-trafficking NGOs have reported stronger partnerships with high-level officials. The government, in partnership with [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], provided anti-trafficking training for police recruits and commanders, police from neighboring countries, and over 100 judges and prosecutors. The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] provided $155,100 toward a [[UNICEF]] campaign on [[trafficking of children]] as a global phenomenon and funded an [[International Organization for Migration]]-produced public awareness campaign acknowledging trafficking as a problem in Greece. The government did not run any new campaigns targeting the clients of prostitution or beneficiaries of forced labor. The government implemented a law enforcement-focused national plan of anti-trafficking action; however, the government lacked a central authority to coordinate ministries’ anti-trafficking efforts and monitor anti-trafficking results. Coordination of data between agencies remained ad hoc. The Greek government facilitated anti-trafficking partnerships by funding initiatives in neighboring countries. Greek law provide extraterritorial jurisdiction over [[child sex tourism]] offenses by its nationals; the government did not report any prosecutions of Greek citizens for child sex tourism during the reporting period. The government gave its peacekeeping troops anti-trafficking training before deploying them abroad. Since 2011, Greece is a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

==NGO anti-trafficking efforts==
In addition to governmental efforts, several [[non-governmental organization]]s, or NGOs, are also making strides to combat trafficking in Greece. NGOs reported that government grant disbursement delays, onerous reporting requirements, and deteriorating public finances have created financial difficulty for trafficking victim service providers dependent on government funding &lt;ref name=dos/&gt; In 2001, StopNow project was launched to raise awareness and lobby public organizations on trafficking issues.&lt;ref name="papadimos"/&gt; The [[List of Greek think tanks|Marangopoulos Foundation for Human Rights]] conducts and analyses research on trafficking in women in Greece.&lt;ref name="lazaridis" /&gt; The [[A21 Campaign]], an NGO founded in 2008, promotes awareness about human trafficking, and rehabilitates and provides legal support to survivors. In 2009 A21 opened a crisis shelter for victims in [[Thessaloniki]] and works with the Greek government to assist trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt; The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] works closely with the NGO “Smile of a Child” to implement an [[amber alert]] program aimed at helping trafficked missing children.&lt;ref name="lymouris" /&gt; The Greek NGO “KEPAD” (Human Rights Defense Center) works to establish and maintain a network or anti-trafficking NGOs in the Balkan region that work cooperatively to combat trafficking.&lt;ref name="lymouris" /&gt; NGOs, some of whom received government funding, reported assisting at least 3,376 trafficking victims in 2009, significantly more than the 125 victims identified by the government.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Remaining challenges==
As of 2012, the Greek government has made important strides in anti-trafficking efforts by tightening legislation and increasing the services and assistance to victims of trafficking in recent years. However, the current [[Greek government-debt crisis|economic crisis]] in Greece has vastly limited the government’s ability to help trafficking victims; severe economic conditions have taken resources and attention away from the issue of human trafficking. While the country remains in economic crisis, funding to various social services and anti-trafficking efforts will remain low as economic [[bailout]] money is allocated elsewhere.&lt;ref name="papadimos" /&gt;

'''Human–lion conflict''' refers to the pattern of problematic interactions between native people and lions.  Conflict with humans is a major contributor of the decline in [[lion]] populations in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazzah | first1 = L. | last2 = Dolrenry | first2 = S. | last3 = Naughton | first3 = L. | last4 = Edwards | first4 = C.T.T. | last5 = Mwebi | first5 = O. | last6 = Kearney | first6 = F. | last7 = Frank | first7 = L. | year = 2014 | title = Efficacy of two lion conservation programs in Maasailand, Kenya | doi = 10.1111/cobi.1224 | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 851–860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Habitat destruction|Habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] due to conversion of land for agriculture has forced lions to live in closer proximity to human settlements.&lt;ref name=Abade2014&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abade | first1 = L. | last2 = MacDonald | first2 = D.W. | last3 = Dickman | first3 = A.J. | year = 2014 | title = Assessing the relative importance of landscape and husbandry factors in determining large carnivore depredation risk in Tanzania's Ruaha landscape | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2014.10.005 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 180 | issue = | pages = 241–248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, conflict is often characterized by lions preying upon [[livestock]], known as livestock depredation.  When depredation events take place, farmers suffer financial losses and lions face threats of retaliatory killing.

==Causes of conflict==
The main cause of conflict is habitat loss.&lt;ref name=Abade2014 /&gt;  83% of the African lion's range has been reduced and what remains is increasingly fragmented.&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazzah | first1 = L. | last2 = Borgerhoof Mulder | first2 = M. | last3 = Frank | first3 = L. | year = 2009 | title = Lions and warriors: Social factors underlying declining African lion populations and the effect of incentive-based management in Kenya | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2009.06/006 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 142 | issue = | pages = 2428–2437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lions, as large [[carnivore]]s, rely on large connected expanses of land.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt2014&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenblatt | first1 = E. | last2 = Becker | first2 = M.S. | last3 = Creel | first3 = S. | last4 = Droge | first4 = E. | last5 = Mweetwa | first5 = T. | last6 = Schuette | first6 = P.A. | last7 = Watson | first7 = F. | last8 = Merkle | first8 =  | last9 = Mwape | first9 = H. | year = 2014 | title = Detecting declines of apex carnivores and evaluating their causes: an example with Zambian lions | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2014.10.006 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 180 | issue = | pages = 176–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conversion of their habitat into agricultural land prevents them from dispersing and can limit the availability of natural prey.&lt;ref name=Schuette2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schuette | first1 = P. | last2 = Creel | first2 = S. | last3 = Christianson | first3 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Coexistence of African lions, livestock, and people in a landscape with variable human land use and seasonal movements | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 157 | issue = | pages = 148–154 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2012.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bauer2010&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bauer | first1 = H. | last2 = de Iongh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sogbohossou | first3 = E. | year = 2010 | title = Assessment and mitigation of human-lion conflict in West and Central Africa | doi = 10.1515/MAMM.2010.048 | journal = Mammalia | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 363–367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lions are therefore roaming closer to farms than before and are at a higher risk of preying on livestock.

===Ecological variables===
There are many ecological variables that can affect likelihood of depredation.  Factors such as farms' distance from water sources,&lt;ref name=Abade2014 /&gt; [[protected area]]s,&lt;ref name=Schuette2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thorn2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thorn | first1 = M. | last2 = Green | first2 = M. | last3 = Dalerum | first3 = F. | last4 = Bateman | first4 = P.W. | last5 = Scott | first5 = D.M. | year = 2012 | title = What drives human carnivore conflict in the North West province of South Africa? | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2012.02.017 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 23–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; elevation&lt;ref name=Abade2014 /&gt; and surrounding vegetative cover&lt;ref name =Schuette2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thorn2012 /&gt; may all play a role.  Some research has shown that depredation decreases with distance from protected areas.&lt;ref name=Thorn2012 /&gt;  This could be because access to nearby conservation areas provides lions with a refuge when coming into contact with humans.&lt;ref name=Schuette2013 /&gt;  Farms that are located close to water sources and at a low elevation may be especially vulnerable to conflict.&lt;ref name=Abade2014 /&gt;  The effect of vegetative cover remains unclear.  Dense vegetative cover has been associated with a higher rate of depredation&lt;ref name=Thorn2012 /&gt; yet has also been shown to reduce depredation as it allows predators to hide from humans.&lt;ref name=Schuette2013 /&gt;  Farm and livestock management can also affect chances of depredation.  [[Pen (enclosure)|Corralling]] livestock at night&lt;ref name=Schuette2013 /&gt; as well as providing guards to monitor lion movements to prevent and deter [[predation]]&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014 /&gt; can limit losses.

==Financial losses==
Depredation events lead to financial losses to farmers who rely on livestock as a source of income.  In the [[North West (South African province)|North West province]] of [[South Africa]], around $375, 797USD were lost as a result of game and livestock losses caused by depredation.&lt;ref name=Thorn2012 /&gt;  It should be noted that lions are not the only predators involved, with [[hyena]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[Wild Dog|wild dog]]s responsible for depredation events as well.&lt;ref name=Schuette2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kissui2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kissui | first1 = B.M. | year = 2008 | title = Livestock predation by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and their vulnerability to retaliatory killing in the Maasai steppe, Tanzania | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00199.x | journal = Animal Conservation | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 422–432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, lions typically attack cattle which incur higher financial losses than sheep and goats (hunted by hyenas and leopards).&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt;

===Compensation===
In order to lessen these financial losses, some regions offer financial compensation to affected farmers.  However, these programs are not always effective.  Major criticisms revolve around the response times of programs, arguing that they take too long or do not happen at all.  Additionally, farmers do not always receive sufficient financial restitution. For example, as of 2009, [[Botswana]]'s state-funded compensation program only compensated farmers for 80% of the value they lost.  It is common for farmers to not even report livestock losses due in part to dissatisfaction with response time and amount.&lt;ref name=Hemson2009&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemson | first1 = G. | last2 = Maclennan | first2 = S. | last3 = Mills | first3 = G. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = P. | last5 = Macdonald | first5 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Community, lions,livestock and money: a spatial and social analysis of attitudes to wildlife and the conservation value of tourism in a human-carnivore conflict in Botswana | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2009.06.024 | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 142 | issue = | pages = 2718–2725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Predator Compensation Fund (PCF) in Massailand, [[Kenya]] has reduced retaliatory killings following depredation events by 73%, illustrating that when done correctly, compensation programs can be effective.&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014 /&gt;  Farmers who have received compensation have also reported a lower likelihood of killing a suspected lion than those who have not received any.&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt;  Regardless of their efficacy, compensation programs are reactionary and not preventative, only seeking to mitigate farmers' losses after the event and do not address underlying causes of conflict&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014 /&gt;

==Retaliatory killing==
Retaliatory killing is the hunting of a suspected predator after a depredation event.  While a threat for all predators, lions are killed disproportionately to the number of losses they are responsible for as opposed to [[hyena]]s and [[leopard]]s.&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt;  One reason lions are killed in retaliation more than other carnivores is because of their propensity to kill [[cattle]] more than [[sheep]] and [[goats]].&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt;  Because cattle are of more financial value to farmers than sheep and goats, the desire to retaliate can be greater.  Lions also will hunt during the night when most attacks take place,&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt; are easier to track,&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt; and are more likely to defend a carcass which make them more vulnerable to being killed by humans&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt;

===Likelihood of retaliation===
Social and economic differences also impact motivation to [[lion hunting|hunt lions]] in reaction to livestock losses.  People who have lost a higher proportion of their livestock to depredation (often those with smaller farms to begin with) as well as those owning livestock for the purpose of sale as opposed to traditional or subsistence reasons have been found to report a higher willingness to retaliate.&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt;  Both higher proportional losses and keeping livestock for sale increase the value of cattle and therefore increase the financial incentive to kill suspected predators.  Likelihood to retaliate has also been shown to be influenced by social factors such as [[religion]]&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt; and [[culture]]&lt;ref name=Thorn2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt;

==Reducing conflict==
Due to the complex social, economic, and ecological aspects of human-lion conflict, it is recommended that mitigation strategies be adaptable and situation-specific.&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schuette2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thorn2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt;  Specific actions such as providing guards to monitor predators and protect cattle,&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014 /&gt; corralling livestock at night,&lt;ref name=Schuette2013 /&gt; providing compensation&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014 /&gt; and restoring natural prey densities&lt;ref name=Bauer2010 /&gt; may reduce conflict in some areas.  Focusing on unique conservation programs that take into account factors such as culture&lt;ref name=Hazzah2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thorn2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt; and religion,&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt; type of livestock owned,&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kissui2008 /&gt; and reason for owning livestock&lt;ref name=Hazzah2009 /&gt; may also be helpful.

'''Hunting in Russia''' has an old tradition in terms of [[List of indigenous peoples of Russia|indigenous people]], while the original features of state and princely economy were farming and cattle-breeding. There was [[hunting]] for food as well as sport. The word "hunting" ("охота", ''okhota'') first appeared in the common [[Russian language]] at the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="HNT"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first =  |authorlink = | coauthors = | script-title=ru:Охота. Период Российского государства| work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://hunt-story.spb.ru/index/rus/| format =| doi = | accessdate = 2007-06-09|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that the word "catchings" ("ловы", ''lovy'') existed to designate the hunting business in general.&lt;ref name="HNT"/&gt; The hunting grounds were called in turn ''lovishcha'' ("ловища").&lt;ref name="HNT"/&gt; In the 15th-16th centuries, foreign ambassadors were frequently invited to hunts; they also received some of the prey afterwards. So did [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor I]] in particular, once sending out nine [[elk]]s, one [[bear]] and a black-and-brown [[fox]].

The right of using the hunting grounds in Russia was once granted to every social class. The right of the nobility was even sometimes limited by agreements with others regarding hunting grounds. The [[falconry|hawkers]] and separate persons who dealt with [[hound]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[black grouse]]s, [[hare]]s, etc. were permitted either on the landed properties, or on territories specified by local people. Though the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] clergy once disapproved the hunting, these persons were authorized to eat and feed their horses, hounds and falcons on others' account or even demand participation in hunting.&lt;ref&gt;''Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers ([[Grand Prince]]s and [[Tsar#Russia|Tsar]]s), under the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial hunts were organized mainly in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]] and [[Gatchina]].

During the soviet rule, state-sponsored hunting clubs were formed within the administrative boundaries or factories. Hunting clubs based in cities were allocated hunting grounds where club members were allowed to hunt according to the federal and local regulations.  Following demise of the Soviet Union private individuals were allowed to lease hunting territories formerly used by government sponsored clubs. Many lease owners are wealthy Russians who are willing to spend large sums of money in order to maintain leased hunting grounds for their pleasure and sometimes to allow other hunters to use their territories for a fee. As a result, the quality and quantity of the game increased dramatically during the past 20 years in most parts of Russia.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} During the Soviet Union time, a single agency called "Glavohota" was granted an authority to conduct hunts for the foreign hunters. Nowadays many outfitters and booking agents organize hunting trips for the foreigners. The inevitable competition between such companies improved quality of hunts and brought down the prices which used to be extremely high.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Big game==

===Bear===
Russia's northeast part, the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] and the coastal regions of the [[Pacific Ocean]], have the highest density of [[brown bear]]s. There are [[Eurasian brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos arctos''), [[Siberian brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos beringianus''), [[Syrian brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos syriacus''), [[Ussuri brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos lasiotus''), etc. 
 
[[Grand Prince of Moscow]] [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV Vasilyevich]] was present at the bear hunts at the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;Карамзин, Н. М. ''История государства Российского'', т. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; [[False Dmitriy I]] was especially keen on bear hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Карамзин, Н. М. ''История государства Российского'', т. XI; Буссов, К. ''Московская хроника. 1584–1613''. М.-Л., 1961., с. 111&lt;/ref&gt; A legend describes the miraculous salvation of Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]] from a bear by [[Saint Sava]]. After 1650/51 the bear hunts of Tsars became rare. In 2007 Russia proposed to allow [[polar bear|polar bear hunting]] by the [[Chukchi people]], for the first time since the [[Soviet Union]] banned hunting the dwindling species in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Wolf ===
{{main|Wolf hunting}}
The wolf is the most widespread large indigenous [[game animal]] in Russia.&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Wolf Hunting in Russia| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.russianhunting.com/wolf-hunting-in-russia/| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070531113840/http://www.russianhunting.com/wolf-hunting-in-russia/| archivedate =2007-05-31| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best hunting time is considered to be January–February.&lt;ref name="HT"/&gt; 
[[File:Provedenie meropriyatii po otstrelu vrednyh givotnyh na territorii Kamyshinskogo raiona Volgogradskoi oblasti.jpg|thumb|Carcasses of hunted wolves in [[Kamyshinsky District]], [[Volgograd Oblast]], [[Russia]].]]
Wolves were hunted in both [[Russian Empire|Czarist]] and Soviet Russia with [[borzoi]] by landowners and [[Cossack]]s.&lt;ref name="control"&gt;''Chapter 10: Wolf Control Methods'' in Will Graves, and Valerius Geist, editors. ''Wolves in Russia''. Detselig Enterprises Ltd. 210, 1220 Kensington Road NW, Calgary, Alberta T2N 3P5. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Covers were drawn by sending mounted men through a wood with a number of dogs of various breeds,&lt;ref name="rassiya"/&gt; including deerhounds, staghounds and Siberian wolfhounds, as well as smaller greyhounds and foxhounds,&lt;ref name="lopez"&gt;''Chapter 8: Wolfing for Sport'' in Barry Lopez' ''Of Wolves and Men'', 1978 Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; as they made more noise than borzoi.&lt;ref name="rassiya"/&gt; A beater, holding up to six dogs by leash, would enter a wooded area where wolves would have been previously sighted.&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt; Other hunters on horseback would select a place in the open where the wolf or wolves may break. Each hunter held one or two borzois, which would be slipped the moment the wolf takes flight.&lt;ref name="rassiya"/&gt; Once the beater sighted a wolf, he would shout "Loup! Loup! Loup!" and slip the dogs. Thea idea was to trap the wolf between the pursuing dogs and the hunters on horseback outside the wood.&lt;ref name="lopez"/&gt; The borzois would pursue the wolf along with the horsemen and yapping curs. Once the wolf was caught by the borzois, the foremost rider would dismount and quickly dispatch the wolf with a knife. Occasionally, wolves are captured alive in order to better train borzoi pups.&lt;ref name="rassiya"&gt;''Russia As I Know It'', by Harry De Windt, Published by BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009, {{ISBN|1-103-19677-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-103-19677-7}}, 272 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]], wolf hunting was done solely by authorised firearm holders, usually police, soldiers, rich landowners or nobles. Upon learning of the frequency of attacks on livestock and humans, the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|Czarist Ministry of the Interior]] sent agents to Western Europe in order to learn how the people there dealt with wolf problems.  Upon returning, the Ministry of Internal Affairs developed a plan in 1846 to deal with wolves involving the opening of wolf bounties and appointment of government hunters. Each hunter was given jurisdiction to hunt in one district, with more than one for large areas. Hunters were given 3 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] for each male wolf killed and 1.5 for each cub, with a tail presented as proof. Each hunter would receive an annual salary of 60 rubles a year, provided he kill 15 adults and 30 cubs a year.  Peasant hunters however were rarely rewarded, due to corrupt bureaucrats stealing the money.  In 1858, after paying $1 250 000 for over a million wolves in Central Russia, officials became suspicious, and discovered that some hunters bought wolf pelts for low prices, cut them up and handed them to magistrates as wolf tails. In the latter years of the 19th century, Russian hunting societies began an energetic campaign against wolves. In 1897, members of the Moscow Hunting Society killed their first 1000 wolves, though the number of professional wolf hunters at the time was rather low. [[Serf]]s began hunting wolves after their emancipation in 1861, though rarely with success, as civilian firearms were highly expensive, and the cheaper ones were usually primitive and unable to bare the heavy ammunition necessary to kill wolves.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite book | author=Graves, Will |url=http://www.wolvesinrussia.com/ | title=Wolves in Russia: Anxiety throughout the ages | year=2007 | page=222 | isbn=1-55059-332-3 | publisher=Detselig Enterprises | location=Calgary | accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution (1917)]], the newly formed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government worked heavily to eradicate wolves and other predators during an extensive land reclamation program.&lt;ref name="RUSWH"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wolfsongalaska.org/wolf_russia_history.html| title = ''Hunting A History of Wolves in Russia''| work = Evgeni Okhtin| publisher = Wolf Song of Alaska| accessdate = 2007-09-12| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19991022033534/http://www.wolfsongalaska.org/wolf_russia_history.html| archivedate = 1999-10-22| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|the Eastern Front]], wolf populations increased, though after [[Nazi Germany]]'s defeat, wolf hunts resumed. With the end of the war and the onset of aerial hunting, the USSR destroyed 42,300 wolves in 1945, 62,700 wolves in 1946, 58,700 wolves in 1947, 57,600 in 1948, and 55,300 in 1949. From 1950 to 1954, an average of 50,000 wolves were killed annually. In 1966, wolves had been successfully exterminated in 30 [[oblast]]s of the [[RSFSR]]. During this time, wolf depredations on humans and livestock had dropped by a factor of ten. However, with the publishing of a [[Russian language|Russian]] translation of [[Farley Mowatt]]'s [[fictional]] book ''[[Never Cry Wolf]]'', wolf hunts decreased in popularity. Amid public outcry, Czarist and Soviet records of wolf attacks on both livestock and people were ignored and wolf hunts decreased in number, allowing wolves to multiply. 15,900 wolves were reportedly culled from the [[RSFSR]] in 1978, compared to 7,900 two years prior. With an increase in population, twice as many wolves were culled in the 1980s than in the prior decade.&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; Wolves became extinct in [[Wrangel Island]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Russki"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/features/284feature1.shtml | title =  In defence of Russia's wolves | work = | publisher = bbc.co.uk| accessdate = 2008-04-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406150238/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/features/284feature1.shtml |archivedate=2005-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the RSFSR had over 2000 wolf hunting brigades consisting of 15,000 hunters who killed 16 400 wolves.&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; Overall, the Soviet Union culled over 1 500 000 wolves for a cost of 150,000,000 rubles on bounties alone. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], many wolf bounties were lowered or dropped altogether.&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; Wolf hunting continues in Russia, at the expense of individual hunters rather than the government.&lt;ref name="Волки"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gazeta.aif.ru/online/aif/1102/07_02| script-title=ru:Волки: серое нашествие | work =  | publisher = Аргументы и факты | accessdate = 2008-08-14|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunting with hounds==
{{further|Borzoi|West Siberian Laika}}
[[File:PeterII&amp;Elizaveta.jpg|thumb|left|''Peter II and his aunt [[Elizaveta Petrovna]] go hunting'', a 1900 painting by [[Alexandre Benois]].]]
Under Grand Duke [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]], who personally loved the huntings for hare, there were over one hundred chasseurs who dealt particularly with wolves and foxes.&lt;ref name="OVR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Савченко |first=Борис |authorlink= |coauthors= |script-title=ru:Под царским прицелом |work= |publisher=Отдых в России |date= |url=http://www.rustur.ru/news/news1632.html |doi= |accessdate=2007-06-09 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227180319/http://www.rustur.ru/news/news1632.html |archivedate=2007-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court hunt of that time embraced the chasseurs with hounds (выжлятники), their head (доезжачий), [[borzoi]] hunters (борзятники), dog-breeders and beaters. Additionally there were cooks, grooms and drivers. Depending on the number of hounds there were big and small hunts. The first one involved forty hounds and twelve packs of three borzois each, and the second consisted of eighteen hounds and twenty borzois in five packs.&lt;ref name="OVR"/&gt;

The gunless hunting with hounds, particularly for hares or foxes, became widespread in the Russian Empire in the 18th-19th centuries, after the reign of [[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna]] who liked gun [[deerstalking]]. [[Peter II of Russia|Emperor Peter II]] and [[Empress Elizabeth]] were among the most prominent lovers of hunting with hounds. The longest hunt of Peter II took place in 1729 in [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], where fifty foxes, five bears, five [[lynx]]es and many hares were baited between September 7 and October 16. In that time the state kennel consisted of two hundred hounds and 420 borzois. [[Poaching]] has been fought notably by Empress Anna and [[Empress Catherine II]].

As landlords, counts and dukes had kennels, there were stables and villages with serfs, who sowed oats which was to be mixed with meat as a hound forage. Each kennel could support up to 1,000 hounds.&lt;ref name="HOU"&gt;{{cite web|last=Соловьев |first=Евгений |authorlink= |coauthors= |script-title=ru:Охота с гончими как зеркало общественных трансформаций |work= |publisher=Независимая Газета |date= |url=http://www.hunter.ru/hunting/articles/nezavisimaja.htm |doi= |accessdate=2007-06-09 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329212443/http://www.hunter.ru/hunting/articles/nezavisimaja.htm |archivedate=2007-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] put an end to hunting with hounds. In 1917 there were only two hound chases in the fading Russian Empire: Gatchina and [[Pershino]], in the Tula Governorate.&lt;ref name="HOU"/&gt;

==Hunting birds==
[[File:Chetverikova-Avanzo hunt.jpg|thumb|125px|Noblewomen hunting. Taken in the 1890s.]]
Orthodox martyr [[Tryphon of Campsada|Saint Trifon]] is often depicted with a white [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]] on his hand. Particularly the name of [[Moscow]]'s [[Sokolniki Park]] refers to the rapid spread of [[falconry]]-related ''[[sloboda]]s'' in Tsarist Russia. As indicated by English diplomat [[Jerome Horsey]], [[Boris Godunov]] used to be a hawker. Meanwhile, the use of hunting birds was already popular among Russian nobility in the times of the [[Golden Horde]].&lt;ref name="FALC"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first =  |authorlink = | coauthors = | script-title=ru:Русский соколиный центр| work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.deol.ru/nature/falcon/| format =| doi = | accessdate = 2007-06-10|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several hundred such birds in possession of Ivan IV, and even the road tax was collected in pigeons for falcons.&lt;ref name="FALC"/&gt; However, the first famous hawker was Alexis I, who created the falconry statute book (''Урядник сокольничья пути''). The white, red or speckled merlins were also in common usage in those days. The merlin cocks were called ''cheligi'' (челиги). The places where the birds were caught were called ''pomchishcha'' (помчища) and the catchers - ''pomytchiki'' (помытчики). Before the reign of Feodor I each ''pomytchik'' community annually delivered three living falcons to the prince's falcon loft. In the time of Feodor I it became necessary to obtain two red merlins, three speckled and thirty-five grey.

There were two state merlin lofts, in Semyonovskoye (in modern [[Sokolniki Park]]) and [[Kolomenskoye]]. An Italian ambassador, [[Horatio Calvucci]], had been trying to get in and sketch at least one bird for six months; the embassy finally gained an access on February 13, 1662. In 1805 there were only fifteen hunting birds left in Semyonovskoye. The last event with hunting birds occurred during the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. The [[golden eagle]]s were taken from Orenburg Governorate to hunt for wolves and foxes at that time.

==Walrus==
The first mention of Russia-related [[walrus]] hunting, in the [[Arctic]] part of the [[Northern Atlantic]], is dated back to the late 9th century.&lt;ref name="WAL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yurchenko |first=A |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Russian walrus hunting: history of crisis in the 19th century |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.vitiaz.ru/congress/en/thesis/101.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040114201801/http://vitiaz.ru/congress/en/thesis/101.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-01-14 |doi= |accessdate=2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the [[Viking]] [[Ohthere of Hålogaland]], sailing along the [[Kola Peninsula]], landed somewhere on the [[White Sea]] coast and established trade relations with aboriginal people for [[walrus ivory]].&lt;ref name="WAL"/&gt; The [[Slavs]] and [[Saami people]], who penetrated to this area in the early 12th century, could only hunt for small groups of walruses and came to the northern part of the White Sea from time to time.&lt;ref name="WAL"/&gt; The Russian walrus hunting in that region started in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name="WAL"/&gt; Purposeful and mass walrus hunting was stimulated by the exploration of the Arctic [[archipelago]]es [[Novaya Zemlya]] and [[Spitsbergen]] with adjacent areas where the large walrus rookeries were concentrated. The collapse of Russian walrus hunting happened at the first half of the 19th century, being a result of interaction of both [[ecology|ecological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] factors.&lt;ref name="WAL"/&gt;

There is an increasing trend among users of online matrimony sites in India to declare one's willingness to marry outside their caste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caste-no-bar-in-words-if-not-in-action/article4989269.ece thehindu.com: 'Caste no bar', in words if not in action]&lt;/ref&gt; While the secular Government does not object to inter-caste marriage, in much of conservative society such marriages are taboo, and can result in ostracisation of not just the married couple but both families from respective communities. Inter-caste marriages can also prove troublesome for offspring who do not belong to either caste, and the difficulties in adopting cultural practices which vary from caste to caste. Conservative critics feel that inter-caste marriage leads to a loss of cultural heterogeneity and value.

==History==
The Kassena people are part of the greater [[Gurunsi]] group and were separated from the Gurunsi ethnic group at the beginning of the 20th century, as a consequence of [[colonialism]] and more specifically of the partitioning of the [[Burkina Faso]]-[[Ghana]] area between [[France]] and [[United Kingdom]]. As most of the Gurunsi people live in Burkina, the Kassena were isolated and gradually developed an independent cultural identity. Kassena mostly live on [[agriculture]], growing [[millet]], [[sorghum]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] and, to a lesser extent, [[maize]], [[rice]], [[Peanut|groundnut]]s, [[bean]]s. During the dry season they also hunt and fish.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

==Society==
Traditional Kassena society is grouped into chiefdoms, five of whom are predominant:Navrongo, Paga, Chiana, Kayoro, Katiu and Nakon.&lt;ref name = "nankani"/&gt;

==Home Call==
The Belgian anthropologist, [[Ann Cassiman]], conducted detailed ethnographic accounts of the Kassena. In her book “Stirring Life: Women's Paths and Places Among the Kasena of Northern Ghana”,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Stirring-Life-Northern-Cultural-Anthropology/dp/9155465986 Stirring Life Northern Cultural Anthropology]. ''[[amazon.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; she elaborates on the material culture, rituals and social practices as experienced in a rural Kassena village. This research also led to a museum exhibition entitled 'Home Call', housed by the [[Museum Aan de Stroom]] (MAS) in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuleuven.be/english/newsletter/newsflash/home_call.html Home Call]. ''kuleuven.be''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cawishana''' (Kawishana, Kaishana) is an [[Arawakan language]], presumably extinct, of [[Brazil]]. A few speakers were reported in the 1950s. 

Aikhenvald (1999) classifies it as a Middle Rio Negro, North Amazonian language, along with [[Shiriana language|Shiriana]] and [[Manao language|Manao]]. Kaufman (1994) had placed it in a branch of Western Nawiki Upper Amazonian along with two long-extinct languages, Jumana (Yumana) and Pasé, which Aikhenvald leaves unclassified. It had an [[active–stative]] syntax.

'''Keith Rapp''' (also known as W. Keith Rapp) is a judge on the [[Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals]], the intermediate appellate court in the state of [[Oklahoma]]. He represents District 2, Office 2. A native of Ohio, he earned his J.D. degree from the University of Tulsa Law School 

==Biography==
Judge Rapp was born on May 2, 1934 in [[Wheelersburg, Ohio]]. He received his undergraduate degree from [[Missouri State University]] and took graduate classes in mathematics and statistics from the [[University of Missouri]], [[University of Minnesota]] and [[University of Arizona]]. Rapp then worked as an [[aerospace engineer]] on many major [[N.A.S.A.]] projects before receiving his J.D. degree from the [[University of Tulsa]]. Rapp later earned a Master of Laws degree from the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="OCJC"&gt;[http://okciviljustice.com/keith "Keith Rapp." Oklahoma Civil Justice Council. 2018.] Accessed May 7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Military service and aerospace career==
From 1953 to 1955, he served in the [[US Navy]], completing two tours of duty in the Far East as an aerial navigator and electronics warfare operator with the VC-35. Later, he retired from the U.S. Naval Reserves as a Judge Advocate General Corps commander.&lt;ref name="OCJC"/&gt;

Returning to civilian life, Rapp went to work as an aerospace engineer, specializing in inertial guidance and navigation systems. Some of his projects included Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and SkyLab for the U.S. space program and Bomarc, the first operational surface-to-air missile for the Department of Defense. While working as an engineer, he enrolled in the University of Tulsa School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.&lt;ref name="OCJC"/&gt; Later, he earned the LLM degree from the University of Virginia.{{efn|According to the University of Virginia alumni publication, Rapp graduated in the class of 1990.&lt;ref name="UVA Lawyer"&gt;[http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/alumni/uvalawyer/sp06/90.htm "1990s Class Notes." ''UVA Lawyer''. Spring 1996.] Accessed May 7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After completing law school at the University of Tulsa, Judge Rapp served as a [[public defender]] and [[city prosecutor]] in [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma]].  He later served as a municipal judge in [[Bixby, Oklahoma]] and then an alternative municipal judge in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].  After this, he was judge on the 14th District Court in Tulsa. He stood for election against incumbent Judge [[Fred DeMier]] for the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals in 1984. It was the first time a challenger had unseated an incumbent since the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals was created in 1969.&lt;ref name="NewsOK"&gt;[http://newsok.com/article/2087547 "Court of Appeals Judge Unseated."

[[File:制服 (5346443876).jpg|thumb|''Kogal'' girls, identified by shortened [[Japanese school uniform]] skirts and [[loose socks]].]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kogal'''''|コギャル|kogyaru}} is a Japanese fashion culture that involves schoolgirls wearing an outfit based on their [[Japanese school uniform|uniform]], but with very short skirts. The short skirts are worn irrespective of the season. The girls may also wear [[loose socks]] and scarves, and have dyed hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/11/12/business/man-who-gave-us-loose-white-socks-eyes-comeback/|title=Man who gave us loose white socks eyes comeback|first=Taiga|last=Uranaka|date=12 November 2003|publisher=|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/japans-schoolgirls-set-the-trend-1295844.html|title=Japan's schoolgirls set the trend|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "kogal" is anglicized from ''kogyaru'', a contraction of ''kōkōsei gyaru'' (high school gal). The girls refer to themselves as ''[[gyaru]]'' (gals), although this word is applied to several other fashion looks as well.

Aside from the [[miniskirt]] or [[microskirt]], and the [[loose socks]], kogals favor platform boots, makeup, and Burberry scarves. They may also dye their hair brown and get artificial suntans. They have a distinctive slang peppered with English words. They are often, but not necessarily, enrolled students. Centers of kogal culture include the [[Harajuku]] and [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] districts of [[Tokyo]], in particular Shibuya's [[109 (department store)|109 Building]]. [[Pop music|Pop]] singer [[Namie Amuro]] promoted the style. Kogals are avid users of photo booths, with most visiting at least once a week, according to non-scientific polls.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Miller, Jan Bardsle, ''Bad Girls of Japan'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; While critics condemned the ''gyaru'' as shallow, materialistic, and devoted to [[conspicuous consumption]], admirers describe them as "kindhearted, active young women in exuberant health, the women of today."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nobukatsu.blog32.fc2.com/blog-category-18.html since 1970]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "kogal" is a contraction of {{nihongo3|"high school gal"|高校生ギャル|kōkōsei gyaru}}.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Laura, "Those Naughty Teenage Girls: Japanese Kogals, Slang, and Media Assessments", ''Journal of Linguistic Anthropology'': Volume 14: Number 2 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as a code used by disco bouncers to distinguish adults from minors.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; The term is not used by the girls it refers to. They call themselves {{nihongo3||ギャル|[[gyaru]]}}, a Japanese pronunciation of the English word "gal."&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; The term ''gyaru'' was first popularized in 1972 by a television ad for a brand of jeans.&lt;ref name="Shiro"&gt;"[http://www.style-arena.jp/en/tribe/0016.html Shiro Gal (Light Skin Gal)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501011547/http://www.style-arena.jp/en/tribe/0016.html |date=2009-05-01 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, a ''gyaru'' was a fashionably dressed woman.&lt;ref name="Shiro"/&gt; When written 子, ''ko'' means "young woman," so ''kogyaru'' is sometimes understood in the sense of "young gal."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fecielo.com/osaka-japan Osaka - Japan]"&lt;/ref&gt; However, if this was the meaning originally intended, {{nihongo3|"young gal"|若いギャル|wakai gyaru}} would be more logical.

==Character==
[[File:Ganguro3.jpg|thumb|A kogal (with shortened skirt) and a [[Yamanba]] (wearing ''Manba'' makeup)]]
Kogals have been accused of [[conspicuous consumption]], living off their parents and ''[[enjo-kosai]]'' (amateur prostitution/dating service). Critics decry their [[materialism]] as reflecting a larger psychological or spiritual emptiness in modern Japanese life. Some kogals support their lifestyle with allowances from wealthy parents, living a "[[parasite single]]" existence that grates against traditional principles of duty and industry. "The modern school girls' uniform, embellished with loose socks and a cellular phone, has come to be perceived as the dress code for promiscuity, easiness, greed, and stupidity," according to one commentator.&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;Sky Whitehead, "[http://www.giantrobot.com/issues/issue11/kogals/index.html K is for Kogal] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60v06ECXu?url=http://www.giantrobot.com/issues/issue11/kogals/index.html |date=2011-08-13 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have charged that the kogal phenomenon is less about the girls and their fashions than a media practice to fetishize school uniforms and blame those required to wear them.&lt;ref name="Kinsella"/&gt; "I wish that I were in high school at a different time," said one schoolgirl. "Now, with kogal being such an issue in Japan, nobody can see me for me. They only see me as kogal, like the ones they see on TV."&lt;ref name="Sky"/&gt; As for the accusation of conspicuous consumption, careful gal shoppers may know a thing or two about fashion that the journalists and movie directors who accuse them do not. For every high-priced brand-name accessory, there is an off-brand version that goes for a fraction of the price. These are sold at stalls in back-alley markets like ''ura Harajuku''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Laura |editor1-last=Mathews |editor1-first=Gordon |editor2-last=White |editor2-first=Bruce |title=Japan's Changing Generations: Are Young People Creating a New Society? |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134353897 |pages=87–88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4K2D1O5tkQC&amp;pg=PA87|chapter=Youth fashion and beautification}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fdHZAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=japanese+schoolgirls+fashion+magazine&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Japanese Schoolgirl Confidential: How Teenage Girls Made a Nation Cool]'' (Tuttle Publishing, 2014), {{ISBN|9781462914098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kogals were far from the first generation of Japanese girls who ''oya o nakaseru'' (made their parents weep) and inspired salacious media exposés. The ''daraku jogakusei'' (degenerate schoolgirls) of the early 1900s violated taboos against dating, while the ''moga'', or [[modern girl]], of the 1920s, adopted Western fashions. The hard-partying "Mambo girl" arose in the late 1950s.

Japanese fashion began to divide by age in the 1970s with the appearance of ''gyaru'' magazines aimed at teens. ''[[Popteen]]'', the most widely read of these magazines, has been publishing monthly since 1980. While mainstream fashion in the 1980s and early 1990s emphasized girlish and cute (''kawaii''), ''gyaru'' publications promoted a sexy aesthetic.&lt;ref name="Kinsella146"&gt;Kinsella, Sharon, "Black faces, witches and racism", ''Bad Girls of Japan'', edited by  Laura Miller, Jan Bardsley, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Top ''gyaru'' magazines, including ''[[Popteen]]'', ''Street Jam'' and ''[[Happie Nuts]]'', were produced by editors previously involved in creating pornography for men.&lt;ref name="Kinsella146"/&gt;

Also in the 1980s, a male-and-female motorcycle-oriented slacker culture emerged in the form of the "Yankiis" (from the American word "Yankee") and [[Bosozoku]] Gals. The original kogals were dropouts from private school who, instead of lengthening their skirts like androgynous Yankii girls, created a new form of teen rebellion by shortening them.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pliink.com/mt/marxy/archives/2007/01/the-misanthropo.html The Misanthropology of Late-Stage Kogal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016100416/http://www.pliink.com/mt/marxy/archives/2007/01/the-misanthropo.html |date=2007-10-16 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; These middle school dropouts were thus taking their cues from high school students and attempting to justify their independence by looking and acting older. The gals added their own touches like loose socks and a cellular phone. Amateurs can create fashion in Japan by dressing up and hanging around places like Harajuku and Shibuya, where magazine photographers may take their pictures.&lt;ref name="Evers"&gt;Evers, Izumi, Patrick Macias, (2007) ''Japanese Schoolgirl Inferno: Tokyo Teen Fashion Subculture Handbook'', p. 11. {{ISBN|0-8118-5690-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AKB48 20090703 Japan Expo 55.jpg|right|thumb|Japanese idol girl group [[AKB48]] performs in kogal uniforms.]]

The 1993 television special ''Za kogyaru naito'' (The Kogal Night) introduced the kogal to a mass audience and provided a model for aspiring kogals to follow.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Platform shoes were popularized by singer [[Namie Amuro]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Laura, "Youth Fashion and changing beautification practices," ''Japan's Changing Generations: Are Young People Creating a New Society'' edited by Gordon Mathews, Bruce White, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Egg'', a fashion magazine for kogals, was established in 1995.

In the mid-1990s, the Japanese media gave a great deal of attention to the phenomenon of [[enjo-kosai|enjo-kōsai]] ("paid dating") supposedly engaged in by bored housewives and high school students, thus linking kogals to prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Kinsella"&gt;Kinsella, Sharon, "What's Behind the Fetishism of Japanese School Uniforms?", ''Fashion Theory: The Journal of Dress, Body &amp; Culture,'' Volume 6, Number 2, May 2002 , pp. 215-237(23)&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''Baunsu ko gaurusu'' ([[Bounce Ko Gals]]) (1997) by [[Masato Harada]] depicts kogals prostituting themselves to buy trendy fashion accessories.&lt;ref&gt;Nix, "[http://www.beyondhollywood.com/bounce-ko-gal-aka-leaving-1997-movie-review/ Bounce ko Gal aka Leaving (1997) Movie Review]"&lt;br&gt;"[http://wlt4.home.mindspring.com/fafr/reviews/bounce.htm Bounce KoGALS (1997)]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Kogal culture peaked in 1998. Kogals were then displaced by ''[[ganguro]]'', a gal culture that first appeared in 1999 and used dark makeup combined with heavy amounts of tanning.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"[Japanese Schoolgirl Inferno: Tokyo Teen Fashion Subculture Handbook]"&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberate ugliness of the look may reflect a desire to discourage [[Groping|chikan]] (subway perverts) and men seeking enjo-kōsai{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}. Ganguro evolved into another extreme look (though less extreme than Ganguro) called [[yamanba]] (mountain hag). As looks grew more extreme, fewer girls were attracted to gal culture. Although there are still female students who sexualize their uniforms, the kogal is no longer a focus of fashion or media attention.

[[File:Mirai Suenaga with summer school uniform by Hagure Yuuki 20120316.jpg|thumb|Mirai Suenaga, a mascot for Japan and Malaysian tourism, is dressed in a kogal summer school uniform.]]

Gal fashion later reemerged in the form of the skin-whitening ''Shiro Gyaru'', associated with ''Popteen''.&lt;ref name="Resurge"&gt;"[http://www.mekas.jp/en/trends/181.xhtml?page=2#2 Gyaru Resurgence]", ''Mekas''&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of this is the ''Onee Gal'', who take their fashion cues from Hollywood. Clad in stilettos and jewels, these gals parade the streets of Shibuya as if it were the red carpet. The women opting for this style are often Gals of previous generations that are returning for this style, which is sexy yet more adult. Unlike their younger counterparts, there is less clubbing and more projecting an image of sky-high social status. Despite this, the Onee Gals are more serious about their lives than other gal groups, with their age placing them in college or the workforce. One of the driving forces behind this is [[Sifow]], a singer and idol that subscribes to the Onee Gal style.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  The ''Hime gyaru'' (literally "lady gal," also translated as "princess gal"), also part of the ''Shiro Gyaru'' style, first appeared in 2007. The girls in this subculture seem to want to live as princesses like out of fairy tales, complete with over-glamorous lifestyles and items. They wear princess-like dresses (usually in pink or other pastels), and sport large, curly brown hair, usually in bouffants. Popular brands for this subsection of Gal include Liz Lisa and Jesus Diamante.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Resurge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122713804938242481 Japan's Latest Fashion Has Women Playing Princess for a Day]", ''Wall Street Journal'', November 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="livejournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gal-handbook.livejournal.com/3663.html |title=The Gyaru Handbook - Casual hime gyaru style DEBUNKED! |publisher=Gal-handbook.livejournal.com |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217145823/http://gal-handbook.livejournal.com/3663.html |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="livejournal1"/&gt;

Kogals are identified primarily by looks, but their speech, called {{nihongo||コギャル語|kogyarugo}}, is also distinctive,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; including, but not restricted to the following: {{nihongo3|"Cool dude"|イケ面|ikemen}}, {{nihongo3|"totally cute"|超かわいい|chō-kawaii}},&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; {{nihongo3|"do the gal thing"|ギャルやって|gyaru-yatte}}, {{nihongo3|"gal clothes"|ギャル服|gyaru-fuku}}, {{nihongo3|"gal-style shop"|ギャル系ショップ|gyaru-kei shoppu}}, {{nihongo3|"increasing her degree of galness"|ギャル度アップのために|gyaru-do appu no tame ni}}, {{nihongo3|"really super frustrating"|超マジでむかつく|chō maji de mukatsuku}}.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; In a land obsessed with self-sacrifice and group identity, gals proclaim, {{nihongo3|"long live the self"|ビバ自分|biba jibun|derived from [[:wikt:viva|Viva]] and the Japanese word for "self"}}.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

Gals' words are often created by contracting Japanese phrases or by literal translation of an English phrase, i.e. without reordering to follow Japanese syntax.&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;"[http://members.at.infoseek.co.jp/pontamiki/p4/p2.htm コギャル語＆ギャル語辞典] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215182140/http://members.at.infoseek.co.jp/pontamiki/p4/p2.htm |date=2007-12-15 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; Gal words may also be created by adding the suffix ''-ingu'' (from English "-ing") to verbs, for example {{nihongo3|"getting"|ゲッティング|gettingu}}.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt; Roman script abbreviations are popular, for example "MM" stands for ''maji de mukatsuku'' (really frustrating). "MK5" stands for {{nihongo3|"on the verge of [''lit.'' five seconds away from] going ballistic"|マジでキレる５秒前|maji de kireru go byoumae}}.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt; Another feature of gal speech is the suffix ''-ra'', meaning "like" or "learned from," as in {{nihongo3|"like singer [[Namie Amuro]]"|アムラー|Amura}}.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;

'''Lee Grant''' (born '''Lyova Haskell Rosenthal'''; October 31, during the mid-1920s){{efn|name="birth year note"}} is an American actress and film director.

In her 1951 film debut, she played the role of a young shoplifter in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'', co-starring [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Eleanor Parker]]. It earned her an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], along with the Best Actress Award at the [[1952 Cannes Film Festival]].

In 1952, as she had refused to testify against her husband at the [[HUAC]] hearings, she was [[Hollywood ten|blacklisted]] from most acting jobs for the next ten years. She was then only able to find occasional work on the stage or as a teacher during that period. It also contributed to her divorce. After she was removed from the blacklist in 1962, she rebuilt her acting career in films, after which she starred in 71 TV episodes of ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' (1965–1966), followed by lead roles in films such as ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (1967), and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), for which she won her first Oscar. In 1964, she won the [[Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress]] for her performance in ''[[The Maids]]''. During her career, she was nominated for the [[Emmy Award]] seven times between 1966 and 1993, winning twice.

==Early life==
Lee Grant was born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jerry.

Rosenthal, a realtor and educator. Her father was born in New York City, to [[Polish-Jewish]] immigrants, and her mother was a [[Russian-Jewish]] immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/202192/lee-grant-said-yes-to-everything-except-mccarth Profile], forward.com; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The family resided at 706 [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], in the [[Hamilton Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/38/Lee-Grant.html Lee Grant profile], FilmReference.com; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her date of birth is October 31, but the year is disputed, with all years ranging from 1925 to 1931 having been given as her year of birth at some point; however, census data, travel manifests, and testimony suggest that she was born in 1925 or 1926, while Grant's stated ages at the time of her professional debut and Oscar nomination indicate she was born in 1927.{{efn|name="birth year note"}}

She debuted in ''[[Franco Leoni|L'Oracolo]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 1931&lt;ref&gt;Olin Downes.

''Life Interrupted: The Unfinished Monologue'', Random House (2005) p. 154&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Art Students League of New York]], [[Juilliard School of Music]], [[The High School of Music &amp; Art]], and [[George Washington High School (New York City)|George Washington High School]], all in New York City. Grant graduated from high school, and won a scholarship to the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]], and studied under [[Sanford Meisner]]. She subsequently enrolled in [[Actors Studio]] in New York.

==Career==
===1940s{{ndash}}1950s===
Grant had her first stage ballet performance in 1933 at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]].&lt;ref name=tcm&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/75242%7C96586/Lee-Grant/milestones.html Turner Classic Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, in her early teens, she was made a member of the [[American Ballet]], under [[George Balanchine]].&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt; As an actress, Grant had her professional stage debut as understudy in ''Oklahoma'' in 1944. In 1948, she had her Broadway acting debut in ''Joy to the World''. Grant established herself as a dramatic [[method acting|method]] actress on and off [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], earning praise for her role as a shoplifter in ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{IBDB name|42830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her film debut two years later in the film version (''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]''), starring [[Kirk Douglas]], receiving her first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] nomination, and winning the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] Award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)]]&lt;/ref&gt; She said she enjoyed working under director [[William Wyler]], who helped guide her.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL3iv9gUAPA;t=1m43s Lee Grant, "Inside the Actors Studio" 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box||align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=But as quickly as that dream unfolded, her life soon turned into a nightmare... So right when her career should have been blooming, she was banned from working in Hollywood. And that ban lasted for twelve years, a lifetime for an actor.|source=[[Robert Osborne]], ''Turner Classic Movies'' interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/1033419/Conversation-With-Lee-Grant-A-TCM-Original-2014.html "Conversation With Lee Grant", 2014], tcm.com; accessed May 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1951, she gave an impassioned eulogy at the memorial service for actor [[J. Edward Bromberg]], whose early death, she implied, was caused by the stress of being called before [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). After her eulogy was published, she was summoned by the same committee to testify against her husband, playwright [[Arnold Manoff]], but refused. As a result, for the next ten years, her "prime years", as she put it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lee-grant-on-life-beyond-the-hollywood-blacklist "Lee Grant on life beyond the Hollywood blacklist"], CBSnews.com, August 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; she was [[Hollywood ten|blacklisted]] and her work in television and movies was limited.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLf3Ga4ZBM Turner Classic Movies "Evening With Lee Grant" (1of4), ''Detective Story''], interview with [[Robert Osborne]], 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirk Douglas]], who acted with her in ''Detective Story'', recalled that director [[Edward Dmytryk]], a blacklistee, had first named her husband at the HUAC:{{quote|Lee was only a kid, a beautiful young girl with extraordinary talent and a big future. You could see it. She was so good that she earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her very first film role. But because Eddie Dmytryk named her husband, Lee Grant was blacklisted before her film career even had a chance to begin. Of course, she refused to testify about the man to whom she was married, and it took years before anyone would hire her for another picture.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Kirk. ''I Am Spartacus: Making a Film, Breaking the Blacklist'', Open Road Media (2012) p. 26; {{ISBN|978-1453254806}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant appeared in a limited number of stage and television shows during these years. In 1953, she played Rose Peabody on the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''. In the Broadway production of ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' in 1959, she succeeded [[Anne Bancroft]] in the lead female role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/lee-grant/11/ "Two for the Seesaw"], CBS News, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
[[File:Lee Grant - 1961.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Grant in 1961]]
By the time her name was finally removed from the blacklist in the early 1960s, she had since been divorced, remarried, and had a young daughter, [[Dinah Manoff|Dinah]]. She began re-establishing her television and movie career. In her autobiography, she writes:{{quote|Dinah was my grail, my constant; nothing and no one could get between us. Dinah and my need to support her financially, morally, viscerally, and my rage at those who had taken twelve working, acting years from my life, were what motivated me.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Lee. ''I Said Yes to Everything: A Memoir'', Penguin (2014) {{ISBN|978-0-399-16930-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}}} Her experience with the blacklist scarred her to such an extent that as late as 2002, she would freeze and go into a "near trance" when anyone asked her about her experiences during the McCarthy period.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven J. ''Hollywood Left and Right'', Oxford Univ. Press (2011) p. 128; {{ISBN|978-0195181722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's first major achievement, after HUAC officially cleared her, was in the 1960s television series ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', as [[Stella Chernak]], for which she won an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] in 1966. In 1967, Grant appeared in an episode of ''[[Mission Impossible]]'', portraying the wife of a U.S. diplomat who goes undercover to discredit a rogue diplomat. That same year, she played the distraught widow of a murder victim in the Oscar-winning ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]''. In 1963, she won acclaim for her stage performance in the off-Broadway production of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Maids]]''.&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb name|15613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
She received subsequent Academy Award nominations for the dramas ''[[The Landlord]]'' (1970) and ''[[Voyage of the Damned]]'' (1976). Her acting range extended into comedy equally well, notably in several roles as an overbearing mother. In ''[[Plaza Suite (film)|Plaza Suite]]'' (1971), a comedy directed by [[Arthur Hiller]] and written by [[Neil Simon]], she played the harassed mother of a bride, with [[Walter Matthau]] as the father. The film was followed by another comedy role as the mother in ''[[Portnoy's Complaint (film)|Portnoy's Complaint]]'' (1972).

Also in 1971, she played cold-blooded killer Leslie Williams on the second episode ("Ransom for a Dead Man") of the [[Peter Falk]] series ''[[List of Columbo episodes|Columbo]]''. She would appear with Falk again on Broadway ''[[Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'', whose playwright Neil Simon said that his "first and only choice" for the part was Grant, who he said was equally at home with dramatists such as [[Chekhov]] or [[Sidney Kingsley]], yet could also be "hilariously funny" when the script called for it, as she was able to portray essential honesty in her acting.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Neil. ''Rewrites'', Simon &amp; Schuster (1996) p. 336)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among her most notable roles was as [[Warren Beatty]]'s older lover in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), for which she won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Supporting Actress. The film received mixed reviews, but was Columbia's biggest hit in the studio's 50-year history.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Elizabeth. ''The Makeover in Movies: Before and After in Hollywood Films, 1941-2002'', McFarland (2004) p. 198&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' was the second film in which Grant acted under director [[Hal Ashby]]. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], comparing her in both films, noted Grant "is such a cool-style comedienne that she's in danger of having people say that she's good, as usual."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pauline Kael|Kael, Pauline]]. ''The Age of Movies: Selected Writings of Pauline Kael'', Penguin e-books (2011)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming, however, she did have some serious disagreements with Beatty, who was also the producer, and nearly quit. During one scene, she wanted to play it in a way she felt was more realistic from a woman's perspective, but Beatty disagreed. After thinking about the scene for a few days, she told director Ashby that she could not do it Beatty's way and was quitting. As she was walking out, Beatty stopped her, and asked what was wrong. "I sat down and told him", she said. "He threw up his hands and said, 'Play it your way. What do I know? I'm a man.'"&lt;ref&gt;Biskind, Peter. ''Star: The Life and Wild Times of Warren Beatty'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2010) e-book&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Lee Grant 1975-1.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Grant in 1975]]
Despite the success of the film, Grant was feeling less secure in Hollywood, as she was then around fifty years old. She writes:
{{quote|I was becoming my own worst enemy as an actor, traumatized onstage and fixated on staying young so I could keep working in film. A woman of a certain age does not play in movies or TV; we're kicked to the side or out. And I was a woman of a certain age, terrified I'd be found out and unemployed again.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;{{rp|213}}}}

In March 1971, Grant appeared in the ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' episode "Ransom for a Dead Man"', and was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress&amp;nbsp;– Miniseries or a Movie. Having been nominated for two performances in the same acting category, she received the award for her other Emmy-nominated performance in the television film, ''The Neon Ceiling''. The only other nominee was [[Colleen Dewhurst]]; in Grant's acceptance speech, she wryly noted, "I must thank Colleen Dewhurst since it takes two of me to equal one of her." {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

During the 1975-76 television season, she starred in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Fay (TV series)|Fay]]'', which, to her chagrin, was canceled after eight episodes. She made a guest appearance on ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'', in which her daughter [[Dinah Manoff]] co-starred. In 1978 she was the lead actress in the sequel, ''[[Damien: Omen II]]''.

Grant successfully moved into directing when she directed the stage play, ''[[The Stronger]]'', in 1976, written by [[August Strindberg]].

===1980s{{ndash}}1990s===
In 1980, Grant directed her first film, ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'', a story about an aging Jewish couple. That debut narrative film was followed by a widely distributed documentary film, "The Willmar 8", which profiled 8 female employees of a bank in Willmar, Minnesota who went on strike to protest pay inequities between male and female bank tellers. She starred a [[HBO]] remake of ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' in 1982, costarring [[Jerry Orbach]], both playing three different characters in three acts. It was filmed before a live audience.&lt;ref name=Shelley&gt;Shelley, Peter.

[[File:Lee Grant at F.I.S.T premier 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=.76|left|Grant at the premiere of ''F.I.S.T.'' (April 1978)]]
Actor [[Bruce Dern]], who played alongside her in [[The Big Town (1987 film)|''The Big Town'']] (1987), recalls working with her: "Lee Grant is a fabulous actress. Anytime she works it's a blessing you have her in your movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Dern|Dern, Bruce]]. ''Things I've Said, But Probably Shouldn't Have: An Unrepentant Memoir'', Wiley (2007) p. 231&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She directed several documentary films, including ''[[Down and Out in America]]'' (1986) which won the [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]]. That same year, she directed ''Nobody's Child'', a television movie starring [[Marlo Thomas]] about a woman confined to a mental institution for twenty years.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0335519}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her direction, Grant became the first female director to win the [[Directors Guild of America Award]].&lt;ref name=TCM/&gt;

In 1988, she was awarded the [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Women in Film Crystal Award]] for outstanding women who through their endurance and the excellence of their work have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wif.org/past-recipients Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724120329/http://www.wif.org/past-recipients |date=2011-07-24 }} Women in Film website; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiring her directing and acting skill, actress [[Sissy Spacek]] agreed to act in ''[[Hard Promises (1991 film)|Hard Promises]]'' (1991) "only to work with Grant", although Grant was later replaced as its director.&lt;ref&gt;Jarboe, Jan. "Sissy Spacek's Long Walk Home", ''Texas Monthly'', February 1991, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Grant played Dora Cohn, the mother of [[Roy Cohn]] in the biographical made-for-TV film ''[[Citizen Cohn]]'', which garnered her yet another Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

===2000s–present===
In 2001, Lee Grant portrayed Louise Bonner in [[David Lynch]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Mullholland Drive (film)|Mullholland Drive]]''. From 2004 to 2007, [[Carlin Glynn]], [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]], and Grant served as co-artistic directors for the [[Actors Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, James. ''Inside Inside'', Penguin Group (USA), October 18, 2007; {{ISBN|9781101211991}}, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, Grant directed a series of ''[[Intimate Portrait (TV series)|Intimate Portrait]]'' episodes for Lifetime Television, that celebrated a diverse range of accomplished women.

In 2013 she returned to the stage, after a nearly forty-year absence, to star in ''[[The Gin Game]]'', part of a benefit for improvement programs at the Island Music Guild. Grant played Fonsia Dorsey opposite [[Frank Buxton]] as Weller Martin; her daughter [[Dinah Manoff]] directed the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2013/aug/12/theater-high-powered-cast-deals-this-gin-game/?partner=RSS#axzz2xZu7fd3s|title=Theater: High-powered cast deals this 'Gin Game'|author=Michael C.

==Notes==
{{Notelist|notes=

{{efn|name="birth year note"|Grant was born on October 31, but disagreement exists between sources over the year. While secondary and tertiary sources put Grant's year of birth between 1925 and 1931 she was almost certainly born in the mid-1920s. Public records indicate she was born in 1925 but a ship manifest and congressional testimony favor 1926. Recent interviews with Grant and her autobiography suggest 1927, although Grant herself is inconsistent on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;

''Secondary sources''
* ''Mid-1920s'': The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' notes that Grant is "famously inexact" about her age, as a result of being blacklisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Carrie|last=Rickey|title='I Said Yes to Everything', by Lee Grant|date=July 17, 2014|work=[[SFGate.com]]|quote=Lyova Rosenthal was born in the mid-1920s. The granddaughter of Polish and Russian immigrants is famously inexact about her age.

*''1926–1930, 1931'': ''[[Who’s Who in America]]'' lists 1931 as Grant's birth year, but ''Great Jews in the Performing Arts'' notes that "Other sources give every year from 1926 through 1930."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Darryl|last=Lyman|title=Great Jews in the Performing Arts|year=1999|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bnQHAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rosenthal+1930 124] |quote=Lee Grant was born in New York City, New York, on October 31, 1931.

'''Mental health law''' includes a wide variety of legal topics and pertain to people with a diagnosis or possible diagnosis of [[Mental disorder|a mental health condition]], and to those involved in managing or treating such people. Laws that relate to mental health include:

* employment laws, including laws that prohibit [[employment discrimination]] on the basis of a mental health condition, require [[reasonable accommodation]]s in the workplace, and provide mental health-related leave;
* insurance laws, including laws governing mental health coverage by medical insurance plans, disability insurance, [[workers compensation]], and [[Social Security Disability Insurance]];
* housing laws, including [[fair housing|housing discrimination]] and zoning;
* education laws, including laws that prohibit discrimination, and laws that require reasonable accommodations, equal access to programs and services, and [[free appropriate public education]];
* laws that provide a right to treatment; 
* [[involuntary commitment]] and [[guardianship]] laws; 
* laws governing treatment professionals, including licensing laws, confidentiality, [[informed consent]], and [[medical malpractice]];  
* laws governing admission of expert testimony or other psychiatric evidence in court; and
* criminal laws, including laws governing [[Competence (law)|fitness for trial]] or execution, and the insanity defense.
  
Mental health law has received relatively little attention in scholarly legal forums. The University of Memphis [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law]] in 2011 announced the formation of a student-edited law journal entitled "Mental Health Law &amp; Policy Journal."

==United States==

===Employment===
Title I of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] ("ADA") is a civil rights law that protects individuals with [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] ("PTSD"), and other mental health conditions in the workplace. It prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from firing, refusing to hire, or taking other adverse actions against a job applicant or employee based on real or perceived mental health conditions.&lt;ref name="12112a"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12112(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also strictly limits the circumstances under which an employer can ask for information about medical conditions, including mental health conditions, and imposes confidentiality requirements on any medical information that the employer does have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=EEOC|title=Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/preemp.html|website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=EEOC|title=EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/preemp.html|website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADA also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants or employees with mental health conditions under some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12112(b)(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reasonable accommodation is a special arrangement or piece of equipment that a person needs because of a medical condition to apply for a job, do a job, or enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=EEOC|title=EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html|website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include a flexible schedule, changes in the method of supervision, and permission to work from home. To have the right to a reasonable accommodation, the worker's mental health condition must meet the ADA's definition of a "current disability." Conditions that should easily qualify include major depression, PTSD, [[bipolar disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] ("OCD"), and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=FR&gt;{{cite web| title= 76 FR 16977 | year= 2011 | publisher= federalregister.gov | url= https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/03/25/2011-6056/regulations-to-implement-the-equal-employment-provisions-of-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-as }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditions may also qualify, depending on what the symptoms would be if the condition were left untreated, during an active episode (if the condition involves active episodes).&lt;ref name="FR" /&gt; The symptoms do not need to be severe or permanent for the condition to be a disability under the ADA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=EEOC|title=Fact Sheet on the EEOC's Final Regulations Implementing the ADAAA|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/regulations/adaaa_fact_sheet.cfm|website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] (FMLA), certain employees are entitled to up to twelve weeks of job-protected and unpaid leave to recover from a serious illness or to care for a family member with a serious illness, among other reasons. To be eligible, the employer must have had 50 or more employees in 20 or more workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year, or else must be a public agency, elementary school, or secondary school, and the employee must have worked for the employer for at least
12 months, must have at least 1,250 hours of service for the employer during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave, and must work at a location where the employer has at least 50 employees within 75 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Department of Labor|title=Fact Sheet #28: The Family and Medical Leave Act|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==

===Civil commitment===
Mental health legislation is largely used in the management of psychiatric disorders, such as [[dementia]] or [[psychosis]], and [[developmental disabilities]] where a person does not possess the ability to act in a legally competent manner and requires treatment and/or another person to act in his or her best interests. The laws generally cover the requirements and procedures for [[involuntary commitment]] and compulsory treatment in a psychiatric hospital or other facility.

In some [[jurisdiction]]s, court orders are required for compulsory treatment; in others, psychiatrists may treat compulsorily by following set procedures, usually with means of appeal or regular scrutiny to ensure compliance with the law.

===Sources of law===
Mental health law includes areas of both [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[common law|common]] and [[statutory law]].

Common law is based on long-standing English legal principles, as interpreted through [[case law]]. Mental health-related legal concepts include [[mens rea]], [[insanity defence]]s; legal definitions of "[[Sanity#Law|sane]]," "insane," and "[[Competence (law)|incompetent]];" [[informed consent]]; and [[Automatism (law)|automatism]], amongst many others.

Statutory law usually takes the form of a mental health statute. An example is the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] in England and Wales. These acts codify aspects of the treatment of mental illness and provides rules and procedures to be followed and penalties for breaches.

Not all countries have mental health acts. The World Health Report (2001) lists the following percentages, by region, for countries with and without mental health legislation.{{ref|who}}

The ILO '''Convention concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment''' C138 &lt;ref&gt; 1973 ILO Convention C138: Minimum Age Convention (Convention concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment)(58th Conference Session Geneva 1973), 1015 United Nations Treaty Series, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;, is a [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|convention]] adopted in 1973 by the [[International Labour Organization]]. It requires ratifying states to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of [[child labour]] and to raise progressively the [[legal working age|minimum age for admission to employment or work]]. Convention C138 replaces several similar ILO conventions in specific fields of labour.

==Minimum ages==
Countries are free to specify a minimum age for labour, with a minimum of 15 years. A declaration of 14 years is also possible when for a specified period of time. Laws may also permit light work for children aged 13–15 (not harming their health or school work). The minimum age of 18 years is specified for work which "is likely to jeopardise the health, safety or morals of young persons". Definitions of the type of work and derogations are only possible after [[tripartite consultation]]s (if such a system exists in the ratifying country).

== Effect on other conventions ==
The convention is a revision of several conventions for workers in specific areas. Upon entry into force, some of these conventions were closed for ratification and becoming a party to this convention automatically resulted in denunciation of the older ones. An overview of older minimum age conventions of ILO is shown below:

}}  Entry into force of ILO Convention C138  occurred one year after deposition of two first ratifications (Cuba and Libya).  As of January 2018 171 countries have signed Convention C138. Initially, however, the pace of ratification of this Convention was extremely slow. Therefore, an alternative Convention with a more limited scope has been initiated in 1999. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nissen|first=A.|date=15 June 2018|title=Can WTO Member States Rely on Citizen Concerns to Prevent Corporations from Importing Goods Made from Child Labour?|url=https://www.utrechtlawreview.org/articles/abstract/10.18352/ulr.436/|journal=Utrecht Law Review|volume=14}} p. 74 referring to 1999 ILO Convention C182: Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour), 2133 United Nations Treaty Series, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns ILO Convention 182 concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour.

Convention C138 enters for a ratifying country into force one year after ratification. This can be denounced every 10 years in the year after 10 years have passed (e.g. {{nowrap|19 June 2027}} – {{nowrap|19 June 2028}}).

The '''Munk Debates''' are a semi-annual series of [[debates]] on major policy issues held in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. They are run by the Aurea Foundation, a charitable foundation set up by [[Peter Munk]], founder of [[Barrick Gold]], and his wife Melanie Munk. The debate series was founded in 2008 by Munk and [[Rudyard Griffiths]], who moderates most of the debates.

The Munk debates are held in Toronto, at steadily larger venues as they have proven popular. Tickets are sold to the general public, and sell out shortly after being made available. 

A poll is taken from the audience both before and after each debate. The winner of the debate is determined by how many people are persuaded to move from one opinion side to the other.

The debates have been broadcast on [[CBC Radio]]'s ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' as well as [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]]. The more recent ones have also appeared on international broadcasters including [[BBC]] and [[C-SPAN]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9841">{{Romani people}}
'''Polska Roma''' are the largest and one of the oldest [[ethnolinguistic]] sub group of [[Romani people|Romani]] people living in Poland. Some Polska Roma also live in [[North America]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Great Britain]] and countries of the [[European Union]]. The term "Polska Roma" is both an [[ethnonym]] of the group and a term used in the academic literature. As such it is distinct from the terms "Polish Roma" or "Roma in Poland" which better denote [[Romani people in Poland|the broader Roma population in Poland]]. Polish ethnographer [[Jerzy Ficowski]], writing in the 1950s and 1960s used the term "Polish Lowlander Gypsies" (Polish: ''Polscy Cyganie Nizinni'') to refer to the same group, though this terminology is no longer in widespread use.

==Culture==
[[File:Papusza.JPG|thumb|200px|A portrait of Polska Roma poet [[Papusza]] (Bronislawa Wajs) by Krystyna Gierlinska.]]

Polska Roma were nomadic until the twentieth century. They have not assimilated into broader Polish society, or the non-Romani cultures of other countries where they live. They are in fact one of the most traditional Romani groups. One exception to this is that the most common [[surnames]] among Polska Roma are characteristically Polish (for example ''Kwiatkowski'' or ''Majewski''), or occasionally Polonized-German (for example ''Wajs'' or ''Szwarc''). Polska Roma generally have had a very strict interpretation of [[Romanipen]] cultural laws and practices. Some cultural differences arose however within the community during and after World War II because those of the Polska Roma who spent the war in areas controlled by the Soviet Union were able to hold on to [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] practice, while those under German occupation and threatened by [[genocide]] had to compromise the strictness of their traditions in order to survive.

They are closely related to [[Ruska Roma|Xaladitka Roma]], or "Ruska Roma" who emigrated to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] together with the Polska Roma. Because the Xaladitka settled in regions of present-day [[Belarus]], they became more affected by [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]], rather than Polish, culture.&lt;ref name=bartosz/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===

Polska Roma as a distinct ethnolinguistic group formed during the 16th century in western Poland from Roma refugees who had migrated to the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth in order to escape anti-Romani persecution in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The migration was a result of a wave of [[pogroms]], persecutions and anti-Romani laws in German territories and this had a profound effect on Polska Roma culture and language. Compared to other Roma groups, such as the [[Bergitka Roma]] (''Polish Carpathian Gypsies'' or ''Polish Highlander Gypsies'' in Ficowski's terminology) who had actually arrived in Poland earlier in the 15th century, the communities of Polska Roma are more closed and suspicious of outsiders ([[Gadjo (non-Romani)|Gadjo]]), less "assimilated", and more tied to traditional Roma culture. Their version of the Roma dialect has also incorporated many German words and idioms.&lt;ref name=bartosz&gt;Adam Bartosz, "Nie boj sie cygana/Na dara rromesoar", Pograniczne, Sejny, 1994, pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth===

Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], like other European states, passed anti-Roma legislation. However, unlike in most of European countries, these laws were rarely enforced in large measure because the Roma found powerful protectors among the [[szlachta]] (Polish nobility) and benign neglect. Polish nobles, magnates and landowners, placed a high value on the traditional [[crafts]] of the Roma, such as [[metallurgy]], [[husbandry]], and [[Wheelwright|wheel wrighting]], as well musical skills (which became a standard staple of important occasions), the Polska Roma were usually exempted from the [[feudal]] restrictions that tied Polish peasants to the land. They were free to continue the nomadic lifestyle during most of the year, as long as they arrived in the "home town" of their lord on pre-specified market days. In that respect the Polska Roma occupied a social strata above that of the Polish peasants as well as that of other Roma populations, such as the Carpathian Roma (whose mobility was restricted).

In many large magnate [[latifundia]] the communities of Polska Roma were also given the right to have a "[[King of the Gypsies|king]]", chosen to represent them in legal disputes with outsiders. However, over time, the office became a source of corruption and in the 18th and 19th centuries the persons were often chosen from outside their group and tended to pursue personal rather than community interests.

Additional anti-Roma laws were passed in Poland and Lithuania when [[Augustus the Strong]], the [[Elector of Saxony]], was elected king of Poland in 1697. [[Saxony]], like most German states of the time had very strong anti-Roma legislation (Roma men were to be killed on sight, often with a bounty paid for their ears, while Roma women and children were disfigured, branded and banished) and upon Augustus' inauguration some of these laws were transferred to the Commonwealth. However, a distinction was made between the laws applicable in Augustus' home state of Saxony and the Commonwealth proper, where the most severe measures were mitigated into monetary fines or simply benign neglect of local authorities.&lt;ref name=bartosz/&gt;

Shortly before the [[Partitions of Poland]], Polska Roma, like other non-szlachta classes, were granted full citizenship by the [[Constitution of 3rd May]]. However, these privileges were lost with the partitions and the Polska Roma were forced back into servile status by the foreign powers (Austria, Prussia, Russia).

===During the Polish partitions===

After the partitions of Poland, persecution of Polska Roma became more severe, particularly in the [[Russian partition]]. As a result, the size of the group's population declined, at one point falling to as low as 1000 persons within [[Congress Poland]]. Another reason for the overall decline was that within the [[Prussian partition]] part of the group developed an identity, under the influence of German culture, distinct from those of other Polska Roma and subsequently became the [[Sasytka Roma]]. Finally, the 19th century saw an influx of other Romani into the territories of former Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, in particular the [[Kalderash]] and [[Lovari]]. These groups competed economically against the Polska Roma within their traditional crafts and in many places successfully displaced them in terms of employment.

===Interwar Poland===

After Poland regained its independence, Polish authorities tended to recognize the Kalderash as the overall representatives of the Roma population in the country. Consequently, the "gypsy kings" during this period were chosen from among the Kalderash and policy generally reflected the interests of this group, often at the expense of the Polska Roma. The latter, like most other Romani sub-groups within Poland who were not Kalderash, did not recognize the authority of these representatives and did their best to ignore or circumvent it.

===Porajmos===

{{main|Porajmos}}

After the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion and occupation of Poland]] the Nazis carried out a planned genocide of the Roma population as part of the [[final solution]]. Polska Roma, along with other Romani groups in Poland were very much affected. Generally, while other Roma were usually placed in [[ghettos]] and then sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]], the German [[SS]] usually murdered Polska Roma (as well as the Bergitka Roma) in mass executions in forests and secluded places (for example in the [[Szczurowa massacre]]).

===After World War II===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Terno Gorzow 07.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Edward Dębicki with the Roma musical group ''Terno'' in [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]] in 2007.]]
While prior to World War II a small portion of Polska Roma had become sedentary, most continued a traditional nomadic way of life. Unlike the Lovarii and Kalderash, who often engaged in cross-national Europe wide travels, Polska Roma tended to stay within the borders of interwar Poland or neighboring countries.

After the war however, the communist government of People's Poland instituted a policy aimed at the "settling" of the Roma population which had survived the Holocaust. Initially this took the form of financial incentives - including free housing and "settlement funds" - but because the policy did not achieve the goals the communist authorities hoped for, by the late 1950s the policy evolved into one of forced settlement and outright prohibitions against the "nomadic" lifestyle. All Polska Roma had to register, "vagrancy" was outlawed, and Roma parents were often jailed if their children failed to attend the same school throughout the year (which was impossible in the context of a nomadic lifestyle). This policy of force resulted in about 80% of the previously nomadic Roma becoming settled, while a portion of the remainder went underground. Still others, emigrated abroad.

The Polska Roma poet [[Papusza]] (Bronisława Wajs) became nationally renowned during this period, as did her nephew, [[Edward Dębicki]].

==Present==

Currently, Polska Roma live mostly in southeastern Poland, in the area around [[Nowy Sącz]], in [[Podhale]] and [[Spisz]].&lt;ref name=bartosz/&gt;
One notable example of someone with Polska Roma heritage is James Onclate of [[Montana]].

A '''sanctuary''', in its original meaning, is a sacred place, such as a [[shrine]]. By the use of such places as a haven, by extension the term has come to be used for any place of safety. This secondary use can be categorized into human sanctuary, a safe place for [[human]]s, such as a political sanctuary; and non-human sanctuary, such as an animal or plant sanctuary.

== Religious sanctuary ==
Sanctuary is a word derived from the Latin {{wikt-lang|la|sanctuarium}}, which is, like most words ending in {{wikt-lang|la|-arium}}, a container for keeping something in—in this case holy things or perhaps cherished people ({{lang|la|sanctae}}/{{lang|la|sancti}}).  The meaning was extended to places of holiness or safety, in particular the whole demarcated area, often many acres, surrounding [[ancient Greek temple|a Greek]] or [[Roman temple]]; the original terms for these are ''[[temenos]]'' in Greek and ''[[fanum]]'' in Latin, but both may be translated as sanctuary.  Similar usage may be sometimes found describing sacred areas in other religions. In Christian churches "sanctuary" has a specific meaning, covering part of the interior, covered below.

===Sanctuary as area around the altar===
{{Main article|Chancel}}

[[Image:StMarysSanctuary.JPG|thumb|left|The sanctuary at [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney]]]]
In many [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] traditions including Roman Catholic, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], and Anglican churches, the area around the altar is called the sanctuary; it is also considered holy because of the physical presence of God in the [[Eucharist]], both during the Mass and in the [[church tabernacle]] the rest of the time.

In many churches the architectural term ''chancel'' covers the same area as the sanctuary, and either term may be used.&lt;ref name="Robinson2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Gary|title=Architecture|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9788189093129|page=40|quote=In the historic floor plan, the words chancel and sanctuary are often synonymous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Protestant]] churches, the term ''sanctuary'' denotes the entire worship area while the term ''[[chancel]]'' is used to refer to the area around the [[altar|altar-table]].

In many Western traditions [[altar rails]] sometimes mark the edge of the sanctuary or chancel. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of [[Syro-Malabar Church]], [[Byzantine rite]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]es, the sanctuary is separated from the [[nave]] (where the people pray) by an [[iconostasis]], literally a wall of [[icon]]s, with three doors in it. In other [[Oriental Orthodox]] traditions, a sanctuary curtain is used.
[[File:Churchofstpaulandandrewinterior.jpg|thumb|The back of the church sanctuary at [[Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew (New York City)|Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew]].]]
The terminology that applies the word "sanctuary" to the area around the altar does not apply to Christian churches alone: [[King Solomon]]'s temple, built in about 950 BC, had a sanctuary ("[[Holy of Holies]]") where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was, and the term applies to the corresponding part of any house of worship. In most modern [[synagogue]]s, the main room for prayer is known as the sanctuary, to contrast it with smaller rooms dedicated to various other services and functions. (There is a raised [[Bema|bimah]] in the sanctuary, from which services are conducted, which is where the [[Ark (synagogue)|ark]] holding the [[Torah]] may reside; some synagogues, however, have a separate bimah and ark-platform.)

=== Sanctuary as a sacred place ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] --&gt;&lt;!-- Is it just me, or is this all dubious OR? --&gt;
In Europe, Christian churches were sometimes built on land considered to be a particularly holy spot, perhaps where a miracle or martyrdom was believed to have taken place or where a holy person was buried. Examples are [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome and [[St. Albans Cathedral]] in England, which commemorate the martyrdom of [[Saint Peter]] (the first Pope) and [[Saint Alban]] (the first Christian martyr in Britain), respectively. 

The place, and therefore the church built there, was considered to have been sanctified (made holy) by what happened there. In modern times, the [[Catholic Church]] has continued this practice by placing in the altar of each church, when it is consecrated for use, a box (the ''sepulcrum'') containing relics of a saint. The relics box is removed when the church is taken out of use as a church. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[antimension]] on the altar serves a similar function. It is a cloth [[icon]] of Christ's body taken down from the cross, and typically has the relics of a saint sewn into it. In addition, it is signed by the parish's [[bishop]], and represents his authorization and blessing for the [[Eucharist]] to be celebrated on that altar.

== Human sanctuary ==
=== Legal sanctuary ===
In the classical world, some (but not all) temples offered sanctuary to criminals or runaway slaves.  When referring to prosecution of crimes, sanctuary can mean one of the following:
[[File:Richard Burchett - Sanctuary (1867) contrasted.jpg|thumb|The Church as a [[Place of Refuge]]]]
;Church sanctuary
{{Main article|Place of Refuge#Medieval England}}
:A sacred place, such as a church, in which fugitives formerly were immune to arrest (recognized by English law from the fourth to the seventeenth century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wun.ac.uk/wun/events/view/sanctuary-violence-and-law-late-medieval-england|title=Sanctuary, Violence, and Law in Late Medieval England - Events|website=Worldwide Universities Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the practice of churches offering sanctuary is still observed in the modern era, it no longer has any legal effect and is respected solely for the sake of tradition.
;Political sanctuary
:Immunity to arrest afforded by a sovereign authority. The United Nations has expanded the definition of "political" to include race, nationality, religion, political opinions and membership or participation in any particular social group or social activities. People seeking political sanctuary typically do so by asking a sovereign authority for asylum.

====Right of asylum====
{{Main article|Right of asylum}}
[[Image:St John of Beverley Sanctuary Stone.jpg|thumb|Remains of one of four medieval stone boundary markers for the sanctuary of Saint [[John of Beverley]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]]]
Many ancient peoples recognized a religious [[right of asylum]], protecting criminals (or those accused of crime) from legal action and from exile to some extent. This principle was adopted by the early Christian church, and various rules developed for what the person had to do to qualify for protection and just how much protection it was.

In England, King [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]] made the first laws regulating sanctuary in about AD 600, though [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (c. 1136) says that the legendary pre-Saxon king [[Dunvallo Molmutius]] (4th/5th century BC) enacted sanctuary laws in the [[Molmutine Laws]] as recorded by [[Gildas]] (c. 500–570).&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' 2, 17&lt;/ref&gt; By Norman times, there had come to be two kinds of sanctuary: All churches had the lower-level kind, but only the churches the king licensed had the broader version. The medieval system of asylum was finally abolished entirely in England by [[James I of England|James I]] in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/articles/coroner4.html|title=English Coroner System Part 4: Sanctuary|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political asylum====
During the [[Wars of the Roses]] of the 15th century when the Lancastrians or Yorkists would suddenly gain the upper hand by winning a battle, some adherents of the losing side might find themselves surrounded by adherents of the winning side and unable to return to their own side, so they would rush to sanctuary at the nearest church until it was safe to leave it. A prime example is Queen [[Elizabeth Woodville]], consort of [[Edward IV of England]].

In 1470, when the Lancastrians briefly restored [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] to the throne, Edward's queen was living in London with several young daughters. She moved with them into [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] for sanctuary, living there in royal comfort until Edward was restored to the throne in 1471 and giving birth to their first son [[Edward V of England|Edward]] during that time. When King Edward IV died in 1483, Elizabeth (who was highly unpopular with even the Yorkists and probably did need protection) took her five daughters and youngest son (Richard, Duke of York; Prince Edward had his own household by then) and again moved into sanctuary at Westminster. She had all the comforts of home; she brought so much furniture and so many chests that the workmen had to break holes in some of the walls to move everything in fast enough to suit her.{{citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In the 20th century, during [[World War I]], all of [[Russia]]'s [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] made the controversial decision in 1917 to deny political sanctuary to Tsar [[Nicholas II]] and his immediate family when he was overthrown in that year's [[February Revolution]] for his abuses of power and forced to [[abdicate]] in March in favor of [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government]]. Nicholas and his family and remaining household were sent to [[Tobolsk]], [[Siberia]] that summer while Kerensky kept Russia in the war when it couldn't win, enabling [[Lenin]] and his [[Bolshevik]]s to gain the Russian people's support in overthrowing Kerensky's regime in that year's [[October Revolution]]. The [[Russian Civil War]] started that November and in July, 1918, with Lenin losing the civil war, [[Shooting of the Romanov family|Nicholas and his family were executed]] on Lenin's orders while confined to the [[Ipatiev House]] in [[Yekaterenburg]]. In 1939, months before [[World War II]] began, more than 900 [[Jewish]] refugees from [[Nazi Germany]] on board the [[MS St. Louis]] met the same fate, first by [[Cuba]]—their original destination—and afterwards by the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. As a result, most of them were forced back to Europe, where over 600 of them died in [[Nazi concentration camps]] during the war. This incident was the subject of [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas']] and Max-Morgan Witts' 1974 novel, ''[[Voyage of the Damned]]'' and its [[1976]] [[movie]] adaptation. In 1970, [[Simonas Kudirka]] attempted to defect from the then-Soviet Union by jumping from his "mother ship", 'Sovetskaya Litva', onto the [[USCGC Vigilant]] when it was sailing from [[New Bedford]] while Kudirka's ship was anchored at [[Martha's Vineyard]]. Kudrika was accused of stealing 3,000 rubles from Sovetskaya Litva's [[safe]] and when the U.S. [[State Department]] failed to help him, Kudrika was sent back to the Soviet Union, where he was convicted of [[treason]] and sentenced to ten years of hard labor but because Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother, he was allowed to return to the United States in 1974. His plight was the subject of Algis Ruksenas' 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The Truth About The Murderous Happenings Aboard the Cutter Vigilant During the Russian-American Confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' and the 1978 [[TV movie]] ''The Defection of Simas Kudirka'', starring [[Alan Arkin]] in the title role. In the 1980s, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] youth, [[Walter Polovchak]], became a [[cause celebre]] because of his request in 1980 at age 12 to remain in the United States permanently after he announced that he didn't want to return with his parents to what was then [[Soviet Ukraine]], and was the subject of a five-year struggle between U.S. and Soviet courts over his fate, which was decided in his favor in 1985 when Walter turned 18 that October 3 and was no longer a juvenile and thus no longer under any requirements to return to his parents if he didn't want to. Later in the 1980s, [[Estonia]]n national and alleged [[Nazi war criminal]], [[Karl Linnas]], was the target of several sanctuary denials outside the United States before he was finally returned in 1987 to the then-[[USSR]] to face a highly likely [[death penalty]] for alleged war crimes that he was convicted of in 1962 (see [[Holocaust trials in Soviet Estonia]]). Linnas died in a Leningrad prison hospital on July 2, 1987 while waiting for a possible retrial in [[Gorbachev]]-era courts, 25 years after [[Khrushchev]]-era courts convicted him [[in absentia]].

=== Sanctuary movement in modern times ===
{{see also|Sanctuary movement}}

Sanctuary of refugees from [[Central America]]n civil wars was a movement in the 1980s. Part of a broader anti-war movement positioned against U.S. foreign policy in Central America, by 1987, 440 [[cities]] in the United States had been declared "[[sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]]" open to migrants from these civil wars in Central America.

These sites included university campuses and cities. From the 1980s continuing into the 2000s, there also have been instances of churches providing "sanctuary" for short periods to migrants facing deportation in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia and Canada, among other nations. In 2007, Iranian refugee Shahla Valadi was granted asylum in Norway after spending seven years in church sanctuary after the initial denial of asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Iranian-given-asylum-in-Norway-20071213|title=Iranian given asylum in Norway|work=[[News24.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 to 2003 Canada experienced 36 sanctuary incidents.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Randy K. Lippert]] (2005). ''Sanctuary, Sovereignty, Sacrifice: Canadian Sanctuary Incidents, Power and Law''. {{ISBN|0-7748-1249-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "New Sanctuary Movement" organization estimates that at least 600,000 people in the United States have at least one family member in danger of deportation.&lt;ref&gt;"Elvira Arellano Arrested Outside Downtown Church: Chicago Immigration Activist Taken Into Custody Sunday Afternoon" [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070820230047/http://cbs2.com/local/local_story_231191810.html CBS2.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, an Icelandic church declared that they would harbour two failed asylum seekers who violated the [[Dublin Regulation]], and police removed them for deportation, as ecclesiastical immunity has no legal standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2016/06/28/asylum_seekers_dragged_out_of_church_by_reykjavik_p/|title=Asylum seekers dragged out of church by Reykjavik Police|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
When referring to a shelter from danger or hardship, sanctuary can mean one of the following:
;Shelter sanctuary
:A place offering protection and safety; a shelter, typically used by [[displaced persons]], [[refugees]], and [[homelessness|homeless people]].
:{{see also|safe house|right of asylum|air-raid shelter|emergency shelter|refugee camp|homeless shelter|humanitarian aid|relief agency|debt relief|psychiatric hospital|hospice|nursing home|special education}}
;Humanitarian sanctuary
:A source of help, relief, or comfort in times of trouble typically used by victims of war and disaster.
;Institutional sanctuary
:An institution for the care of people, especially those with physical or mental impairments, who require organized supervision or assistance.
The term "sanctuary" has further come to be applied to any space set aside for private use in which others are not supposed to intrude, such as a "[[man cave]]".

== Non-human sanctuary ==

=== Animal sanctuary ===
{{Main article|Animal sanctuary}}
An animal sanctuary is a facility where animals are brought to live and be protected for the rest of their lives. Unlike animal shelters, sanctuaries do not seek to place animals with individuals or groups, instead maintaining each animal until its natural death.

=== Plant sanctuary ===
{{Main article|Wildlife preserve}}
Plant sanctuaries are areas set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world.

==About==
'''Source credibility theory''' is an established theory that explains how communication's persuasiveness is affected by the perceived credibility of the source of the communication.&lt;ref name=Hovland1951/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berlo1969&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berlo|first=David K.|author2=Lemert, James B. |author3=Mertz, Robert J. |title=Dimensions for Evaluating the Acceptability of Message Sources|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|date=1969|volume=33|issue=4|pages=563–576|doi=10.1086/267745|jstor=2747566}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credibility of all communication, regardless of format, has been found to be heavily influenced by the ''perceived'' credibility of the source of that communication.&lt;ref name=Lowry2013/&gt;

The idea of credibility was first derived from [[Aristotle]] who argued that the speaker's reliability must be built and established in speech and that what the speaker did or said before such a speech was not of importance. Aristotle divided the aspects of persuasion into three categories: [[ethos]] (credibility), [[pathos]] (emotion) and [[logos]] (logic). As credibility refers to people believing who they trust, emotion and logic indicate a person's emotional connection and means of reasoning to convince one of a particular argument and/or speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aristotle|title=Rhetoric|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area of source credibility is studied for practical applications in [[communication]], [[marketing]], [[law]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="Tellis2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcus1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=George E. |title=With Malice Toward Some: How People Make Civil Liberties Judgments |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date= 1995 |isbn=978-0-521-43997-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaller1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaller |first=John R. |title=The Nature and Originss of Mass Opinion |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==
There are several dimensions of credibility that affect how an audience will perceive the speaker: competence, extraversion, composure, character, and sociability. These dimensions can be related to [[John R. P. French|French]] &amp; [[Bertram Raven|Raven]]'s [[French and Raven's five bases of power|five bases of power]] (see below). These characteristics are fluid and affect each other as well as the speaker's transactional credibility. One dimension may strengthen the speaker's credibility if he/she struggles in another.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann /&gt;

The audience can perceive these attributes through certain behaviors in which the speaker delivers results, is concise and direct with the audience members. If a speaker displays characteristics of honesty, integrity, sincerity, and can show that they are trustworthy and ethical, the audience will be more inclined to believe the message being communicated to them, even if they do not remember every aspect of the interaction. They will, however, recall how the presenter made them feel, how they took in the information and what they may share with others once the presentation has concluded.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann /&gt;

For instance, if a speaker presents the audience with a short clip and includes a witty joke at the conclusion of the video to drive the point home, members of the audience may only remember the joke. Although the joke may only be a small element of the entire speech, someone will recall it and share it with others and perhaps speak kindly of the speaker and wish to interact with that person again, or promise to purchase product or feel inclined to tell anyone who will listen about what they learned. This is when terminal credibility comes into play, but is dependent on how well the speaker presented the information to the audience.

Speakers must also present themselves to be likable since people are more inclined to trust those they generally like or feel comfortable with in a room. Being friendly, easy going, warmhearted, nice and kind can carry the speaker into a very comfortable space with the audience. Once the audience is at ease, the speaker can generally present their information, and it will be perceived positively.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann /&gt;

The late Dr. James C. McCroskey ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]) was known for his research in the dimensions of source credibility. His scales for the measurement of source credibility have been widely used in communication research. He noted in his 1975 article, "Image of Mass Media News Sources", that "the available scales for the measurement of source credibility should not be assumed to be universally applicable measures of source credibility."&lt;ref name=McCroskey1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCroskey|first=James C.|author2=Jenson, Thomas A. |title=Image of Mass Media News Sources|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|date=1975|volume=19|issue=2|series=2|pages=169–180|doi=10.1080/08838157509363777}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his research and his proposed scale from 1975 are still foundations for source credibility research.

In McCroskey's work, he further breaks down each dimension as follows:&lt;ref name=McCroskey1975/&gt;

=== Competence ===

The measurement of competence is based on seven values. These values are qualification, expertise, reliability, believability, openness (i.e. intellectual vs. narrow), value, and currency (i.e., informed vs. uninformed).

=== Character ===

The measurement of character has four values. These are kindness, sympathy, selflessness (i.e., unselfish vs. selfish), and virtue.

=== Sociability ===

The measurement of sociability has three values. These are friendliness, cheer, and temperament (i.e., good natured vs. irritable). Character and sociability may be combined by some researchers. In that case, researchers will employ the seven values under one "Character-Sociability" measurement.

=== Composure ===

Four seemingly synonymous values are assigned to the measurement of composure. These are excitability (composed vs. excitable), calmness (calm vs. anxious), tension (relaxed vs. tense), and poise (poised vs. nervous).

=== Extroversion ===

Like composure, extroversion is composed of four seemingly synonymous values. These are aggressiveness, boldness, talkativeness (i.e. talkative vs. silent), and voice (i.e., verbal vs. quiet).

Dr. McCroskey's research concluded that of the five dimensions of credibility, competence, character and sociability were the most important in establishing and maintaining credibility.&lt;ref name=McCroskey1975/&gt;

==Dynamics==
[[File:Dynamics of Source Credibility.jpg|thumb|Dynamics of source credibility]]
Initial credibility is established before a speaker appears before an audience to deliver a particular message. If there are few people in the audience who know the speaker, the level of credibility is at a low, and just the opposite can apply if the speaker is known. The levels are incredibly high with well-known authors, personalities, celebrities, politicians, professors and the like. For instance, the credibility would be incredibly low if a recently published author walked on a stage as opposed to [[Stephen King]] gracing the place with his presence. One simply has more of a trust/believable factor than the other.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Buhlmann|first=Hans|title=A Course in Credibility Theory and its Applications|date=2006|publisher=Springer Publishing|location=New York|author2=Gisler, Alois }}&lt;/ref&gt;

B.J. Fogg identified initial credibility as surface credibility in his 2003 book ''Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do.'' He defined it as credibility that derives from "initial judgments based on surface traits such as a persons' looks, his or her dress, or hairstyle"&lt;ref name=Fogg2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Fogg|first=B.J.|title=Persuasive technology using computers to change what we think and do|date=2003|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9781558606432|page=132|edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same can be said for [[advertising|advertisements]]. Generally, people are familiar with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Puma SE|Puma]] and [[New Balance]]. A fairly new shoe company would have to work harder to gain customers. If a person/company is virtually unknown, they must create a sense of trust, believability in themselves and their product. People need to see evidence that the person/company can be trusted.  The well-known person/company has to live up to the previous expectations and not disappoint those who have shown up to see them speak and possibly purchase product. The advertising and [[marketing]] industry calls this [[brand management]].&lt;ref name=Buhlmann/&gt;

Transactional credibility is based on what takes place after initial credibility is established and during the course of interaction. Several factors affect credibility at this stage. How the audience receives the speaker's message, if the speaker will make a new or reaffirm old impressions, and how the speaker conveys his/her confidence or lack thereof are just a few. These factors could affect credibility either way for the speaker and affect how well the speaker's message is received. Either consciously or subconsciously, the audience examines the speaker's competence, likeability, passion, character, and, depending on the environment of the interaction, professionalism. To maintain credibility, the speaker should be knowledgeable about the subject, sincere in his/her approach, enthusiastic and even relaxed. All of this will make the audience lean more towards trusting and having faith in the speaker rather than the opposite. In this sense, the audience comes with an expectation and hopes to leave with a better feeling about themselves as it relates to the person, product and/or company.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann/&gt;

Terminal credibility refers to what the audience takes away with them once the interaction has concluded. If the audience felt the speaker had good dimensions of source credibility, the terminal credibility will be high. On the other hand, if the speaker was incompetent, lacked character, did not maintain composure, and came off as unsociable and introverted, the terminal credibility will be low. This final form of credibility hinges on how the audience perceives the speaker and if the speaker uses valid information to get specific points across to those listening. Terminal credibility in one interaction will affect initial credibility in the next.

For example, a teacher delivers a lecture and informs the students that the works of [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] are not considered [[magical realism]] and uses one article in which to defend this argument to make it fit the speech. If students are intrigued and decide to go and delve further into the works of Marquez and finds several articles to prove that the author not only uses magical realism, but is credited with being its founder, then the credibility of the instructor is tarnished, and the students may not trust what is said in the classroom for the remainder of the school year. To ensure that the terminal credibility is positive, enhancing the speech itself is beneficial. A connection should be made with the audience, common ground displayed and speaking with conviction. The key is to build a substantial rapport with the audience so that the terminal credibility is positive.&lt;ref name=Buhlmann/&gt;

==Five bases of power==
{{Main| French and Raven's five bases of power}}
Source credibility has an explicit effect on the bases of power used in persuasion.&lt;ref name=Nesler1993&gt;{{Cite journal | journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=23 |issue=17 |pages=1407–1425 |year=1993 |first=Mitchell S. |last=Nesler |first2=Herman |last2=Aguinis |first3=Brian M. |last3=Quigley |first4=James T. |last4=Tedeschi |title=The Effect of Credibility on Perceived Power |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1993.tb01040.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Source credibility, the bases of power, and objective power, which is established based on variables such as position or title, are interrelated. The levels of each have a direct relationship in the manipulation and levels of one another.

The [[social psychologist]]s [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]] introduced the five bases of power: Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, and Expert.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven&gt;French, J. R. P., Raven, B. H. The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright and A. Zander. Group dynamics. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by Raven's subsequent identification in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.&lt;ref name= Raven1965&gt;Raven, B. H. (1965). Social influence and power. In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.), Current studies in social psychology (pp. 371–382). New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reward power ===

Reward power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has the ability to provide reward, either positive or a decrease in negative result, for the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt; Character and sociability are dimensions of credibility that can help establish reward power.

=== Coercive power ===

Coercive power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has the ability to provide negative results, such as punishment or other reprimand, for the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt;

=== Legitimate power ===

Legitimate power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has the right, such as through a specific role or position, to influence and obtain compliance from the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt;

=== Referent power ===

Referent power is based on the identification with or association with persuading agent by the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt; Character, composure, extroversion and sociability are the dimensions of credibility that help establish referent power.

=== Expert power ===

Expert power is based on the perception that the persuading agent has special knowledge that can be provided to the target of the influence.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven/&gt; Competence is the single dimension of credibility that can be directly linked to establishing expert power.

=== Informational power ===

Informational power is based on the information, or logical argument, that the persuading agent can provide information or obtain information for the target of the influence.&lt;ref name= Raven1965/&gt;

The relationship between measures of power and credibility correlate considerably with one another, indicating that the French and Raven bases of power are not statistically independent concepts. The level of objective power affects the relationship between credibility and perceived social power. Credibility has a direct effect on perceived power. Therefore, individuals with the highest credibility also have the most perceived social power on all of the power bases. When individuals have a low amount of objective power, credibility significantly affects social power ratings.  High credibility increases judgments of perceived reward, coercive, referent, and legitimate powers. Expert powers are also influenced positively, but do not correlate at the highest levels of credibility. Therefore, the highest amount of credibility does not elevate perceived expert powers to the highest levels. However, credibility does not have considerable influence on the perceived social power of individuals with high initial objective power, due to perceptions of powerfulness based on this power.&lt;ref name=Nesler1993/&gt;

==In interpersonal relationships==
[[Interpersonal relationship|Interpersonal]] credibility is based on a listener's perceptions of a speaker's expertness, reliability, intentions, activeness, personal attractiveness and the majority opinion of the listener's associates. First impressions play a significant role in interpersonal credibility and may be enduring.&lt;ref name=Griffin1967&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=K.|title=The Contribution of Studies of Source Credibility to a Theory of Interpersonal Trust in the Communication Process|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1967|volume=68|issue=2|pages=104–120|doi=10.1037/h0024833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both children and adults take confidence and accuracy into account when judging credibility. Adults also take into account calibration (i.e., the speaker's own estimation of their accuracy as demonstrated by confidence and accuracy) and change their assessments of credibility if the speaker is revealed to have inaccurate calibration (e.g. is over- or underconfident). Children believe confident speakers over ones lacking in confidence and do not appear to take calibration into account, possibly because children have not reached the same stage of cognitive development as adults.&lt;ref name=Tenney2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tenney|first=E.|author2=Small, J. |author3=Kondrad, R. |author4=Jaswal, V. |author5= Spellman, B. |title=Accuracy, Confidence, and Calibration: How Young Children and Adults Assess Credibility|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2011|volume=47|issue=4|pages=1065–1077 |doi=10.1037/a0023273 |pmid=21443337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
Candidates in [[political campaign]]s use credibility extensively to influence the attitudes and opinions of [[voting|voters]].&lt;ref name= Druckman1965&gt;{{Cite journal | journal= The Journal of Politics |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1180–1202 |year=2004 |first=James N. |last=Druckman |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Jacobs |first3=Eric |last3= Ostermeier |title= Candidate Strategies to Prime Issues and Image |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3816.2004.00295.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They attempt to prime, or connect specific issues or personality traits, to persuade voters to focus on those issues favorable to the candidate to influence a more positive opinion of the candidate.

A candidate's credibility is important in determining the effectiveness of political advertising.&lt;ref name= Lee2011&gt;{{Cite journal | journal= The Social Science Journal |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=659–671 |year=2011 |first=Yu-Kang |last=Lee |first2=Chun-Tuan |last2=Chang |title= Missing ingredients in political advertising: The right formula for political sophistication and candidate credibility |doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2011.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements for candidates with high credibility have a greater impact on influencing audiences and potential voters. Low credibility reduces the impact and influence of negative or comparative advertising supporting the candidate. A candidate with high credibility will better withstand the influences of any negative advertising.

Another application of credibility in politics is endorsements by celebrities attempting to use their status to influence voters.&lt;ref name= Morin2012&gt;Morin, D. T., Ivory, J. D., &amp; Tubbs, M. (2012, December). Celebrity and politics: Effects of endorser credibility and sex on voter attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors. Social Science Journal, Volume 49, Issue 4, p. 413-420&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrity credibility is based on numerous attributes, the most influential of which are trustworthiness and competence. High-credibility and low-credibility celebrity endorsers are perceived very differently. However, the level of credibility of celebrity endorsers, while important in the conveyance of their messages, does not influence the credibility of or attitudes toward candidates. They, therefore, may not change the political public opinions or voting behaviors of their audience.

==Media credibility==
Media credibility refers to the perceived believability of [[content (media)|media content]] "beyond any proof of its contentions."&lt;ref name=West1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Mark Douglas|title=Validating a Scale for the Measurement of Credibility: A Covariance Structure Modeling Approach|journal=Journalism Quarterly|date=1994|volume=71|issue=1|pages=159–168|doi=10.1177/107769909407100115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its roots are in Hovland's classic persuasion research on source credibility, media credibility research has shifted the focus from characteristics of individual, personal sources to characteristics of media behaviors such as objectivity, accuracy, fairness, and lack of bias.&lt;ref name=Gaziano1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=Cecilie|author2=McGrath, Kristin |title=Measuring the Concept of Credibility|journal=Journalism Quarterly|date=1986|volume=63|issue=3|pages=451–462|doi=10.1177/107769908606300301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research has found that media credibility is an important part, along with message characteristics and audience characteristics, of effective communication.&lt;ref name=Zhu2002/&gt;

According to [[Dan Gillmor]] when becoming [http://mediactive.com/book/table-of-contents-2/ mediactive] (i.e., an active consumer of media) source credibility is a very important aspect. He suggests that users be skeptical; they should be on the lookout for [[fallacy|fallacies]], such as the two-side fallacy, and people who are paid to persuade. He also believes that people need to exercise judgment, the idea of assuming that everything is lying is just as much a problem as assuming that everything posted or published is the truth.  Opening your mind is another important concept when considering source credibility. Most people are likely to consider a source credible if the content reflects ideas that the user also holds. Finally, Gillmor advises that people keep asking questions and follow up on sources to help realize their credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillmor|first=Dan|title=Mediactive|url=http://mediactive.com/2-0-chapter-2-becoming-an-active-user-principles/|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credibility is a core value of American [[journalism]].&lt;ref name=Miller2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=A.|author2=Kurpius, D. |title=A Citizen-Eye View of Television News Source Credibility|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=2010|pages=137–156|doi=10.1177/0002764210376315|volume=54|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Credibility also is essential to the business aspect of the media. Loss of credibility may translate to loss of [[audience]]. [[Journalists]] themselves view loss of credibility as the biggest issue facing the industry.&lt;ref name=Doherty2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doherty|first=C.|title=The Public Isn't Buying Press Credibility|journal=Nieman Reports|date=2005|issue=Summer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the media occupies a significant part of people's daily lives, it significantly impacts the [[social constructionism|social construction of reality]], the shape of public consciousness and the direction of [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] change.&lt;ref name=Bandura2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=A.|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|journal=Media Psychology|date=2001|pages=265–299|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0303_03|volume=3|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, media's credibility is as important as the message itself.

=== Journalist credibility ===

The actions of some journalists have raised questions about credibility. [[Joe McGinniss]] was criticized for misleading accused killer [[Jeffrey MacDonald]] about whether or not he believed MacDonald innocent. [[Janet Cooke]] fabricated a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning story in [[The Washington Post]]. [[Jack Kelley (journalist)|Jack Kelley]] fabricated stories that appeared in [[USA Today]] over a period of years. [[Jayson Blair]] plagiarized and fabricated [[New York Times]] stories. [[Dan Rather]]'s career at [[CBS News]] ended after issues surrounding the credibility of a story. Numerous other examples of journalism [[scandal]]s center on credibility issues. But, while credibility issues may end an individual journalist's career, those scandals do not seem to have much impact on public opinion; the public is mostly unaware of individual transgressions; when it is aware, it is not shocked; a majority of the public surveyed said news organizations sometimes made up stories.&lt;ref name=Doherty2005/&gt;

=== Source credibility ===

[[Television]] viewers distinguish between the credibility of official (or elite) and citizen (or nonelite) [[Source (journalism)|sources]].&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt; Expert ratings alter subjects' judgments of source credibility.&lt;ref name=Markham1965&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=D.H.|title=The Dimensions of Source Credibility of Television Newscasters|date=1965|publisher=The University of Oklahoma|location=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Race (human classification)|Race]] does not affect credibility. Debate about the credibility of [[elite]] versus nonelite sources dates back to at least the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt; [[Walter Lippmann]] argued in favor of elite sources in his 1922 book [[Public Opinion]]. [[John Dewey]] argued citizens are credible sources in his 1927 book [[The Public and its Problems]]. Elite, male sources outnumber nonelite, female and minority sources in American journalism.  Television news viewers perceive stories with elite sources as significantly more credible than stories with nonelite sources. Source titles and manner of dress played a larger role in viewer estimations of credibility than did either race or even what the sources said on air.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Hard news and soft news ===

Journalists and television viewers distinguish between hard news and soft news (or [[infotainment]]). Television viewers find hard news more credible than soft news.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Media type ===

Whether a story appears in a [[magazine]], [[newspaper]] or on television may also affect credibility. The credibility assigned to different media varies by race and gender of news consumers.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== No-source stories ===

Television viewers do not assign significantly more credibility to stories that include sources than they do to no-source stories.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;  This aligns with research suggesting that citing authorities in speeches that advocate a position makes little difference in shifting listener opinion.&lt;ref name=Markham1965/&gt;

=== Overall media credibility ===

Viewers do not hold broadcast news as particularly credible and the credibility of broadcast news in the public's eyes is in decline. There is increasing evidence of public skepticism of media content.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt; The [[General Social Survey]] charts a slide in media credibility ratings since the late 1980s. Contributory factors may include a perception that powerful people and organizations influence the press, doubt about media fairness, doubt about journalists' willingness to admit error, cynicism about standards and performance, and questions about values, morals and partisanship.&lt;ref name=Doherty2005/&gt;

=== New media ===

New media, such as [[blog]]s, are changing journalism. One study found that random citizens who contributed to a blog increased their credibility over time, to the point that traditional media outlets quoted them as sources.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Education ===

Less educated people trust media content more than more educated people.&lt;ref name=Miller2010/&gt;

=== Media Credibility Index (from the International Council for Press and Broadcasting)===

The Media Credibility Index is a relatively new publication, produced annually by the [[Next Century Foundation]] (NCF), together with the [[International Council for Press and Broadcasting]]. It was launched at the NCF's 2011 [[International Media Awards]]. It is currently being developed to try and cover a wide range of publications, assessing them in terms of press freedom, accuracy, incitement, bias, sensitivity and transparency, awarding plus or minus points as is seen fit. Points awarded are only based on items reported to the International Council for Press and Broadcasting that have been posted on the NCF media blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncfpeace.org/drupal/aggregator |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053941/http://www.ncfpeace.org/drupal/aggregator |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Index is to foster good journalism, responsible editing, balanced broadcasting and more responsible treatment of media professionals. It mostly focuses on Anglo-American media, the Middle East and South Asia.

==The Internet==
The development of the internet and its delivery of online information have created a new information environment that can affect perceptions of the credibility of that information. Online information can be created by amateur sources (e.g., [[blog]]s and [[citizen journalism]]) posted on personal sites or on news websites (e.g., comments on news stories, [[CNN]]'s [[iReport]]). Seeking to satiate the insatiable online audience with "instant" news can result in inaccuracies and premature conclusions. Online "[[opinion poll|polls]]" intended to allow the audience to express opinions are insufficient in that they are neither random nor representative samples. The freedom for anyone to publish anything and the convergence of information genres (i.e., [[infotainment]]) affect editorial review and credibility.&lt;ref name=Rubin2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Rebecca B.|title=Communication Research Measures II: A Sourcebook|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY|page=96|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/sooner/Doc?id=10305773&amp;ppg=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the impact of the internet on value orientations in mainland [[China]] by Jonathan Zhu and Zhou He ([[University of Hong Kong]]) revealed that credibility of the internet was far more important than conventional media to Chinese citizens. This may be because conventional media has a historical record of being credible whereas internet sources, especially [[user-generated content]], can be questionable.&lt;ref name=Zhu2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Jonathan J. H.|author2=He, Zhou |title=Information Accessibility, User Sophistication, and Source Credibility: The Impact of the Internet on Value Orientations in Mainland China|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=January 2002|volume=7|issue=2|pages=0|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Websites are often the first or only interaction consumers have with a company. Also, these interactions are usually short- in the magnitude of a few seconds to a few minutes. Source credibility can be established online in a number of ways to include [[logo]] design, website sophistication, and [[citation|source citation]]. Lowry, Wilson and Haig (2013) showed that well designed logos that are [[synergy|synergistic]] with the company's product/service can trigger positive credibility judgments about the company's website and results in greater trust and willingness to interact with the company. These effects are magnified when the [[website design]] extends and complements the logo design.&lt;ref name=Lowry2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowry|first=Paul Benjamin|author2=Wilson, David W. |author3=Haig, William L. |title=A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words: Source Credibility Theory Applied to Logo and Website Design for Heightened Credibility and Consumer Trust|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction|date=June 2013|volume=30|issue=1|pages=63–93|ssrn=2273535|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/10447318.2013.839899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional source credibility theory research has shown that [[color scheme]]s and other [[visual language|visual elements]] can predict perceptions of credibility.&lt;ref name=Gianluigi2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gianluigi|first=Guido|author2=Prete, M. Irene |author3=Sammarco, Luigi |title=Prototypes Versus Examples: A New Model of Online Credibility for Commercial Websites|journal=Journal of Targeting, Measurement &amp; Analysis for Marketing|date=March 2010|volume=18|issue=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.1057/jt.2009.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[social media]] sites, source credibility can be ascribed based on the number of followers and the ratio between followers and follows a user has. Research by Westerman, Spence and Van Der Heide (2011) shows that there is a curvilinear effect for the number of followers, "such that having too many or too few connections results in lower judgments of expertise and trustworthiness." A narrow gap between followers and follows may also result in a higher perception of competence (i.e., if a user has many followers but does not follow many others, that person may be regarded as less of an expert).&lt;ref name=Westerman2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westerman|first=David |author2=Spence, Patric R. |author3=Van Der Heide, Brandon |title=A Social Network as Information: The Effect of System Generated Reports of Connectedness on Credibility on Twitter|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2012|volume=28|pages=199–206|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research showed that frequency of updates led to higher perception of credibility.&lt;ref name=Klout&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Chad|author2=Spence, Patric R. |author3=Gentile, Christina J. |author4=Edwards, America |author5= Edwards, Autumn |title=How Much Klout Do You Have... A Test of System Generated Cues on Source Credibility|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|volume=29|issue=5|pages=A12–A16|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Klout|Klout.com]] is a [[social analytics|social media analytic]] website and [[mobile application software|app]] that ranks users according to online social influence and assigns a "Klout Score". Research by Westerman et al. has shown that a higher "Klout Score" results in higher perceived competence and character but has no bearing on the caring (i.e., sociability) dimension of credibility.&lt;ref name=Klout/&gt;

Focus groups have also shown that users evaluation criteria of [[blog]] credibility slightly differed from that of traditional media credibility. Participants indicated that the source of the blog was the first component evaluated and factors such as the source's knowledge, passion, transparency, reliability, and influence impacted credibility judgements. Participants also indicated that the blog's message/content needed to be authentic, insightful, informative, consistent, accurate, timely, popular, fair, and focused.&lt;ref name=Klout/&gt;

==Popular culture==
Source credibility has an enormous role in [[popular culture]]. [[Celebrity]] [[Testimonial|endorsement]] is a popular [[communication]] strategy in advertising and relies heavily on source credibility, at least in the [[United States]]. Dr. Roobina Ohanian developed a scale for assessing celebrity credibility and assessed the impact of celebrity credibility on consumers' purchase intentions. Her scale measured three components: attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise. Though not as precise as McCroskey's scale, Ohanian's scale has been widely used in the United States.&lt;ref name=Ohanian1990&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ohanian|first=Roobina|title=Construction and Validation of a Scale to Measure Celebrity Endorsers' Perceived Expertise, Trustworthiness, and Attractiveness|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=1990|volume=19|issue=3|pages=39–52|issn=0091-3367|doi=10.1080/00913367.1990.10673191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kan2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Kan|first=Ying Che Ruth|title=Dissertation: Celebrity Advertising and Source Credibility in Hong Kong|date=2012|publisher=University of Newcastle|location=Newcastle, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional sports|Professional athletes]]' credibility is also important to pop culture. An athlete's credibility differs a little, however, from typical celebrity endorsers. Research indicates that negative information about an endorsing athlete can lead to negative impact directed toward the endorsed brand or product. Issues outside the realm of sport have been considered the source of negative information about an athlete (e.g., a [[scandal]] or [[crime]]). For example, when [[Tiger Woods]]' sex scandal became known to the public, [[Gatorade]] immediately severed its ties. Likewise, when [[Michael Phelps]] was indicted for [[substance abuse|illegal drug use]], [[Kellog's]] dropped him from their [[advertising campaign]]s.&lt;ref name=Koo2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koo|first=Gi-Yong|author2=Ruihley, Brody J |author3=Dittmore, Stephen W |title=Impact of Perceived On-Field Performance on Sport Celebrity Source Credibility|journal=Sport Marketing Quarterly|date=2012|volume=21|pages=147–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic performance, however, has come into question of whether it affects source credibility and, remarkably, it does. A study by Koo, Ruihley, and Dittmore (2012) shows that athletic performance is seen subconsciously as a reflection of a celebrity athlete's [[trustworthiness]]. Additionally, maintained or increased athletic performance following negative news may help the celebrity athlete to maintain or quickly regain his/her credibility.&lt;ref name=Koo2012/&gt;

Celebrity source credibility goes beyond product/brand endorsement, though. [[Oprah Winfrey]], for example, was touted as the "doyenne of [[daytime television]]," and, as such, had an incredible following. She was able to utilize her credibility in a number of ways. Her [[Oprah's Book Club|book club]] would bring nearly instant success to any featured author. Her [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|talk show]] would bring out the best (and worst) in its guests. And, most recently, she has been able to use her credibility and past success as the foundation for a media empire.&lt;ref name=Oprah2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Oprah's Achievement|newspaper=USA TODAY|date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical attractiveness is another component relative to pop culture that has been researched. [[Physical attractiveness]] has been linked to credibility as an aspect of likability which can be classified under sociability or trustworthiness.&lt;ref name=Patzer1983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patzer|first=Gordon L.|title=Source Credibility as a Function of Communicator Physical Attractiveness|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=1983|volume=11|issue=2|pages=229–241|doi=10.1016/0148-2963(83)90030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research shows age has an effect on credibility. Steinhaus and Lapitsky showed that women of varying ages ascribe more credibility to older [[Model (profession)|fashion models]] than younger ones. Their research concluded that "similarity between older models and older consumers resulted in significant positive effects for source credibility and interpersonal attraction. Younger consumers evaluated older models higher than younger models on one dimension of credibility, but indicated no other significant differences in attitudes toward younger or older models."&lt;ref name=Steinhaus1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinhaus|first=Nancy H.|author2=Lapitsky, Mary |title=Fashion Model's Age as an Influence on Consumers' Attitudes and Purchase Intent|journal=Family &amp; Consumer Sciences|date=March 1986|volume=14|issue=3|pages=294–305|doi=10.1177/1077727X8601400303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish general strike''' (sv. ''Storstrejken'') of August 4 to September 4, 1909, was a [[General Strike|general work stoppage]] by over 300,000 individuals all over [[Sweden]]. It was the first major conflict between the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]] (sv. ''Landsorganisationen, LO''), and the [[Swedish Employers Association]] (sv. ''Svenska Arbetsgivareföreningen, SAF''). The losses to employers was estimated to be around 25 million [[Swedish kronor]].

[[Recession]] was having a negative impact on many companies and the SAF therefore wanted to lower wages. A [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] of 80,000 workers in the [[Textile manufacturing|textile]]-, [[sawmill]]- and [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp industry]] was put in effect. The LO answered with a call for [[general strike]]. Only [[healthcare]] workers and a few other skeleton professions were exempt from the strike.

Funds were short and forced the union to end the strike after a month, resulting in major membership losses. The LO lost almost half of its members, some to the newly formed [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]].  The anarcho-syndicalists argued that the management of the LO had handled the strike half-heartedly and only started it to curb its members' more radical stance. Employers also took the opportunity to lay off approximately 20,000 workers, which also contributed to mass defections from LO when workers were forced to leave the union to keep their jobs. [[Emigration]] also rose as a consequence of the strike.

The failure of the general strike formed an important backdrop to the [[Saltsjöbaden Agreement]] of 1938.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3732">'''Thalarion''' is a fictional location appearing in several unrelated works.

==H. P. Lovecraft==
Thalarion is a fictional location in [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Dreamlands]]. The name refers to one of the largest [[city|cities]] in the Dreamlands, known as the "City of a Thousand Wonders", where all the mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom reside. Its walls are grim and grey, with a great carven gate called Akariel, and the spires of its temples reach to the sky so that none might behold their peaks. The dream traveler [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Elton, Basil|Basil Elton]] described the city as "fascinating yet repellent". It is implied that any human who enters dies or is transformed somehow, and in the city are said to "walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men". The city is ruled by an entity known as the [[Eidolon (apparition)|eidolon]] Lathi. Thalarion is mentioned in ''[[The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath]]'' and ''[[The White Ship (story)|The White Ship]]''.

Thalarion is also a fictional [[island]] centered in the [[DC Comics]] book ''[[Wonder Woman]]''.

===Fictional history===
Thalarion was created by the [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian]] god [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] to home his newly created race of male warriors, the [[Gargareans]]. Deemed the site of the second rebirth of the Olympians, it was created {{convert|300|nmi|km}} from the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]]. On the island Zeus created a kingdom city, with the central part made of clear crystal so that there would be no secrets from its occupants. 

A river of molten gold flowed through the city so that each Olympian could share in its wealth and there would never be a need for jealousy. Zeus also provided the island with winged lions and winged horses so that the Gargareans could travel by air. 

In contrast to Themyscira, only men were allowed to set foot on Thalarion, and only those who had the permission of the Olympians. All others were killed on sight. By Zeus' decree, Athena the goddess of wisdom was the only woman permitted to visit Thalarion.

One of the more renowned residents of Thalarion was Jason, the fame Argonaut who sailed with Heracles upon the Argo centuries ago. Jason was the leader of the Olympian army, and [[Olympian (comics)#Achilles Warkiller|Achilles Warkiller]] was their king.

'''''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''''' (2001) is an [[art history]] book  by Dr. Larry Shiner (1934- ), Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, History, and Visual Arts at the [[University of Illinois, Springfield]]  &lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History: review|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-226-75342-3|journal=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo3633486.html|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiner spent over a decade to finish the work of this book.&lt;ref name="uis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.edu/philosophy/faculty/research/shiner.html |title=Dr. Larry Shiner - Research - Philosophy |publisher=uis.edu |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The book sees [[fine art]] as a modern invention due to [[social transformation]]s during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

David Clowney, writing for ''Contemporary Aesthetics'' summarizes the central thesis of this book.

"In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History , Larry Shiner claims that [[Art]] with a capital A, [[Fine Art]], was invented in the west in the eighteenth century. The claim is not original with him; he credits [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]]’s essay “The Modern System of the Arts” as the inspiration for his work. Others have made this claim as well, among them [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Paul Mattick]], and [[Terry Eagleton]]. What Shiner has added is a detailed proof of the Kristeller claim using the methods of intellectual, social, cultural, and art history.

In brief, the thesis is this: There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art,” in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “[[skill]]”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war,” “the art of love,” and “the art of medicine.”"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=David Clowney|accessdate=23 January 2017|date=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into five parts
* ''I.   Before Fine Art and Craft'' - Details the lack of any differentiation between skilled work of any type during three periods of history; classical antiquity, the middle ages, and [[the Renaissance]]. The lack of any social role separating artists from artisans, nor any concept of the aesthetic is also discussed. In the final chapter of Part I, the beginnings of some differentiation during the 17th century is described.
* ''II.  Art Divided''
* ''III. Countercurrents'' 
* ''IV.  The Apotheosis of Art'' 
* ''V.   Beyond Art and Craft''.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

==Quotes==
“The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.” (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)

== Reviews ==
In a book review published in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Mitch Avila   wrote:&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Avila|first1=Mitch|title=Reviews: The Invention of Art: A Cultural History by Larry Shiner|journal= The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume= 61|issue=4|pages=401–403|date=Autumn 2003|jstor= 1559075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shiner aptly characterizes his narrative as one that aims to heal the unnecessarily fractured conceptions of art and art practice that mark the contemporary artworld... By showing that the essentialist conception of art, along with its normative and regulative implications, is the artifact of a particular historical and cultural world, Shiner invites us to freely respond to the manifold richness of human expression and embellishment.

'''[[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[slaves]]''' throughout the Islamic world, and in the '''[[Delhi Sultanate]]''' were valued members of society. Their value, for their patrons, was their military capabilities, their loyalty and discipline. Their ability to capitalize on opportunity for social mobility, while maintaining their own unique cultural identity created an interesting tension in their social narrative. Their slave origins created a discrepancy in their nobility. This discrepancy was often eluded in commentary by the Persian Chroniclers of the time.

==Origins==
The need to secure the Sultanate regime from Mongol marauders led to the delineation of a frontier that needed to be defended.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate," Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 45–77.&lt;/ref&gt; To guard the Punjab marches, there was increasingly more and more slaves that were being bought.  Their allegiance was not along ethnic lines, and their dedicated patronage allowed them to incorporate themselves into the military hierarchy as trusted officers and commanders. The Sultanate bought Turks in order to develop a strong cavalry arm and in particular to amass a corps of mounted archers.&lt;ref&gt;Peter. Jackson, "Turkish Slaves on Islam’s Indian Frontier," in Slavery &amp; South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006), 63–82&lt;/ref&gt; This was a proprietary way to build their military capacity, by taking advantage of a unique skillset. [[Jalaluddin Firuz Khalji]] and [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] were both frontier military commanders. When they tried to capitalize on their achievements, and take over the Delhi Sultanate they were not given support because of their un-noble origins.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate," Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 45–77&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at the high level of military success, advancement and capacity that the Turkish Slaves added, it is disproportionate to popular sentiment regarding their Slavic origins.

==''Turkishness''==
The Delhi Sultanate was shaped in many ways by the Turkish Slaves. To a significant extent the early Delhi Sultans, themselves of Turkic origin, deliberately sought to import exclusive signs of "Turkishness".&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "Service, Status, and Military Slavery in the Delhi Sultanate: Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries." in Slavery &amp; South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006)86&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian Chroniclers had to learn the Turkish language, and the Turkic language spread throughout the Sultanate. It is undeniable that the Turks strongly resisted cultural influences whether [[Hindu]] or [[Buddhist]], and retained their unique identity which actually centered around a Persian culture and [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter. Jackson, "Turkish Slaves on Islam’s Indian Frontier," in Slavery &amp; South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006)65&lt;/ref&gt; Turks, being brought into a foreign land, having no particular ethnic allegiance still maintained a cultural identity.  In addition to holding high rank in the military, certain Turks, that were particularly dedicated to their patron also enjoyed holding ceremonial positions in court.&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Slaves 64&lt;/ref&gt; The sultans even honored non-turks with Turkish titles.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "Service, Status, and Military Slavery in the Delhi Sultanate: Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries." in Slavery &amp; South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006), 83–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Status==

As one Sufi saint noted "they were slaves, not learned in the secretarial or Islamic sciences, they were rude, bellicose and vain and their military calling undoubtedly led to unjust killing of innocent people".&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "Service, Status, and Military Slavery in the Delhi Sultanate: Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries." in Slavery &amp; South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006), 89&lt;/ref&gt; One can see when viewing how the institution of Turkish Slaves in the Delhi sultanate created a problem. Their excellence was preceded by slave origins. These origins were often not spoken of, where possible, in order to create a more refined image. The quality of being a Turk per se, was not a problem it was their slave origin that created a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate," Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 61&lt;/ref&gt; It was ironic that these marginalized groups happened to be the political elites and Sultans of Delhi in itself creates a telling commentary on the incomplete state of evidence and the dire need to rewrite the narrative of the sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate," Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 45–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in the Sultanate==

There existed a [[racial segregation|racial divide]] among the [[Persian people|Persians]] and the [[Arabs]], this was displayed in social riots. [[History of slavery in the Muslim world|The free counterparts to the slave]]s were distinct members of society, and were not able to predicate the term to which the Sultanate and the slaves would maintain its power. Authority was derived mostly from their patronage, and while they were deployed as military slaves it did not hinder their ability to seize political power. Their privileged job opportunities were not invulnerable to critique because of their slave origin. This shows that while status within the Sultanate can be seen through post - their origins were inescapable social paradigms. This is a subtle continuity of the hierarchical class structure based on birth from the [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. They were termed 'new Muslims' within the Sultanate.

==Reputation==
Turkish slavery was very distinct from the conventional idea of a slave-master relationship. While it was based on subservience, the high ranking positions and yielded power that resulted from their careers created an aura of power, rather than weakness and submission. Their reputation did not hinge on social status but on their relationship and their career. They had a mixed reputation for greed and turbulence as well as for martial accomplishments and perseverance in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar, "The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate," Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 45–77.&lt;/ref&gt; They had subordinates of their own, and they had a level of autonomy that created a dismay from onlookers who were aware of their Slavic origins. Within the Sultanate, which was composed of Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Turks, Afghans and many other groups - the reputation of the Turks was of high stature - regarding them as elites in the community.

==Impact==
The infusion of immigrants from the Afghan Punjab frontier into the Delhi Sultanate helped shape its future. Social and cultural history of Muslim society, and the reproduction of authority within the Delhi Sultanate can be attributed to these slaves. Their ambition was often degraded by their social status, through the scope of the existing ideals of the Persian Chroniclers and the institutionalized caste system of the Hindus. The outsiders, the deployed slaves, and their purpose can be said to be more than just military assets. They created for themselves their own circles of elites. They did this while maintaining their identity. Their language spread throughout the sultanate. Their story, often eluded by the narratives of the time, is one of dedication and discipline. Skills and expertise in battle acted as a catalyst to gain favor, reverence, that lead to high ranking positions which placed them as an authority in a heterogeneous society. The deliberate tension within the Delhi Sultanate due to their Slavic origins, only further displays their importance in society. The role of the Sultans, as former Slaves, and their attempt to spread turkishness, by electing Turkish titles to non-turks, and by incorporating the Turkish slave into high governing ranks in the court - shapes the landscape both socially and politically. These 'new muslims' helped shape the identity of the Delhi Sultanate and help instil the Islamic Culture into this Indian Kingdom.

==Studies==

In the broader context of learning about South Asian history, one can find an inconclusive range of facts surrounding the portrayal of day-to-day life. Often, certain aspects of society or identity are left out because either they are thought to be insignificant or not part of the greater narrative. As one can see in the example of the Turkish Slaves, the court chroniclers chose to elude aspects of their history. So, as the authors that have been referenced in this article have done, one must piece together the puzzle. To do this, the authors thought outside the box and looked beyond court scribes,into memoirs, personal letters, and documents indirectly linked to the topic. Turkish slaves provide a narrative of capitalizing on opportunity, building authority, and creating a reputation so large that its true origins had to be hidden, for they may tarnish views on their accomplishments. It is also questioned if the deployment into the frontiers and employment into the Delhi Sultanate a way for the 'Turkish'  culture to flourish or it was a way to ensure the authority of Islam could flourish, through the installation of military men into the capital.

'''Venus''' ({{IPAc-en|'|v|i:|n|ə|s}}, Classical Latin: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛ|n|ʊ|s}}) is the [[List of Roman deities|Roman goddess]], whose functions encompassed love, beauty, desire, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sex]], fertility, prosperity and victory. In [[Roman mythology]], she was the mother of the Roman people through her son, [[Aeneas]], who survived the [[Trojan War|fall of Troy]] and fled to Italy. [[Julius Caesar]] claimed her as his ancestor. Venus was central to many [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]], and was revered in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] under numerous cult titles.

The Romans adapted the myths and iconography of her [[interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] [[Aphrodite]] for [[Roman art]] and [[Latin literature]]. In the later [[classical tradition]] of [[Western culture|the West]], Venus became one of the most widely referenced deities of [[classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]] as the embodiment of love and sexuality.

==Name and attributes==
{{Ancient Roman religion}}
Venus embodies [[sexuality in ancient Rome|sex]], love, beauty, enticement, seduction, and persuasive female charm among the community of immortal gods; in Latin orthography, her name is indistinguishable from the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] noun ''venus'' ("[[sexual love]]" and "[[sexual desire]]"), from which it derives.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, 1879, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DVenus1 "Venus", (B, Transf.], at perseus.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walde &amp; Hofmann, [https://archive.org/stream/walde/Walde#page/n1661/mode/1up ''Lateinisches etymologisches Wörterbuch''], 3rd ed. 1938, vol. 2, p. 752-753.&lt;/ref&gt; It has connections to ''venerari'' ("to honour, to try to please") and ''venia'' ("grace, favour") through a possible common root in an Indo-European ''*wenes-'' or ''*u̯enis'' ("friend"). Their common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root is assumed as ''*wen-'' or ''*u̯en-'' "to strive for, wish for, desire, love").&lt;ref&gt;J. Pokorny, [http://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary//u̯en-1_u̯enə.htm ''Indo-European Etymological Dictionary''], p. 1146-1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Venus |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000. |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Venus Etymonline link (Harper)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also William W.Skeat ''Etymological Dictionary of the English Language'' New York, 2011 (first ed. 1882) s. v. venerable, venereal, venial.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J. P., and Adams, D. Q. (Editors), ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997, p. 158. {{ISBN|1-884964-98-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roman Venus MBA Lyon L83.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|Bronze figurine of Venus, [[Lyon]] (Roman [[Lugdunum]])]] 
Venus has been described as perhaps "the most original creation of the Roman pantheon",&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, R., p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; and "an ill-defined and assimilative" native goddess, combined "with a strange and exotic Aphrodite".&lt;ref&gt;Eden, p. 458ff. Eden is discussing possible associations between the [[Astarte]] or "Venus of [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]]" and the [[brassica]] species ''[[Eruca sativa|E. sativa]]'', which the Romans considered an aphrodisiac.&lt;/ref&gt; Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the [[Religion in ancient Rome#Superstitio and magic|unofficial, illicit manipulation]] of divine forces through magic.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling ''La religion romaine de Venus depuis les origines jusqu'au temps d' Auguste'' Paris, 1954, pp. 13–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling "La relation Venus venia", ''Latomus'', 21, 1962, pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt; The ambivalence of her persuasive functions has been perceived in the relationship of the root ''*venes-'' with Latin ''venenum'' (poison), in the sense of "a charm, magic [[Potion|philtre]]".&lt;ref&gt;Linked through an adjectival form ''*venes-no-'': William W. Skeat ''ibid''. s.v. "venom"&lt;/ref&gt;

In myth, Venus-Aphrodite was born of sea-foam. Roman [[theology]] presents Venus as the yielding, watery female principle, essential to the generation and balance of life. Her male counterparts in the Roman pantheon, [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], are active and fiery. Venus absorbs and tempers the male essence, uniting the opposites of male and female in mutual affection. She is essentially assimilative and benign, and embraces several otherwise quite disparate functions. She can give military victory, sexual success, good fortune and prosperity. In one context, she is a goddess of prostitutes; in another, she turns the hearts of men and women from sexual vice to virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Staples, Ariadne, ''From Good Goddess to vestal virgins: sex and category in Roman religion'', Routledge, 1998, pp. 12, 15–16, 24 – 26, 149 – 150: [[Varro]]'s theology identifies Venus with water as an aspect of the female principle. To generate life, the watery matrix of the womb requires the virile warmth of fire. To sustain life, water and fire must be balanced; excess of either one, or their mutual antagonism, are unproductive or destructive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of Venus have been found in domestic murals, mosaics&lt;!-- Need text and image of Bignor Venus and "gladiator-cupids", if possible: Imperial era stuff, and Venus as vehicle of Imperial religion and ludi  --&gt; and household shrines (''lararia''). [[Petronius]], in his ''[[Satyricon]]'', places an image of Venus among the [[Lares]] (household gods) of the [[freedman]] [[Trimalchio]]'s ''lararium''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann-Heinimann, in Rüpke (ed), 197–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective brides offered Venus a gift "before the wedding"; the nature of the gift, and its timing, are unknown. Some Roman sources say that girls who come of age offer their toys to Venus; it is unclear where the offering is made, and others say this gift is to the Lares.&lt;ref&gt;Hersch, Karen K., The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity, Cambridge University Press, 2010, pp. 66 – 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In dice-games, a popular pastime among Romans of all classes, the luckiest, best possible roll was known as "[[Venus Throw|Venus]]".

===Signs and symbols===
[[File:Medallion painting of Venus Aphrodite with a golden diadem and scepter, pearl earrings and necklace, House of Marcus Fabius Rufus, Pompeii 2.jpg|thumb|A medallion painting from the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus in [[Pompeii]], Italy, executed in the [[Pompeian Styles|Second Style]] and depicting the Greco-Roman goddess Venus-Aphrodite wearing a [[diadem]] and holding a [[scepter]]; it is dated to the 1st century BC.]]
Venus' [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#signum|signs]] were for the most part the same as Aphrodite's. They include roses, which were offered in Venus' [[Porta Collina]] rites,&lt;ref&gt;Eden, P.T., Venus and the Cabbage, Hermes, 91, (1963), p. 456, citing Ovid, ''Fasti'' 4, 869–870 cf. I35-I38; Ovid describes the rites observed in the early Imperial era, when the temple environs were part of the Gardens of Sallust.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- A bit of an oddment - not sure how best to incorporate --&gt; and above all, myrtle (Latin ''murtos''), which was cultivated for its white, sweetly scented flowers, aromatic, evergreen leaves and its various medical-magical properties. Venus' statues, and her worshipers, wore myrtle crowns at her festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, H. S., ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion, Vol. 2, Transition and reversal in myth and ritual,'' Brill, 1994, p. 262 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kWU33X4gPmUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Inconsistencies+in+Greek+and+Roman+Religion:+Transition+and+reversal+in+myth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Uy8IKisL1&amp;sig=STtg94MzGZ0jPlFq0TK09NPcNwk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ukfgTJ79I8XMhAfcq_3JDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Before its adoption into Venus' cults, myrtle was used in the purification rites of [[Cloacina]], the Etruscan-Roman goddess of Rome's [[Cloaca Maxima|main sewer]]; later, Cloacina's association with Venus' sacred plant made her [[Venus Felix|Venus Cloacina]]. Likewise, Roman folk-etymology transformed the ancient, obscure goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]] into "Venus of the Myrtles, whom we now call Murcia".&lt;ref&gt;Eden, pp. 457 – 8, citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', Book 15, 119 – 121. ''Murcia'' had a shrine at the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myrtus|Myrtle]] was thought a particularly potent [[aphrodisiac]]. The [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female genitals|female pudendum]], particularly the clitoris, was known as ''murtos'' (myrtle). As goddess of love and sex, Venus played an essential role at Roman prenuptial rites and wedding nights, so myrtle and roses were used in bridal bouquets. Marriage itself was not a seduction but a lawful condition, under [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s authority; so myrtle was excluded from the [[bridal crown]]. Venus was also a patron of the ordinary, everyday wine drunk by most Roman men and women; the seductive powers of wine were well known. In the rites to [[Bona Dea]], a goddess of female chastity,&lt;ref&gt;"Bona Dea" means "The Good Goddess". She was also a "Women's goddess".&lt;/ref&gt; Venus, myrtle and anything male were not only excluded, but unmentionable. The rites allowed women to drink the strongest, sacrificial wine, otherwise reserved for the Roman gods and Roman men; the women euphemistically referred to it as "honey". Under these special circumstances, they could get virtuously, religiously drunk on strong wine, safe from Venus' temptations. Outside of this context, ordinary wine (that is, Venus' wine) tinctured with myrtle oil was thought particularly suitable for women.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, H. S., ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion, Vol. 2, Transition and reversal in myth and ritual,'' Brill, 1994, p. 262; see also Versnel, H.S., "The Festival for Bona Dea and the Thesmophoria", ''Greece &amp; Rome, Second Series'', 39, 1, (Apr., 1992), p. 44, citing Plutarch, ''Quaestiones Romanae'', 20.  For the total exclusion of myrtle (and therefore Venus) at Bona Dea's rites, see [[Bona Dea]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman generals given an [[ovation]], a lesser form of [[Roman triumph]], wore a myrtle crown, perhaps to purify themselves and their armies of blood-guilt. The ovation ceremony was assimilated to Venus Victrix ("Victorious Venus"), who was held to have granted and purified its relatively "easy" victory.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Roman triumph|Triumph]], the general was drawn in a four-horse chariot before his troops. He wore Jupiter's laurel crown, and was applauded as Jupiter's embodiment for the day – or a king, by any other name. See Mary Beard, The Roman Triumph, The Belknap Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, Henrik H. J., ''Bona Dea, The Sources and a Description of the Cult,'' Études préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l'Empire romain, 110, Brill, 1989: citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', Book 23, 152 – 158, and Book 15, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult history and temples==
The first known temple to Venus was [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|vowed]] to ''Venus Obsequens'' ("Indulgent Venus"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome", v. 1, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;) by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Q. Fabius Gurges]] in the heat of a battle against the [[Samnite Wars#Third Samnite War (298 to 290 BC)|Samnites]]. It was dedicated in 295 BC, at a site near the [[Aventine Hill]], and was supposedly funded by fines imposed on Roman women for sexual misdemeanours. Its rites and character were probably influenced by or based on Greek [[Aphrodite]]'s cults, which were already diffused in various forms throughout Italian [[Magna Graeca]]. Its dedication date connects ''Venus Obsequens'' to the ''[[Vinalia]] rustica'' festival.&lt;ref&gt;Eden, P.T., "Venus and the Cabbage" Hermes, 91, (1963) p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, R. ''La Religion romaine de Venus'', BEFAR, Paris, 1954, p.87, suggests that Venus began as an abstraction of personal qualities, later assuming Aphrodite's attributes.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:The Forum of Caesar (built near the Forum Romanum in Rome in 46 BC) and the Temple of Venus Genetrix, Imperial Forums, Rome (21101482544).jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]] in the [[Imperial forums|Forum of Caesar]], Rome.]]
In 217 BC, in the early stages of the [[Second Punic War]] with [[Carthage]], Rome suffered a disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Lake Trasimene]]. The [[Sibylline books|Sibylline oracle]] suggested that if the Venus of [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]] ({{lang|la|Venus Erycina}}, a [[interpretatio graeca|Roman understanding]] of the [[Canaanite religion|Punic goddess]] [[Astarte]]), patron goddess of Carthage's Sicilian allies, could be persuaded to change her allegiance, Carthage might be defeated. Rome laid siege to [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], offered its goddess a magnificent temple as reward for her defection, [[Evocatio|captured]] her image, and brought it to Rome. It was installed in a temple on the [[Capitoline Hill]], as one of Rome's twelve ''{{lang|la|[[dii consentes]]}}''. Shorn of her more overtly Carthaginian characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;Her Sicillian form probably combined elements of Aphrodite and a more warlike Carthaginian-Phoenician [[Astarte]]&lt;/ref&gt; this "foreign Venus" became Rome's ''Venus Genetrix'' ("Venus the Mother"),&lt;ref name="autogenerated80"&gt;Beard ''et al'', Vol 1., pp. 80, 83: see also Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita'' 23.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, Eric (2007), in Rüpke, J, ed. ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Blackwell publishing, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; As far as the Romans were concerned, this was the homecoming of an ancestral goddess to her people. Roman tradition made Venus the mother and protector of the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]], ancestor of the Roman people. Soon after, Rome's defeat of Carthage confirmed Venus's goodwill to Rome, her links to its mythical Trojan past, and her support of its political and military hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Venus' links with Troy can be traced to the epic, mythic history of the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Judgement of Paris]], in which the Trojan prince [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose Aphrodite over [[Hera]] and [[Athena]], setting off a train of events that led to war between the Greeks and Trojans, and eventually to Troy's destruction. In [[Founding of Rome|Rome's foundation myth]], Venus was the divine mother of the Trojan prince Aeneas, and thus a divine ancestor of the Roman people as a whole. Mary Beard, ''The Roman Triumph'', The Belknap Press, 2007, p. 23. The Punic Wars saw many similar introductions of foreign cult, including the Phrygian cult to [[Magna Mater]], who also had mythical links to Troy. See also Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capitoline cult to Venus seems to have been reserved to higher status Romans. A separate cult to ''Venus Erycina'' as a fertility deity,&lt;ref name="autogenerated72"/&gt; was established in 181 BC, in a traditionally plebeian district just outside [[pomerium|Rome's sacred boundary]], near the [[Colline Gate]]. The temple, cult and goddess probably retained much of the original's character and rites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated72"&gt;Lipka, Michael, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach, Brill, 2009, pp. 72–73: Lipka gives a foundation date of 181 BC for Venus' Colline temple.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Orlin, Eric M., "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), pp. 4, 8, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a shrine to Venus Verticordia ("Venus the changer of hearts"), established in 114 BC but with links to an ancient cult of Venus-Fortuna, was "bound to the peculiar milieu of the Aventine and the Circus Maximus" – a strongly plebeian context for Venus's cult, in contrast to her aristocratic cultivation as a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Epicurian]] "all-goddess".&lt;ref&gt;Mario Torelli, ''Typology and Structure of Roman Historical Reliefs'', University of Michigan Press, 1992, pp. 8 – 9: the aristocratic ideology of an increasingly Hellenised Venus is "summarized by the famous invocation to ''Venus Physica'' in [[Lucretius]]' poem."&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the [[Roman Republic]], some leading Romans laid personal claims to Venus' favour. The general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Sulla]] adopted ''Felix'' ("Lucky") as a surname, acknowledging his debt to heaven-sent good fortune and his particular debt to ''Venus Felix'', for his extraordinarily fortunate political and military career.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's original Greek translates this adopted surname, Felix, as Epaphroditus (Aphrodite's beloved); see Plutarch, Sulla 19.9.&lt;/ref&gt; His protégé [[Pompey]] competed for Venus' support, dedicating (in 55 BC) a large temple to ''Venus Victrix'' as part of his lavishly appointed new [[Theatre of Pompey|theatre]], and celebrating his triumph of 54 BC with coins that showed her crowned with triumphal laurels.&lt;ref name="Beard, 2007, pp. 22 - 23"&gt;Beard, 2007, pp. 22 – 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pompey's erstwhile friend, ally, and later opponent [[Julius Caesar]] went still further. He claimed the favours of ''Venus Victrix'' in his military success and ''Venus Genetrix'' as a personal, divine ancestress – apparently a long-standing family tradition among the [[Julia (gens)|Julii]]. When Caesar was assassinated, his heir, [[Augustus]], adopted both claims as evidence of his inherent fitness for office, and divine approval of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), pp. 67 – 69: "At the battle of Pharsalus, Caesar also vowed a temple, in best republican fashion, to Venus Victrix, almost as if he were summoning Pompey’s protectress to his side in the manner of an ''[[evocatio]]''. Three years after Pompey's defeat at the battle of Actium, Caesar dedicated his new Roman Forum, complete with a temple to his ancestor ''Venus Genetrix'', "apparently in fulfillment of the vow". The goddess helped provide a divine aura for her descendant, preparing the way for Caesar's own cult as a [[divus]] and the formal institution of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]].&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' new temple to [[Mars Ultor]], divine father of Rome's legendary founder [[Romulus]], would have underlined the point, with the image of avenging Mars "almost certainly" accompanied by that of his divine consort Venus, and possibly a statue of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Caesar's heir|deceased and deified Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol 1, pp. 199 – 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitruvius]] recommends that any new temple to Venus be sited according to rules laid down by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Haruspex|haruspices]], and built "near to the gate" of the city, where it would be less likely to contaminate "the matrons and youth with the influence of lust". He finds the Corinthian style, slender, elegant, enriched with ornamental leaves and surmounted by [[volute]]s, appropriate to Venus' character and disposition.&lt;ref&gt;Immediately after these remarks, Vitruvius prescribes the best positioning for temples to Venus' two divine consorts, Vulcan and Mars. Vulcan's should be outside the city, to reduce the dangers of fire, which is his element; Mars' too should be outside the city, so that "no armed frays may disturb the peace of the citizens, and that this divinity may, moreover, be ready to preserve them from their enemies and the perils of war." [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#7.1 Book 1, 7,1.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vitruvius recommends the widest possible spacing between the temple columns, producing a light and airy space, and he offers Venus's temple in Caesar's forum as an example of how not to do it; the densely spaced, thickset columns darken the interior, hide the temple doors and crowd the walkways, so that matrons who wish to honour the goddess must enter her temple in single file, rather than arm-in arm.&lt;ref&gt;The widely spaced, open style preferred by Vitruvius is ''eustylos''. The densely pillared style he criticises is ''pycnostylos''. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/3*.html#1.5 Book 3, 1, 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 135 AD the Emperor [[Hadrian]] inaugurated [[Temple of Venus and Roma|a temple]] to Venus and ''[[Roma (mythology)|Roma Aeterna]]'' (Eternal Rome) on Rome's [[Velian Hill]], underlining the Imperial unity of Rome and its provinces, and making Venus the protective ''genetrix'' of the entire Roman state, its people and fortunes. It was the largest temple in Ancient Rome.&lt;ref name="uchicago257"&gt;See James Grout, ''Encyclopedia Romana'', "Temple of Venus and Rome," [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanurbs/venusrome.html online].

===Festivals===
{{See also|Roman festivals}}
[[File:Dea Barberini Massimo.jpg|thumb|Fresco with a seated Venus, restored as a personification of Rome in the so-called ”Dea Barberini” (“Barberini goddess”); Roman artwork, dated first half of the 4th century AD, from a room near the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Laterano]]
Venus was offered [[Religion in ancient Rome#Religio and the state|official (state-sponsored) cult]] in certain [[Roman festivals|festivals of the Roman calendar]]. Her sacred month was April (Latin ''Mensis Aprilis'') which Roman etymologists understood to derive from ''aperire'', "to open," with reference to the springtime blossoming of trees and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;The origin is unknown, but it might derive from ''Apru'', an Etruscan form of Greek Aphrodite's name.[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=April]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Big OED or Etymological Dict., anyone? --&gt;

'''[[Veneralia]]''' (April 1) was held in honour of ''Venus Verticordia'' ("Venus the Changer of Hearts"), and [[Fortuna|Fortuna Virilis]] (Virile or strong Good Fortune), whose cult was probably by far the older of the two. Venus Verticordia was invented in 220 BC, in response to advice from a Sibylline oracle during Rome's [[Punic Wars]],&lt;ref&gt;Either the [[Sibylline Books]] (Valerius Maximus, 8. 15. 12) or the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] (Ovid, ''Fasti'', 4. 155 – 62).&lt;/ref&gt; when a series of [[Prodigium|prodigies]] was taken to signify divine displeasure at sexual offenses among Romans of every category and class, including several men and three [[Vestal Virgins]].&lt;ref&gt;See Staples, Ariadne, ''From Good Goddess to vestal virgins: sex and category in Roman religion'', Routledge, 1998, pp. 105 – 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Her statue was dedicated by a young woman, chosen as the most ''[[Pudicitia|pudica]]'' (sexually pure) in Rome by a committee of Roman matrons. At first, this statue was probably housed in the temple of ''[[Fortuna|Fortuna Virilis]]'', perhaps as divine reinforcement against the perceived moral and religious failings of its cult. In 114 BC ''Venus Verticordia'' was given her own temple.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jesse Benedict, "The Cognomina of the Goddess 'Fortuna,'" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 31, 1900, p. 66. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/282639]&lt;/ref&gt; She was meant to persuade Romans of both sexes and every class, whether married or unmarried, to cherish the traditional sexual proprieties and [[Mos maiorum|morality]] known to please the gods and benefit the State. During her rites, her image was taken from her temple to the men's baths, where it was undressed and washed in warm water by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. Women and men asked Venus Verticordia's help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. For [[Ovid]], Venus's acceptance of the epithet and its attendant responsibilities represented a change of heart in the goddess herself.&lt;ref&gt;Langlands, p. 59, citing Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', 4. 155 – 62. Romans considered personal ethics or mentality to be functions of the heart.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vinalia#Vinalia Urbana|Vinalia urbana]]''' (April 23), a wine festival shared by Venus and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], king of the gods. Venus was patron of "[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#profanum|profane]]" wine, for everyday human use. Jupiter was patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine, and controlled the weather on which the autumn grape-harvest would depend. At this festival, men and women alike drank the new vintage of ordinary, non-sacral wine in honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with this gift. Upper-class women gathered at Venus's Capitoline temple, where a libation of the previous year's vintage, sacred to Jupiter, was poured into a nearby ditch.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier de Cazanove, "Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin", Revue de l'histoire des religions, 1988, Vol. 205, Issue 205-3, pp. 245–265 [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhr_0035-1423_1988_num_205_3_1888 persee]&lt;/ref&gt; Common girls (''vulgares puellae'') and prostitutes gathered at Venus' temple just outside the Colline gate, where they offered her myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches and asked her for "beauty and popular favour", and to be made "charming and witty".&lt;ref&gt;Staples, p. 122, citing Ovid, ''Fasti'', 4,863 – 872.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vinalia Rustica]]''' (August 19), originally a rustic [[Latium|Latin]] festival of wine, vegetable growth and fertility. This was almost certainly Venus' oldest festival and was associated with her earliest known form, ''Venus Obsequens''. Kitchen gardens and market-gardens, and presumably vineyards were dedicated to her.&lt;ref&gt;Vegetable-growers may have been involved in the dedications as a corporate guild: see Eden, P.T., "Venus and the Cabbage" ''Hermes'', 91, (1963) p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman opinions differed on whose festival it was. Varro insists that the day was sacred to Jupiter, whose control of the weather governed the ripening of the grapes; but the sacrificial victim, a female lamb (''agna''), may be evidence that it once belonged to Venus alone.&lt;ref&gt;For associations of kind between Roman deities and their sacrificial victims, see [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|Victima]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, Michael, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'', Brill, 2009, p. 42; citing Varro, ''Lingua Latina'', 6. 16; Varro's explicit denial that the festival belongs to Venus implies his awareness of opposite scholarly and commonplace opinion. Lipka offers this apparent contradiction as an example of two Roman cults that offer "complementary functional foci".&lt;/ref&gt;

A festival of '''Venus Genetrix''' (September 26) was held under state auspices from 46 BC at [[Temple of Venus Genetrix|her Temple]] in the [[Forum of Caesar]], in fulfillment of a vow by [[Julius Caesar]], who claimed her personal favour as his divine patron, and ancestral goddess of the [[Julia (gens)|Julian clan]]. Caesar dedicated the temple during his unprecedented and extraordinarily lavish quadruple triumph. At the same time, he was [[pontifex maximus]] and Rome's senior magistrate; the festival is thought to mark the unprecedented promotion of a personal, family cult to one of the Roman state. Caesar's heir, Augustus, made much of these personal and family associations with Venus as an Imperial deity.&lt;ref&gt;Sulla may have set some form of precedent, but there is no evidence that he built her a Temple. Caesar's associations with Venus as both a personal and state goddess may also have been propagated in the Roman provinces.  See James Rives, "Venus Genetrix outside Rome", ''Phoenix'', Vol. 48, No. 4 (Winter, 1994), pp. 294–306.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival's rites are not known.

==Epithets==
[[File:Roman - Venus - Walters 54966.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Imperial image of Venus suggesting influence from [[Roman Syria|Syria]] or [[Roman Palestine|Palestine]], or from the [[Isis#Ancient Rome|cult of Isis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roman_-_Venus_-_Walters_54966.jpg Description] from [[Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Like other major Roman deities, Venus was given a number of [[epithet]]s that referred to her different cult aspects, roles, and her functional similarities to other deities. Her "original powers seem to have been extended largely by the fondness of the Romans for folk-etymology, and by the prevalence of the religious idea ''nomen-omen'' which sanctioned any identifications made in this way."&lt;ref&gt;See Eden, p. 457. For further exposition of ''nomen-omen'' (or ''nomen est omen'') see Del Bello, Davide, ''Forgotten paths: etymology and the allegorical mindset'', The Catholic University of America Press, 2007, p.52 ff. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AQh7PdkctiYC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=omen&amp;cd=3&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Venus&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Acidalia''', in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (1.715–722, as ''mater acidalia''). [[Servius]] speculates this as reference to a "Fountain of Acidalia" (''fons acidalia'') where the [[Graces]] (Venus' daughters) were said to bathe; but he also connects it to the Greek word for "arrow", whence "love's arrows" and love's "cares and pangs". [[Ovid]] uses ''acidalia'' only in the latter sense. It is likely a literary conceit, not a cultic epithet.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, J ames J., "The Significance of Vergil's Acidalia Mater, and Venus Erycina in Catullus and Ovid", ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', Vol. 93, 1990, pp. 335–342&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus [[List of Roman deities#Caelestis|Caelestis]]''' (Celestial or Heavenly Venus), used from the 2nd century AD for Venus as an aspect of a syncretised supreme goddess. ''Venus Caelestis'' is the earliest known Roman recipient of a [[taurobolium]] (a form of bull sacrifice), performed at her shrine in [[Pozzuoli]] on 5 October 134. This form of the goddess, and the taurobolium, are associated with the "Syrian Goddess", understood as a late equivalent to [[Astarte]], or the Roman [[Cybele|Magna Mater]], the latter being another supposedly Trojan "Mother of the Romans"&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, p. 141 – 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Calva''' ("Venus the bald one"), a legendary form of Venus, attested only by post-Classical Roman writings which offer several traditions to explain this appearance and epithet. In one, it commemorates the virtuous offer by Roman matrons of their own hair to make bowstrings during a siege of Rome. In another, king [[Ancus Marcius]]' wife and other Roman women lost their hair during an epidemic; in hope of its restoration, unafflicted women sacrificed their own hair to Venus.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling ''La religion romaine de Venus depuis les origines jusqu'au temps d'August'' Paris, 1954, pp. 83–89: "L'origine probable du cult de Venus". Ashby (1929) finds the existence of a temple to Venus Calva "very doubtful"; see Samuel Ball Platner (completed and revised by Thomas Ashby),'' A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', London, Oxford University Press, 1929, p551.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Venus_Calva.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Cloacina''' ("Venus the Purifier"); a fusion of Venus with the Etruscan water goddess [[Cloacina]], who had an ancient shrine above the outfall of the [[Cloaca Maxima]], originally a stream, later covered over to function as Rome's main sewer. The shrine contained a statue of Venus, whose rites were probably meant to purify the culvert's polluted waters and [[Miasma theory|noxious airs]].&lt;ref&gt;Eden, p. 457, citing Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', Book 15, 119 – 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny the Elder, remarking Venus as a goddess of union and reconciliation, identifies the shrine with a legendary episode in Rome's earliest history, when the warring Romans and [[Sabine]]s, carrying branches of myrtle, met there to make peace.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 15, 119, cited in Wagenvoort, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Erycina''' ("[[Eryx (Sicily)|Erycine]] Venus"), a [[Canaanite religion|Punic idol]] of [[Astarte]] [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|captured]] from [[Sicily]] and worshiped [[interpretatio graeca|in Romanised form]] by the elite and respectable matrons at a temple on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. A later temple, outside the [[Porta Collina]] and Rome's [[pomerium|sacred boundary]], may have preserved some Erycine features of her cult. It was considered suitable for "common girls" and [[prostitute]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol 1., pp. 80, 83: see also Livy Ab Urbe Condita 23.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law in Ancient Rome,'' Oxford University Press, 1998, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Frutis''' honoured by all the Latins with a federal cult at the temple named ''Frutinal'' in Lavinium.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus-Festus s. v. p. 80 L: ''Frutinal templum Veneris Fruti''. Strabo V 3, 5: "At the midway between Ostia and Antium lies Lavinium that has a sanctuary of Aphrodite common to all Latin nations, but which is under the care of the Ardeans, who have entrusted the task to intendents".&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions found at Lavinium attest the presence of federal cults, without giving precise details.&lt;ref&gt;CIL X 797: "''Sp. Turrianus Proculus Gellianus... pater patratus...Lavinium sacrorum principiorum p(opuli) R(omani) Quirt(ium) nominisque Latini qui apud Laurentis coluntur''". Cited in B. Liou-Gilles "Naissance de la ligue latine. Mythe et culte de fondation" in ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'' '''74''' 1996 1 p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Felix''' ("Lucky Venus"), probably a traditional epithet, later adopted by the dictator Sulla. It was Venus's cult title at [[Hadrian]]'s temple to ''[[Temple of Venus and Roma|Venus Felix et Roma Aeterna]]'' on the [[Via Sacra]]. This epithet is also used for [[Venus Felix (sculpture)|a specific sculpture at the Vatican Museums]].

'''[[Venus Genetrix (sculpture)|Venus Genetrix]]''' ("Venus the Mother"), as a goddess of motherhood and domesticity, with a festival on September 26, a personal ancestress of the [[Julia (gens)|Julian lineage]] and, more broadly, the divine ancestress of the Roman people. [[Julius Caesar]] dedicated a [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]] in 46 BC. This name has attached to [[Venus Genetrix (sculpture)|an iconological type of statue of Aphrodite/Venus]].

{{anchor|Venus Heliopolitana}}&lt;!--linked--&gt;
'''Venus Heliopolitana''' ("Venus of [[Heliopolis Syriaca]]"), worshipped at [[Baalbek]]. A form of [[Ashtart]] who formed a third of the [[Heliopolitan Triad]], in which she was the consort of [[Jupiter Heliopolitanus|Jupiter]] ([[Baʿal]]) and mother of [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]] ([[Tammuz (god)|Adon]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

'''[[Venus Kallipygos]]''' ("Venus with the beautiful buttocks"), worshiped at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].

'''Venus Libertina''' ("Venus the [[freedman|Freedwoman]]"), probably arising through the semantic similarity and cultural inks between ''libertina'' (as "a free woman") and ''lubentina'' (possibly meaning "pleasurable" or "passionate"). Further titles or variants acquired by Venus through the same process, or through orthographic variance, include Libentia, Lubentina, and Lubentini. '''Venus Libitina''' links Venus to a patron-goddess of funerals and undertakers, [[Libitina]]; a temple was dedicated to Venus Libitina in Libitina's grove on the [[Esquiline Hill]], "hardly later than 300 BC."&lt;ref&gt;See Eden, p. 457. Varro rationalises the connections as ''"lubendo libido, libidinosus ac Venus Libentina et Libitina"'' (''Lingua Latina'', 6, 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Murcia''' ("Venus of the Myrtle"), merging Venus with the little-known deity [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]] (or Murcus, or Murtia). Murcia was associated with Rome's Mons Murcia (the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine's lesser height]]), and had a shrine in the [[Circus Maximus]]. Some sources associate her with the myrtle-tree. Christian writers described her as a goddess of sloth and laziness.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De civitate Dei'', IV. 16; Arnobius, ''Adversus Nationes'', IV. 9. 16; ''Murcus'' in Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', 1, 33, 5 – cf ''murcidus'' = "slothful".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Obsequens''' ("Indulgent Venus"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;), Venus' first attested Roman epithet. It was used in the dedication of her first Roman temple, on August 19 in 295 BC during the [[Third Samnite War]] by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]]. It was sited somewhere near the Aventine Hill and Circus Maximus, and played a central role in the [[Vinalia Rustica]]. It was supposedly funded by fines imposed on women found guilty of [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;Staples, Ariadne, ''From Good Goddess to vestal virgins: sex and category in Roman religion'', Routledge, 1998, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Physica''': Venus as a universal, natural creative force that informs the physical world. She is addressed as "Alma Venus" ("Mother Venus") by [[Lucretius]] in the introductory lines of his vivid, poetic exposition of [[Epicurean]] physics and philosophy, ''De Rerum Natura''. She seems to have been a favourite of Lucretius' patron, [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Memmius]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Asmis, "Lucretius' Venus and Stoic Zeus", ''Hermes'', 110, (1982), p. 458 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Pompeii's protective goddess was ''Venus Physica Pompeiana'', who had a distinctive, local form as a goddess of the sea, and trade. When [[Sulla]] captured Pompeii from the [[Samnites]], he resettled it with his veterans and renamed it for his own family and divine protector Venus, as ''[[Colonia (Roman)|Colonia]] Veneria [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]]'' (for Sulla's claims of Venus' favour, see ''Venus Felix'' above).&lt;ref&gt;A. Lill, "Myths of Pompeii: reality and legacy", ''Baltic Journal of Art History'', 2011, p. 141, [http://ojs.utlib.ee/index.php/bjah/article/viewFile/814/792 online] (accessed 19 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venus Urania''' ("Heavenly Venus"), used as the title of a book by [[Basilius von Ramdohr]], a relief by [[Pompeo Marchesi]], and a painting by [[Christian Griepenkerl]]. (cf. [[Aphrodite Urania]].)

'''[[Venus Verticordia]]''' ("Venus the Changer of Hearts"). See [[Venus (mythology)#Festivals|Veneralia in this article]] and [[Veneralia|main article, Veneralia]].

'''Venus Victrix''' ("Venus the Victorious"), a Romanised aspect of the armed Aphrodite that Greeks had inherited from the East, where the goddess [[Ishtar]] "remained a goddess of war, and Venus could bring victory to a [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] or a Caesar."&lt;ref&gt;Thus [[Walter Burkert]], in ''Homo Necans'' (1972) 1983:80, noting C. Koch on "Venus Victrix" in ''Realencyclopädie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft'', '''8''' A860-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey, Sulla's protégé, vied with his patron and with Caesar for public recognition as her protégé. In 55 BC he dedicated a temple to her at the top of his [[Pompey's Theater|theater]] in the [[Campus Martius]]. She had a shrine on the [[Capitoline Hill]], and festivals on August 12 and October 9. A sacrifice was annually dedicated to her on the latter date. In neo-classical art, her epithet as Victrix is often used in the sense of 'Venus Victorious over men's hearts' or in the context of the [[Judgement of Paris]] (e.g. [[Canova]]'s ''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]'', a half-nude reclining portrait of [[Pauline Bonaparte]]).

{{details|Aphrodite}}
[[File:Ares e Afrodite.JPG|thumb|right|Venus and Mars, with Cupid attending, in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]]]]
As with most major gods and goddesses in [[Roman mythology]], the literary concept of Venus is mantled in whole-cloth borrowings from the literary [[Greek mythology]] of her counterpart, Aphrodite. In some Latin mythology, [[Cupid]] was the son of Venus and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war. At other times, or in parallel myths and theologies, Venus was understood to be the consort of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. [[Virgil]], in compliment to his patron [[Augustus]] and the ''[[Julius|gens Julia]]'', embellished an existing connection between Venus, whom [[Julius Caesar]] had adopted as his protectress, and [[Aeneas]]. Vergil's Aeneas is guided to [[Latium]] by Venus in her heavenly form, the morning star, shining brightly before him in the daylight sky; much later, she lifts Caesar's soul to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Venus as a guide and protector of Aeneas and his descendants is frequent motif in the Aeneid. See discussion throughout M. F.

Roman and Hellenistic art produced many variations on the goddess, often based on the [[Praxiteles|Praxitlean]] type [[Aphrodite of Cnidus]]. Many female nudes from this period of sculpture whose subjects are unknown are in modern art history conventionally called 'Venus'es, even if they originally may have portrayed a mortal woman rather than operated as a [[cult statue]] of the goddess.

Examples include:
* [[Venus de Milo]] (130 BC)

===Art in the classical tradition===
Venus became a popular subject of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] during the [[Renaissance]] period in Europe. As a "[[classical tradition|classical]]" figure for whom [[nudity]] was her natural state, it was socially acceptable to depict her unclothed. As the goddess of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], a degree of erotic beauty in her presentation was justified, which appealed to many artists and their patrons. Over time, ''venus'' came to refer to any artistic depiction in post-classical art of a nude woman, even when there was no indication that the subject was the goddess.

In the field of [[prehistoric art]], since the discovery in 1908 of the so-called "[[Venus of Willendorf]]" small [[Neolithic]] sculptures of rounded female forms have been conventionally referred to as [[Venus figurines]]. Although the name of the actual deity is not known, the knowing contrast between the obese and fertile [[cult figure]]s and the classical conception of Venus has raised resistance to the terminology.

==Medieval and modern music==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s opera [[Tannhäuser (opera)|''Tannhäuser'']], which draws on the [[medieval]] [[Germany|German]] legend of the knight and poet [[Tannhäuser]], Venus lives beneath the [[Venusberg (mythology)|Venusberg]] mountain. Tannhäuser breaks his knightly vows by spending a year there with Venus, under her enchantment. When he emerges, he has to seek penance for his sins.

The Dutch band Shocking Blue had a number one hit on the Billboard Top Ten in 1970 with the song titled "[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]", which was also a hit when covered by [[Bananarama]] in 1986. The song "Venus" by the band [[Television (band)|Television]] from the 1978 album ''[[Marquee Moon]]'' references the Venus de Milo. There is also a song named "[[Venus (Lady Gaga song)|Venus]]" written, produced and sung by [[Lady Gaga]], as well as a song named "Birth of Venus Illegitima" by the Swedish [[symphonic metal]] [[Therion (band)|Therion]], on the album [[Vovin (album)|''Vovin'']], and the song "[[Venus as a Boy]]" by the Icelandic artist [[Björk]]. Another reference to Venus is from Billy Idol's album "[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]" , in track # 16 titled "Venus".

'''Wife selling''' in England was a way of ending an unsatisfactory marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when [[divorce]] was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a [[halter]] around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly [[auction]] her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'', in which the central character sells his wife at the beginning of the story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.

Although the custom had no basis in law and frequently resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, the attitude of the authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local [[English Poor Law|Poor Law Commissioners]] forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in [[workhouse]]s.

Wife selling persisted in England in some form until the early 20th century; according to the [[jurist]] and historian [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], writing in 1901, wife sales were still occasionally taking place during his time. In one of the last reported instances of a wife sale in England, a woman giving evidence in a [[County Borough of Leeds|Leeds]] police court in 1913 claimed that she had been sold to one of her husband's workmates for £1.

==Legal background==
Wife selling in its "ritual form" appears to be an "invented custom" that originated at about the end of the 17th century,{{sfnp|Griffiths|1995|p = 163|ps = }} although there is an account from 1302 of someone who "granted his wife by deed to another man".{{sfnp|Bryce|1901|p=820|ps=none}} With the rise in popularity of newspapers, reports of the practice become more frequent in the second half of the 18th century.{{sfnp|Mansell|Meteyard|2004|p=88|ps=none}} In the words of 20th-century writer Courtney Kenny, the ritual was "a custom rooted sufficiently deeply to show that it was of no recent origin".&lt;ref name="CourtneyKenny"&gt;{{citation | last = Kenny | first = Courtney | title = Wife-Selling in England | journal = Law Quarterly Review | year = 1929 | pages = 494–497 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/lqr45&amp;div=34&amp;id=&amp;page= }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1901 on the subject of wife selling, James Bryce stated that there was "no trace at all in our [English] law of any such right",{{sfnp|Bryce|1901|pp=819–820|ps=none}} but he also observed that "everybody has heard of the odd habit of selling a wife, which still occasionally recurs among the humbler classes in England".{{sfnp|Bryce|1901|p=819|ps=none}}

===Marriage===
Until the passing of the [[Marriage Act 1753|Marriage Act of 1753]], a formal ceremony of marriage before a clergyman was not a legal requirement in England, and marriages were unregistered. All that was required was for both parties to agree to the union, so long as each had reached the legal age of consent,{{sfnp|Bryce|1901|pp=816–817|ps=none}} which was 12&amp;nbsp;for girls and 14&amp;nbsp;for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Leneman |first=Leah |year=1999 |title=The Scottish Case That Led to Hardwicke's Marriage Act |journal=Law and History Review |volume=17 |issue=1 |page=161 |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/leneman.html |access-date=16 December 2009 |doi=10.2307/744190 |jstor=744190 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525024450/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/leneman.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were completely subordinated to their husbands after marriage, the husband and wife becoming one legal entity, a legal status known as [[coverture]]. As the eminent English judge [[William Blackstone|Sir&amp;nbsp;William&amp;nbsp;Blackstone]] wrote in 1753: "the very being, or legal existence of the woman, is suspended during the marriage, or at least is consolidated and incorporated into that of her husband: under whose wing, protection and cover, she performs everything". Married women could not own property in their own right, and were indeed themselves the property of their husbands.{{sfnp|Caine|Sluga|2002|pp=12–13|ps=none}} But Blackstone went on to observe that "even the disabilities the wife lies under are, for the most part, intended for her protection and benefit. So great a favourite is the female sex of the laws of England".{{sfnp|Bryce|1901|p=820|ps=none}}

===Separation===
Five distinct methods of breaking up a marriage existed in the [[early modern period]] of English history. One was to sue in the [[ecclesiastical courts]] for separation from bed and board (''[[legal separation|a mensa et thoro]]''), on the grounds of adultery or life-threatening cruelty, but it did not allow a remarriage.{{sfnp|Stone|1990|p=141|ps=none}}&lt;!-- this could probably use some expansion considering the size of the parliament divorce --&gt; From the 1550s, until the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act]] became law in 1857, divorce in England was only possible, if at all, by the complex and costly procedure of a private Act of Parliament.{{sfnp|Sokol|Sokol|2003|p=144|ps=none}}  Although the divorce courts set up in the wake of the 1857 Act made the procedure considerably cheaper, divorce remained prohibitively expensive for the poorer members of society.{{sfnp|Finlay|2005|p=15|ps=none}}{{efn|In his 1844 judgement against a bigamist, at Warwick Assizes, [[William Henry Maule]] described the process in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=FitzGerald |first=J. D. |contribution=Maule, Sir William Henry (1788–1858) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18369 |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I will tell you what you ought to have done;&amp;nbsp;... You ought to have instructed your attorney to bring an action against the seducer of your wife for criminal conversation. That would have cost you about a hundred pounds. When you had obtained judgment for (though not necessarily actually recovered) substantial damages against him, you should have instructed your proctor to sue in the Ecclesiastical courts for a divorce ''a mensa et thoro''. That would have cost you two hundred or three hundred pounds more. When you had obtained a divorce ''a mensa et thoro'', you should have appeared by counsel before the House of Lords in order to obtain a private Act of Parliament for a divorce ''a vinculo matrimonii'' which would have rendered you free and legally competent to marry the person whom you have taken on yourself to marry with no such sanction. The Bill might possibly have been opposed in all its stages in both Houses of Parliament, and together you would have had to spend about a thousand or twelve hundred pounds. You will probably tell me that you have never had a thousand farthings of your own in the world; but, prisoner, that makes no difference. Sitting here as an English Judge, it is my duty to tell you that this is not a country in which there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. You will be imprisoned for one day. Since you have been in custody since the commencement of the Assizes you are free to leave."&lt;ref name="greenbag"&gt;{{citation |last=Wright |first=John deP. |title=Wife Sale |url=http://www.greenbag.org/archive/green_bag_tables_of_contents.html |year=2004 |publisher=Green Bag Archives |work=greenbag.org |access-date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affirmation later contributed to the passing of the 1857 Act.}}  An alternative was to obtain a "private separation", an agreement negotiated between both spouses, embodied in a [[deed]] of separation drawn up by a [[conveyancer]]. Desertion or elopement was also possible, whereby the wife was forced out of the family home, or the husband simply set up a new home with his mistress.{{sfnp|Stone|1990|p=141|ps=none}} Finally, the less popular notion of wife selling was an alternative but illegitimate method of ending a marriage.{{sfnp|Hill|1994|p=215|ps=none}} ''The Laws Respecting Women, As They Regard Their Natural Rights'' (1777) observed that, for the poor, wife selling was viewed as a "method of dissolving marriage", when "a husband and wife find themselves heartily tired of each other, and agree to part, if the man has a mind to authenticate the intended separation by making it a matter of public notoriety".&lt;ref name="greenbag" /&gt;

Although some 19th-century wives objected, records of 18th-century women resisting their sales are non-existent. With no financial resources, and no skills on which to trade, for many women a sale was the only way out of an unhappy marriage.{{sfnp|Hill|1994|pp=217–218|ps=none}} Indeed, the wife is sometimes reported as having insisted on the sale. A wife sold in [[Much Wenlock|Wenlock]] Market for [[£sd|2s. 6d.]] in 1830 was quite determined that the transaction should go ahead, despite her husband's last-minute misgivings: {{"'}}e [the husband] turned shy, and tried to get out of the business, but Mattie mad' un stick to it. 'Er flipt her apern in 'er gude man's face, and said, 'Let be yer rogue. I wull be sold. I wants a change'."{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=462|ps=none}}

For the husband, the sale released him from his marital duties, including any financial responsibility for his wife.{{sfnp|Hill|1994|pp=217–218|ps=none}} For the purchaser, who was often the wife's lover, the transaction freed him from the threat of a legal action for [[criminal conversation]], a claim by the husband for restitution of damage to his property, in this case his wife.{{sfnp|Pateman|1988|p=122|ps=none}}

It is unclear when the ritualised custom of selling a wife by public auction first began, but it seems likely to have been some time towards the end of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century. In November&amp;nbsp;1692 "John, ye son of Nathan Whitehouse, of Tipton, sold his wife to Mr. Bracegirdle", although the manner of the sale is unrecorded. In 1696, Thomas Heath Maultster was fined for "cohabiteing in an unlawful manner with the wife of George ffuller of Chinner&amp;nbsp;... haueing bought her of her husband at 2d.q. the pound",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cawte |first=E. C. |title=Precise Records of Some Marriage Customs |volume=96 |year=1985 |page=254 |jstor=1259650 |issue=2 |journal=Folklore}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered by the [[Court of Peculiars|peculiar court]] at [[Thame]] to perform public penance, but between 1690 and 1750 only eight other cases are recorded in England.{{sfnp|Jacob|2002|p=76|ps=none}}  In an Oxford case of 1789 wife selling is described as "the vulgar form of ''Divorce'' lately adopted", suggesting that even if it was by then established in some parts of the country it was only slowly spreading to others.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=412|ps=none}} It persisted in some form until the early 20th century, although by then in "an advanced state of decomposition".{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|pp=408–409|ps=none}}

In most reports the sale was announced in advance, perhaps by advertisement in a local newspaper. It usually took the form of an auction, often at a local market, to which the wife would be led by a halter (usually of rope but sometimes of ribbon)&lt;ref name="CourtneyKenny" /&gt; around her neck, or arm.{{sfnp|Hill|1994|pp=215–216|ps=none}} Often the purchaser was arranged in advance, and the sale was a form of symbolic separation and remarriage, as in a case from [[Maidstone]], where in January 1815 John Osborne planned to sell his wife at the local market. However, as no market was held that day, the sale took place instead at "the sign of 'The Coal-barge,' in Earl Street", where "in a very regular manner", his wife and child were sold for £1 to a man named William Serjeant. In July the same year a wife was brought to Smithfield market by coach, and sold for 50&amp;nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] and a horse. Once the sale was complete, "the lady, with her new lord and master, mounted a handsome curricle which was in waiting for them, and drove off, seemingly nothing loath to go." At another sale in September&amp;nbsp;1815, at [[Staines]] market, "only ''three shillings and four pence'' were offered for the lot, no one choosing to contend with the bidder, for the fair object, whose merits could only be appreciated by those who knew them. This the purchaser could boast, from a long and intimate acquaintance."{{sfnp|Ashton|1899|pp=216–217|ps=none}}

Although the initiative was usually the husband's, the wife had to agree to the sale. An 1824 report from [[Manchester]] says that "after several biddings she [the wife] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and a quart of ale".{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=433|ps=none}} Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=428|ps=none}} In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers.{{sfnp|Hill|1994|pp=216–217|ps=none}} In March 1766, a carpenter from [[Southwark]] sold his wife "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, the man asked his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce.{{sfnp|Hill|1994|p=216|ps=none}} In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in [[Plymouth]].{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|pp=440–441|ps=none}}

Such "divorces" were not always permanent. In 1826 John Turton sold his wife Mary to William Kaye at [[Emley, West Yorkshire|Emley]] Cross for five  shillings. But after Kaye's death she returned to her husband, and the couple remained together for the next 30 years.{{sfnp|Pobjoy|1970|p=132|ps=none}}

===Mid-19th century===
It was believed during the mid-19th century that wife selling was restricted to the lowest levels of labourers, especially to those living in remote rural areas, but an analysis of the occupations of husbands and purchasers reveals that the custom was strongest in "proto-industrial" communities. Of the 158&amp;nbsp;cases in which occupation can be established, the largest group (19) was involved in the livestock or transport trades, fourteen worked in the building trade, five were blacksmiths, four were chimney-sweeps, and two were described as gentlemen, suggesting that wife selling was not simply a peasant custom. The most high-profile case was that of [[Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos]], who is reported to have bought his second wife from an [[hostler|ostler]] in about 1740.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|pp=413–414|ps=none}}

Prices paid for wives varied considerably, from a high of £100 plus £25 each for her two children in a sale of 1865 (equivalent to about £{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|150|1865|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} to a low of a glass of ale, or even free. The lowest amount of money exchanged was three [[Farthing (British coin)|farthings]] (three-quarters of one penny), but the usual price seems to have been between 2s.&amp;nbsp;6d. and 5&amp;nbsp;[[shilling]]s.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=415|ps=none}} According to authors Wade Mansell and Belinda Meteyard, money seems usually to have been a secondary consideration;{{sfnp|Mansell|Meteyard|2004|p=88|ps=none}} the more important factor was that the sale was seen by many as legally binding, despite it having no basis in law. Some of the new couples [[bigamy|bigamously]] married,{{sfnp|Hill|1994|p=216|ps=none}} but the attitude of officialdom towards wife selling was equivocal.{{sfnp|Mansell|Meteyard|2004|p=88|ps=none}} Rural clergy and magistrates knew of the custom, but seemed uncertain of its legitimacy, or chose to turn a blind eye. Entries have been found in baptismal registers, such as this example from Perleigh in [[Essex]], dated 1782: "Amie Daughter of Moses Stebbing by a bought wife delivered to him in a Halter".{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=451|ps=none}}  A jury in Lincolnshire ruled in 1784 that a man who had sold his wife had no right to reclaim her from her purchaser, thus endorsing the validity of the transaction.{{sfnp|Clark|1997|pp=86–87|ps=none}} In 1819 a magistrate who attempted to prevent a sale at Ashbourne, [[Derbyshire|Derby]], but was pelted and driven away by the crowd, later commented:

{{quote|Although the real object of my sending the constables was to prevent the scandalous sale, the apparent motive was that of keeping the peace&amp;nbsp;... As to the act of selling itself, I do not think I have a right to prevent it, or even oppose any obstacle to it, because it rests upon a custom preserved by the people of which perhaps it would be dangerous to deprive them by any law for that purpose.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=451|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Woodbury|1951|p=223|ps=none}}}}

In some cases, such as  that of Henry Cook in 1814, the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] authorities forced the husband to sell his wife rather than have to maintain her and her child in the [[Effingham, Surrey|Effingham]] [[workhouse]]. She was taken to [[Croydon]] market and sold for one shilling, the parish paying for the cost of the journey and a "wedding dinner".{{sfnp|Gibson|1993|p=51|ps=none}}

===Venue===
{{quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |align=right |width=33% |quote={{align|right|'Oct. 24, 1766}}&lt;br /&gt;It is this day agreed on between John Parsons, of the parish of Midsummer Norton, in the county of Somerset, clothworker, and John Tooker, of the same place, gentleman, that the said John Parsons, for and in consideration of the sum of six pounds and six shillings in hand paid to the said John Parsons, doth sell, assign, and set over unto the said John Tooker, Ann Parsons, wife of the said John Parsons; with all right, property, claim, services, and demands whatsoever, that he, the said John Parsons, shall have in or to the said Ann Parsons, for and during the term of the natural life of her, the said Ann Parsons.

By choosing a market as the location for the sale, the couple ensured a large audience, which made their separation a widely witnessed fact.{{sfnp|Stone|1990|pp=144–145|ps=none}} The use of the halter was symbolic; after the sale, it was handed to the purchaser as a signal that the transaction was concluded,{{sfnp|Mansell|Meteyard|2004|p=88|ps=none}} and in some instances, those involved would often attempt further to legitimate the sale by forcing the winning bidder to sign a contract, recognising that the seller had no further liability for his wife. In 1735, a successful wife sale in St Clements was announced by the common cryer,{{efn|A common cryer was a person whose responsibility it was to make public announcements on behalf of his employer.}} who wandered the streets ensuring that local traders were aware of the former&lt;!-- hmmm, quotes? --&gt; husband's intention not to honour "any debts she should contract". The same point was made in an advertisement placed in the ''Ipswich Journal'' in 1789: "no person or persons to intrust her with my name&amp;nbsp;... for she is no longer my right".{{sfnp|Hill|1994|p=218|ps=none}} Those involved in such sales sometimes attempted to legalise the transaction, as demonstrated by a bill of sale for a wife, preserved in the [[British Museum]].{{efn|MSS. 32,084}} The bill is contained in a petition presented to a [[Somerset]] Justice of the Peace in 1758, by a wife who about 18&amp;nbsp;months earlier had been sold by her husband for £6 6s "for the support of his extravagancy". The petition does not object to the sale, but complains that the husband returned three months later to demand more money from his wife and her new "husband".&lt;ref name="CourtneyKenny" /&gt;

In [[Sussex]], [[inns]] and [[public house]]s were a regular venue for wife-selling, and alcohol often formed part of the payment. For example, when a man sold his wife at the Shoulder of Mutton and Cucumber in [[Yapton]] in 1898, the purchaser paid [[£sd|7s. 6d.]] (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.375|1898|r=-1}}|0}} in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and {{convert|1|impqt|l}} of beer. A sale a century earlier in [[Brighton]] involved "eight pots of beer" and seven [[shilling]]s (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.35|1799|r=-1}}|0}} in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}});{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and in [[Ninfield]] in 1790, a man who swapped his wife at the village inn for half a pint of [[gin]] changed his mind and bought her back later.{{sfnp|Collins|2007|p=65|ps=none}}

Public wife sales{{efn|Private sales have not been counted. Thompson, 1991, pp. 409–410 and see pp. 411–412.}} were sometimes attended by huge crowds. An 1806 sale in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] was postponed "owing to the crowd which such an extraordinary occurrence had gathered together", suggesting that wife sales were relatively rare events, and therefore popular. Estimates of the frequency of the ritual usually number about&amp;nbsp;300 between 1780 and 1850, relatively insignificant compared to the instances of desertion, which in the Victorian era numbered in the tens of thousands.{{sfnp|Stone|1990|pp=147–148|ps=none}}

===Distribution and symbolism===
[[File:French depiction of englishman wife selling.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|A French depiction of Milord [[John Bull]], heading to [[Smithfield market#The market|Smithfield Market]] to sell his wife]]
Wife selling appears to have been widespread throughout England, but relatively rare in neighbouring Wales, where only a few cases were reported, and in Scotland where only one has been discovered. The English county with the highest number of cases between 1760 and 1880 was Yorkshire, with forty-four, considerably more than the nineteen reported for Middlesex and London during the same period, despite the French caricature of Milord [[John Bull]] "booted and spurred, in [London's] Smithfield Market, crying &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''à quinze livres ma femme!''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [£15 for my wife], while Milady stood haltered in a pen".{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=409|ps=none}}

In his account, ''Wives for Sale'', author Samuel Pyeatt Menefee collected 387&amp;nbsp;incidents of wife selling, the last of which occurred in the early 20th century.{{sfnp|Stone|1990|p=145|ps=none}} Historian [[E. P. Thompson]] considered many of Menefee's cases to be "vague and dubious", and that some double-counting had taken place, but he nevertheless agreed that about three hundred were authentic, which when combined with his own research resulted in about four hundred reported cases.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=408|ps=none}}

Menefee argued that the ritual mirrored that of a livestock sale—the symbolic meaning of the halter; wives were even occasionally valued by weight, just like livestock. Although the halter was considered central to the "legitimacy" of the sale, Thompson has suggested that Menefee may have misunderstood the social context of the transaction. Markets were favoured not because livestock was traded there, but because they offered a public venue where the separation of husband and wife could be witnessed. Sales often took place at fairs, in front of public houses, or local landmarks such as the obelisk at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] (1817), or [[Bolton]]'s "gas pillar"{{efn|The "gas pillar" was a large cast iron vase erected in the early 19th century, in Bolton's market square, atop which was a [[gas lamp]]. The whole structure was about {{convert|30|ft}} tall.}} (1835), where crowds could be expected to gather.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=418|ps=none}}

There were very few reported sales of husbands, and from a modern perspective, selling a wife like a chattel is degrading, even when considered as a form of divorce.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|pp=458–459|ps=none}} Nevertheless, most contemporary reports hint at the women's independence and sexual vitality: "The women are described as 'fine-looking', 'buxom', 'of good appearance', 'a comely-looking country girl', or as 'enjoying the fun and frolic heartily{{'"}}.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=461|ps=none}}

Along with other English customs, settlers arriving in the American colonies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries took with them the practice of wife selling, and the belief in its legitimacy as a way of ending a marriage.  In 1645 "The P'ticular Court"&lt;!-- source uses quotes for this, italics for Boston Evening Post --&gt; of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], reported the case of Baggett Egleston, who was fined 20&amp;nbsp;shillings for "bequething his wyfe to a young man".  The ''[[Boston Evening-Post]]'' reported on 15&amp;nbsp;March 1736 an argument between two men "and a certain woman, each one claiming her as his Wife, but so it was that one of them had actually disposed of his Right in her to the other for Fifteen Shillings".  The purchaser had, apparently, refused to pay in full, and had attempted to return "his" wife.  He was given the outstanding sum by two generous bystanders, and paid the husband—who promptly "gave the Woman a modest Salute wishing her well, and his Brother Sterling much Joy of his Bargain."{{sfnp|Woodbury|1951|pp=224–225|ps=none}}  An account in 1781 of a William Collings of South Carolina records that he sold his wife for "two dollars and half [a] dozen bowls of grogg".{{sfnp|Godbeer|2002|p=131|ps=none}}

Towards the end of the 18th century, some hostility towards wife selling began to manifest itself amongst the general population. One sale in 1756 in [[Dublin]] was interrupted by a group of women who "rescued" the wife, following which the husband was given a mock trial and placed in the [[stocks]] until early the next morning. In about 1777, a wife sale at [[Carmarthenshire]] produced in the crowd "a great silence", and "a feeling of uneasiness in the gathering".{{sfnp|Hill|1994|p=217|ps=none}} When a labourer offered his wife for sale on Smithfield market in 1806, "the public became incensed at the husband, and would have severely punished him for his brutality, but for the interference of some officers of the police."{{sfnp|Clark|1997|pp=86–87|ps=none}}

Reports of wife selling rose from two per decade in the 1750s, to a peak of fifty in the 1820s and 1830s. As the number of cases increased so did opposition to the practice. It became seen as one of a number of popular customs that the social elite believed it their duty to abolish, and women protested that it represented "a threat and insult to their sex".{{sfnp|Clark|1997|pp=86–87|ps=none}} JPs in Quarter Sessions became more active in punishing those involved in wife selling, and some test cases in the central law courts confirmed the illegality of the practice.{{sfnp|Stone|1990|p=146|ps=none}} Newspaper accounts were often disparaging: "a most disgusting and disgraceful scene" was the description in a report of 1832,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Buying and Selling Wives |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/250/374/88505816w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS102391385&amp;dyn=12!xrn_4_0_CS102391385&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |work=The Times |publisher=infotrac.galegroup.com |date=26 February 1832 |at = p. 6, col. E |issue=14784 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until the 1840s that the number of cases of wife selling began to decline significantly. Thompson discovered 121&amp;nbsp;published reports of wife sales between 1800 and 1840, as compared to 55 between 1840 and 1880.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=409|ps=none}}

[[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], considered wife sales to be a conspiracy to commit adultery, but few of those reported in the newspapers led to prosecutions in court.{{sfnp|Mansell|Meteyard|2004|p=88|ps=none}} ''[[The Times]]'' reported one such case in 1818, in which a man was indicted for selling his wife at [[Leominster]] market, for 2s. 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=News |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/250/374/88505816w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS50873182&amp;dyn=12!xrn_1_0_CS50873182&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |work=The Times |publisher=infotrac.galegroup.com |date=30 October 1818 |at=p. 3, col.

He had also printed copies of the song, and the story of a wife sale, to earn money.

The return of a wife after 18&amp;nbsp;years results in Michael Henchard's downfall in [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886).  A bad-tempered, impulsive and cruel husband, feeling burdened by his wife, Henchard sells her to a stranger for five guineas.  He becomes a successful businessman and rises to the position of mayor, but the return of his wife many years later prompts his fall back into penury.{{sfnp|Gibson|1996|pp=95–97 |ps=none}}  The custom was also referred to in the 19th-century French play, ''Le Marché de Londres''.{{sfnp|Reach|1846|p=337|ps=none}} Commenting on the drama and contemporary French attitudes on the custom, in 1846 the writer Angus B. Reach complained: "They reckon up a long and visionary list of our failings [... They] would as readily give up their belief in the geographical and physical existence of London, as in the astounding fact that in England a husband sells his wife exactly as he sells his horse or his dog."{{sfnp|Reach|1846|pp=335–336|ps=none}} Such complaints were still commonplace nearly 20&amp;nbsp;years later; in ''[[Chambers Book of Days|The Book of Days]]'' (1864), author Robert Chambers wrote about a case of wife selling in 1832, and noted that "the occasional instances of wife-sale, while remarked by ourselves with little beyond a passing smile, have made a deep impression on our continental neighbours, [who] constantly cite it as an evidence of our low civilisation."{{sfnp|Chambers|1864|p=487|ps=none}} Embarrassed by the practice, a legal handbook of 1853 enabled English judges to dismiss wife selling as a myth: "It is a vulgar error that a husband can get rid of his wife by selling her in the open market with a halter round her neck. Such an act on his part would be severely punished by the local magistrate."{{sfnp|Stone|1990|pp=146–147|ps=none}} Originally published in 1869, ''Burn's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer'' states that "publicly selling or buying a wife is clearly an indictable offence&amp;nbsp;... And many prosecutions against husbands for selling, and others for buying, have recently been sustained, and imprisonment for six months inflicted".{{sfnp|Burn|2009|p=1025|ps=none}}

Another form of wife selling was by [[deed]] of conveyance. Although initially much less common than sale by auction, the practice became more widespread after the 1850s, as popular opinion turned against the market sale of a wife.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=455|ps=none}} The issue of the commonly perceived legitimacy of wife selling was also brought to the government. In 1881, Home Secretary [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]] was asked to comment on an incident in [[Sheffield]], in which a man sold his wife for a quart of beer. Harcourt replied: "no impression exists anywhere in England that the selling of wives is legitimate", and "that no such practice as wife selling exists",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Brutal Practice |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZT18810819.2.2 |work=New Zealand Tablet |publisher=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |volume=IX |issue=436 |date=19 August 1881 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as late as 1889, a member of the [[Salvation Army]] sold his wife for a shilling in [[Hucknall|Hucknall Torkard]], [[Nottinghamshire]], and subsequently led her by the halter to her buyer's house, the last case in which the use of a halter is mentioned.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|p=455|ps=none}} The most recent case of an English wife sale was reported in 1913, when a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court during a maintenance case claimed that her husband had sold her to one of his workmates for £1 (equivalent to about £{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1|1913|r=-1}}|0}} in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} The manner of her sale is unrecorded.{{sfnp|Thompson|1991|pp=408–409|ps=none}}

'''Zulu''' ({{IPAc-en|z|uː|l|uː}}) or '''isiZulu''' ({{small|Zulu:}} ''isiZulu'') is the [[language]] of the [[Zulu people]], with about 10 million speakers, the vast majority (over 95%) of whom live in [[South Africa]]. Zulu is the most widely spoken [[home language]] in South Africa (24% of the population), and it is understood by over 50% of its population.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of [[languages of South Africa|South Africa's 11 official languages]] in 1994.

According to [[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sna Ethnologue's Shona entry]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018|talk=Most widely spoken?}} it is the second most widely spoken of the [[Bantu languages]], after [[Shona language|Shona]]. Like many other Bantu languages, it is written with the [[Latin alphabet]].

In [[South African English]], the language is often referred to by using its native form, ''isiZulu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/zulu|title=Zulu|last=sahoboss|date=2011-04-03|work=South African History Online|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zulu migrant populations have taken it to adjacent regions, especially [[Zimbabwe]], where Zulu is called (Northern) [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]].

[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], the predominant language in the [[Eastern Cape]], is often considered mutually intelligible with Zulu.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C10-1115 |title=Ukwabelana - An open-source morphological Zulu corpus |last1=Spiegler|first1=Sebastian |last2=van der Spuy|first2=Andrew |last3=Flach |first3=Peter A.|date=August 2010 |publisher=Tsinghua University Press |book-title=Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics |pages=1020 |location=Beijing, China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maho (2009) lists four dialects: central KwaZulu-Natal Zulu, northern Transvaal Zulu, eastern coastal Qwabe, and western coastal Cele.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

==History==
The Zulu, like [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and other [[Nguni people|Nguni]] people, have lived in South Africa for a long time. The Zulu language possesses several click sounds typical of Southern African languages, not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have coexisted with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi.

Zulu, like most indigenous Southern African languages, was not a [[written language]] until the arrival of missionaries from Europe, who documented the language using the [[Latin script]]. 
The first grammar book of the Zulu language was published in [[Norway]] in 1850 by the Norwegian missionary [[Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder|Hans Schreuder]].&lt;ref&gt;Rakkenes, Øystein (2003) ''Himmelfolket: En Norsk Høvding i Zululand'', Oslo: Cappelen Forlag, pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; The first written document in Zulu was a Bible translation that appeared in 1883. In 1901, [[John Dube]] (1871–1946), a Zulu from Natal, created the [[Ohlange Institute]], the first native educational institution in South Africa. He was also the author of ''Insila kaShaka'', the first novel written in Zulu (1930). Another pioneering Zulu writer was [[Rolfes Robert Reginald Dhlomo|Reginald Dhlomo]], author of several historical novels of the 19th-century leaders of the Zulu nation: ''U-Dingane'' (1936), ''U-Shaka'' (1937), ''U-Mpande'' (1938), ''U-Cetshwayo'' (1952) and ''U-Dinizulu'' (1968). Other notable contributors to Zulu literature include [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] and, more recently, [[Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali]].

The written form of Zulu was controlled by the [[Zulu Language Board]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. This board has now been disbanded and superseded by the Pan South African Language Board&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |title=pansalb.org.za |access-date=17 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141039/http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |archive-date=17 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which promotes the use of all eleven official languages of South Africa.

==Contemporary usage==
English, Dutch and later [[Afrikaans]] had been the only official languages used by all South African governments before 1994. However, in the [[Kwazulu]] [[bantustan]] the Zulu language was widely used. All education in the country at the high-school level was in English or Afrikaans. Since the demise of apartheid in 1994, Zulu has been enjoying a marked revival. Zulu-language television was introduced by the [[SABC]] in the early 1980s and it broadcasts news and many shows in Zulu. Zulu radio is very popular and newspapers such as ''isoLezwe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isolezwe.co.za/ isolezwe.co.za]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ilanga''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilanganews.co.za/ ilanganews.co.za]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''UmAfrika'' in the Zulu language are available in [[Kwazulu-Natal]] province and in [[Johannesburg]]. In January 2005 the first full-length feature film in Zulu, ''[[Yesterday (2004 film)|Yesterday]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].

South African [[matriculation]] requirements no longer specify which South African language needs to be taken as a second language, and some people have made the switch to learning Zulu. However people taking Zulu at high-school level overwhelmingly take it as a first language: according to statistics, [[Afrikaans]] is still over 30 times more popular than Zulu as a ''second'' language. The mutual intelligibility of many [[Nguni languages]] has increased the likelihood of Zulu becoming the [[lingua franca]] of the eastern half of the country, although the political dominance of Xhosa-speaking people on national level militates against this.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} (The predominant language in the [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]] is Afrikaans – see the map below.)

In the 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]'', in the "[[Circle of Life]]" song, the phrases ''Ingonyama nengw' enamabala'' (English: ''A lion and a leopard spots''), ''Nans' ingonyama bakithi Baba'' (English: ''Here comes a lion, Father'') and ''Siyonqoba'' (English: ''We will conquer'') were used. In some movie songs, like "This Land", the voice says ''Busa leli zwe bo'' (''Rule this land'') and ''Busa ngothando bo'' (''Rule with love'') were used too.

The song ''[[Siyahamba]]'' is a South African hymn originally written in the Zulu language that became popular in North American churches in the 1990s.

===Standard vs urban Zulu===
[[standard language|Standard]] Zulu as it is taught in schools, also called "deep Zulu" (''isiZulu esijulile''), differs in various respects from the language spoken by people living in cities (urban Zulu, ''isiZulu sasedolobheni''). Standard Zulu tends to be [[Linguistic purism|purist]], using derivations from Zulu words for new concepts, whereas speakers of urban Zulu use [[loan words]] abundantly, mainly from English. For example: 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Standard Zulu
! urban Zulu
! English
|-
| ''umakhalekhukhwini''
| ''icell''
| cell/mobile phone
|-
| ''Ngiyezwa''
| ''Ngiya-andastenda''
| I understand
|}
This situation has led to problems in education because standard Zulu is often not understood by young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magagula|first=Constance Samukelisiwe|title=Standard Versus Non-standard IsiZulu: A Comparative Study Between Urban and Rural Learners' Performance and Attitude|year=2009|publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal|location=Durban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Vowels===
[[File:Zulu vowel chart.svg|right|upright=1.13|thumb|Zulu vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Wade|1996}}]]
Zulu has a simple vowel system consisting of five vowels.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- style="text-align:center;"

| {{IPA link|e}}
|
| {{IPA link|o}}
|- style="text-align:center;"
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| {{IPA link|a}}
|
|}

{{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} are pronounced {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}, respectively, if the following syllable contains an "i" or a "u" or if the vowel is word-final. They are {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} otherwise:
* ''umgibeli'' "passenger", phonetically {{IPA|[úm̩̀ɡìɓé(ː)lì]}}
* ''ukupheka'' "to cook", phonetically {{IPA|[ùɠúpʰɛ̀(ː)ɠà]}}

There is limited [[vowel length]] in Zulu, as a result of the contraction of certain syllables. For example, the word ''ithambo'' {{IPA|/íːtʰámbó/}} "bone", is a contraction of an earlier ''ilithambo'' {{IPA|/ílítʰámbó/}}, which may still be used by some speakers. Likewise, ''uphahla'' {{IPA|/úːpʰaɬa/}} "roof" is a contraction of earlier ''uluphahla'' {{IPA|/ulúpʰaɬa/}}. In addition the vowel of the penultimate syllable is allophonically lengthened phrase- or sentence-finally.

# The plain voiceless plosives, affricates and clicks are realised phonetically as ejectives {{IPA|[pʼ]}}, {{IPA|[tʼ]}}, {{IPA|[kʼ]}}, {{IPA|[tsʼ]}}, {{IPA|[tʃʼ]}} {{IPA|[kxʼ]}}.
# When not preceded by a nasal, {{IPA|/ɠ/}} is almost in complementary distribution with {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}}. The latter two phonemes occur almost exclusively root-initially, while {{IPA|/ɠ/}} appears exclusively medially. Recent loanwords contain {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}} in other positions, e.g. ''isekhondi'' {{IPA|/iːsekʰoːndi/}} "second", ''ibhayisikili'' {{IPA|/iːbajisikiːli/}} "bicycle".
# The [[slack voice|slack-voiced]] consonants are [[depressor consonant]]s. These have a lowering effect on the tone of their syllable. 
# The consonant {{IPA|/ŋ/}} occurs in some dialects as a reduction of the cluster {{IPA|/nɡ/}} when it is not in stem-initial position, and is therefore always slack-voiced.
# The trill {{IPA|/r/}} is not native to Zulu and occurs only in expressive words and in recent borrowings from European languages.

The use of [[click consonant]]s is one of the most distinctive features of Zulu. This feature is shared with several other languages of Southern Africa, but it is very rare in other regions. There are three basic articulations of clicks in Zulu:
* [[Dental click|Denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|/ǀ/}}, comparable to a sucking of teeth, as the sound one makes for 'tsk tsk'.
* [[Postalveolar click|Alveolar]] {{IPA|/!/}}, comparable to a bottle top 'pop'.
* [[Alveolar lateral click|Lateral]] {{IPA|/ǁ/}}, comparable to a click that one may do for a walking horse.

Each articulation covers five click consonants, with differences such as being slack-voiced, [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or [[nasalisation|nasalised]], for a total of 15.

===Phonotactics===

Zulu syllables are canonically (N)C(w)V, and words must always end in a vowel. Consonant clusters consist of any consonant, optionally preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal consonant (so-called "prenasalisation", described in more detail below) and optionally followed by the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}.

In addition, syllabic {{IPA|/m̩/}} occurs as a reduction of former {{IPA|/mu/}}, and acts like a true syllable: it can be syllabic even when not word-initial, and can also carry distinctive tones like a full syllable. It does not necessarily have to be homorganic with the following consonant, although the difference between homorganic nonsyllabic {{IPA|/mC/}} and syllabic {{IPA|/m̩C/}} is distinctive, e.g. ''umpetshisi'' {{IPA|/um̩pétʃiːsi/}} "peach tree" (5 syllables) versus ''impoko'' {{IPA|/ímpoːɠo/}} "grass flower" (3 syllables). Moreover, sequences of syllabic ''m'' and homorganic ''m'' can occur, e.g. ''ummbila'' {{IPA|/úm̩mbíːla/}} "maize" (4 syllables).

Recent loanwords from languages such as English may violate these constraints, by including additional consonant clusters that are not native to Zulu, such as in ''igremu'' {{IPA|/iːgreːmu/}} "[[gram]]". There may be some variation between speakers as to whether clusters are broken up by an [[epenthetic vowel]] or not, e.g. ''ikhompiyutha'' {{IPA|/iːkʰompijuːtʰa/}} or ''ikhompyutha'' {{IPA|/iːkʰompjuːtʰa/}} "computer".

===Prosody===

====Stress====

Stress in Zulu words is mostly predictable and normally falls on the penultimate syllable of a word. It is accompanied by allophonic lengthening of the vowel. When the final vowel of a word is long due to contraction, it receives the stress instead of the preceding syllable.

Lengthening does not occur on all words in a sentence, however, but only those that are sentence- or phrase-final. Thus, for any word of at least two syllables, there are two different forms, one with penultimate length and one without it, occurring in complementary distribution. In some cases, there are morphemic alternations that occur as a result of word position as well. The remote demonstrative pronouns may appear with the suffix ''-ana'' when sentence-final, but only as ''-ā'' otherwise. Likewise, the recent past tense of verbs ends in ''-ile'' sentence-finally, but is reduced to ''-ē'' medially. Moreover, a falling tone can only occur on a long vowel, so the shortening has effects on tone as well.

Some words, such as ideophones or interjections, can have stress that deviates from the regular pattern.

====Tone====

Like almost all other [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and other [[African languages]], Zulu is [[tonal Languages|tonal]]. There are three main ''tonemes'': low, high and falling. Zulu is conventionally written without any indication of tone, but tone can be distinctive in Zulu. For example, the words for "priest" and "teacher" are both spelled ''umfundisi'', but they are pronounced with different tones: {{IPA|/úm̩fúndisi/}} for the "priest" meaning, and {{IPA|/úm̩fundísi/}} for the "teacher" meaning.

In principle, every syllable can be pronounced with either a high or a low tone. However, low tone does not behave the same as the other two, as high tones can "spread" into low-toned syllables while the reverse does not occur. A low tone is therefore better described as the ''absence'' of any toneme; it is a kind of default tone that is overridden by high or falling tones. The falling tone is a sequence of high-low, and occurs only on long vowels. The penultimate syllable can also bear a falling tone when it is long due to the word's position in the phrase. However, when it shortens, the falling tone becomes disallowed in that position.{{clarify|reason=What happens to it?|date=December 2016}}

In principle, every [[morpheme]] has an inherent underlying tone pattern which does not change regardless of where it appears in a word. However, like most other Bantu languages, Zulu has [[word tone]], meaning that the pattern of tones acts more like a template to assign tones to individual syllables, rather than a direct representation of the pronounced tones themselves. Consequently, the relationship between underlying tone patterns and the tones that are actually pronounced can be quite complex. Underlying high tones tend to surface rightward from the syllables where they are underlyingly present, especially in longer words.

====Depressor consonants====

The breathy consonant phonemes in Zulu are [[depressor consonant]]s, or depressors for short. Depressor consonants have a lowering effect on pitch, adding a non-phonemic low-tone onset to the normal tone of the syllable. Thus, in syllables with depressor consonants, high tones are realised as rising, and falling tones as rising-then-falling. In both cases, the pitch does not reach as high as in non-depressed syllables. The possible tones on a syllable with a voiceless consonant like ''hla'' are {{IPA|[ɬá ɬâ ɬà]}}, and the possible tones of a breathy consonant syllable, like ''dla'', are {{IPA|[ɮǎ̤ ɮa̤᷈ ɮà̤]}}. A depressor has no effect on a syllable that's already low, but it blocks assimilation to a preceding high tone, so that the tone of the depressor syllable and any following low-tone syllables stays low.

===Phonological processes===

====Prenasalisation====

Prenasalisation occurs whenever a consonant is preceded by a homorganic nasal, either lexically or as a consequence of prefixation. The most notable case of the latter is the class 9 noun prefix ''in-'', which ends in a homorganic nasal. Prenasalisation triggers several changes in the following consonant, some of which are phonemic and others allophonic. The changes can be summed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Rycroft &amp; Ngcobo (1979) ''Say it in Zulu'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zulu-English dictionary'', C.M. Doke &amp; B.W. Vilakazi&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tone assimilation====

Zulu has tonic [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]: high tones tend to spread allophonically to following low-tone syllables, raising their pitch to a level just below that of adjacent high-tone syllables. A toneless syllable between a high-tone syllable and another tonic syllable assimilates to that high tone. That is, if the preceding syllable ends on a high tone and the following syllable begins with a high tone (because it is high or falling), the intermediate toneless syllable has its pitch raised as well. When the preceding syllable is high but the following is toneless, the medial toneless syllable adopts a high-tone onset from the preceding syllable, resulting in a falling tone contour.

For example, the English word ''spoon'' was borrowed into Zulu as ''isipunu'', phonemically {{IPA|/ísipúnu/}}. The second syllable ''si'' assimilates to the surrounding high tones, raising its pitch, so that it is pronounced {{IPA|[ísípʼúːnù]}} sentence-finally. If tone pitch is indicated with numbers, with 1 highest and 9 lowest pitch, then the pitches of each syllable can be denoted as 2-4-3-9.&lt;ref&gt;''Zulu-English Dictionary'', Doke, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; The second syllable is thus still lower in pitch than both of the adjacent syllables.

====Tone displacement====

Depressor consonants have an effect called ''tone displacement''. Tone displacement occurs whenever a depressor occurs with a high tone, and causes the tone on the syllable to shift rightward onto the next syllable. If the next syllable is long, it gets a falling tone, otherwise a regular high tone. If the penultimate syllable becomes high (not falling), the final syllable [[dissimilation|dissimilates]] and becomes low if it wasn't already. Tone displacement is blocked under the following conditions:
* When the syllable has a long vowel.
* When the following syllable also has a depressor consonant.
* When the following syllable is the final syllable, and is short.

Whenever tone displacement is blocked, this results in a depressor syllable with high tone, which will have the low-tone onset as described above. When the following syllable already has a high or falling tone, the tone disappears from the syllable as if it had been shifted away, but the following syllable's tone is not modified.

Some examples:
* ''izipunu'' "spoons", the plural of ''isipunu'' from the previous section, is phonemically {{IPA|/ízipúnu/}}. Because {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor consonant, tone assimilation is prevented. Consequently, the word is pronounced as {{IPA|[ízìpʼúːnù]}} sentence-finally, with low tone in the second syllable.
* ''izintombi'' "girls" is phonemically {{IPA|/izíntombí/}}. {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor, and is not blocked, so the tone shifts to the third syllable. This syllable can be either long or short depending on sentence position. When long, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[ìzìntômbí]}}, with a falling tone. However, when the third syllable is short, the tone is high, and dissimilation of the final syllable occurs, resulting in {{IPA|[ìzìntómbì]}}.
* ''nendoda'' "with a man" is phonemically {{IPA|/nʱéndoda/}}. {{IPA|/nʱ/}} is a depressor, but so is {{IPA|/d/}}, so tone displacement is blocked. Consequently, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[nʱěndɔ̀ːdà]}}, with rising pitch in the first syllable due to the low-onset effect.

====Palatalisation====

[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalisation]] is a change that affects labial and alveolar consonants whenever they are immediately followed by {{IPA|/j/}}. While palatalisation occurred historically, it is still productive, and occurs as a result of the addition of suffixes beginning with {{IPA|/j/}}. A frequent example is the diminutive suffix ''-yana''.

Moreover, Zulu does not generally tolerate sequences of a labial consonant plus {{IPA|/w/}}. Whenever {{IPA|/w/}} follows a labial consonant, it changes to {{IPA|/j/}}, which then triggers palatalisation of the consonant. This effect can be seen in the locative forms of nouns ending in ''-o'' or ''-u'', which changes to ''-weni'' and ''-wini'' respectively in the locative. If a labial consonant immediately precedes, palatalisation is triggered. The change also occurs in nouns beginning in ''ubu-'' with a stem beginning with a vowel.

The following changes occur as a result of palatalisation:

Reference works and older texts may use additional letters. A common former practice was to indicate the implosive {{IPA|/ɓ/}} using the special letter ''ɓ'', while the digraph ''bh'' would then be simply written as ''b''. Some references may also write ''h'' after letters to indicate that they are of the depressor variety, e.g. ''mh'', ''nh'', ''yh'', a practice that is standard in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] orthography.

Very early texts, from the early 20th century or before, tend to omit the distinction between plain and aspirated voiceless consonants, writing the latter without the ''h''.

Nouns are written with their prefixes as one orthographical word. If the prefix ends with a vowel (as most do) and the noun stem also begins with a vowel, a hyphen is inserted in between, e.g. ''i-Afrika''. This occurs only with loanwords.

==Morphology==
{{main article|Zulu grammar}}
Here are some of the main features of Zulu:

* Word order is [[subject–verb–object]].
* Morphologically, it is an [[agglutinative language]].
* As in other Bantu languages, Zulu nouns are classified into [[noun class|morphological classes]] or ''[[grammatical gender|genders]]'' (16 in Zulu), with different prefixes for singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Such agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which it is agreeing. An example is the use of the class 'aba-':

::'''B'''onke '''aba'''ntu '''aba'''qatha '''ba'''sepulazini '''ba'''yagawula.

::''All the strong people of the farm are felling (trees).''

:The various agreements that qualify the word 'abantu' (people) can be seen in effect.

* Its verbal system shows a combination of temporal and aspectual categories in their finite paradigm. Typically verbs have two stems, one for present-undefinite and another for perfect. Different prefixes can be attached to these verbal stems to specify subject agreement and various degrees of past or future tense. For example, in the word ''uyathanda'' ("he loves"), the present stem of the verb is ''-thanda'', the prefix ''u-'' expresses third-person singular subject and ''-ya-'' is a filler that is used in short sentences.
:Suffixes are also put into common use to show the causative or reciprocal forms of a verb stem.
* Most property words (words encoded as adjectives in English) are represented by relative. In the sentence ''umuntu ubomvu'' ("the person is red"), the word ''ubomvu'' (root ''-bomvu'') behaves like a verb and uses the agreement prefix ''u-''. however, there are subtle differences; for example, it does not use the prefix ''ya-''.

===Morphology of root ''Zulu''===
The root can be combined with a number of prefixes and thus create other words. For example, here is a table with a number of words constructed from the roots -''Zulu'' and ''-ntu'' (the root for ''person/s'', ''people''):

{|class="wikitable"
! Prefix !! -zulu !! -ntu
|-
| '''um(u)''' || um''Zulu'' (a Zulu person) || umu''ntu'' (a person)
|-
| '''ama, aba''' || ama''Zulu'' (Zulu people) || aba''ntu'' (people)
|-
| '''isi''' || isi''Zulu'' (the Zulu language) || isi''ntu'' (culture, heritage, mankind)
|-
| '''ubu''' || ubuZulu (personification/Zulu-like tendencies) || ubu''ntu'' (humanity, compassion)
|-
| '''kwa''' || kwa''Zulu'' (place of the Zulu people) || –
|-
| '''i(li)''' || i''zulu'' (the weather/sky/heaven) || –
|-
| '''pha''' || phe''zulu'' (on top) || –
|-
| '''e''' || e''zul''wini (in, at, to, from heaven) || –

Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.

==Zulu words in South African English==
[[South African English]] has absorbed many words from the Zulu language. Others, such as the names of local animals (''[[impala]]'' and ''[[mamba]]'' are both Zulu names) have made their way into standard English. A few examples of Zulu words used in South African English:

* '''[[muti]]''' (from ''umuthi'') – medicine
* '''[[donga (ditch)|donga]]''' (from ''udonga'') – ditch (udonga means 'wall' in Zulu and is also the name for ditches caused by soil erosion)
* '''[[indaba]]''' – conference (it means 'an item of news' in Zulu)
* '''[[induna]]''' – chief or leader
* '''shongololo''' (from ''ishongololo'') – millipede
* '''[[ubuntu (ideology)|ubuntu]]''' – compassion/humanity.
