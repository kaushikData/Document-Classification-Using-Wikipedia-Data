An '''anthology film''' (also known as an '''omnibus film''', '''package film''', or '''portmanteau film''') is a subgenre of films consisting of several different [[short film]]s, often tied together by only a single theme, premise, or brief interlocking event (often a turning point). Sometimes each one is directed by a different [[film director|director]]. These differ from "[[revue#Film revues|revue films]]" such as ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930)—which were common in Hollywood in the early [[sound film]] era to show off their stars and related [[vaudeville]]-style acts—[[composite film]]s, and [[compilation film]]s.

Sometimes there is a theme, such as a place (e.g. ''[[New York Stories]]'', ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]''), a person (e.g. ''[[Four Rooms]]''), or a thing (e.g. ''[[Twenty Bucks]]'', ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]''), that is present in each story and serves to bind them together. Two of the earliest films to use the form were [[Edmund Goulding]]'s ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), released by [[MGM]] with an all-star cast; and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s ''[[If I Had a Million]]'' (also 1932), featuring segments helmed by a number of directors.

==Examples==
European directors such as [[Roberto Rossellini]] directed anthology films such as ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' (segments: "Il Miracolo" and "Una voce umana") (1948), ''Les Sept péchés capitaux'' (segment: "Envie, L'Envy") (1952), ''[[Siamo donne]]'' (segment: "[[Ingrid Bergman]]") (1953), and ''Amori di mezzo secolo'' (segment: "Napoli 1943") (1954). American studios soon followed with films like ''[[Quartet (1948 film)|Quartet]]'' ([[1948 in film|1948]]) based on stories by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. This led to two sequels, ''[[Trio (1950 film)|Trio]]'' (1950) and ''[[Encore (1951 film)|Encore]]'' (1951), as well as imitators like ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'' (1952) and ''[[Actor's and Sin]]'' (1952).

Sometimes there is one "top-level" story, a [[framing device]], which leads into the various "sub-stories", as in ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), ''[[Tales of Manhattan]]'' (1942), ''[[Flesh and Fantasy (1943 film)|Flesh and Fantasy]]'' (1943), ''[[Dead of Night (1945 movie)|Dead of Night]]'' (1945), and ''[[The Illustrated Man (film)|The Illustrated Man]]'' (1968). ''Dead of Night'' helped to popularize the format for horror films—although they had existed as far back as ''Unheimliche Geschichten'' (1919)—and [[United Kingdom|British]] company [[Amicus Productions|Amicus]] made several such films in the 1960s and 1970s.

The 1989 film ''[[New York Stories]]'' consists of three segments directed by [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Woody Allen]].

''[[The Red Violin]]'' (1998) could also be considered a portmanteau film, since the storylines revolve around the various owners of a precious sixteenth-century violin through the centuries. Similarly, 1964's ''[[The Yellow Rolls-Royce]]'' follows the owners of the titular vehicle.

[[Gene Kelly]]'s 1956 all-dance film ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' consisted of three distinct stories, each different in tone and with its own plot line. Kelly appeared in each of the stories as different characters.

''[[Four Rooms]]'' is also an anthology film which follows the protagonist and his misadventures in four different rooms of a hotel. The four different segments (or rooms) were all directed by different directors.

Mohsen Abdolvahab's debut ''[[Please Do Not Disturb]]'' (2010) was a widely acclaimed tri-segmented Iranian anthology film.

Anthology films are often mistaken with [[hyperlink cinema]]. Hyperlink cinema shows bits of many stories throughout the movie, whereas anthology films show story segments of one at a time. Some mistaken examples include ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[Amores Perros]]'', distributing their storylines non-chronologically, separated by segments.

[[V/H/S]] is a 2012 American anthology [[horror film]] created by Brad Miska&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Nigel N. [www.indiewire.com/2012/01/bloody-disgusting-founder-and-vhs-producer-brad-miska-on-why-the-found-footage-movie-is-here-to-stay-49609/ Bloody Disgusting Founder and "V/H/S" Producer Brad Miska On Why the Found-Footage Movie Is Here To Stay". '''Indiewire'''. Retrieved 2016-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bloody Disgusting]]. It features a series of five unrelated [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found-footage]] horror shorts tied together by a [[Frame story|frame narrative]]. The film spawned two sequels, [[V/H/S/2]] (2013), and [[V/H/S: Viral]] (2014), and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], [[SiREN]] (2016).

On November 16, 2018, the [[Coen brothers|Coen Brothers]]' American [[Western (genre)|Western]] anthology film, [[The Ballad of Buster Scruggs]], was released on a limited theater run and on [[Netflix]] a week later.  The film contains six separate stories written and directed by the Coen Brothers, which they wrote and accumulated over the last 25 years.

== In India ==
''[[Sirikkathe]]'', a [[Tamil language|Tamil film]] released in 1939, is considered the first anthology film in India.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.deccanherald.com/content/338926/anthology-romance.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/chitramela-1967/article2115673.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1961 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] film ''[[Teen Kanya]]'' by [[Satyajit Ray]], based on three short stories by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], belongs to this genre.

''[[Chithramela]]'', a [[Malayalam]] film directed by T. S. Muthaiah, and ''Kathasangama'', a Kannada film directed by [[Puttanna Kanagal]] in 1975, are some of the earliest portmanteau films from India.

Recent anthology films from [[Bollywood]] include [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s ''[[Darna Mana Hai]]'' and its sequel ''[[Darna Zaroori Hai]]''. ''[[Dus Kahaniyaan]]'' is also a noted portmanteau film from Bollywood.

''[[Love Sex aur Dhokha]]'', directed by [[Dibakar Banerjee]] also belong to this genre of films. While the characters of the part 'Sex' work in the supermarket, the characters of 'Love' and 'Dhokha' visits the market and acquainted with the protagonists of 'Sex'.

In [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada Cinema]] famous director [[S. R. Puttanna Kanagal]]'s 1976 film ''[[Katha Sangama]]'' is the first attempt in making anthology films.But the audience did not accepted this movie.However today ''Katha Sangama'' counted as one of the [[cult]] movie in Kannada Cinema history.It is made by three different stories of different authors.

Recently in 2010, [[V. K. Prakash]]'s [[Kannada]] movie ''[[Aidondla Aidu]]'' attracted people to theatres.People accepted the movie.He used author Jayaprakash Koloor's five stories in this movie.

An Indian Malayalam movie, ''[[Kerala Cafe]]'' (2009) includes 10 different stories packed up in a single movie by [[Ranjith (director)|Ranjith]], a well known Malayalam film director. The ten stories are directed by ten directors and more importantly, every film has a different team for its making. Another Malayalam Example is ''[[5 Sundarikal]]'' which had 5 Different Short-Movies. It also pays tribute to Indian film industry on its centenary. ''Yauvanam''/''Vandikkari'' (1974) and [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]]'s ''[[Naalu Pennungal]]'' (2007) are two other portmanteau films in Malayalam.

''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' is an Indian anthology film consisting of four short films, directed by Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar and Karan Johar. The film was released on May 3, 2013, to mark the centenary year of Indian cinema.

[[Solo (2017 film)|Solo]] is a 2017 Indian bilingual anthology romantic thriller directed by [[Bejoy Nambiar]], telling the story of four different people all played by [[Dulquer Salmaan]], each story revolving around four different elements: Earth, Fire, Wind and Water, each with the different facets of [[Lord Shiva]]

In Assamese Cinema, [[Samiran Barua Ahi Ase]] was the first attempt to make a film based on Anthology consisting of four stories revolving around a leader of a terrorist outfit.

''Asphalt 3D'' has received negative reviews from critics, currently holding an average score of 47% at [[GameRankings]] and 43/100 at [[Metacritic]], based on 30 and 37 reviews respectively.&lt;ref name="gr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt; The game was described by critics as "an absolute joke",&lt;ref name="GRreview" /&gt; "a buggy mess"&lt;ref name="GIreviewUS" /&gt; and "truly horrible"&lt;ref name="IGNReview" /&gt; due to "terrible physics, stiff controls and poor graphics",&lt;ref name="GPro" /&gt; along with [[Frame rate#Frame rates in video games|frame rate issues]] and glitches.&lt;ref name="GRreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GIreviewUS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ONMreview" /&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Martin Robinson stated that "a game can't even be bothered to stream its own pre-rendered intro smoothly".&lt;ref name="IGNReview" /&gt; Although praising of its "decent car models", [[GameTrailers]] noted that it "suffers from choppy performance, lots of pop-in, laughable animations, and tire marks that float above the road in 3D. It's as if it was made merely to look good in screen shots."&lt;ref name="GTReview" /&gt; Justin Towell of [[GamesRadar]] felt that the "angular scenery are reminiscent of the [[Nintendo 64|N64]]". The review said overall "So what can I say in summary? It's a £39.99 inferior remix of a £2.99 iPhone game with bad sound, bad graphics and shockingly slapdash collision logic. Not only is it the worst game of the 3DS' launch line-up, it's a contender for the title of 'worst launch game of all time'. Worse than Pen Pen. Worse than Tama. Worse even than Altered Beast. Do I really need to say it? Avoid.". &lt;ref name="GRreview" /&gt; Nintendo World Report staff writer Josh Max complained of its lack of [[tutorial]] sections and stated that it "does nothing to represent the capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS".&lt;ref name="NWRreview" /&gt; In their buyer's guide, NWR writer Matthew Blundon and director Neal Ronaghan stated that "when there are far better racers available, namely ''[[Ridge Racer 3D]]'', why waste your money on an inferior product such as ''Asphalt 3D''?"&lt;ref name="NWRbuy"&gt;{{cite web| title=Nintendo 3DS Launch Game Buyer's Guide| url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/25869| publisher=Nintendo World Report| date=March 27, 2011| accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''This article is about the banzuke document, for a list of wrestlers as ranked on an actual banzuke see [[List of active sumo wrestlers]]''
[[File:Banzuke2.jpg|right|thumb|The ''banzuke'' from the January 2012 tournament]]

A {{nihongo|'''''banzuke''''' |番付}}, officially called {{nihongo||番付表|banzuke-hyō}} is a document listing the rankings of professional [[sumo]] wrestlers published before each official tournament or ''[[honbasho]]''.  The term can also refer to the rankings themselves.  The document is normally released about two weeks before the tournament begins. On the ''banzuke'' wrestlers are divided into East, which is printed on the right, and West, which is printed on the left.  Each wrestler's full ''[[shikona]]'' (ring name), hometown and rank is also listed.  The top of the page starts with the highest ranked ''[[makuuchi]]'' wrestlers printed in the largest characters, down to the wrestlers in the lowest divisions which are written in much smaller characters.  The names of ''[[gyōji]]'' (sumo referees), ''[[yobidashi]]'' (ushers/handymen), ''[[Judge (sumo)|shimpan]]'' (judges), ''[[Toshiyori|oyakata]]'' (elders of the [[Japan Sumo Association]]), and occasionally ''[[tokoyama]]'' (hairdressers) are also listed.

While not as old as sumo itself, the form and production of this document can be traced as far back as 1761, and has been a defining component of sumo for centuries. As is the traditional Japanese style, a ''banzuke'' is meant to be read right to left, top to bottom. It is considered a collector's item by sumo fans.&lt;ref name="Hall 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hall |first= Mina. |title= The Big Book of Sumo |publisher= [[Stone Bridge Press]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 1-880656-28-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Banzuke'' preparation==

The rankings on the ''banzuke'' are decided by an assembly composed of 20 sumo judges and three supervisors who gather a few days after each official tournament. The assembly assigns ranks to over 600 wrestlers in six divisions based on their performance in the previous tournament.  There are no precise rules for assigning rank, but the general rule is that a wrestler who achieved ''[[Glossary of sumo terms#kachikoshi|kachi-koshi]]'' (a majority of wins) will be raised in the rankings and a wrestler with a ''[[Glossary of sumo terms#makekoshi|make-koshi]]'' (a majority of losses) will be lowered in the rankings. The degree of a wrestler's success or failure will help give the assembly a benchmark for figuring how far he rises or falls in the  rankings.&lt;ref name="How to Read a Banzuke"&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |title =  How to Read a Banzuke? |publisher = Le Monde de sumo |year = 2004 |url = http://www.lemondedusumo.com/english/MDS6_banzuke.php?mag=mds&amp;num=6 |accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-ranking ''[[gyōji]]'' then take on the laborious task of copying down the new rankings on a traditional Japanese paper roll called a ''maki''. They carefully write down the ''[[kanji]]'' characters of each wrestler participating in a tournament in a calligraphy style called [[Glossary of sumo terms#sumo moji|sumo ''moji'']]. The work is very intricate and requires a great deal of skill. It usually takes about a week to complete the document. The ''banzuke'' information is carefully guarded for several weeks before it is released, which is usually on the Monday 13 days before an official tournament begins.&lt;ref name="How to Read a Banzuke"/&gt;

The ''banzuke'' is printed at a greatly reduced size on sheets of paper (58&amp;nbsp;cm x 44&amp;nbsp;cm) and copies are distributed by the [[Japan Sumo Association]].  Sumo [[heya (sumo)|stables]] buy a large quantity of them to give to their sponsors. Tea houses in the [[Tokyo]] sumo venue [[Ryogoku Kokugikan|Kokugikan]] also buy them to give out to their patrons. They are also available for purchase for a small fee at tournament sites.&lt;ref name="Hall 1997" /&gt;

{{Celtic mythology}}
[[File:The Bard.jpg|thumb|''The Bard'' (ca. 1817), by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]]]
In medieval [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Britons (historical)|British]] culture, a '''bard''' was a professional [[Storytelling|story teller]], verse-maker and music composer, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble), to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.

Originally a specific, lower class of poet, contrasting with the higher rank known as ''[[fili]]'' in Ireland and Highland Scotland, with the decline of living [[bardic tradition]] in the modern period the term "bard" acquired generic meanings of an author or [[minstrel]], especially a famous one. For example, [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], are known as "the Bard of Avon" and "the Bard of Bengal" respectively.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of English"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work of Rabindranath Tagore celebrated in London - BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33543786|website=BBC News|accessdate=15 July 2015|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - Beardna.jpg|thumb|left|230px|'Beardna,' a loanword of Celtic origin]]
The word is a Celtic [[loan word]] from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''bàrd'', Irish ''bard'', Welsh ''bardd''. In 16th-century Scotland, it was a derogatory term for an [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] musician; nonetheless it was later romanticised by Sir [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary of English"/&gt;

==Origin==
In medieval [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Wales|Welsh]] society, a ''bard'' ([[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]] and Irish Gaelic) or ''bardd'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]) was a professional poet, employed to compose [[Eulogy|eulogies]] for his [[lord]] (see [[Planxty#Etymology|planxty]]). If the employer failed to pay the proper amount, the bard would then compose a satire (c.f. ''[[fili]]'', ''[[fáith]]''). In other Indo-European societies, the same function was fulfilled by [[skald]]s, [[rhapsode]]s, [[minstrel]]s and ''[[scop]]s'', among others. A hereditary caste of professional poets in [[Proto-Indo-European society]] has been reconstructed by comparison of the position of poets in medieval Ireland and in ancient India in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Litchfield West, ''Indo-European poetry and myth'', Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-19-928075-9}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bards (who are not the same as the Irish 'filidh' or 'fili') were those who sang the songs recalling the tribal warriors' deeds of bravery as well as the genealogies and family histories of the ruling strata among [[Celt]]ic societies. The pre-Christian Celtic peoples recorded no written histories; however, Celtic peoples did maintain an intricate oral history committed to memory and transmitted by bards and filid. Bards facilitated the memorisation of such materials by the use of [[Metre (poetry)|metre]], [[Rhyme#Function of rhyme|rhyme]] and other formulaic poetic devices.

One of the most notable bards in Irish Mythological was [[Amergin Glúingel]], he was bard, druid and judge for the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].

==History==

===Ireland===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
{{See also|Bardic poetry}}
In medieval Ireland, bards were one of two distinct groups of poets, the other being the ''[[fili]]''. According to the [[Early Irish law]] text on status, ''[[Uraicecht Becc]]'', bards were a lesser class of poets, not eligible for higher poetic roles as described above. However, it has also been argued that the distinction between ''filid'' (pl. of ''fili'') and bards was a creation of Christian Ireland, and that the ''filid'' were more associated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/onbards.html|title=On Bards, And Bardic Circles|website=www.pbm.com|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breatnach"&gt;Breatnach, Liam. ''[[Uraicecht na Ríar]]'', ca. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this should have some publication data or a URḶ if at all possible --&gt; By the Early Modern Period, these names came to be used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergin|first1=Osborn|title=Irish Bardic Poetry|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|location=Dublin|pages=3–5|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/bardic.html|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish bards formed a professional hereditary [[caste]] of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of [[clan]] and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was [[Syllabic verse|syllabic]] and used [[assonance]], [[half rhyme]] and [[alliteration]], among other conventions. As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were [[chronicle]]rs and [[Satire|satirists]] whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irishempire.org/news/travel-roots/druids-filid-bards-custodians-of-celtic-tradition/25|title=Druids, Filid &amp; Bards: Custodians of Celtic Tradition|last=Empire|first=Irish|website=irishempire.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, ''glam dicenn'', could raise boils on the face of its target.

The bardic system lasted until the mid-17th century in Ireland and the early 18th century in Scotland. In Ireland, their fortunes had always been linked to the Gaelic aristocracy, which declined along with them during the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor Reconquest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/divided-gaels-gaelic-cultural-identities-in-scotland-and-ireland-c-1200-c-1650/|title=Divided Gaels: Gaelic cultural identities in Scotland and Ireland c. 1200–c. 1650|date=2013-02-22|work=History Ireland|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early history of the bards can be known only indirectly through mythological stories. The first mention of the bardic profession in Ireland is found in the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn|Book of Invasions]], in a story about the Irish colony of [[Tuatha De Danann]] (Peoples of Goddess Danu), also called Danonians. They became the ''[[aos sí]]'' (folk of the mound), comparable to Norse ''[[alfr]]'' and British [[fairy]]. During the tenth year of the reign of the last Belgic monarch, the people of the colony of Tuatha De Danann, as the Irish called it, invaded and settled in Ireland. They were divided into three tribes—the tribe of Tuatha who were the nobility, the tribe of De who were the priests (those devoted to serving God or De) and the tribe of Danann, who were the bards. This account of the Tuatha De Danann must be considered legendary; however the story was an integral part of the oral history of Irish bards themselves.

===Scotland===
{{Further information|MacMhuirich bardic family}}
The best-known group of bards in Scotland were the members of the MacMhuirich family, who flourished from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The family was centred in the [[Hebrides]], and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland. The family was at first chiefly employed by the [[Lords of the Isles]] as poets, lawyers, and physicians.&lt;ref name="Clancy-453"/&gt; With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the [[Scottish clan chief|chiefs]] of the [[Clan Macdonald of Clanranald|MacDonalds of Clanranald]]. Members of the family were also recorded as musicians in the early 16th century, and as clergymen possibly as early as the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Thomson-61"&gt;{{citation |author=Thomson, Derick S. |authorlink=Derick Thomson |title=Gaelic Learned Orders and Literati in Medieval Scotland |journal=Scottish Studies |publisher=The Journal of the School of Scottish Studies University of Edinburgh |year=1968 |volume=12 |issue=1 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the family to practise classical Gaelic poetry was Domhnall MacMhuirich, who lived on [[South Uist]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Clancy-453"&gt;{{citation |last=Clancy |first=Thomas Owen |authorlink=Thomas Owen Clancy |contribution=Clann MacMhuirich |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |editor1-last=Koch |editor1-first=John T. |editor1-link=John T.

A number of bards in [[Welsh mythology]] have been preserved in [[medieval Welsh literature]] such as the [[Red Book of Hergest]], the [[White Book of Rhydderch]], the [[Book of Aneirin]] and the [[Book of Taliesin]]. The bards [[Aneirin]] and [[Taliesin]] may be legendary reflections of historical bards active in the 6th and 7th centuries.
Very little historical information about [[Dark Age Wales|Dark Age Welsh]] court tradition survives, but the Middle Welsh material came to be the nucleus of the [[Matter of Britain]] and [[Arthurian legend]] as they developed from the 13th century. The (Welsh) Laws of Hywel Dda, originally compiled around 900 A.D, identify a bard as a member of a king's household. His duties, when the bodyguard were sharing out booty, included the singing of the sovereignty of Britain—possibly why the genealogies of the British high kings survived into the written historical record.

The royal form of bardic tradition ceased in the 13th century, when the 1282 [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|Edwardian conquest]] permanently ended the rule of the Welsh princes. The legendary suicide of ''The Last Bard'' (c. 1283), was commemorated in the poem ''[[The Bards of Wales]]'' by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] poet [[János Arany]] in 1857, as a way of encoded resistance to the suppressive politics of his own time. However, the poetic and musical traditions were continued throughout the Middle Ages, e.g., by noted 14th-century poets [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]] and [[Iolo Goch]]. The tradition of regularly assembling bards at an [[eisteddfod]] never lapsed, and was strengthened by formation of the [[Gorsedd]] by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in 1792, establishing Wales as the major Celtic upholder of bardic tradition in the 21st century. Many regular ''eisteddfodau'' are held in Wales, including the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] which was instituted in 1861 and has been held annually since 1880. Many Welsh schools conduct their own annual versions at which bardic traditions are emulated.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://stjulians.realsmartcloud.com/our-eisteddfod/ Our Eisteddfod] at St Julian's School, Newport, 19 March 2013. Accessed 20 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical and poetic traditions of the Welsh bards are perpetuated by the [[Gorsedd|Gorsedd of bards]] and through the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] (''Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru'').

From its frequent use in Romanticism, 'The Bard' became attached as a title to various  poets,
* 'The Bard of Armagh' is [[Martin Hearty]]
* 'The Bard of Avon,' 'The Immortal Bard' (or in England, simply 'The Bard') is [[William Shakespeare]]
* 'The Bard of Ayrshire' (or in Scotland, simply 'The Bard') is [[Robert Burns]]
* 'The Bard of Bengal' is [[Rabindranath Tagore]]
* 'The Bard of Olney' is [[William Cowper]]
* 'The Bard of Rydal Mount' is [[William Wordsworth]]
* 'The Bard of Salford' is [[John Cooper Clarke]]
* 'The Bard of Twickenham' is [[Alexander Pope]]
* Australian [[bush poet]]s such as [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] are referred to as "bush bards"
* [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jim MacCool]] and the band [[Blind Guardian]] have also been termed 'bards'

From its Romanticist usage, the notion of the bard as a minstrel with qualities of a priest, magician or seer also entered the [[fantasy]] genre in the 1960s to 1980s, for example as the 'Bard' class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons),"Bard" class (Pathfinder RPG - Paizo), ''Bard'' by [[Keith Taylor (author)|Keith Taylor]] (1981), ''[[Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish]]'' by [[Morgan Llywelyn]] (1984), and in video games in fantasy settings such as ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]'' (1985).

'''''The Black Cab Sessions''''' is a series of one-song performances by musicians and poets recorded in the back of a [[black cab]] and filmed for an internet audience.  A [[black cab]] is a type of [[black cab|hackney carriage]] (taxicab, An [[Austin FX4]] or a [[Metrocab]]) common to Britain.  The sessions are recorded while the black cab that serves as the studio travels through city streets, usually in [[London, England]].  Most of the performances feature rock bands, ranging from popular acts such as [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[The Kooks]] and [[My Morning Jacket]] to lesser known acts such as the [[Cave Singers]].  Other performances stray from the rock music scene, featuring poetry and [[beatboxing]], for example.

The motto of the Black Cab Sessions is "one song, one take, one cab."  These performances have gained a cult following of viewers both on their own website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcabsessions.com www.blackcabsessions.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[YouTube]].

==Format==
''The Black Cab Sessions'' video clips begin with a screen showing the name of the artist and date the session was recorded.  This is followed by a shot of the cab driver, who has just been informed that his cab will play host to the sessions, introducing the artist.  The artists then give their performance.  

During the performances, the artists often have to react to the unusual venue.  For example, during the [[New Pornographers]] session, the two musicians can be seen bouncing up and down in their seats as the cab hits speed bumps.  The performances are also shaped by the limited space afforded by the back of a black cab. The uploads of acoustic acts with a different premise is a very popular one, with different projects using different selling points, Acts Unsigned, Tea and Biscuit Sessions and many others using the niche to get views.  Many of the bands that play are only represented by part of the band, for example.  In at least one instance, when singer/harpist [[Joanna Newsom]] was invited to perform, the fact that her harp would not fit in the cab kept her from contributing at all.&lt;ref name="Smyth"&gt;{{cite news

==Production==

The Black Cab Sessions were conceived by Jono Stevens and produced as a partnership between Hidden Fruit (Gen Stevens and Chris Pattinson) and Just So Films (Jonny Madderson and Will Evans).

One of the producers reports that about 10 percent of the cab drivers approached by the producers turns them down, thinking that the idea is weird, but that those who do participate enjoy it.&lt;ref name="Smyth" /&gt;

Filming of the Black Cab Sessions began in May, 2007 and is ongoing.

==History==
[[Image:Blue Castle Games logo.png|thumb|right|Blue Castle Games logo]]
The company was formed on July 4, 2005 in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] by three core founders with thirty five years of combined video game experience. Starting with only twelve staff and one game (''[[The Bigs]]''&lt;ref name="the_bigs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://2ksports.com/games/thebigs/|title = 2K Sports - The BIGS|accessdate = 2008-09-10|publisher = 2K Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the company has grown to 200 people with 3 shipped titles.&lt;ref name="company_profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcomvancouver.com/|title=Company Homepage|accessdate=2012-09-21|publisher=Capcom Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, Blue Castle Games won the award for Best New Video Game Company at the 2008 Elan Awards for ''[[The Bigs]]'', in a tie with another local Vancouver company.&lt;ref name = "elan_award"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theelans.com/2009/past-winners/2nd-annual-elans-winners/|title = 2nd Annual ELANS Winners|date = 2008-02-15|publisher = ELAN Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide number of developers in Capcom Vancouver were formerly of [[EA Canada]], located only a couple blocks away from their studio.

In February 2018, Capcom had laid off about 30% of the studio, but had continued to use Capcom Vancouver to support ''Puzzle Fighter'' on mobile and ongoing work for ''Dead Rising'' games. On September 18, 2018, Capcom announced the closure of the studio on reviewing the state of development of current projects. While a skeleton crew will remain through January 2019 to complete certain projects, remaining development work was either cancelled or transitions to Capcom's Japan studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-studio-capcom-vancouver-shuts-down-1829143863 | title = Dead Rising Studio Capcom Vancouver Shuts Down | first = Stephan | last = Tolito | date = September 18, 2018  | accessdate = September 18, 2018 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom estimated the cost of the cancelled projects equated to about {{JPY|4.5 billion}} (approximately {{USD|40 million}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/capcom-expects-to-lose-40-million-after-cancelling-dead-rising-studios-games | title = Capcom Expects To Lose $40 Million After Cancelling Dead Rising Studio's Games | first = Shabana | last= Arif | date = September 18, 2018 | accessdate = September 18, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cartoon pornography''' is the portrayal of illustrated or animated fictional cartoon characters in erotic or sexual situations.  Animated cartoon pornography or '''erotic animation''' is a subset of the larger field of [[adult animation]], not all of which is sexually explicit.

Because historically most cartoons have been produced for child and all-ages audiences, cartoon pornography has sometimes been subject to criticism and extra scrutiny compared to live-action erotic films or photographs. It is somewhat common in Japan, where it is part of a genre of entertainment commonly referred to outside of Japan as ''[[hentai]]''.

== History ==
[[File:Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure.ogv|thumb|300px|''Eveready Harton in 'Buried Treasure''', a 1929 animated erotic short film]]

One of the earliest examples of erotic animation is ''[[The Virgin with the Hot Pants]]'', a [[stag film]] that opens with an animated sequence featuring an independent penis and testicles pursuing a naked woman and having sex with her, then another sequence of a mouse sexually penetrating a cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Williams|first=Linda|title=Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the "Frenzy of the Visible"|year=2007|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-06652-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is ''[[Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure]]'', a 6.5-minute silent black-and-white animated film produced in 1928 by three US animation studios, for a private party. It features a man with a large, perpetually erect penis who has various misadventures with other characters and farm animals, plus his penis detaching and doing things on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America|last=Cohen|first=Karl F.|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|year=|isbn=0-7864-0395-0|location=North Carolina|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Golden Age of Porn]], which saw mainstream filmmakers and cinemas tentatively experiment with sexually explicit material with fully developed plots and storytelling themes, also saw some renewed interest in similar erotic animation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/10-animated-sexploitation-features-from-the-sixties-and-seventies-nsfw-95048.html|title=10 Animated Sexploitation Features from the Sixties and Seventies (NSFW)|date=2014-01-20|work=Cartoon Brew|access-date=2017-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Out of an Old Man's Head|O''ut of an Old Man’s Head'']] (1968) by [[Per Åhlin]] and [[Tage Danielsson]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''[[Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle]]'' (1975) by [[Picha]] and [[Boris Szulzinger]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and ''Historias de amor y masacre'' (1979) by Jorge Amorós.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Animator [[Ralph Bakshi]] produced [[Fritz the Cat (film)|''Fritz the Cat'']] (1972) (based loosely on the comix of [[Robert Crumb]]), which was the first animated film to receive an [[X rating|"X" rating]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/fritz-the-cat/257295/fritz-the-cat-a-look-at-r-crumbs-x-rated-animation-masterpiece|title=Fritz The Cat: A Look at R.

Since the 1980s, erotica has been a popular genre of animation in Japan. Erotic Japanese ''[[anime]]'' – some based on erotic ''manga'', others as [[original video animation]] – feature sexually suggestive and explicit sex scenes. (See also: [[Hentai]])

In the early 21st century, producers began applying digital animation technology to erotic material. In 2000, [[Playboy TV]] began running the erotic dystopian sci-fi series [[Playboy's Dark Justice|''Dark Justice'']], which used 3D animation, and ran for 20 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.awn.com/news/playboy-tv-disrobes-new-cgi-series|title=Playboy TV Disrobes New CGI Series|work=Animation World Network|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pararobo.blogspot.com/2016/08/playboys-dark-justice.html|title=Eu escrevo para robôs: Playboy´s Dark Justice|last=Rogério|date=2016-08-20|website=Eu escrevo para robôs|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/NYS/PLA/reports/PbyAR2000.pdf|title=Playboy Enterprises Inc. 2000 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, illustrator [[Joe Phillips]] released ''[[The House of Morecock]]'', a comedic erotic feature film for gay and bisexual male audiences, made using 2D digital animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gay.it/cultura/news/disegni-per-un-anno|title=DISEGNI PER UN ANNO - Gay.it|date=2004-12-23|work=Gay.it|access-date=2017-05-27|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 short ''[[Sex Life of Robots]]'' turned to the traditional technique of [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] to depict the imagined sexual activities of living robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/12/robots-have-a-s/|title=Video: Robots Have a Sex Life?

Animated content has become popular on pornographic video services, which sometimes report terms such as "anime", "hentai", and "cartoon" – all of which are commonly associated with animation – among the top search terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.craveonline.com/design/960987-porn-pornhub-study|title=What We Search For When We Search For Porn - CraveOnline|date=2016-03-02|work=CraveOnline|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2016/pornhub-most-searched-terms/|title=Pornhub reveals, state by state, its most popular search terms among U.S. users|date=2016-03-02|work=GeekWire|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/pokemon-go-porn-searches/?tw=dd|title=Pokémon Go has inspired people to get really into anime porn {{!}} The Daily Dot|date=2016-07-12|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortega-Brena|first=Mariana|date=2009-03-01|title=Peek-a-boo, I See You: Watching Japanese Hard-core Animation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-008-9039-5|journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=17–31|doi=10.1007/s12119-008-9039-5|issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/05/inside-the-surprisingly-big-overwatch-porn-scene/|title=Inside The Surprisingly Big Overwatch Porn Scene|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
{{seealso|Legal status of drawn pornography depicting minors}}
{{unrefsect|date=November 2018}}
The [[legal status]] of cartoon pornography varies from country to country. In addition to the normal [[legal status of pornography]], much cartoon pornography depicts potentially minor [that is, underage] characters engaging in sexual acts. One of the primary reasons for this may be due to the many cartoons featuring major characters who are not [[adult]]s. Cartoon pornography does not always have depictions of minors in sexual acts or situations, but that which does may fall under the [[jurisdiction]] laws concerning [[child pornography]]. Drawings of pre-existing characters can in theory be in violation of copyright law no matter the situation the characters are shown in.

'''''Days of Thunder''''' is a [[1990 in video gaming|1990]] [[NASCAR]] racing simulation video game loosely based on the [[1990 in film|1990]] movie ''[[Days of Thunder]]''. The game utilized elements from the movie, using a movie license from [[Paramount Pictures]] for its graphical elements, plot, and music soundtrack. It was released for the PC, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], the [[Game Boy]], and many other formats. It was created by [[Argonaut Software]] and distributed by [[Mindscape Group]].  In 2009 [[Freeverse]] released an updated version for the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Days of Thunder PC game.png|left|200px|thumbnail|During-game image. Note cracked dashboard.]]
In the PC version, gameplay consisted of setting up the car, qualifying, and then the actual race event. If the player finished in a high enough position, they would progress to the next circuit. Damage was calculated not by realistic damage displayed on the car but a "cracked dashboard" bar indicator, with cracks appearing along the dashboard when the player hits something.

==Segments==

===Intro===
Martin sings a song about himself while walking backstage and showing his [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] skills.

===Large Pad/Findings===
Martin uses his Large Pad to show some research or "Findings" with his Pointer. Among the topics discussed are "How Short a Person Is vs. How Drunk a Person Is and How Funny It Is", "Breakdown of [[Hummer]] Owners", "How Funny I Find Farts by Location", "Flow Chart Of Clowns", "People Who Live in Glass Houses Shouldn't Throw Stones", "Pony Tail Locations", "A Pie Chart About [[Procrastination]]" (actually an empty circle), "The Cuteness of a Girl vs. How Interested I Am in Hearing About How Intuitive Her Cat Is", "My Ability To Draw Mountains Over Time", "State Shapes", "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?|Half Full vs. Half Empty]] Based on Contents of Glass", and "Pillow Fights".

===Hey Porcupines===
In this animation made by Martin using felt and chalkboards, Martin thinks about [[porcupine]]s.

===The Jokes with Piano===
Martin plays some [[blues]] on the piano and sings some one liners. This is also the introduction of the recurring theme of "unnecessary bells".

===The Jokes with Guitar and Harmonica===
Martin tells some jokes while playing [[guitar]] and [[harmonica]].

===Art===
Martin showcases some of his funny drawings accompanied by music on piano and harmonica.

===Mythical Creatures===
In this animated segment, Martin plays Professor Irwin Glands, a professor in "mythozoology". He discusses some lesser known [[mythical creatures]], such as the "Vertimaid", the "Zebratard", and the "RexFidoBuster".

===Getting the Harmonica the Cool Way===
Martin is about to tell some jokes accompanied by his guitar when he realizes he doesn't have the harmonica rack around his neck and left it on top of the piano, so he gets up out of his chair and gets it "the [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]] way".

===Where My Jokes Go===
Similar to the end of his ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' special where he talked about where his jokes came from, Martin discusses/hypothesizes where his jokes go while some friends and relatives of his act them out. In between, he tells some more jokes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">'''Dial-A-Poem''' is  a phone-based service started in 1968 by poet [[John Giorno]] after a phone conversation with his friend [[William Burroughs]]. Fifteen phone lines were connected to individual answering machines; anyone could phone [[Giorno Poetry Systems]] and listen for free to a poem offered from various live recordings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/arts/dialapoem-enters-the-internet-age.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weirdretro.org.uk/the-dial-a-poem-poets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The venture was a success from 1969 on, and the poems dealt with numerous social issues such as the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[sexual revolution]]. Giorno claimed the service later influenced the creation of other information services over the telephone, such as banking, sports, and investing. It spawned a number of imitators. Eventually, all of them were eclipsed by the internet, most particularly by [[YouTube]].

[[File:6sided dice.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Four traditional dice showing all six different sides]]
'''Dice''' ([[Grammatical number|singular]] '''die''' or '''dice''';&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dice Definition of dice in English], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Old French]] ''dé''; from [[Latin]] ''datum'' "something which is given or played"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/die?searchDictCode=all#die-2 |title=die |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are small throwable objects that can rest in multiple positions, used for generating [[Statistical randomness|random numbers]]. Dice are suitable as [[gambling]] devices for games like [[craps]] and are also used in non-gambling [[tabletop game]]s.

[[File:Dice-rolling-slowmotion-2018-9.webm|thumb|Dice being thrown in slow motion.]]
A traditional die is a [[cube]], with each of its six faces showing a different number of dots ([[pip (counting)|pips]]) from 1 to 6. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing on its upper surface a random [[integer]] from one to six, each value being equally likely. A variety of similar devices are also described as dice; such specialized dice may have [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] or irregular shapes and may have faces marked with symbols instead of numbers. They may be used to produce results other than one through six. Loaded and crooked dice are designed to favor some results over others for purposes of [[cheating]] or amusement.

A dice tray, a tray used to contain thrown dice, is sometimes used for gambling or [[board game]]s, in particular to allow dice throws which do not interfere with other game pieces.

Dice have been used since before recorded history, and it is uncertain where they originated. The oldest known dice were excavated as part of a [[backgammon]]-like game set at the [[Burnt City]], an archeological site in south-eastern [[Iran]], estimated to be from between 2800–2500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/5668.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620035304/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=5668&amp;sectionid=351020108 |archive-date=20 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |title=presstv.ir |publisher=presstv.ir |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other excavations from ancient tombs in the [[Indus Valley civilization]] indicate a [[South Asia]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Possehl, Gregory.

The Egyptian game of [[Senet]] was played with dice. Senet was played before 3000&amp;nbsp;BC and up to the 2nd century AD. It was probably a racing game, but there is no scholarly consensus on the rules of Senet.&lt;ref name="Aruz"&gt;{{cite book |first=Irving |last=Finkel |title=Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gr5BgOwEJicC&amp;pg=PA151 |year=2008 |chapter=Board Games |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |isbn=978-1-58839-295-4 |page=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dicing is mentioned as an [[History of India|Indian]] game in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and the early [[List of games that Buddha would not play|Buddhist games list]].&lt;ref&gt;2.3, 4.38, 6.118, 7.52, 7.109&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[Bible|biblical]] references to "casting lots", as in [[Psalms|Psalm]] 22, indicating that dicing (or a related activity) was commonplace when the psalm was composed.

Although gambling was illegal, many [[Culture of Ancient Rome|Romans]] were passionate gamblers who enjoyed dicing, which was known as ''aleam ludere'' ("to play at dice"). Dicing was even a popular pastime of emperors. Letters by [[Augustus]] to [[Tacitus]] and his daughter recount his hobby of dicing. There were two sizes of Roman dice. ''Tali'' were large dice inscribed with one, three, four, and six on four sides. ''Tesserae'' were smaller dice with sides numbered from one to six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Matz |title=Daily Life of the Ancient Romans |year=2002 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-30326-5 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-sided dice date back to the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4205385 |title=christies.com |publisher=christies.com |accessdate=18 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from Ptolemaic Egypt as early as the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/551072 |title=Twenty-sided die (icosahedron) with faces inscribed with Greek letters |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=28 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dominoes]] and [[playing card]]s originated in China as developments from dice. The transition from dice to playing cards occurred in China around the [[Tang dynasty]], and coincides with the technological transition from rolls of manuscripts to [[woodblock printing|block printed]] books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Ronan |first2=Joseph |last2=Needham |title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjRAiqGSJ50C&amp;pg=PA55 |year=1986 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31560-9 |page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, dice were used to play a popular game called [[sugoroku]]. There are two types of sugoroku. ''Ban-sugoroku'' is similar to [[backgammon]] and dates to the [[Heian period]], while ''e-sugoroku'' is a racing game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rebecca |last=Salter |title=Japanese Popular Prints: From Votive Slips to Playing Cards |year=2006 |chapter=Board Games |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-3083-0 |page=164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Dice are thrown onto a surface either from the hand or from a container designed for this (such as a dice cup). The face of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. One typical [[List of dice games|dice game]] today is [[craps]], where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to randomize moves in [[board game]]s, usually by deciding the distance through which a piece will move along the board; examples of this are backgammon and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''.

The result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of [[classical mechanics]]. A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of [[hardware random number generator]]. Perhaps to mitigate concerns that the pips on the faces of certain styles of dice cause a small bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dice-play.com/DiceCasino.htm|title=Casino Dice|website=www.dice-play.com|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; casinos use precision dice with flush markings.

==Construction==
===Arrangement===
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.2.svg|thumb|left|[[Chirality]] of dice. Faces may be placed [[clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise (top) ''or'' clockwise]].]]
Common dice are small [[cube]]s most commonly {{convert|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} across,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dicegamedepot.com/dice-sizes/|title=Dice Sizes Explained|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Dice Game Depot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of [[Arabic numerals]] is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)

Opposite sides of a modern die traditionally add up to seven, implying that the 1, 2 and 3 faces share a vertex.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [https://archive.org/details/greekanthology05newyuoft ''Greek Anthology''] Book 14, §8: "The Opposite Pairs of Numbers on a Die. The numbers on a die run so: six one, five two, three four."&lt;/ref&gt; The faces of a die may be placed [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise or counterclockwise]] about this vertex. If the 1, 2 and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called "right-handed", and if those faces run clockwise, the die is called "left-handed". Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.&lt;ref name="diceplay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/DiceStandard.htm |title=Standard Dice |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730085649/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/DiceStandard.htm |archivedate=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die Faces.svg|thumb|upright|Typical facets showing the more compact pip arrangement of an Asian-style die (top) vs. a Western-style die (bottom)]]

The pips on dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown. Asian style dice bear similar patterns to Western ones, but the pips are closer to the center of the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are colored red on the 1 and 4 sides. One possible explanation is that red fours are of Indian origin.&lt;ref name="diceplay" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Culin/Dice1893/dice.html |title=Chinese Dice|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501172614/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Culin/Dice1893/dice.html |archivedate=1 May 2008  |publisher=Elliott Avedon Museum &amp; Archive of Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some older sets, the "one" pip is a colorless depression.

===Manufacturing===
[[Image:dice01.jpg|thumb|upright|Western, Asian and [[casino]] dice]]
Non-precision dice are manufactured via the plastic [[injection molding]] process. The pips or numbers on the die are a part of the mold. The coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the die entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry. The die is then polished via a [[tumble finishing]] process similar to [[rock polishing]]. The [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasive agent]] scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also creates the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.&lt;ref name="awesomedice"&gt;[http://www.awesomedice.com/blog/64/how-dice-are-made/ How Dice Are Made] from Awesome Dice&lt;/ref&gt;

Precision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same [[density]] as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. All such dice are stamped with a [[serial number]] to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die. Precision backgammon dice are made the same way; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the dice cup and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.

===Terms===
While the terms ''[[ace]]'', ''deuce'', ''trey'', ''cater'', ''cinque'' and ''sice'' are generally obsolete, with the names of the numbers preferred, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice. ''Ace'' is from the Latin ''as'', meaning "a unit";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/ace |title=ace |publisher=AskOxford |accessdate=18 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the others are 2 to 6 in [[Old French]].&lt;ref name="Conant"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Number Concept: Its Origin and Development |last1=Conant |first1=Levi Leonard |publisher=Macmillan |year=1896 |page=124 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16449/16449-h/16449-h.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unicode representation===
Using Unicode characters, the faces &lt;span style="font-size:180%"&gt;⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅&lt;/span&gt;, can be shown in text using the range U+2680 to U+2685 or using decimal &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#9856;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#9861;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dice faces in block Miscellaneous Symbols |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf |work=The Unicode standard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loaded dice==
A loaded, weighted, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for creating loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces and weights. Transparent [[cellulose acetate]] dice are used by casinos as tampering is more apparent than with opaque dice.

==Variants==

===Polyhedral dice===
[[File:Dice (typical role playing game dice).jpg|thumb|right|A typical set of roleplaying dice in various colors. They consist of the five Platonic solids, along with a ten-sided die that is also used for generating percentages.]]
Around the end of the 1960s, non-cubical dice became popular among players of [[Wargaming|wargames]],&lt;ref name="Peterson2012"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jon |last=Peterson |title=Playing at the World: A History of Simulating Wars, People and Fantastic Adventures, from Chess to Role-Playing Games |date=July 2012 |publisher=Unreason Press |isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 |pages=315–318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since have been employed extensively in [[role-playing game]]s and [[collectible card game|trading card games]]. The numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, are distinguished with a dot or underline.

====Standard variations====
{{Further information|isohedral figure{{!}}isohedron}}
Dice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the [[Platonic solid]]s, whose faces are [[regular polygon]]s. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal [[trapezohedron]] die, whose faces are ten [[kite (geometry)|kites]], each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing for a pair of 10-sided dice to generate numbers between 1 and 100.

Using these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate the real probability distributions of the events they simulate. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to [[normal distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |title=Tumbling Dice &amp; Birthdays: Understanding the Central Limit Theorem |publisher=Minitab |first=Michelle |last=Paret |first2=Eston |last2=Martz |year=2009 |accessdate=29 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101141751/http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike other common dice, a [[four-sided die]] does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it has to be read in a different way. Many such dice have the numbers printed around the points, so that when it settles, the numbers at the vertex pointing up are the same and are read. Alternatively, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middles of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are read.

Normally, the faces on a die will be placed so opposite faces will add up to one more than the number of faces (this is not possible with 4-sided dice and dice with an odd-number of faces). Some dice, such as those with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.

| Each face has three numbers,  arranged such that the upright number, placed either near the vertex or near the opposite edge, is the same on all three visible faces. The upright numbers represent the value of the roll. This die does not roll well and thus it is usually thrown into the air instead.

| Each face is a kite. The die has two sharp corners, where five kites meet, and ten blunter corners, where three kites meet. The ten faces usually bear numbers from zero to nine, rather than one to ten (zero being read as "ten" in many applications). Often all [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbered]] faces converge at one sharp corner, and the [[Parity (mathematics)|even]] ones at the other. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is usually 9 (if numbered 0–9) or 11 (if numbered 1–10).

Modern dice with 20 sides are sometimes numbered 0–9 twice as an alternative to 10-sided dice. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 21 if numbered 1–20.
|}

====Rarer variations====
"Uniform fair dice" are dice where all faces have equal probability of outcome due to the symmetry of the die as it is [[isohedral figure|face-transitive]]. Theoretically, this includes:

* [[Platonic solid]]s, the five regular polyhedra: 4, 6, 8, 12, 20 sides
* [[Catalan solid]]s, the [[dual polyhedron|duals]] of the 13 [[Archimedean solid]]s: 12, 24, 30, 48, 60, 120 sides
* [[Bipyramid]]s, the duals of the infinite set of [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]], with triangle faces: any multiple of 4 (so that a face will face up) above 8
* [[Trapezohedron|Trapezohedra]], the duals of the infinite set of [[antiprism]]s, with kite faces: any even number not divisible by 4 (so that a face will face up) above 6
* [[Disphenoid]]s, an infinite set of tetrahedra made from congruent non-regular triangles: 4 sides. This is a less symmetric tetrahedron than the Platonic tetrahedron, but still sufficiently symmetrical to be face-transitive. Similarly, [[Pyritohedron|pyritohedra]] and [[tetartoid]]s are less symmetrical but still face-transitive dodecahedra: 12 sides.

[[Long dice]] can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aleakybos.ch/Properties%20of%20Dice.pdf |title=Properties of Dice |first=Alea |last=Kybos |accessdate=7 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528013233/http://www.aleakybos.ch/Properties%20of%20Dice.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are based on the infinite set of [[prism (geometry)|prisms]]. All the rectangular faces are mutually face-transitive, so they are equally probable. The two ends of the prism may be rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die cannot rest on those faces. 4-sided long dice are easier to roll than tetrahedra, and are used in the traditional board games [[dayakattai]] and [[daldøs]].

===Non-numeric dice===
[[File:White Fudge Dice.jpg|right|thumb|A set of [[Fudge (role-playing game system)|Fudge dice]] ]]
The faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits. However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for [[Boggle]], directions for ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'', [[Fudge (role-playing game system)#Fudge dice|Fudge dice]], playing card symbols for [[poker dice]], and instructions for sexual acts using [[sex dice]].

===Alternatively numbered dice===
Dice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the "average" die.&lt;ref name="em4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.em4miniatures.com/acatalog/SPECIALIST_D6.html|title=Specialist D6|website=em4miniatures|access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tmp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theminiaturespage.com/boards/msg.mv?id=184673|title=[TMP] 'What are Average Dice' Topic|date=20 November 2009|website=The Miniatures Page|language=en|access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are six-sided dice with sides numbered &lt;code&gt;2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5&lt;/code&gt;, which have the same [[arithmetic mean]] as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top [[wargaming|wargames]], where a narrower range of numbers is required.&lt;ref name="tmp" /&gt; Other numbered variations include [[Sicherman dice]] and [[nontransitive dice]].

===Spherical dice===
[[File:Black and red round 6-sided die.jpg|150px|thumb|A spherical die]]
A die can be constructed in the shape of a sphere, with the addition of an internal cavity in the shape of the [[dual polyhedron]] of the desired die shape and an internal weight. The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.

==Applications==
[[Image:Wuerfel5.jpg|thumb|180px|Typical role-playing dice, showing a variety of colors and styles. Note the older hand-inked green 12-sided die (showing an 11), manufactured before pre-inked dice were common. Many players collect or acquire a large number of mixed and unmatching dice.]]
Polyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (D&amp;D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like ''[[Exalted]]'' which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&amp;D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, [[dice notation]] is frequently used.

Many board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as Axis &amp; Allies, have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In Castles of Burgundy, players spend their dice to take actions based on the die's value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In Quarriors (and its descendent, Dicemasters), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/10/02/making-better-use-of-dice-in-g.html|title=Making better use of dice in games|date=2 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dice can be used for [[divination]] and using dice for such a purpose is called [[cleromancy]]. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this [[Mo (divination)|method of divination]]. It is highly likely that the [[Pythagoreans]] used the [[Platonic solids]] as dice. They referred to such dice as "the dice of the gods" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=Kenneth |title=The Pythagorean sourcebook and library: an anthology of ancient writings which relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy |year=1988 |publisher=Phanes Press |location=Grand Rapids, MI |isbn=978-0-933999-50-3 |oclc=255212063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the [[orbital node|nodes]] of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. A specialized icosahedron die provides the answers of the [[Magic 8-Ball]], conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.

Dice can be used to generate random numbers for use in [[Password|passwords]] and [[cryptography]] applications. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] describes a method by which dice can be used to generate [[Passphrase|passphrases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/dice|title=EFF Dice-Generated Passphrases|date=2016-05-12|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notation===
{{Main|Dice notation}}
In many gaming contexts, especially tabletop role-playing games, shorthand notations representing different dice rolls are used. A "d" or "D" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example, &lt;code&gt;d4&lt;/code&gt; denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence, &lt;code&gt;6d8&lt;/code&gt; means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, &lt;code&gt;3d6+4&lt;/code&gt; instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7945">A '''Digital Copy''' is a commercially distributed [[computer file]] containing a media product such as a [[film]] or music [[album]]. The term contrasts this computer file with the [[data storage device|physical copy]] (typically a [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]]) with which the Digital Copy is usually offered as part of a [[product bundle|bundle]]. It allows the disc's purchaser to create a single copy of the film on a computer, and to view it on that computer's display or an external display (e.g. television) connected to that computer. "Digital Copy" is also commonly referred to as "Digital HD" (where it is referencing a [[High-definition video|high-definition]] Digital Copy), or "4K UHD" (in [[4K resolution]] [[ultra high definition]], possibly boxed with a Blu-ray of the same resolution).

==Features==
{{Anchor|Technical details|Features}}
There are two types of Digital Copy. The first is a copy made in advance and included on the disc. The second is created dynamically from the DVD content itself. In both scenarios the publisher decides which content, formats, [[digital rights management]] (DRM) systems and technical parameters are used for the Digital Copy. Digital Copy systems based on existing pregenerated files are less flexible than dynamic [[Transcode|transcoding]] solutions.

Digital Copy files based on existing files include only one audio track and no [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], although the [[DVD]] itself may have multiple audio tracks and multiple [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]. Also, the quality is limited by the [[bit rate|bitrate]] used to encode the file which is typically relatively low and not adjusted to the device to be transferred to.

Digital Copy files based on transcoding solutions can use the correct audio track and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] based on the user's location or choice and individually create the digital copy based on the target device properties (video and audio bitrate, [[display resolution]], [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]).

Most often, Digital Copy solutions offer [[Windows Media]] or [[Apple Inc|Apple]] [[iTunes]] files with their respective [[digital rights management|DRM]] services, [[Windows Media DRM]] and [[FairPlay]]. Other solutions also provide support for [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable]] and phones using [[3GP]] video files and [[Open Mobile Alliance]] DRM. Some publishers limit their digital copies to Microsoft operating systems and devices. Linux-based desktop operating systems are unable to play this content. Apple computers and devices are not supported by their digital solution.

To limit the number of free copies, the disc typically comes with a single-use code to authenticate a computer over the Internet.  Alternatively, content owners can offer the Digital Copy feature as a paid service. Often the authentication code has an expiration date, rendering the copy invalid if it is used after that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

{{Anchor|Critics}}
Technology industry analyst Michael Gartenberg described the Digital Copy initiative as "a smart move" providing an easier alternative to customers compared to converting the files themselves using software such as [[HandBrake]]. Gartenberg was critical of Sony for restricting themselves to files for the PlayStation Portable that were not widely compatible with &lt;!-- iPod --&gt; more popular personal media devices.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{Cite news

Fred von Lohmann of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] described Digital Copy schemes as "stealing your fair use rights and selling them back to you piecemeal", disputing claims by Hollywood studios that it is illegal for customers to rip a personal copy of a DVD to put on a portable video player, even if they own the DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Healey of the [[Los Angeles Times]] pointed out that, with DVDs, consumers were being asked to pay more for uses they had before at no extra cost with CDs and cassette tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of ComputerWorld.com describes Digital Copy as "nonsense, a feature that is no feature at all." He criticizes it as an attempt by the industry to sugar-coat [[Digital rights management|DRM]], complaining that viewers should be able to watch the movie they have bought on any device they want, and that media companies should change their business plans to meet their customers' legitimate needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989)===
{{main|Honey, I Shrunk the Kids}}

Wayne Szalinski ([[Rick Moranis]]) is an eccentric professor who makes a living by inventing machines in his attic while not at work. He lives at home with his wife, Diane ([[Marcia Strassman]]), a real-estate agent, and his two kids, Amy and Nick. He and Diane had an argument a previous night. While she is selling a house, he accidentally shrinks his and the neighbors' ([[Matt Frewer]] and [[Kristine Sutherland]]) kids and sends them to his overgrowing backyard with the trash. They try to make their way across what seems like miles of grass, [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and a [[lawn mower]]. They find their way back to the house and end up going back to normal size.

===''Honey, I Blew Up the Kid'' (1992)===
{{main|Honey, I Blew Up the Kid}}

Wayne has moved the family to Nevada and still invents things. The Szalinski's have a new baby boy, Adam, who is now two years old. Amy is leaving for college and Diane helps her get settled into her dorm, and Nick ([[Robert Oliveri]]) is going crazy over a girl at school named Mandy ([[Keri Russell]]) despite her not noticing. While Wayne is at work, Adam is accidentally zapped by a machine in his lab. Everywhere there is an Electro-Magnetic Flux, he soon grows bigger and bigger and soon heads to the neon lights of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Mandy the babysitter gets mixed up in the crisis and along with Nick gets placed into Adam's Pocket.  Wayne and Diane retrieve the shrinking Machine from the first film, and soon the police, the Federal Marshals, Sterling Labs and other officials take notice and try to help. He is soon back to his normal size again.

===''Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves!'' (1997)===
{{main|Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves}}

Wayne is now banned from using his shrink ray by joint committee of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and Diane ([[Eve Gordon]]). Nick is now away at college and Adam ([[Bug Hall]]) is ten years old. Diane is planning a vacation with Patti ([[Robin Bartlett]]), her sister-in-law, while Wayne and his brother, Gordon ([[Stuart Pankin]]), watch Adam and his cousins ([[Allison Mack]] and [[Jake Richardson]]). While tampering with the shrink ray, Wayne accidentally shrinks himself, Diane, Gordon, and Patti. The kids have a party in the house after thinking they have it to themselves. The adults try their hardest to get the kids' attention and finally do near the end of the movie.

{{main|Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show}}
A [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series was produced in 1997, featuring [[Peter Scolari]] taking on the role of Wayne. The Szalinski family has moved from [[Nevada]] to [[Matheson, Colorado]]. The [[Disney Channel]] picked up the series and produced it until it was cancelled in 2000, due to Disney's unwritten policy of not producing shows after 65 episodes. It was last seen on the air during early mornings in 2004. [[Barbara Alyn Woods]], [[Hillary Tuck]], and [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] also star as Diane, Amy, and Nick Szalinski.

==Theme park attractions==
A 3D attraction called ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience]]'' debuted at [[Epcot]] in 1994 and ran at Disney theme parks until 2010. [[Rick Moranis]], [[Marcia Strassman]], [[Robert Oliveri]], and the Shalikar twins reprise their roles from the films. While being given an award by Dr. Nigel Channing ([[Eric Idle]]) about his shrink ray, Wayne accidentally shrinks the audience and sends them on an adventure with rats, snakes, and babies.

In 1999, ''Journey into Imagination'' was rethemed and featured Dr. Nigel Channing, from ''Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!'', with the purple dragon [[Figment (Disney character)|Figment]] in a show retitled as ''[[Journey into Imagination with Figment]]''. Dr. Channing also hosts an area known as the ''[[Imagination Institute (place)|Imagination Institute]]''. His grandfather created the institute and features Wayne Szalinski and Dr. Philip Brainard (from ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]'') as the recipients of the ''Inventor of the Year'' award. [[Walt Disney]] and [[Thomas Edison]] also make an appearance.

Another attraction, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: Movie Set Adventure]]'', was a playground at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] designed to look like the outdoor backyard of the first film. It closed in 2016.

'''Incantation''' are a musical group playing traditional tribal and other South American music. The [[band (music)|band]] started in 1981 from a pool of musicians who were, at the time, playing all kinds of different types of music for the (then) [[Ballet Rambert]], based in London. A new ballet was [[choreography|choreographed]] (called "Ghost Dances") about political oppression in South America, to the music of [[Inti-Illimani]], the exiled [[Chile]]an [[folk music|folk]] group. The company preferred to use live musicians (rather than tapes) for performances, and six of the musicians volunteered.

Authentic [[musical instrument|instruments]] were procured, and some time was spent perfecting how to play them.

The show was a hit and before long the band was offered a [[recording contract]]. Incantation was chosen as the band's name, based on the word "[[Inca]]". 

Members of the various incarnations of the band include [[Tony Hinnigan]] ([[Scottish people|Scottish]]), Mike Taylor ([[Irish people|Irish]]), Forbes Henderson (English), [[Simon Rogers]] (English), Chris Swithinbank, and Chileans Claudia Figuerora, Sergio Avila and Mauricio Venegas. They achieved [[record chart|chart]] success in the UK in 1982 with the top twenty hit "Cacharpaya", and later contributed the traditional instruments (including [[pan pipes]]) to the [[soundtrack]]s of the [[film]]s, ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'' (1986), scored by [[Ennio Morricone]], and ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'' (1988), scored by [[George Fenton]].

Since 1974, the '''International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo''', known as ''Festival International du Cirque de Monte-Carlo'' in [[French (language)|French]], is an annual festival held in [[Monaco]].&lt;ref name="circusjuventas"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160327124137/https://circusjuventas.org/circus-juventas-in-monte-carlo-2/&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was held in [[Monte-Carlo]], until its permanent venue, Chapiteau (circus tent) de Fontvieille, was completed.&lt;ref name="hellomonaco"&gt;{{cite web  | title       = Awards Galore for the World’s Most Glorious and Glamorous Circus  | url         = https://www.hellomonaco.com/news/awards-galore-for-the-world-s-most-glorious-and-glamorous-circus/  | date        = 2018-11-29  | archiveurl  = http://archive.today/1HxS1  | archivedate = 2018-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Oller''' ('''Josep Oller i Roca''' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) (1839–1922) was a Spanish entrepreneur who lived in Paris for most of his life. He co-founded the famous cabaret [[Moulin Rouge]]&lt;ref name="Joseph Oller, the founder"&gt;{{cite web | title=Joseph Oller, the founder | url=http://www.moulinrouge.fr/vedette/joseph-oller?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Charles Zidler]] and was the inventor of the [[parimutuel betting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Inventor of the "Pari Mutuel" System Of Wagering | url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/historydisplays/SecondFloor/Totalisators/ToteHistory/BookSummary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Terrassa]], Joseph Oller emigrated to [[France]] with his family as a child. Later, he moved back to [[Spain]] to study at the university in [[Bilbao]]. There, he became fond of [[cockfighting]] and started his career as a [[bookmaker]].

Once in Paris, in 1867, Joseph Oller invented a new method of wagering, which he named Pari Mutuel ([[French language|French]] for Parimutuel betting). He successfully introduced his pool method system at French race tracks. Nonetheless, in 1874, Joseph Oller was sentenced to fifteen days in prison and fined for operating illegal gambling. Later, in 1891, the French authorities legalised his system and banned [[fixed-odds betting]]. Quickly, Oller’s Pari Mutuel spread across most [[race tracks]] around the world, but the method was operationalised in engineered systems like that of the [[automatic totalisator]], invented by [[George Alfred Julius]].

In 1870, he moved to London for a while to avoid the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. There he came into contact with the world of the stage.

From 1876, Joseph Oller focused his attention on the [[entertainment industry]]. 
First he opened various auditoriums and venues: Fantaisies Oller, La Bombonnière, Théâtre des Nouveautés, Nouveau Cirque and the Montagnes Russes. 
But it was in 1889, when he inaugurated the famous [[Moulin Rouge]].&lt;ref name="Joseph Oller, the founder"/&gt; In 1892, he opened the first Parisian [[music-hall]]: [[Paris Olympia]] offering new forms of entertainement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=Zv2TvqhPhmMC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=joseph+oller+opened+paris+olympia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H5lxn1wj8A&amp;sig=ozgy4gKHPwBsW1RhbcMbfO6LECo&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMzfOh49bVAhXKSRoKHZYzDu4Q6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20oller%20opened%20paris%20olympia&amp;f=false|title=Chanteuse in the City: The Realist Singer in French Film|last=Conway|first=Kelley|date=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520938571|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

'''''Kusemai''''' (曲舞, くせまい)　is a dance-like art form originating from medieval Japan (roughly, the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] and [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] Periods).  It was particularly popular during Japan’s [[Nanboku-chō period|Nanboku Period]] (CE1336-1392) up through the end of the rest of the [[Muromachi Period]] (CE 1336-1573).  Kusemai is sometimes simply characterized as a [[Japan]]ese form of song and dance with a strong irregular beat - emphasis is placed on the beat at the expense of the melody. 

Kusemai is sometimes referred to in classical and medieval Japanese simply as ''mai'' (舞), or “dance.”  While the modern Japanese [[kanji]] spelling of kusemai is 曲舞, written variants of the ''kanji'' are found in written records as 久世 舞 (kuse-mai) and 九世 舞 (kuse-mai). The “dance,” or pre-arranged physical movements of kusemai, are widely held to be the root of ''[[kōwakamai]]''’s dance-element.&lt;ref&gt;Araki, James T. (1964). "The Ballad-Drama of Medieval Japan. Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of music that accompanies the kusemai performance particularly flourished around [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], in the 14th and 15th centuries. The name can be roughly translated as "peculiar/unconventional dance." Although dance was originally involved with the performance, it was of minor importance, and probably involved the performer simply stamping the beat.

==Summary==
Kusemai’s origins are unknown but it appears to have started in the late 15th to early 16th centuries.  A [[Muromachi Period]] illustration titled ''Shichijuuichi-ban shokunin utaawase'' (七十一番職人歌合) depicts a kusemai performer in contrast to another ''[[shirabyōshi]]'' (白拍子) performer.  Since the garments and musical accompaniment of both kusemai and shirabyōshi, which came about at the end of the [[Heian Period]], are so similar some scholars believe that shirabyōshi is the root of kusemai.&lt;ref&gt;Takayama, Shigeru. (2004). "Kusemai." Shogakkan Nihon Daikyakkuka Zenshuu.  Tokyo: Shogakkan. {{ISBN|4-09-906745-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A kusemai performance consists of a story/narrative tale and rhythmic musical accompaniment.  The performer recites the narrative lines while dancing to the music [performed by separate musicians].  The dancer was either a man or a young boy (''[[chigo]]'', 稚児).

The young boy-dancer costume consisted of ''suikan'' (水干, [[Heian period]]-style garments), ''ōguchi'' (大口, a long, loose fitted, pleated skirt), and tall style ''eboshi'' cap.  Adult male dancers wore warrior-class garments called ''hitatare'' (直垂) in place of suikan.  Dancers also held a folding fan which served as a basic performance prop.&lt;ref&gt;Takayama, Shigeru. (2004). "Kusemai." Shogakkan Nihon Daikyakkuka Zenshuu.  Tokyo: Shogakkan. {{ISBN|4-09-906745-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also performances called ''onna no kusemai'' (女曲舞) or ''jokyokumai'' (女曲舞) in which women wear the male performer’s clothes and perform kusemai.&lt;ref&gt;「舞舞」「舞々」の呼称も確認されている。「口宣舞」の表記もある。高山（2004）など&lt;/ref&gt;

The kusemai “Yamauba” and “Hyakuman” are said to be the oldest performances of kusemai, having been transmitted from time immemorial to the present.  Also, [[kōwakamai]], which is sometimes considered a style of kusemai, is known to have been created sometime in the [[Muromachi Period]] and has been passed down to the present day.

[[File:LunaPark-Charleston-entrance.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Luna Park, Charleston was a popular amusement park from 1912 until its demise in 1923.|Post card picture of the main entrance of '''Luna Park, Charleston'''. After a fire destroyed its roller coaster, the park closed its gates in 1923.]]
'''Luna Park''' was an [[amusement park]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], USA, that was open to the public from 1912 until 1923. Located on the western side of Charleston on the north bank of the [[Kanawha River]],&lt;ref&gt;Ken Sullivan, ''The West Virginia Encyclopedia'' (West Virginia Humanities Council 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; the park was a popular destination that featured a [[roller coaster]], a dance [[pavilion]], a public [[swimming pool]], a [[roller skating|roller rink]], and live entertainment. Admission to the park cost 15 cents per person; a ride on the Royal Giant Dips roller coaster cost [[dime (United States coin)|one dime]] per trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mywvhome.com/1900s/luna.htm Luna Park (Charleston) pictures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gazette-mail.com"&gt;[http://www.gazette-mail.com/News/200808310329 20th Century Images: Cooling off at Luna Park] – Richard Andre, ''[[Charleston Gazette]]'' 1 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[trolley park]] served by the [[Charleston Interurban Railroad Company]].&lt;ref&gt;''McGraw Electric Railway Directory – August 1920'' (McGraw-Hill Publishing Company 1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary attraction at Luna Park was the 45-foot-by-100-foot community swimming pool, which held an estimated 200,000 gallons of water. Unlike most pools of that size, the Luna Park pool was not made of concrete but of “lumber and tin sheet,” according to a report by the state [[Department of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Report of the State Health Department of West Virginia 1920/21'' (State of West Virginia 1921)&lt;/ref&gt; A local newspaper reported in 1913 that 15,000 visited the park in the afternoon, followed by an evening crowd of about 16,000; [[street cars]] were carrying passengers to and from the park at a rate of about 1200 an hour.&lt;ref name="gazette-mail.com"/&gt; Others arrived by [[steamboat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wvgazette.com/Multimedia/topmedia/200910090824 The Way It Was: Luna Park Thriller, 1915]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – ''Charleston Gazette'' 11 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1923, the Royal Giant Dips caught fire and was destroyed along with most of the park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/news_article.html?id=371 Postcards Provide Visits to the Past] – ''[[Charleston Daily Mail]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts by ownership to raise the money to rebuild Luna Park, it was never resurrected. Eventually, single-family housing was constructed on the park grounds.

'''Max Wall''' (12 March 1908 &amp;ndash; 21 May 1990) was an English comedian and actor, whose performing career covered [[music hall]], theatre, films and television.&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9efee33a|title=Max Wall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Wall was born '''Maxwell George Lorimer''', son of the successful [[music-hall]] entertainer [[Jack Lorimer|Jack (Jock) Lorimer]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] comedy actor from [[Forfar]], known for his songs and dancing, and his wife Stella (born Maud Clara Mitchison). He was born near [[the Oval]], at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, [[Brixton Road]], [[London]] SW9. In 1916, during a [[World War I]] air raid, Max and his elder brother Alex were saved from death by a cast iron bed frame, but his younger brother Bunty and their Aunt Betty, who was looking after them, were killed by a bomb dropped from a [[Germany|German]] [[Zeppelin]] which also destroyed their house.&lt;ref name=maxwallsociety&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwallsociety.org/page3.html|title=Max's Life Page 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max and Alex went to live with their father and his family, whilst their mother went to live with Harry Wallace, whom she had met on tour. When their father died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1920, aged 37, their mother married Harry Wallace, and they all moved to a pub in [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;An Audience with Max Wall - BBC Radio 4 - first broadcast 3 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Wall auditioned for a part with a touring theatre company, and made his stage début at the age of 14 as Jack in ''[[Mother Goose]]'' with a travelling [[pantomime]] company in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] featuring [[Pantomime dame|George Lacey]]. In 1925 he was a speciality dancer in the [[London Revue]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]].  He became determined not to rely on his father's name, so abbreviated Maxwell to Max, and his stepfather's name Wallace, to Wall.&lt;ref name=voices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices-of-variety.com/max-wall/ |title=Max Wall |publisher=Voices of Variety |date= |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best remembered for his ludicrously attired and hilariously strutting ''Professor Wallofski''. [[John Cleese]] has acknowledged Wall's influence on his own "[[Ministry of Silly Walks]]" sketch for ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-23/news/mn-33_1_max-wall|title=Max Wall; British Dancer-Comedian Gained Fame in Beckett Plays|first1=From|last1=Staff|first2=Wire|last2=Reports|date=23 May 1990|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing in many [[Musical theatre|musical]]s and stage comedies in the 1930s, Wall's career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure [[nightclub]]s. He then joined the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]] and served for three years until he was invalided out in 1943.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;

Wall married dancer Marion Pola and the couple had five children. In an interview with the family in the mid-1950s, ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' magazine wrote: "The kind of private jokes you find in all the nicest families flourish with the Walls. After Max and his wife, Marion, had their first son, Michael, it seemed kind of natural to make a corner in names beginning with ‘M’, and there are now Melvyn (aged nine), Martin (nearly five) and the four-month-old twins Meredith and Maxine. ... In the same way, because the Walls, like other couples married during the war, were eventually thrilled when they found a house with four walls of their own, they decided to call it just that, only Martin arrived and made it ‘Five Walls’."&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;

In 1955 Wall left Marion and became involved with Jennifer Chimes, that year's [[Miss Great Britain]], who was 26 years his junior and married with children. The couple married in 1956, but the following year Wall collapsed on stage and suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. Jennifer left him, and although there were reconciliations, he divorced Jennifer for desertion in 1962.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;

===Re-emergence===
Wall re-emerged during the 1950s when producers and directors rediscovered his comic talents, along with the expressive power of his tragic clown face and the distinctive sad falling cadences of his voice. He secured television appearances and, having attracted [[Samuel Beckett]]'s attention, he won parts in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in 1979 and ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=page3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwallsociety.org/page3c.html|title=Max's Life Page 4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he appeared as Père Ubu in [[Alfred Jarry|Jarry's]] ''[[Ubu Roi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/support/individual/face-to-face/my-favourite-portrait/my-favourite-portrait-by-bill-paterson.php|title=National Portrait Gallery - My Favourite Portrait by Bill Paterson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1972 he toured with [[Mott the Hoople]] on their "Rock n' Roll Circus Tour", gaining a new audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mottthehoople.com/main/?page_id=103|title=MTH Timeline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His straight acting gained him this review in 1974: "Max Wall makes [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]] look like an amateur in ''The Entertainer'' at Greenwich Theatre...".&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 27 November 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appeared in ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' (as Walter Soper, 1982 to 1983), ''[[Coronation Street]]'' (as Harry Payne, 1978) and what was then ''[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm]]'' (as Arthur Braithwaite, 1978).&lt;ref name=bfi/&gt; He played ex-con Ernie Dodds in ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'' in 1982, with [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b744ba705|title=Birdman of Wormwood Scrubs (1982)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
Wall played one of the inventors in the 1968 film ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' and in 1977 he was seen as King Bruno the Questionable in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s film ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]''.&lt;ref name=bfi/&gt; In the 1970s and 80s, Wall occasionally performed a one-man stage show, ''Aspects of Max Wall'', in which he recaptured the humour of old-time [[music hall]] theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6eede21f|title=Aspects of Max Wall (1975)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1977, Wall's version of [[Ian Dury]]'s song "England's Glory" (which featured in Dury's stage show ''[[Apples (album)|Apples]]'') was issued on [[Stiff Records]] (BUY 12), backed with "Dream Tobacco" and given away with the album ''[[Hits Greatest Stiffs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stiff-records.com/docs/stiff_discography.xls Stiff Records Catalogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143556/http://www.stiff-records.com/docs/stiff_discography.xls |date=16 July 2011 }} Retrieved 6 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Wall also appeared onstage with Dury at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1978, but was poorly received, and said "They only want the walk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Between 1982 and 1984 he appeared as Tombs in the [[BBC Two]] [[Jane (TV series)|adaptation of ''Jane'']] based on the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' [[Jane (comic strip)|comic-strip character]] and filmed with similar "comic-strip frames".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/541765327c81d|title=Jane (1982)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second series his place in the castlist was upgraded to second, after [[Glynis Barber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b730a6350|title=Jane in the Desert (1984)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last film appearance was in 1989 in the 12-minute film ''[[A Fear of Silence]]'', a dark tale of a man who drives a stranger to a confession of murder by answering only "yes" or "no" to his questions; those two words, repeated, were his only dialogue.  The film won a gold award in the ''[[New York International Independent Film and Video Festival|New York Film and TV Festival]]''.&lt;ref name=page3/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:MaxWallGrave.jpeg|thumb|upright|Wall's grave in Highgate Cemetery.]]
On the afternoon of 20 May 1990 Wall fell at [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]] in [[central London]], fracturing his skull. He was conveyed by ambulance to [[Westminster Hospital]] in an unconscious state, but never regained consciousness, and died there early in the next morning, at the age of 82. His body was buried at [[Highgate Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/23/max-wall-dies-comedian-clown|title=Master-clown Max Wall dies - archive, 23 May 1990|first=John|last=Ezard|date=23 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9379|title=Max Wall (1908 - 1990) - Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall was survived by four sons, Michael, Melvyn, Martin and Meredith, and a daughter, Maxine.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

'''''Medea''''' ({{lang-grc|Μήδεια}}, ''Mēdeia'') is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Euripides]], based upon the myth of [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] and first produced in 431 BC. The [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] centers on the actions of Medea, a former princess of the "[[barbarian]]" kingdom of [[Colchis]], and the wife of Jason; she finds her position in the Greek world threatened as Jason leaves her for a Greek princess of [[Corinth]]. Medea takes vengeance on Jason by murdering Jason's new wife as well as her own children, after which she escapes to [[Athens]] to start a new life.

''Medea'' and the suite of plays that it accompanied in the [[City Dionysia]] was not well received at its original performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp |Gregory |2005 |p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=July 2018}} The play was re-discovered in [[Augustan drama]], and again in 16th-century Europe, from which time it remained part of the tragedic repertoire, and became a classic of the [[Western canon]] and has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century. It experienced renewed interest in the [[feminist movement]] of the late 20th century,&lt;ref name=feminist/&gt; being interpreted as a nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of Medea's struggle to take charge of her own life in a male-dominated world.&lt;ref&gt;Helene P. Foley. Reimagining Greek Tragedy on the American Stage. University of California Press, Sep 1, 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The play holds the American Tony award record for most wins for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play#Multiple character wins|same female lead character]], with [[Judith Anderson]] winning in 1948, [[Zoe Caldwell]] in 1982, and [[Diana Rigg]] in 1994.

==History==

''Medea'' was first performed in 431 BC at the [[City Dionysia]] festival. Here every year three playwrights competed against each other, each writing a [[tetralogy]] of three tragedies and a satyr play (alongside ''Medea'' were ''[[Philoctetes (Euripides)|Philoctetes]]'', ''[[Dictys]]'' and the [[satyr play]] ''[[Theristai]]''). In 431 the competition was among [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] (the son of famed playwright [[Aeschylus]]), [[Sophocles]] (Euripides' main rival) and Euripides. Euphorion won, and Euripides placed last.

While ''Medea'' is considered one of the great plays of the [[Western canon]], the Athenian audience did not react so favorably, and it placed third out of the three competing plays at the [[Dionysia]] festival of 431 BC. A possible explanation is found in a [[scholium]] to line 264 of the play, which asserts that Medea's children were traditionally killed by the Corinthians after her escape;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp |Ewans |2007 |p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euripides' apparent invention of Medea's [[filicide]] might have offended its audience just as his [[Hippolytus (play)|first treatment of the Hippolytus myth]] did.&lt;ref&gt;This theory of Euripides' invention has gained wide acceptance. See (e.g.) {{harvp |McDermott |1989 |p=12}}; {{harvp |Powell |1990 |p=35}}; {{harvp |Sommerstein |2002 |p=16}}; {{harvp |Griffiths |2006 |p=81}}; {{harvp |Ewans |2007 |p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That Euripides and others took liberties with Medea's story may be inferred from the 1st century BC historian [[Diodorus Siculus]]: "Speaking generally, it is because of the desire of the tragic poets for the marvellous that so varied and inconsistent an account of Medea has been given out."&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus 4.56&lt;/ref&gt; A common urban legend claimed that Euripides put the blame on Medea because the Corinthians have bribed him with a sum of five talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sententiaeantiquae.com/2017/03/26/korinthian-women-and-the-plot-against-medea/|title=Korinthian Women and the Plot Against Medea|date=26 March 2017|website=Sententiaeantiquae.com|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century BC, South-Italian vase painting offers a number of Medea-representations that are connected to Euripides' play&amp;nbsp;— the most famous is a [[krater]] in Munich. However, these representations always differ considerably from the plots of the play or are too general to support any direct link to the play of Euripides&amp;nbsp;– this might reflect the judgement on the play. However, the violent and powerful character of princess Medea, and her double nature&amp;nbsp;— both loving and destructive&amp;nbsp;— became a standard for the later periods of antiquity and seems to have inspired numerous adaptations.

With the rediscovery of the text in [[Augustan drama|1st-century Rome]] (the play was adapted by the tragedians [[Ennius]], [[Lucius Accius]], [[Ovid]], [[Seneca the Younger]] and [[Hosidius Geta]], among others), again in 16th-century Europe.

In  20th-century modern [[literary criticism]], ''Medea'' and its "universal themes of [[revenge]] and [[justice]] in an unjust society" have provoked differing reactions from differing critics and writers.{{huh|date=July 2018}}

==Form and themes==

The form of the play differs from many other Greek tragedies by its simplicity: All scenes involve only two actors, Medea and someone else. The Chorus (A staple in Greek theater) would also usually be involved along with those two, representing the women of Corinth. These encounters serve to highlight Medea's skill and determination in manipulating powerful male figures to achieve her own ends. The play is also the only Greek tragedy in which a kin-killer makes it unpunished to the end of the play, and the only one about child-killing in which the deed is performed in cold blood as opposed to in a state of temporary madness.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Edith. 1997. "Introduction" in ''Medea: Hippolytus ; Electra ; Helen'' Oxford University Press. pp. ix–xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euripides' characterization of Medea exhibits the inner emotions of passion, [[love]], and [[Revenge|vengeance]].

==Plot==

''Medea'' is centered on a wife’s calculated desire for revenge against her unfaithful husband. The play is set in [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] some time after Jason's quest for the [[Golden Fleece]], where he met Medea. The play begins with Medea in a blind rage towards Jason for arranging to marry [[Glauce]], the daughter of [[Creon (king of Corinth)]]. The nurse, overhearing Medea’s grief, fears what she might do to herself or her children.

Creon, in anticipation of Medea’s wrath, arrives and reveals his plans to send her into exile. Medea pleads for one day’s delay and eventually Creon acquiesces. In the next scene Jason arrives to explain his rationale for his apparent betrayal. He explains that he couldn’t pass up the opportunity to marry a royal princess, as Medea is only a barbarian woman, but hopes to someday join the two families and keep Medea as his mistress. Medea, and the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of Corinthian women, do not believe him. She reminds him that she left her own people for him (''"I am the mother of your children. Whither can I fly, since all Greece hates the barbarian?"''), and that she saved him and slew the dragon. Jason promises to support her after his new marriage, but Medea spurns him: ''"Marry the maid if thou wilt; perchance full soon thou mayst rue thy nuptials."''

In the following scene Medea encounters [[Aegeus]], [[King of Athens]]. He reveals to her that despite his marriage he is still without children. He visited the [[oracle]] who merely told him that he was instructed “not to unstop the wineskin’s neck.” Medea relays her current situation to him and begs for Aegeus to let her stay in [[Athens]] if she gives him drugs to end his infertility. Aegeus, unaware of Medea’s plans for revenge, agrees.

Medea then returns to plotting the murders of Glauce and Creon. She decides to poison some golden robes (a family heirloom and gift from the sun god [[Helios]]) and a coronet, in hopes that the bride will not be able to resist wearing them, and consequently be poisoned. Medea resolves to kill her own children as well, not because the children have done anything wrong, but because she feels it is the best way to hurt Jason. She calls for Jason once more and, in an elaborate ruse, apologizes to him for overreacting to his decision to marry Glauce. When Jason appears fully convinced that she regrets her actions, Medea begins to cry in mourning of her exile. She convinces Jason to allow her to give the robes to Glauce in hopes that Glauce might get Creon to lift the exile. Eventually Jason agrees and allows their children to deliver the poisoned robes as the gift-bearers.

{{quote|Forgive what I said in anger! I will yield to the decree, and only beg one favor, that my children may stay. They shall take to the princess a costly robe and a golden crown, and pray for her protection.}}

[[File:Medeia child Louvre K300.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Medea kills her son, [[Campania]]n red-figure [[amphora]], c. 330 BC, [[Louvre]] (K 300).]]

In the next scene a messenger recounts Glauce and Creon’s deaths. When the children arrived with the robes and coronet, Glauce gleefully put them on and went to find her father. Soon the poisons overtook Glauce and she fell to the floor, dying horribly and painfully. Creon clutched her tightly as he tried to save her and, by coming in contact with the robes and coronet, got poisoned and died as well.

{{quote|Alas! The bride had died in horrible agony; for no sooner had she put on Medea's gifts than a devouring poison consumed her limbs as with fire, and in his endeavor to save his daughter the old father died too.}}

While Medea is pleased with her current success she decides to take it one step forward. Since Jason brought shame upon her for trying to start a new family, Medea resolves to destroy the family he was willing to give up by killing their sons. Medea does have a moment of hesitation when she considers the pain that her children’s deaths will put her through. However, she steels her resolve to cause Jason the most pain possible and rushes offstage with a knife to kill her children. As the chorus laments her decision, the children are heard screaming. Jason then rushes onto the scene to confront Medea about murdering Creon and Glauce and he quickly discovers that his children have been killed as well. Medea then appears above the stage with the bodies of her children in the chariot of the sun god [[Helios]]. When this play was put on, this scene was accomplished using the ''[[mechane]]'' device usually reserved for the appearance of a god or goddess. She confronts Jason, reveling in his pain at being unable to ever hold his children again:

{{quote|I do not leave my children's bodies with thee; I take them with me that I may bury them in [[Hera]]'s precinct. And for thee, who didst me all that evil, I prophesy an evil doom.}}

She escapes to Athens with the bodies. The chorus is left contemplating the will of [[Zeus]] in Medea's actions:

{{quote|Manifold are thy shapings, [[Divine Providence|Providence]]! / Many a hopeless matter gods arrange / What we expected never came to pass / What we did not expect the gods brought to bear / So have things gone, this whole experience through!}}

==History==

===Background and early history===
{{unreferenced section | date= March 2013}}
Previously, movies on television were usually low-cost [[B film]]s or older films that the major studios or producers no longer found suitable for theatrical presentation. In the earliest years of television, major studios wouldn't release films to television; by the late 1950s, however, major studios began making movies available to the new medium, but a gentleman's agreement between the top studios kept movies made after 1948 by major studios off of the home screen. Movie audiences had grown to expect films to be shown in [[widescreen]] and in color, so older black-and-white [[Academy ratio]] films had lost much of their value to the theatres. By the late-1950s, with the exception of some of [[Walt Disney]]'s films and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939),  these older films had become standard fare for independent stations and the non-prime time schedules of the network affiliates.

Up until the early 1970s, the time span between a film's theatrical release and its appearance on commercial network television was much longer. Whereas today it can take as brief a period as three years before a theatrical film shows up on commercial television, between 1954 and 1972 a theatrical motion picture (even a relatively recent one) usually had to wait as many as twelve years (as in the case of the 1959 ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'') before it turned up on the home screen.

A short-lived [[black-and-white]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] series entitled ''[[Famous Film Festival]]'' had premiered in the fall of 1955, but had shown British films made in the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1957, ABC broadcast ''[[Hollywood Film Theater]]'', which also featured some pre-1948 films produced by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. RKO decided to sell some of their "better" pre-1948 movies to ABC while other films would be syndicated to local TV stations. Films in both series were shown in a ninety-minute time slot, which meant that some of the films had to either be severely edited or shown in two parts. ''NBC Saturday Night at the Movies'' was the first network movie anthology series to run two hours (and occasionally longer), so that almost all of the films could be shown in one evening, and edited (especially in later years) only to remove objectionable content.

For its 1961 television season, [[NBC]] obtained the rights to broadcast 31 post-1950 movie titles from [[20th Century Fox]], although only 30 were actually telecast that season. One film, ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'', was held off by the network until the start of the 1963 season. On September 23, 1961, ''Saturday Night at the Movies'' premiered with the 1953 [[Marilyn Monroe]] - [[Lauren Bacall]] - [[Betty Grable]] film ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', presented "In Living Color". Some of the other movies shown were ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (March 3, 1962) and ''[[No Highway in the Sky]]'' (March 24, 1962).  Many of these films, having been made in [[Cinemascope]], a Fox specialty from 1953 to 1967, had to be severely [[pan and scan|panned-and-scanned]] for [[4:3|fullscreen]] television viewing (which was the only kind of television aspect ratio in existence then).  That initial deal with Fox ended up lasting three seasons (1961-64) with a total of around 90 films, including those run on Monday nights beginning in February 1963.  And when the studio found greener pastures over at rival [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the network found releases from studios such as [[MGM]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] eager to provide content.  Because commercial breaks were shorter than today (running from one minute to a maximum of two), films running less than two hours sometimes ended before the close of the program. The remaining time was filled up with [[theatrical trailer]]s of upcoming films scheduled to be shown on the series in the next two or three weeks. By about 1968, this was no longer necessary, as films and commercial breaks had become longer.

The three major commercial networks did not show worn-out 16&amp;nbsp;mm prints of films as was then the usual practice on local TV stations. The films which aired on the network movie anthology series (as well as annually-telecast specials such as ''The Wizard of Oz'') were 35mm prints invariably in excellent condition.  With the advent of cable television, VHS, and DVD, the idea of always showing films - even very old ones - in pristine, remastered condition on television has become the norm, but aside from films shown on the three major networks, this was simply not done prior to the 1980s. Up until then local stations had to settle for inexpensive 16&amp;nbsp;mm prints of such relatively recent films as ''[[Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison]]'' (1957) or ''[[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]]'' (1954), rather than good "theater-quality" prints as seen on the networks. Unlike the major networks, nearly all local stations used 16&amp;nbsp;mm film chains.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===The birth of the "made for TV movie"===
{{unreferenced section | date= March 2013}}
With the demand for movies increasing during the 1960s, [[Television movie|made-for-television film]]s would soon be created by NBC, along with some help from now-[[NBCUniversal|sister company]] [[Universal Studios|Universal]]. The first, made during the 1963–64 season, was to have been a new version of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' with [[Lee Marvin]], [[Angie Dickinson]] and future US President [[Ronald Reagan]], but NBC deemed the film too violent for television, so it was released in [[Movie theater|theater]]s instead.  It was Reagan's last film before he entered [[politics]].

Although there had been filmed feature-length television specials such as ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), a 1960 [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] ''[[Macbeth (1960 American film)|Macbeth]]'' filmed in color on location in [[Scotland]], and, as early as 1954, a filmed musical version in color of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' telecast on CBS's ''[[Shower of Stars]]'',  the film generally regarded as the first made-for-television movie was ''[[See How They Run (1964 film)|See How They Run]]'', directed by [[David Lowell Rich]] and starring [[John Forsythe]] and [[Senta Berger]].  It first aired on October 7, 1964 and ushered in a series of other TV-movies over the years, aired on NBC under the title '''''NBC World Premiere Movie'''''.  Many of the made-for-television movies on NBC would become TV series in their own right during the late-1960s and early-1970s.  One of the more famous examples was ''[[Fame Is the Name of the Game]]'' (1966), which ultimately served as the [[TV pilot|pilot episode]] for the 1968–71 series ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]''.

===Influence on other networks===
{{unreferenced section | date= March 2013}}
'''''Saturday Night at the Movies''''' attracted sufficient ratings so that NBC and its competitors added more movie series to the prime time schedule. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], then a distant third in the ratings, immediately added another movie series, ''Hollywood Special'', as a mid-season replacement; however, the series, under its new title ''[[The ABC Sunday Night Movie]]'', did not become a regular television program until 1964. [[CBS]] was leading the other networks in the ratings at that time and did not immediately add a prime time movie series. However, over the next few years, each of the three networks added weeknight movies to the schedule and by 1968, there was a prime time network movie for every night of the week:

* ''[[The ABC Sunday Night Movie]]''
* ''[[The NBC Monday Movie]]'' (originally titled ''NBC Monday Night at the Movies'')
* ''NBC Tuesday Night at the Movies''
* ''The ABC Wednesday Night Movie''
* ''The CBS Wednesday Night Movies''
* ''[[CBS Thursday Night Movie|The CBS Thursday Night Movies]]''
* ''The CBS Friday Night Movies''
* ''The CBS Saturday Night Movies''
* ''NBC Saturday Night at the Movies''
* ''The CBS Sunday Night Movies''
* ''NBC Friday Night at the Movies
The popularity of these movie broadcasts also provided a windfall profit to the movie studios, since competitive bidding for popular movies raised the price for broadcast rights. This, in turn, made it cost effective to produce [[Television movie|"made for TV" movies]].

This trend continued and reached its peak in the mid-1970s, when there were 11 or more movies in the weekly network schedule - though some of the "movies" (like ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'') were actually just a regular television series with longer episodes.

Fox Network had also begun to air films in prime time, as the network has gained more and more popularity with its all-time longest running hit, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', but like the "Big Three" networks, Fox also has since cancelled its movie series.

As opposed to ABC, NBC and CBS, Fox aired its movies primarily on Tuesday nights at 7:00 Eastern, though sometimes due to a news broadcast or game, the day of a broadcast might have been changed.

===Announcers===
{{unreferenced section | date= March 2013}}
Announcing of [[opening credits]] and [[Commercial bumper|bumper]]s for '''''NBC Saturday Night at the Movies''''' was handled mainly out of [[NBC Studios (Burbank)|NBC's Burbank studios]]. For years, the main [[announcer]] was [[Don Stanley (announcer)|Don Stanley]]. In later years, he alternated with [[Donald Rickles (announcer)|Donald Rickles]], [[Peggy Taylor]] and [[Victor Bozeman]]. Near the end of '''''Saturday Night at the Movies'''''' run, opening credits (for the series, not for the films themselves) would be handled by members of [[NBC Studios (New York)|the network's New York announcing staff]], including Fred Collins and [[Howard Reig]], though the Burbank staff announcers still handled bumpers. At the beginning the announcer would say something like{{weasel-inline|date=March 2013}}: "''NBC Saturday Night at the Movies'', a series featuring motion pictures appearing on television for the first time. Tonight..." or "''NBC Saturday Night at the Movies'', the television series which each week brings you the finest in recent motion pictures. Tonight..." Following this, the film's title and its stars would be identified. The program would then go into a commercial, and then the film would begin. The opening and closing credits for the actual films would be shown exactly as they appeared when the films were shown in theatres, not in a revised format as was done on ''The ABC Sunday Night Movie''.

As with the other movie anthology series of the time, there was no host for the program. Although an announcer's voice was heard at the beginning, the program itself simply consisted of the showing of the film and perhaps a [[movie trailer]] afterward.

===Decline and later years===
{{refimprove | section, except for one footnote, | date= May 2013}}
NBC broadcast '''''Saturday Night at the Movies''''' until 1978. It ran until at least October 28. Some of the other movie series on television were also cancelled by the end of the decade.  However, some continued well into the 1980s and even beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080314052510/http://www.getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt http://www.getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt] (Cached by the [[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in television viewing habits, though, seemed to spell the end for many of these series. Loss of ratings for them has been attributed to increased competition from cable television, especially pay movie channels that were able to show the movies uncut and without commercial interruptions. Other factors that have led to the decline of the TV network movie presentations include the advent of home video and video rental, pay-per-view and video on demand.

The '''''[[NBC]] Saturday Night Movie''''' has been periodically broadcast on the [[namesake]] [[United States|American]] [[television network]] on Saturdays 8:00 p.m.&amp;ndash;11:00 p.m. from 2000 on, and originally had interstitials hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nbc-announces-the-premiere-of-the-nbc-saturday-night-movie-featuring-the-13-million-log-on-and-win-contest-on-nbcicom-74762257.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by coverage of the [[XFL]] in 2001, but returned the next year without host continuity, and by 2006 the network decided to only occasionally air theatrical films during sweeps weeks in various timeslots, so the Saturday movie has been completely discontinued. In 2009 and 2010, [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] purchased some Friday and Saturday night time on NBC and Fox to broadcast television films they produced such as ''[[The Jensen Project]]'', though the ratings for these films were well below regular programming and like strategies pursued by [[Mattel]] with [[Nickelodeon]] with the [[Barbie (film series)|Barbie series of films]], mainly aired to sell those films on DVD in-store. The P&amp;G/Wal-Mart series of films was eventually discontinued, with Wal-Mart eventually being one of the main sponsors of NBC's live musical event ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]'' in December 2013.

===2000s-2010s===
{{unreferenced section | date= March 2013}}
Occasionally, any one of the major commercial networks still observes the time-honored custom of showing a recent box office and critical smash as a movie special. This pre-empts regular programming, as CBS did on Sunday, May 20, 2007, with a three-hour commercial network telecast of ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'', and as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] did on September 14, 2009 with the first commercial television showing of ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''.  Such showings often occur during [[sweeps]], in an effort to boost a network's viewer ratings.

Since the late 2000s, film rights purchased earlier in the decade by broadcast networks have mainly been [[burning off|burned off]] on Saturday nights or other unusual timeslots such as Sunday afternoon for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], with only a few select event films such as ''The Sound of Music'', ''Titanic'' and ''The Ten Commandments'' remaining annually broadcast by networks, as cable networks such as [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]/[[FXX]], [[USA Network]], [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]/[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[Comedy Central]] have taken the market for major network film premieres.

'''''Neopets''''' (originally ''NeoPets'') is a [[virtual pet site|virtual pet website]]. Users can own virtual pets ("Neopets"), and buy virtual items for them using one of two [[virtual currency|virtual currencies]]. One currency, called Neopoints, can be earned within the site, and the other, Neocash, can either be purchased with real-world money, or won by chance in-game.

The website was launched by [[Adam Powell (game designer)|Adam Powell]] and Donna Williams in late 1999. Two years later, a consortium of investors led by [[Doug Dohring]] bought a controlling interest in the company and in June 2005, [[Viacom]] bought ''Neopets'' Inc. for [[United States dollar|US$]]160 million.&lt;ref name="Viacom" /&gt; On March 17, 2014, Viacom sold Neopets to [[Knowledge Adventure]] for an unannounced amount.

==Gameplay==
''Neopets'' allows users to create and care for [[digital pet]]s called "Neopets" and explore the [[virtual world]] of Neopia. There is no set objective for the users, but they are expected to feed and care for their Neopets when they grow hungry or ill. Neopets will not die if neglected, but their health can limit their gameplay.&lt;ref name="Wingfield" /&gt; Neopets come in a variety of species and colors and users can create or adopt their own. Users can obtain items to interact with their Neopet, such as books to read and toys to play with them. Neopets can be customised with certain clothing items, paint brushes, transformation potions, and accessories. Users can build a customisable Neohome for their Neopets and furnish it with furniture, wallpaper, and flooring. Neopets can battle against other Neopets or [[non-player character]]s in the Battledome but they cannot die there.

[[Image:neohome.jpg|right|210px|thumb|A customisable Neohome.]]

Neopia is a virtual planet with fantasy lands inhabited by Neopets and other virtual creatures. Each land has a different theme, such as [[Pirates in popular culture|pirates]] or [[prehistory]], and their own shops, games, and attractions.&lt;ref name="Baybak" /&gt; Neopia follows its own [[Gregorian calendar|calendar]] and [[time zone]], which runs concurrent with real-world [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]],&lt;ref name="NT285" /&gt; and has tie-ins with certain real world holidays such as [[Halloween]] and [[Christmas]]. It has its own [[economy]] and [[stock market]] based on Neopoints. Users can earn Neopoints through various means including playing games and selling items, which can be invested or used to buy various virtual goods and services.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; While there is no set objective for users, interactive storylines are sometimes released that introduce changes to the planet such as new lands.

The site is regularly updated with features like new games, items and content. In addition to the site content updated by the ''Neopets'' staff members, users also contribute [[user-generated content|content]] to the site.&lt;ref name="NeopetsFAQ" /&gt; User contributions come in the form of prescreened submissions and readily editable content that is automatically [[wordfilter|filtered]], such as the site's weekly electronic newspaper ''The Neopian Times''. There are different types of submissions that will be accepted.&lt;ref name="compback" /&gt;

===Games===
Users can earn Neopoints from playing games. Games come in many different genres, which include action, puzzles, and luck &amp; chance. Most games have a set maximum earnings or playtime. Players may also earn trophies and other awards from games if they [[highscore|score high enough]] or perform better than other users. Many [[Games#single-player games|single-player]] and [[multiplayer game|multi-player]] [[browser games]] are available. Users can also participate in contests and spotlights judged by staff to showcase the users' talents. Quests to retrieve items may also be performed for specific [[non-player characters|NPCs]]. Challenges may be made against other players or random players in a "World Challenge" for a prize piece and Neopoints from the jackpot for certain [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games. Monthly competitions also exist for multiplayer games with four week-long elimination rounds.&lt;ref name="Contests" /&gt;

===Economy===
The [[economy]] is based on Neopoints. Users can also exchange real money for Neocash, used exclusively for the NC Mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=303 |title=Editorial |accessdate = 2007-09-10 |date=2007-08-03 |work=[[Neopian Times]] |publisher=[[Neopets, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can earn Neopoints through playing games, selling items, and other transactions.&lt;ref name="Ito"/&gt; Once earned, they can be saved in the bank, used to buy items from other users or [[non-player character]] (NPC) shops, used to buy and sell stocks in the Neopian [[stock market]] called the [[NASDAQ|NEODAQ]], or used to buy various other things.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Items can be bought from shops found throughout the world of Neopia that are run by NPCs who may allow [[bargaining]]. Users can open their own shops to sell items, sometimes after obtaining those items at a lower price from sources such as other shops or charities. Items may also be exchanged through trade or auction.

===Community===
''Neopets'' has a community for users to chat with and contact other users. Each user has their own profile they can edit with [[HTML]] and [[CSS]] and are represented by [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] provided by the website, as users cannot upload their own. Most avatars must be "unlocked" by completing certain in-game tasks, such as winning a contest or getting a high score on a game.&lt;ref&gt;"Neopets Avatar Solutions. '' Jellyneo. '' Retrieved from http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=avatars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Users may request other users to be "Neofriends" or block other users from contacting them. To comply with [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act|COPPA]], users under 13 years of age cannot access any of the site's communication features without sending in parental consent via fax.&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt; The main features include:

* NeoMail, a personal in-game communication system like regular [[email]]. Users can write messages to other users and restrict who can contact them through NeoMail.
* Neoboards, public [[Internet forum|discussion boards]] for on-topic discussions. Users can enter their own "neoHTML", a restricted form of [[BBCode]], to customise their posts and signatures.
* Guilds, groups of users with similar interests and their own message board.

Discussions through these features are restricted and may not involve topics such as dating and romance or controversial topics like politics and religion. Continuous [[Forum moderator|moderation]] is performed by paid ''Neopets'' staff members, and users can help moderate the site by reporting messages they believe are inappropriate or offensive. Messages are also automatically [[wordfilter|filtered]] to prevent users from posting messages with profanity or lewd content.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt;

==History and background==
===Creation and growth===
''Neopets'' was conceived in 1997 by [[Adam Powell (game designer)|Adam Powell]], a [[British people|British]] student at the [[University of Nottingham]] at the time. He shared this idea with Donna Williams and the two started work on the site in September 1999, with Powell responsible for the programming and the database and Williams the web design and art. The site launched on November 15, 1999 from offices in Portsmouth Road, [[Guildford]], a location still commemorated on the site.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neocam" /&gt; Powell stated that the original goal was to "keep university students entertained, and possibly make some cash from banner advertising".&lt;ref name="Headon" /&gt; The site contained [[popular culture]] references, such as a Neopet that was simply a picture of [[Bruce Forsyth]].&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt;

The user base grew by [[word of mouth]] and by [[Christmas]] 1999, ''Neopets'' was logging 600,000 [[page view]]s daily and sought investors to cover the high cost of running the site. Later in the month, [[Americans|American]] businessman [[Doug Dohring]] was introduced to the creators of the site and, along with other investors, bought a majority share in January of the following year.&lt;ref name="Weintraub" /&gt; Dohring founded ''Neopets, Inc.'' in February 2000 and began business April 28. [[Intellectual property]] that did not belong to ''Neopets'' were removed but the site kept the [[American and British English spelling differences|British spellings]].&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt; The website made money from the first paying customers using an advertising method trademarked as "[[#Immersive advertising|immersive advertising]]"&lt;ref name="Weintraub"/&gt; and touted as "an evolutionary step forward in the traditional marketing practice of [[product placement]]" in television and film.&lt;ref name="immersive" /&gt; In 2004, ''Neopets'' released a premium version and started showing advertisements on the basic site that are not shown to premium members.&lt;ref name="González" /&gt;

===Viacom era===
[[Media conglomerate]] [[Viacom]] purchased ''Neopets, Inc.'' on June 20, 2005 for $160 million and announced plans to focus more on the use of [[banner ad]]s over the site's existing immersive advertising.&lt;ref name="Viacom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Myerhoff" /&gt; The website was redesigned on April 27, 2007 and included changes to the user interface and the ability to customise Neopets.&lt;ref name="nf070423" /&gt; In June, Viacom promoted ''Neopets'' through [[interstitial program|minishows]] on [[Nickelodeon]]. Promotions included the second Altador Cup and led to an increase in traffic through the site.&lt;ref name="González" /&gt; The first Altador Cup was released as an international online gaming event to coincide with the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]&lt;ref name="Altador Cup" /&gt; to improve interactivity between users and had 10.4 million participants the first year.&lt;ref name="Minishow" /&gt; On July 17, the NC Mall was launched in a partnership with Korean gaming company [[Nexon Corporation]]. It allowed users to use real money to purchase Neocash to buy exclusive virtual items.&lt;ref name="Nexon" /&gt; On June 17, 2008, Viacom formed the [[Nickelodeon Kids &amp; Family Virtual Worlds Group]] to "encompass all paid and subscription gaming initiatives across all relevant platforms", including ''Neopets''.&lt;ref name="Nick Kids" /&gt; By June 2011, ''Neopets'' announced that the website had logged 1 trillion page views since its creation.&lt;ref name="nf110613" /&gt;

In July 2009, the ''Neopets'' site was the target of an [[identity theft]] hacking scheme that attempted to trick users into clicking a link that would allow them to gain items or Neopoints. Upon doing so, [[malware]] was installed onto the user's computer. According to reports, the hack was aimed not at child players' ''Neopets'' accounts, but at using the malware to steal the financial data and identities of their parents. Viacom stated that it was investigating the issue, and that the hack was a version of [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] rather than an "indictment of Neopets security practices".&lt;ref name="ID theft" /&gt; In an on-site newsletter for players, ''Neopets'' denied the report and claimed that the site's security measures prevented the posting of such links.&lt;ref name="NT400" /&gt;

===JumpStart era===
[[JumpStart]] acquired Neopets from [[Viacom]] in April 2014. Server migration began in September. JumpStart-owned Neopets was immediately characterized by glitches and site lag. On 6 March 2015, much of the Neopets Team remaining from Viacom were laid off.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?comments=10057&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 2017, Chinese company [[NetDragon Websoft|NetDragon]] acquired JumpStart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netdragon-acquires-jumpstart-to-expand-its-online-communities-300483164.html|title=NetDragon Acquires JumpStart to Expand Its Online Communities|last=Limited|first=NetDragon Websoft Holdings|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable Events===
====Chat filters broken====
On the weekend of 27–28 June 2015, the site's chat filters, designed to prevent adult language and content, stopped working. The site's forums and other user-edited spaces were flooded with adult content and obscene images.&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/neopets-community-melts-down-eat-my-ho-butt-1714610137&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement on [[Facebook]], JumpStart apologized, explaining that the issue was due to a "facility move," and that during that move, the moderation team was not able to access the Neopets community.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Neopets/posts/10153297122846005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data Breach====
In 2016, Motherboard reported that the login data of 70 million Neopets accounts was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpvw7/neopets-hack-another-day-another-hack-tens-of-millions-of-neopets-accounts|title=Another Day, Another Hack: Tens of Millions of Neopets Accounts}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained not only usernames and passwords but also email addresses, birth dates, IP addresses, and PINs. It turned out this information was being stored in plain text by Neopets and had first been retrieved in 2012; every single account created prior to that year was affected. Neopets responded by posting about the leak on their official Facebook page and sent emails out to all affected players telling them to change their passwords.

==Reception==
''Neopets'' is consistently one of the "[[sticky content|stickiest]]" sites for children's entertainment. Stickiness is a measure of the average amount of time spent on a website. A press release from ''Neopets'' in 2001 stated that Neopets.com led in site "stickiness" in May and June, with the average user spending 117&amp;nbsp;minutes a week.&lt;ref name="yahoo4" /&gt; ''Neopets'' also led in the average number of hours spent per user per month in December 2003 with an average of 4 hours and 47&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; A 2004 article stated that [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen//NetRatings]] reported that people were spending around three hours a month on ''Neopets'', more than any other site in its Nielsen category.&lt;ref name="Eckstein" /&gt; By May 2005, a ''Neopets''-affiliated video game producer cited about 35 million unique users, 11 million unique IP addresses per month, and 4 billion web page views per month. This producer also described 20% of the users as 18 or older, with the median of the remaining 80% at about 14.&lt;ref name="Gamespot" /&gt; ''Neopets'' was consistently ranked among the top ten "stickiest" sites by both Nielsen//NetRatings and [[comScore|comScore Media Metrix]] in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref name="dmwmedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaudiosi" /&gt; According to Nielsen//NetRatings, in 2007, ''Neopets'' lost about 15% of its audience over the previous year.&lt;ref name="mediaweek" /&gt; In February 2008, comScore ranked it as the stickiest kids entertainment site with the average user spending 2 hours and 45&amp;nbsp;minutes per month.&lt;ref name="prnewswire" /&gt;

Described as an online cross of ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Tamagotchi]]'',&lt;ref name="Headon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weintraub"/&gt; ''Neopets'' has received both praise and criticism. It has been praised for having educational content. Children can learn [[HTML]] to edit their own pages.&lt;ref name="Boese" /&gt; They can also learn how to handle money by participating in the economy.&lt;ref name="commonsensemedia" /&gt; Reviews from [[About.com]] and MMO Hut considered the multitude of possible activities a positive aspect.&lt;ref name="About.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MMO Hut"/&gt; [[Women and video games|Most of the users are female]], higher than in other [[massively multiplayer online game]]s (MMOGs) but equivalent to [[social-networking]]-driven communities.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NextGen" /&gt; Lucy Bradshaw, a vice president of [[Electronic Arts]], attributes the popularity among girls to the openness of the site and said, "Games that have a tendency to satisfy on more than one dimension have a tendency to have a broader appeal and attract girls".&lt;ref name="Ha" /&gt;

Luck &amp; chance games draw criticism from parents as they introduce children to gambling. In Australia, a cross-[[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] with [[McDonald's]] led to controversy with ''Neopets''' luck/chance games in October 2004. Australian [[tabloid television]] show ''[[Today Tonight]]'' featured a nine-year-old boy who claimed the site requires one to [[gamble]] in order to earn enough Neopoints to feed one's Neopet or else it would be sent to the [[animal pound|pound]].&lt;ref name="Wenn" /&gt; While gambling is not required, nor are pets sent to the pound if unfed, the website includes games of chance based on real games such as [[blackjack]] and lottery [[scratchcard]]s. After this incident, ''Neopets'' prohibited users under the age of 13 from playing most games that involve gambling.&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt;

===Immersive advertising===
{{see also|Interactive advertising}}
Immersive advertising is a trademarked term for the way ''Neopets'' displayed advertisements to generate profit after Doug Dohring bought the site.&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt; Unlike [[Pop-up ad|pop-up]] and [[banner ad]]s, immersive ads integrate advertisements into the site's content [[interactive advertising|in interactive forms]], including games and items. Players could earn Neopoints from them by playing [[advergames]] and taking part in online marketing surveys. Prior to the arrival of the NC Mall, it contributed to 60% of the revenue from the site&lt;ref name="Wingfield" /&gt; with paying [[Fortune 1000]] companies including [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[General Mills]], and [[McDonald's]].&lt;ref name="Fonda" /&gt;

It was a contentious issue with the site with regard to the [[Marketing ethics#Market audience|ethics of marketing to children]]. It drew criticism from parents, psychologists, and consumer advocates who argued that children may not know that they are being advertised to, as it blurred the line between site content and advertisement. Children under eight had difficulty recognizing ads and half a million of the 25 million users were under the age of eight in 2005.&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonda" /&gt; Dohring responded to such criticism stating that of the 40 percent of users twelve and younger, very few were seven or eight years old and that preschoolers were not their target audience.&lt;ref name="Fehrenbacher" /&gt;

Others criticised the functionality of the site. Susan Linn, another psychologist and author of ''Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood'' considered the purpose of this site was to keep children in front of advertisements.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; [[Kalle Lasn]], editor-in-chief and co-founder of ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine, said the site encouraged kids to spend hours in front of a screen and recruited them to [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt; ''Neopets'' executives stated that paid content comprised less than 1% of the site's total content.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; Children were not required to play or use sponsor games and items, and all ads were marked as such.&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonda" /&gt;

After Neopets was purchased by Viacom, and due to criticism towards the immersive advertising model, [[banner advertisements]] and other more clear-cut forms of advertising were integrated into the site. Neocash (discussed elsewhere in this article) was also introduced as an additional revenue source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Terrance|first1=Allen|title=Neopets Information|url=http://neopointsale.com/neopets-information-ezp-12.html|publisher=Neopoint Sale|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchandise==
The popularity of ''Neopets'' spawned real-world merchandise including stickers, books, cereals, [[video game]]s and more, sold at mainstream outlets and online retailers. The most common items were plushies (stuffed animals).&lt;ref&gt;"Neopets products." Neopets. Retrieved from http://www.neopets.com/shopping/index.phtml&lt;/ref&gt; Each piece of merchandise has a code which can be redeemed at the site for an in-game reward. ''Neopets, Inc.'' had always planned to "bring the online and offline worlds together in ways that have never been done before".&lt;ref name="toymania" /&gt; An investment banker at [[Allen &amp; Company]] in New York said that ''Neopets'' was the only online media he had seen "that might have the ability to capture market share in the offline world".&lt;ref name="Wingfield" /&gt;  Merchandise has been almost entirely discontinued save for a line of enamel pins released by Overpowered in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Enamel Pins https://overpowered.life/collections/neopets&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopets, Inc. signed various licensing deals with companies such as Viacom Consumer Products, Thinkway Toys, and [[Jakks Pacific]] over the years.&lt;ref name="Viacom license" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thinkway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianTVfeb176" /&gt; [[Wizards of the Coast]] released the ''[[Neopets Trading Card Game]]'' in September 2003, which was promoted in three of General Mills "Big G" cereals&lt;ref name="General Mills" /&gt; and ten [[Simon Property Group]] malls.&lt;ref name="mall" /&gt; It received two different nominations for "Toy of the Year" as well as other recognitions.&lt;ref name="TCG awards" /&gt; ''Neopets: The Official Magazine'' was a bi-monthly magazine released the same month but it was replaced in 2008 by ''Beckett Plushie Pals'', which featured ''Neopets'' news as well as other companies' products such as [[Webkinz]].

In 2005, ''Neopets'' expanded to film and video game deals.&lt;ref name="Wingfield" /&gt; The first movie was to be written by Ron Lieber and produced by Dylan Sellers and [[John A. Davis]], but the project has since been cancelled with no other projects announced.&lt;ref name="McClintock" /&gt; Two video games were released by Sony Computer Entertainment, ''[[Neopets: The Darkest Faerie]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2005 and ''[[Neopets: Petpet Adventures: The Wand of Wishing]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2006. 2006 also saw the release of ''Neopets'' mobile, which allowed users to visit the new land of Lutari Island, but it was discontinued on June 30, 2009, leaving the island completely inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=mobile&lt;/ref&gt; ''Neopets'' wouldn't attempt another mobile game until 2015, when they released a match-3 game called ''Ghoul Catchers'' for Android and iOS. However, they still released other games during those years, including ''Treasure Keepers'' for [[Facebook]] and ''[[Neopets Puzzle Adventure|Puzzle Adventure]]'' for [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]], and PC.

'''Nuit Blanche''' ({{IPA-fr|nɥi ˈblɑ̃ʃ}}) ('''White Night''') is an annual all-night or night-time [[arts festival]]. A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public [[art gallery|art galleries]], and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a ''de facto'' art gallery, providing space for [[art installation]]s, performances (music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punkabilly.ca/nuit-blanche-2016-toronto-punk-show/|title=Nuit Blanche Punk Rock Show|publisher=punkabilly.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.

==History==

In 1989, the [[Helsinki Festival]] established its [[Night of the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinginjuhlaviikot.fi/en/taiteiden-yo|title=Taiteiden yö|work=Helsingin juhlaviikot}}&lt;/ref&gt; "when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofestivals.co.uk/festivals-in-finland/helsinki-festival/|title=Helsinki Festival|publisher=eurofestivals.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the mayor of Nantes, [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]]'s program included renovating the central city and establishing a "contemporary patrimony", which led arts programmer [[Jean Blaise]] to create a late-night cultural festival, "Les Allumées" ("Things Alight").&lt;ref&gt;[http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf Alliance Française of New Zealand, May 2009 Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325211624/http://alliance-francaise.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mai-2009-newsletter.pdf |date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6&amp;nbsp;pm to 6&amp;nbsp;am, over six years with artists from six cities.&lt;ref name="Nantes"&gt;[http://www.nantes.fr/les-allumees Les Allumées (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear left}}

They were as follows:
* [[Barcelona]], 15–20 October 1990
* [[St. Petersburg]], 14–19 October 1991
* [[Buenos Aires]], 19–24 October 1992
* [[Naples]], 18–23 October 1993
* [[Cairo]], 17–22 October 1994
* [[Havana]], 16–21 October 1995. (The Cuban government refused to issue travel documents to the 300 artists expected, so the event was formally cancelled, though events did take place.)&lt;ref name="Nantes"/&gt;

In 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allumées, the annual [[White Nights Festival]] in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included [[popular culture|pop culture]] (e.g. the [[Rolling Stones]] in the open air at [[Palace Square]]) in 2007 and [[high culture]] events ("Stars of the White Nights Festival" at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] under [[Valery Gergiev]]) every year since 1993.

In 1997, the [[Long Night of Museums]], took place in the [[German reunification|newly re-united]] [[Berlin]] with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.

In 2001, when [[Bertrand Delanoë]] became [[Mayor of Paris]], his deputy, Christophe Girard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christophe-girard.fr/a-propos/|title=Présentation|work=christophe-girard.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 History of Nuit Blanche (in French)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906073353/http://www.paris.fr/loisirs/les-grands-rendez-vous/nuits-blanches/historique-nuit-blanche/rub_6806_stand_19173_port_15521 |date=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Les Allumées was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. "The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/english/visit/highlights/nuit-blanche/rub_8208_stand_34123_port_18969|title=Nuit Blanche|author=Mairie de Paris|work=paris.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as "Nuits Blanches Europe". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists. Each year, new cities become candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eutrio.be/nuit-blanche-9th-edition-0|title=Nuit blanche – 9th edition – Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union|work=eutrio.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Melbourne]] hosted Australia's first White Night event with the city's galleries, theatres, music venues, [[Melbourne laneways|laneways]], shops and major cultural institutions all showcasing the city's art and culture, food and wine, fashion and sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/4156-white-night-melbourne-celebrating-our-city-from-dusk-to-dawn.html?qh=YTozOntpOjA7czo1OiJ3aGl0ZSI7aToxO3M6Nzoid2hpdGVseSI7aToyO3M6Nzoid2hpdGluZyI7fQ%3D%3D Premier of Victoria's Press Release: White Night Melbourne – celebrating our city from dusk to dawn]&lt;/ref&gt; This first Melbourne White Night saw an estimated 300,000 people attend, exceeding initial estimates and constituting the largest event of its kind in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/white-night-an-arty-delight-20130224-2ezot.html|title=White Night an arty delight|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing with its international success, Nuit Blanche was announced to be held in Santiago Chile during 2015, making this important South American capital part of the Nuit Blanche international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-avignon.org/en/contribution-nuit-blanche-made-paris-concept-exported-latin-america-margot-beck|title=Contribution: "Nuit Blanche, the made in Paris concept exported in Latin America" by Margot Beck – Forum d'Avignon|publisher=forum-avignon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital of Colombia, Bogota, the "Noche en Blanco" was made between 2013 and 2015.

The '''People's Prize''' ({{lang-ko|인민상}}) is a [[North Korea]]n arts and sciences award. It is awarded by the People's Prize Awarding Commission, which is working directly under the [[Cabinet of North Korea]].&lt;ref name="ScalapinoLee1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert A. Scalapino|author2=Chong-Sik Lee|title=Communism in Korea: The society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2M_yhsWc6gC&amp;pg=PA1395|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02274-4|page=1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize can be granted to works of art or people. People's Prize has been an important award in the field of [[Cinema of North Korea|North Korean cinema]].

The works and people that have received the People's Prize cover such varied fields as literature, gymnastics, [[Korean revolutionary opera]], [[acupuncture]] and sculpture. The People's Prize has been received by people abroad.

==History==
The People's Prize was instituted on 8 September 1958.&lt;ref name="Weiser2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chests Full of Brass: A DPRK Political History in Orders, Medals, Prizes, and Titles | last = Weiser | first = Martin  | work = Sino-NK | date = 8 January 2016 | access-date = 16 April 2016 | url = http://sinonk.com/2016/01/08/chests-full-of-brass-a-dprk-political-history-in-orders-medals-prizes-and-titles/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first North Korean feature film ''[[My Hometown (film)|My Hometown]]'' (1949) was directed by [[Kang Hongshik]]. It was the first of a film series to be awarded People's Prize. [[Kim Il-sung]] praised many of People's Prize winning movies from 1960s and 1970s of supplying an exhaustive answer to the issue of people's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Chajusŏng|ko|3=자주성 (주체사상)}}''.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}} The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]] gives the award to those North Korean films and film-makers seen as fulfilling the role of an "excellent textbook" for the workers party.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}}

Some of the works, which did not become recognized as "Immortal classics", did earn People's Prize meant only for the best productions. One such production is a three-part film ''[[Five Guerilla Brothers]]'' (1968) directed by [[Choe Ik-gyu]], and overseen by [[Kim Jong-il]] himself. Other films overseen by Kim to win the People's Prize were ''[[A Flowering Village]]'' and ''[[A Family of Workers]]'' (1971). In the case of the ''A Family of Workers'', Kim Jong-il was reportedly not satisfied with the application of the [[On the Art of the Cinema#Seed theory|seed theory]].&lt;ref name="Schönherr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Schönherr|title=North Korean Cinema: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGBog0seMFQC&amp;pg=PA47|date=13 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9052-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley K.

In 1965 the [[Chongryon]] established [[Korea University (Japan)|Chosun University]]'s teaching staff in Japan received the prize.&lt;ref name="Chongryon"/&gt;

Many of the works to obtain People's Prize are still highly regarded in North Korea. ''[[Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas]]'' is regarded as classic of literature of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]], and was awarded People's Prize in 2012. It is still used in daily ideological study sessions at workplaces, and many of the memoirs have later been made into movies.&lt;ref name="KCNA_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2006/200602/news02/04.htm |title=Reminiscences of Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, True Textbook of Life |author= |date=2 February 2006 |website=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |publisher= |access-date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People's Prize winner [[Kim Song-gun]]'s major work ''Waves of the Sea Kumgang'' was used as a background for a group photo with Kim Jong-il and Bill Clinton during [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea#Bill Clinton's visit to Pyongyang|Clinton's visit to North Korea in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2009/08/27/why-dictators-love-kitch/ |title=Why dictators love kitch |author= |date=27 August 2009 |website=www.nkeconwatch.com |publisher= |access-date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Song-gun received the award for his painting ''Waves of the Sea Kumgang'' in 1999.&lt;ref name="KCNA_waves"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2015/201509/news14/20150914-19ee.html |archive-date=8 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908203312/http://kcna.co.jp/item/2015/201509/news14/20150914-19ee.html |title=Kim Jong Un Sends Birthday Spreads to Intellectuals |author= |date=14 September 2015 |website=[[KCNA]] |publisher= |access-date=7 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Place''' was a collaborative [[project]] and [[social experiment]] hosted on the social networking site [[Reddit]] that began on [[April Fools' Day]] 2017. The experiment involved an online [[canvas]] of one million (1000x1000) [[pixel]] squares, located at a [[subreddit]] called '''/r/place''', which registered users could edit by changing the color of a single pixel from a 16-colour palette. After each pixel was placed, a timer prevented the user from placing any pixels for a period of time varying from 5 to 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="ars technica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Machkovech|first1=Sam|title=Did Reddit’s April Fool’s gag solve the issue of online hate speech?|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/in-memoriam-reddits-72-hour-live-graffiti-wall-as-a-social-experiment/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment was ended by Reddit administrators around 72 hours after its creation, on 3 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=powerlanguage|title=Place has ended • r/place|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/6382bb/place_has_ended|website=reddit|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1 million unique users edited the canvas, placing a total of approximately 16 million tiles, and, at the time the experiment was ended, had over 90,000 users viewing or editing it.&lt;ref name="business insider final"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberger|first1=Matt|title=Over 1 million Reddit users waged a virtual war to create this bizarre work of art with 16 million pixels|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/reddit-place-april-fools-experiment-creates-pixel-art-final-version-2017-4?r=US&amp;IR=T|website=Business Insider Australia|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Place subreddit was archived on 19 April 2017.

== Overview ==
The experiment was based in a subreddit, called /r/place, in which the user would be greeted by a screen displaying a section of the canvas with posts showing below. Registered users could place a pixel (or "tile") on an empty canvas, but had to wait before placing another.&lt;ref name="business insider final" /&gt; The waiting time varied from 5 to 20 minutes throughout the experiment. The choice of color for a user's pixel was between white, light gray, gray, black, pink, red, orange, brown, yellow, light green, green, aqua-blue, green-blue, blue, violet and purple.&lt;ref name="business insider first"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-place-april-fools-experiment-canvas-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Reddit's new 'Place' is forcing millions of users to work together to make something great|last=Weinberger|first=Matt|date=1 April 2017|work=Business Insider|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early hours of the canvas were characterized by random pixel placement and chaotic attempts at image creation. Among the first distinct sections of the canvas to emerge were a corner of entirely blue pixels (named "Blue Corner") and an homage to [[Pokémon]]. As the canvas developed, some established subreddit communities, such as those for [[video game]]s, [[sports]] teams and individual countries, coordinated user efforts to claim and decorate particular sections.&lt;ref name=australian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tindale|first1=James|title=Reddit Place: April Fool’s experiment reveals how the internet sees Australia|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/personal-technology/reddit-place-april-fools-experiment-reveals-how-the-internet-sees-australia/news-story/c60e4e20722f885eb3c8494cc6371d19|accessdate=4 April 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sections of the canvas were developed by specially created communities and coordination efforts, such as reproductions of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and ''[[The Starry Night]]''.&lt;ref name=paste&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rhode|first1=Jason|title=Redditors Collaborate to Create the Iconic Picture of Our Time|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/04/redditors-collaborate-to-create-the-iconic-picture.html|website=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several works of [[pixel art]] were created as a result of the experiment, varying from [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] and [[Internet meme|internet memes]] to [[National flag|patriotic flags]] and recreations of famous pieces of [[Work of art|artwork]].&lt;ref name="ib times"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/reddits-bizarre-social-experiment-5-weirdest-things-created-rplace-2519280|title=Reddit's Bizarre Social Experiment: 5 Weirdest Things Created On r/place|date=1 April 2017|work=International Business Times|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philly voice"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-flyers-represented-in-final-version-of-reddit-place-experiment/|title=Eagles, Flyers represented in final version of Reddit's 'Place' social experiment|date=3 April 2017|work=PhillyVoice|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/heres-the-best-game-fan-art-from-reddits-rplace-canvas|title=Here's the Best Game Fan Art from Reddit's r/place Canvas|last=Oxford|first=Nadia|website=USgamer|language=en-US|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several "[[Cult|cults]]" were also formed, usually associated with [[Emblem|emblematic]] features such as a black [[Void (astronomy)|void]], green lattice, and a multi-colored "rainbow road".&lt;ref name="ars technica" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The idea of "place" was commended for its unique take on representing the Reddit online community. [[The A.V. Club]] called it "a benign, colorful way for Redditors to do what they do best: argue among each other about the things that they love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/reddit-gave-its-users-something-fight-over-besides-253138|title=Reddit gave its users something to fight over besides anime and cucks|date=3 April 2017|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ValueWalk.com described it as a "microcosm of the emergent, spontaneous order that characterize society",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/04/reddit-place-project/|title=Reddit "Place" Project, Order Emerges One Pixel at a Time|date=1 April 2017|work=ValueWalk|access-date=4 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Gizmodo]] labelling it as a "testament to the internet's ability to collaborate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/04/place-was-the-internet-in-all-its-glory/|title=Place Was The Internet, In All Its Glory|last=Serrels|first=Mark|access-date=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of commentators described Place as a representation of internet culture.&lt;ref name="paste" /&gt; Some also commented on the apparent relationship between the makeup of the final canvas and the individual communities within Reddit, which exist independently but cooperate as part of a larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purdom|first1=Clayton|title=Reddit gave its users something to fight over besides anime and cucks|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/reddit-gave-its-users-something-fight-over-besides-253138|website=A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4465">The notion of '''postdramatic theatre''' was established by German theatre researcher [[Hans-Thies Lehmann]] in his book ''Postdramatic Theatre'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarising a number of tendencies and stylistic traits occurring in [[experimental theatre|avant-garde theatre]] since the end of the 1960s. The theatre which Lehmann calls postdramatic is not primarily focused on the drama in itself, but evolves a performative aesthetic in which the text of the performance is put in a special relation to the material situation of the performance and the stage. The post dramatic theatre attempts to mimic the unassembled and unorganized literature that a playwright sketches in the novel

Thus postdramatic theatre is more striving to produce an effect amongst the spectators than to remain true to the text. Lehmann locates what he calls 'the new theatre' as part of 'a simultaneous and multi-perspectival form of perceiving'; this, he argues is brought about, in large part, by a reaction to the dominance of the written text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new theatre, Lehmann asserts, is characterised by, amongst other things, the 'use and combination of heterogeneous styles',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it situates itself as after or beyond dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates the notion of the 'performer as theme and protagonist'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most radical varieties, postdramatic theatre knows no "plot" at all, but concentrates fully on the interaction between performer and audience.

Another way of using the notion is to describe plays with little or no drama, for instance the plays of [[Jon Fosse]].

Some names associated with postdramatic theatre are [[Tadeusz Kantor]] ([[Krakow]]), [[Heiner Müller]] ([[Berlin]]), [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] ([[New York City]]), [[The Wooster Group]] ([[New York City]]), [[The Builders Association]] (New York City),  [[Richard Foreman]] ([[New York City]]), Big Art Group ([[New York City]]), [[Jan Fabre]], [[Jan Lauwers]] and [[Needcompany]], [[Frank Castorf]] (Berlin), [[Josef Szeiler]]/[[TheaterAngelusNovus]] (Vienna), [[Elfriede Jelinek]] (Vienna), [[Heiner Goebbels]] (Frankfurt), [[Verdensteatret]] (Oslo), [[Alvis Hermanis]] (Riga), [[Forced Entertainment]] (Sheffield), [[Teater Moment]] (Stockholm), the Apocryphal Theatre (London), [[The Sydney Front]] (Australia) and [[Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio]] (Italy), [[Navid Memar Kermani]] (Amta Theater Group-Iran).

A new wave of post-dramatic performance companies are troubling the work of those past. These companies include the likes of Pan Pan ([[Ireland]]), POST ([[Australia]]), Action Hero ([[United Kingdom]]), Nature Theatre of Oklahoma ([[United States]]), and more.

A new generation of internationally working postdramatic directors is changing the big picture: Among them are Thomas Luz, Amir Reza Koohestani, Susanne Kennedy, Dusan David Parizek, Yael Ronen, [[Simon Stone]], Kai Tuchmann, Anna Bergmann,Bastian Kraft,Ulrich Rasche, Niklas Stemann, and Kay Voges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Thomas|title=The Post-Dramatic Turn in German Theatre|url=http://howlround.com/the-post-dramatic-turn-in-german-theatre|website=HowlRound|publisher=HowlRound|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2265">'''Preah Ko Preah Keo''' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: "Sacred Ox and Sacred Gem") is a famous [[Khmer People|Cambodian]] legend  about two brothers who were born in Cambodia. The older brother was an ox called '''Preah Ko''' and the younger one was a man named '''Preah Keo'''. Preah Ko was an ox who possessed divine power. His belly contained precious objects and valuable things that people wanted very much. Both sacred brothers were believed to bring peace and prosperity to the place where they resided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcmthailand.com/documents/documentcenter/THE%20LEGEND%20OF%20PREAH%20KO%20PREAH%20KEO%20AND%20ITS%20INFLUENCE%20ON.pdf|title=The Legend of Preah Ko Preah Keo|author=Kimly Ngoun|date=2006 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Legend of Preah Ko Preah Keo'' is very popular in Cambodian society. The story has existed in several versions including oral, written, film and paintings. The Khmer people have great respect for the enchanting brothers. In some shrines throughout the country, Khmers have placed statues of ''Preah Ko'' and ''Preah Keo'', who keep watch over the land they left but never abandoned.

==History==

The [[Khmer People|Khmers]] and the [[Siam|Siamese]] ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: "Siem") throughout their history had many wars with each other. The Siamese had sacked the Khmer’s capital of [[Angkor]]. Later on, [[Longvek]], another of Cambodia’s capitals in the 16th century. After their successful capture of Angkor and Longvek, the Siamese brought many precious objects, jewels, statues, texts, learned men and many prisoners of war from [[Khmer Empire|Cambodia]] to their capital of [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]]. The loss of these materials and human resources had a tremendous effect on the kingdom. The country had declined and lacked signs of progress in the later periods.

To explain these historical events and to express the great sadness over the loss of these priceless resources, the Khmers composed a legend called the ''Legend of Preah Ko Preah Keo''.

The series resurrects a number of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes originally published by companies including [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]], [[Crestwood Publications]], and [[Nedor Comics]], many of whom are in the [[public domain]], including the protagonist, [[Fighting Yank]].

==Setting==
The story is set in a present-day world that is different from our own; it is implied that the absence of the world's heroes allowed the United States to become a virtual dictatorship, with the Dynamic Forces corporation manipulating world events for the sake of order and profit. The Police Corps consists of armored officers who show no mercy, wars are being waged for nothing more than business reasons, and even free speech is heavily restricted. In addition to all this, a terrorist movement called "The Claw" (which may or may not be related to the [[Claw (Lev Gleason Publications)|Golden Age villain of the same name]]) is active around the world. It is into this setting that the released heroes first emerge.

==Plot==

===Chapter One===

===="Last Gleaming" (Issue #0)====
Bruce Carter III, formerly the World War II-era hero Fighting Yank, is now an elderly man. As he sits quietly in his home, thinking and wrestling with his regrets, he's confronted by an apparition. Carter mistakes the ghost for that of his colonial-era ancestor, a spirit which guided and advised him throughout his WWII adventures. The ghost, shrouded in an American flag, is instead an amalgamation of the spirits of patriots, heroes, and martyrs who fought and died for their country. The apparition has come to accuse Carter of betrayal and warn him of his impending death. Carter flees from The American Spirit (for that is the name of this Dickensian apparition).
Through a series of flashback sequences, we learn Fighting Yank's WWII backstory. In a meeting between an unidentified general, Fighting Yank, Green Lama, Black Terror, The Flame, and “Big Blue” (1), it is revealed that Adolf Hitler has come into possession of a mystical object which is the original source of all the world's evil: Pandora's Box (actually an urn) described in the ancient Greek myth. Bruce Carter in his guise as The Fighting Yank, is tasked by the U.S. Government to parachute into Nazi Germany and steal the urn.
Pandora's urn introduced evil into the world, but also released hope; while the Axis powers are the representatives of that evil, the 1940s “mystery men” are conversely the embodiment of hope. The mystical creatures released when the urn was opened are visible as physical entities when special goggles (invented by Alan Oppenheimer and other atomic scientists) are worn. Yank puts on the goggles and is immediately attacked by the creatures. After he removes the goggles, Yank's “spirit guide” (the ghost of his colonial-era ancestor, Bruce Carter I) tells him that since hope was the last thing released from the urn the only way to reimprison its evil is to first trap his fellow mystery men within it.

Fighting Yank attempts to convince his allies to enter the urn voluntarily, but they refuse. Carter determines to imprison them one at a time. Three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, the mystery men are in Kokura, Japan, the intended target of the second atomic bomb. Their purpose is to stop the bombing by obtaining a Japanese surrender. Instead of surrendering, the Japanese army attacks the heroes, resulting in a large-scale battle. The U.S. military, in the mistaken belief that the resulting dust and debris are cloud cover obscuring the city, switch the target city to Nagasaki. Meanwhile, Carter takes advantage of the confusion to trap The Flame within the urn; it was necessary to imprison The Flame first as his power would help the other mystery men survive within the urn.

The Flame is presumed killed, ironically, by the fires of Kokura. The Fighting Yank imprisons Flame Girl after The Flame's memorial service. In the years following World War II, Carter continues to imprison his fellow mystery men, one by one, including the newer heroes which spring up after the war. One of the few heroes to escape this fate is The Green Lama, who returned to Tibet immediately after The Flame's memorial.

Now, in Carter's twilight years, The American Spirit has come to indict Carter for this betrayal. Carter's ancestor arrives to argue with The American Spirit, to convince Carter that he did indeed do the right thing. The patriotic apparition counters with a catalogue of the world's ills which have occurred since the mystery men were imprisoned in the urn: the rise of Dynamic Forces, a [[mega-corporation]] that plays on the world's greed and sloth by offering material creature comforts to the masses; a fascist police forces that cows the population and keeps them in line; a zombie army made from the decomposing bodies of America's dead military men, sent to the Middle East to fight on the government's behalf, forced to battle and be reconstructed over and over endlessly, while the soldiers' souls languish in limbo. “How can you say you've done anything to stop or contain evil?...All you've done...is to stop those who might have helped keep this from happening,” The American Spirit argues.

Carter makes his decision. He asks The American Spirit what he must do to make amends. The answer lies in Tibet; despite his advanced age, Carter must journey there and seek counsel from The Green Lama, even though Carter suspects that Green Lama will kill him for what he's done.&lt;ref name="Issue 7"&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=147200|title=Project Superpowers #7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="The Rumors of My Demise..." (Issue #1)====
In New York City, atop the Dynamic Forces skyscraper headquarters, Dynamic Man and Dynamic Woman look down upon the city. Godlike, they regard humanity as little more than the ants they appear to be from atop their glass and steel eyrie.
As Bruce Carter, the former Fighting Yank, struggles through the snows of Tibet, he is beginning to realize that he has been badly misled by the ghost of his ancestor and namesake, that his ancestor might well be a traitor with his own hidden agenda. Reaching Shangri-La, Carter is greeted by Tsarong, Green Lama's manservant, who takes him to his master. Jethro “Jet” Dumont, the Green Lama, who has apparently not aged since the 1940s, greets Carter warmly. Carter confesses to Lama that he's trapped all of their former allies inside Pandora's Urn, and is surprised by Lama's nonchalance at the revelation.

Lama explains to Carter and The American Spirit that he's discovered the power of the “meta-natural” world. It has provided him with new abilities, one of which he immediately demonstrates. Leafy vines suddenly spring up from the ground and engulf the trio; when the vines peel away, they find themselves in New York City. The American Spirit tells Carter that Pandora's Urn will be found in the possession of Dynamic Man, a former ally who, like the Green Lama, wasn't “chosen” to be trapped in the urn.

At Dynamic Forces headquarters, Carter and Green Lama are ushered into the presence of the Dynamic Family who, like Jet Dumont, have also not aged. Dynamic Man is the caretaker of numerous artifacts, mystical and otherwise, left over from the dark days of World War II. Lama asks if Carter may see the urn. Dynamic Man makes to hand the urn to Carter but deliberately drops it instead. With surprising agility for one so elderly, Carter makes a diving catch. Carter himself breaks the urn open and is surprised when nothing happens. Dynamic Man laughs as he informs the duo that he'd had the urn exorcised, while Dynamic Woman hints that the Family may be something more/other than human. Then the Family members grab Carter and Green Lama and throw them down an elevator shaft, despite the fact that the Lama can fly. The elevator car, its cables cut, hurtles down at them; Lama smashes through it and the heroes exit onto the rooftop. Carter puts on his power cloak and mask to again become The Fighting Yank.

The Dynamic Family attacks the heroes on the rooftop, while hundreds of Dynamic Forces employees rush into the fray. Suddenly another mystery man bursts through the rooftop and comes to the aid of Yank and Lama. He is The Black Terror, who has determined that no one but he should have the privilege of killing The Fighting Yank as revenge for Terror's decades-long imprisonment in the urn. During the fight, Black Terror accidentally punches Dynamic Man too hard and discovers, to everyone's surprise, that Dynamic Man is actually a robot. The robot replies by hurling Black Terror from the rooftop. Cat-like, Black Terror lands on his feet on the sidewalk below, cratering it in the process. The Terror then shakes his fist at the rooftop and howls in rage, “OK, Bruce, Fighting Yank gets a reprieve&amp;nbsp;– I'm not going to kill you until after I kill Dynamic Man!”

===="...The Whites of Their Eyes" (Issue #2)====
Mystery men of the 1940s, released from Pandora's Urn, are popping up all over the globe. A red-and-blue clad, boomerang wielding figure emerges from the fabled sewers of Paris in time to see a street riot in progress...

Meanwhile, in New York City, the Fighting Yank and the Green Lama fight for their lives against the robotic Dynamic Family and their mechanical hordes. The Black Terror claws his way back up the side of the skyscraper and rejoins the fray, but seems just as concerned with the fate of his kid sidekick Tim (Kid Terror) as he does with the struggle at hand. Now that they know their opponents are robots instead of flesh and blood, the heroes battle with furious abandon. With a massive rumbling, huge trees and vines suddenly sprout from the heart of the Dynamic Forces headquarters; the Green Lama is using his meta-natural abilities to transport himself and his allies away from the lopsided fight.

In Paris, the mysterious stranger saves a law enforcement officer from the rioters, taking down a few members of the mob in the process. After their escape it's revealed that the officer is a woman who identifies the mob as a group of terrorists and herself as Justine. The stranger remains ever silent.

Back in Shangri-La after their escape from the Dynamic Family, the heroes discuss what they've experienced. The American Spirit is of the belief that the urn's destruction has released the imprisoned mystery men who are likely to reappear randomly around the globe. The Black Terror continues to threaten Fighting Yank's life, while the ghostly Bruce Carter I continues to try to sway his descendant away from The American Spirit.

War is being waged in the Middle East. The United States has replaced its traditional human soldiers with the F-Troop: the reanimated corpses of soldiers killed in previous wars. The war's goal is to destroy the world's petroleum source, which will prompt industrialized nations to switch to a new synthetic fuel created and monopolized by Dynamic Forces. Not coincidentally, Dynamic Forces also controls the U.S. military and is fighting the war with the undead F-Troop soldiers which are also Dynamic's patented creation. Acting as a pair of thorns in Dynamic's side are the heroes Samson (possessed of superhuman strength and the ability to repel ballistic missiles) and The Scarab (clad in powered stealth armor), who meet and join forces to battle the F-Troop.

The Flame appears in Hollywood, California; disoriented and frantic to find Flame Girl (Linda), he accidentally sets the famous “Hollywood” sign on fire with his flame pistol. In Shangri-La, Black Terror, also frantic to find his old sidekick, argues with The American Spirit and decks Fighting Yank. In New York, the Dynamic Family is unable to destroy the meta-natural greenery that has overrun their skyscraper; they've called on The Crusaders to deal with the returned heroes...

===="Proof Through the Night" (Issue #3)====
Shangri-La is under attack. The Crusaders, a U.S. military strike force (under the control of the Dynamic Family) is flying in ‘’en masse’’ to destroy buildings, kill citizens, and essentially level the city. Led to the scene by Dynamic Forces micro-transmitters which were secretly placed on Black Terror’s uniform, the Crusaders wreak havoc as the vastly outnumbered heroes (Green Lama, Black Terror, and Fighting Yank) struggle to stop them.

In a Middle Eastern bazaar, Samson tells Scarab the tale of how he lost his eyes. Samson was among the heroes who’d gone on a peace mission to Kokura, Japan, a mission gone horribly wrong. Kokura had been slated as the target of the second atomic bomb in 1945, so the costumed mystery men travelled there to convince the Japanese to surrender before the bomb could be dropped. The mission instead became a battle which created so much smoke and dust that the U.S. military switched the bomb’s target to Nagasaki instead. Samson flew off from Kokura to intercept the bombing mission. Arriving too late to prevent the bomb’s deployment, Samson is caught in the air burst and the blast literally melts his eyes.

In Paris, the mute mystery man uses a pad and pencil to introduce himself to his new ally Justine, a French law enforcement anti-terrorism operative. On the pad, he writes the word “Devil”.

More heroes released from the urn are popping up around the globe. In California, The Flame runs to the seashore, leaving a path of burning devastation in his wake. Placing his flame pistol to his head, he's about to commit suicide when a sudden tidal wave hits the beach and stops him. The wave is caused by his old friend Hydro who has also recently been released from the urn.

The scene shifts to Asia, where a disoriented, amnesiac Masquerade wanders the streets of a town in which the residents have been afflicted by a mysterious plague. There she encounters her former ally and lover V-Man, who is apparently the plagues's unwitting source; just after they meet, Masquerade fces breaks out in angry red boils.

Mr. Face and a nameless companion sit drinking in a Mexican cantina. In the 1940s, Mr. Face was just an unpowered adventurer in a fright mask, but his time in the urn has transformed him (as it did many of his fellow mystery men): now his mask causes others to experience their worst fears. As the village's inhabitants run screaming through the streets outside, Mr. Face and his drinking buddy confess their own worst fears. The nameless companion fears falling “off the wagon” back into alcoholism. Mr. Face's fear has already come true: he can’t remove the mask.

In Shangri-La, the fight is going badly for the heroes. The city is dying; snow falls in Shangri-La for the first time in thousands of years. Green Lama's friend and manservant Tsarong is fried by a Crusader ray blast, while another Crusader burns a gaping hole in Fighting Yank's chest (which matches the hole Black Terror punched in the chest of Dynamic Man). Yank's power cloak keeps him alive, but he's left behind as Green Lama uses one of his meta-natural “leaf piles” to transport the heroes back to New York. After the departure Fighting Yank falls face first into the snow as The American Spirit flutters down and covers him like a star-spangled shroud.

===="...Undimmed by Human Tears" (Issue #4)====
Dynamic Forces’ headquarters (and all of New York City) has been overrun by Green Lama's meta-natural foliage. The Dynamic Family abandons New York and relocates to Philadelphia. While there, they see the television coverage of the destruction inadvertently caused by The Flame and Hydro. The recently released heroes are bombarded by media questions (including “Are you a couple?” It would seem that many things have changed over the sixty years of their imprisonment within Pandora's Urn). Dynamic Man decides to change his strategy for combating the heroes; he will call out the nationwide Police Corp, a fascistic cadre of stormtroopers, and use them to manipulate the media, making martyrs of the Dynamic Family.

Shangri-La has been destroyed. The Crusaders carry the Fighting Yank through the snow, while Yank's spirit guide realizes that he's lost and truly damned.

Green Lama has renamed New York City “New Shangri-La”. His meta-natural greenery has taken over the city; huge vines and foliage wrap around the skyscrapers. Unable to remove the Dynamic Family's micro-transmitters from the Black Terror, Green Lama decides to send Black Terror across the globe to gather up the newly released superheroes as they appear and bring them back to New Shangri-La.

In the Middle East, Scarab shows Samson a “Black Cross” facility, where the undead F-Troop soldiers are reconstituted and sent back into battle. The political goal of using these zombie troops is to make war “acceptable” to the masses; Samson recognizes that the soldiers’ souls are thereby trapped and that the F-Troop is an abomination. He charges through the tents and begins the work of destroying the undead soldiers, releasing their souls.

In Tibet, the dying Fighting Yank begins to understand how he was misled by his ancestor; it was never about “doing the right thing” but was instead about releasing Bruce Carter I's soul from the curse it labored under. Inspired by The American Spirit, who reassures Yank that his misguided betrayal of his allies has not damned him, Fighting Yank challenges his Crusader captors to “do their worst”.

Events are moving too quickly even for the Dynamic Family. Communications have been cut with their Tibetan Crusader squadron, a Middle Eastern F-Troop unit has been totally destroyed (even beyond the ability to reanimate the corpses), and Black Terror's location is constantly changing as Green Lama sends him around the globe to gather together the reemerging heroes. “How could one old man have started this?” muses Dynamic Woman.

In Paris, the Death Defying 'Devil and Justine's "ad hoc" alliance is strengthened as ‘Devil learns of a terrorist organization called The Claw, and realizes there might be a connection with his old archenemy of the same name. Just then the Black Terror (accompanied by Masquerade and V-Man) arrives to gather up 'Devil.

Back in California, The Flame and Hydro have given themselves up to the Police Corp, unaware of the organization's stormtrooper tactics. As the Police Corp begin to savagely beat the handcuffed heroes, Pyroman arrives to lend the heroes a hand. It’s going badly for the Corp when Dynamic Boy suddenly appears and lends the Corp a hand...

===="Let Slip the Dogs of War" (Issue #5)====
After wiping out his Crusader captors, the Fighting Yank continues to argue with his ancestor’s spirit; Yank has come to realize that his ancestor advised him to commit a hideous wrong for purely selfish reasons. The ghost says he’s in Hell; Yank merely replies, “Good”.

Dynamic Boy ambushes The Flame and Hydro. Pyroman arrives and electrocutes Dynamic Boy, apparently killing him (of course, the reader knows that Dynamic Boy is a robot). Just as the Police Corp prepare to attack the heroes, Black Terror appears in a riot of meta-natural greenery to whisk the trio away to New Shangri-La where they are greeted by the Green Lama (who believes Fighting Yank to be dead).

V-Man, unable to control his new “plague” power, is under quarantine in a plexiglass room. While there, Masquerade comes to visit him; it seems that removing her mask somehow cured her of the plague.

The Dynamic Family makes a televised media circus of Dynamic Boy's funeral. Dynamic Man accuses the superheroes of being “terrorists”, while Dynamic Woman calls for the nations of the planet to unite for a war against the “Superpowers”.

The Target, another released hero, makes an appearance. The Police Corp attempt to take him down, but his ability to split into three separate beings confuses the fascist troops.

In the Middle East, Black Terror joins with Samson and the Scarab in a brutal battle against F-Troop zombies. Black Terror indicates that the other Superpowers will likely join later in an effort to destroy the F-Troop abomination.

Back in Tibet, the Fighting Yank is slipping fast; only his power cloak is keeping him (barely) alive. Suddenly three arrows slam into the gaping wound in Yank's chest, fired by the Arrow, another hero released from the urn.

===Wizard #½: All Part of the Design (Issue #½)===
In December 2008, Dynamite partnered with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]'' to produce a special #½ issue. The story takes place at Dynamic Boy's funeral (between issues #5 and #6 of the first series) and sees Dynamic Man reflecting on the past. We see Dynamic Man and Dynamic Boy in WWII Germany admiring what Hitler has accomplished before playing the role of heroes when their super-powered allies arrive. Back in the present, we see Dynamic Boy emerge from his grave and the next part of the Dynamic Family's plan is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=153389|title=Project Superpowers #½}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="...The Perilous Fight" (Issue #6)====
A flashback sequence shows Bruce Carter I during the American Revolution promising that he'd “be damned” if he failed to deliver a vital message. Stopping for a drink on his journey, Carter is ambushed and killed in the tavern by British soldiers who subsequently find the message he is carrying; Carter is indeed damned as a result. As it later transpires, Carter I's guidance of his descendant and namesake, the Golden Age hero known as The Fighting Yank, is some sort of atonement for his misdeed, but it seems that he's no more competent in death than he was in life. The Arrow's three shots appear to have been accidental, but also seem to be finishing off Yank.

In New Shangri-La, Masquerade visits the quarantined V-Man and informs him that her “possession” power will also allow her to recover from the plague he carries; she can freely enter his “bubble”, but V-Man is so consumed with self-pity that he rejects her. More importantly, she informs V-Man that Green Lama intends to use him as a “secret weapon” should the need arise. Lama arrives to round up Masquerade, as the Superpowers are bound for the Middle East to help Samson and Scarab in their battle against the F-Troop.

Scarab, meanwhile, reveals his identity to Samson and tells of how he once sold a scarab-shaped stone he found, used the money to establish a financial empire, and then built the powered armor he now wears.

Dynamic Man appears before the shadowy cabal known as The Supremacy, petitioning them for full membership. Dynamic Forces has been working for The Supremacy, following their orders, but Dynamic Man believes the time has come for him to become a member instead of a pawn. The Supremacy rejects his request, but not before informing him that more F-Troop forces are being dispatched to the Middle East. The ground there is also being sewn with a defoliating treatment that will prevent Green Lama's transportation powers from working; if the Superpowers appear there, they will be trapped.

The Superpowers prepare to leave for the Middle East, but Green Lama first tells the team what they are about to do and what to expect. The world's governments have become corrupt, and the Superpowers will need to operate without them, outside the law if need be. The team will be likely be vilified by governments, in the press, and by the public. "We will become targets from this day forward, the outrage of the unknowing representatives of hidden corruption. Perhaps this is at the root of what it means to be a hero." They vanish, reappearing in the Middle East in time to aid Scarab and Samson in their fight against (and efforts to save the souls of) the F-Troop forces there.

Meanwhile, American Spirit tells the dying Fighting Yank that his friends will die unless he saves them—by taking his ancestor's curse and damnation upon himself.

The Superpowers' battle is going badly. Heavily outnumbered by F-Troop forces (with more being airdropped), the team decides a retreat is in order. But Green Lama has collapsed; when he rises, he appears to have aged a half-century or more...

===="...Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants Thereof..." (Issue #7)====
The finale for this chapter. The battle between the Superpowers and F-Troop rages on. As more and more undead soldiers parachute down from the sky, the rapidly aging Green Lama tells Black Terror that "all of them"(the F-Troop) must arrive before Lama will spring a trap on them.

Fighting Yank chooses to accept his ancestor's curse in order to help his endangered teammates. His sole request of the American Spirit is that he would be able to keep his magical cloak so that he would be able to affect the world with more than just his words, a request which was granted. Wrapped in his cloak, the Fighting Yank dies.

As the members of The Supremacy watch remotely, the Superpowers continue to fight for their lives. On the verge of springing their "trap" (a mysterious figure covered in leaves), they suddenly discover that Green Lama is unable to transport them away. In desperation, Lama flies Masquerade up to one of the planes airdropping the F-Troop, where Masquerade uses her "possession" power on the pilot. She learns that The Supremacy has treated the ground with a chemical that neutralizes Lama's meta-natural powers and that they've been lured into a trap. Lama urges the heroes with flight powers to escape, but his teammates refuse to go. As the Superpowers prepare for death (and glory), Fighting Yank (or his spirit) appears; his cloak strengthens Green Lama who is then able to use his meta-natural abilities to transport the team to safety.

The mysterious leafed figure stays behind. Bursting forth from the greenery that protected the other Superpowers from his plague powers, V-Man springs Lama's "trap", walking impervious among the undead F-Troop soldiers and sending them to the final reward that they've previously been denied by Dynamic Forces' blasphemous reanimation technology.

With Green Lama as their spokesman, the Superpowers appear on television to address the public. "The nations of this world have grown corrupt with their own power...It is with this in mind that we shall become a check to balance the corruption of the nations of the world. You may call us terrorists, but we're not. We are Americans. And we are your friends."

The members of The Supremacy watch the broadcast and realize that the Superpowers have just declared war. Unknown to the heroes, one of their number is a Supremacy member: Amon Khadul, The Scarab.

Fighting Yank and Black Terror patch their differences as more heroes, responding to the worldwide broadcast, begin to arrive in New Shangri-La. The first on the scene is The Owl...

===Free Comic Book Day Special===
On May 3, 2008, there was a [[Free Comic Book Day]] special edition of ''Project Superpowers'' released. In the story, which takes place after issue #7 of the first series, the heroes wonder if the Claw is still alive and reflect on ’Devil’s history with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=125820|title=Project Superpowers FCBD Special}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter Two Prelude===
Released in October 2008 as a teaser to ''Project Superpowers: Chapter Two'', this one-shot showcases a number of drawings of heroes and groups who will presumably be featured in the next chapter. The groups are: "The Inheritors", led by the Boy King and his Giant, and composed of many of the young sidekicks of the heroes, including the Black Terror's sidekick, Tim; "The Patriots", a team of flag-wearing heroes who return to the service of the American government, and are mentioned to come into conflict with the Black Terror; "The Supremacy", a secret cabal who were introduced previously, who include a "President West", and numerous villain characters, plus the Scarab's secret identity; "The Scarlet Sisters", a team-up between Masquerade, the Woman in Red, and Lady Satan; "The Big Shots", a trio composed of Mr. Face, [[Skyman (Columbia Comics)|Skyman]], and Marvelo, all of whose abilities are hinted to be dangerous and difficult to control; "The Super-Mysterymen", a group of heroes who are said to have been tracked and captured immediately after the destruction of the urn to be used for an unknown party's purposes. Furthermore, several single heroes were shown, including: Captain Future, Cat-Man (now a partially feline character, called Man-Cat), Burning Eagle (who is constantly aflame), Black Owl (whose body now contains a [[black hole]]), Silver Streak, the Ghost, and a newly created hero pair, Truth and Dare, who are said to be inspired by the return of the Superpowers. ''Chapter Two Prelude'' also contains small previews of the ''Black Terror'', ''Death Defying 'Devil'', and ''Masquerade'' mini-series.

===Chapter Two===
Following the events of Project Superpowers and Black Terror, the members of The Supremacy decide to launch a nuclear assault on New Shangri-La; The Scarab, who is secretly a member of The Supremacy, informs The Superpowers of this, and they invade The Pentagon and abduct U.S. President Gene West (who is a former superhero called Power Nelson) before the attack begins. The Green Lama travels to the Supremacy's headquarters and warns them to leave America alone.

The Inheritors, disturbed by what they see as their adult partners running amok, decide to gather other heroes who've escaped from the Urn of Pandora in order to oppose the Superpowers. They find Cat-Man, who now acts like a feral beast, and The Eagle, who is now constantly burning from within.

Later, Captain Future—who is now possessed by Zeus, who had originally created the Urn—appears in the Caribbean, leading people to engage in drunken orgies with him and attacking anyone who opposes him; two new heroes called Truth and Dare try to fight him, and fail. The Superpowers try to get Captain Future under control, and they also fail. It turns out the Captain is working with The Supremacy, who have The Flame's partner Flame Girl prisoner; he steals her flame powers, and prepares to wage war on the Superpowers.

Meanwhile, Tim the Kid Terror is attacked by Cat-Man, who had broken out of his cage; the other Inheritors don't see that the gash in Tim's face reveals machinery. "Tim" is actually Dynamic Boy, who had killed Tim two months earlier in order to assume his identity.

Were also edited in format TPB volume 1 from issues #1–6, and volume 2 issues #7–12 (See section "Collected editions").

Many [[film]]s have been released to the [[public domain]] intentionally by the film's author, or because the [[copyright]] has expired.

== Public domain film by country ==
===Japan===
Many pre-1954 Japanese films have passed into public domain in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/japanese-court-rules-pre-1953-movies-in-public-domain_1002318 |title=Paramount Pictures - Japanese Court Rules Pre-1953 Movies In Public Domain - Contactmusic News |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatroute.ca/view_archived_article.php?id=23&amp;sectionID=10&amp;articleID=562 |title=BeatRoute Magazine - Western Canada's Monthly Arts &amp; Entertainment Source - Archives - Film - Kurosawa, the Emperor of Cinema |publisher=Beatroute.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507192311/http://www.beatroute.ca/view_archived_article.php?id=23&amp;sectionID=10&amp;articleID=562 |archivedate=May 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.washington.edu/Casrip/Newsletter/Vol14/newsv14i1Mitani.html |title=Argument for the Extension of the Copyright Protection over Cinematographic Works|accessdate=March 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204230924/http://www.law.washington.edu/Casrip/Newsletter/Vol14/newsv14i1Mitani.html |archivedate=February 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdrjapan.com/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=Copyright-wrangling-forces-bargain-Kurosawa-DVDs-off-the-shelves.html&amp;Itemid=67 |accessdate=March 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929141113/http://www.hdrjapan.com/index.php?option=com_myblog |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Cinema of Japan#Copyright status of Japanese films|Japanese Films copyright timeline]].

===United States===
{{Main|Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|List of films in the public domain in the United States}}
Due to the U.S. [[Copyright Term Extension Act]], no more films will automatically enter [[public domain in the United States]] until January 1, 2019, when the copyright will expire on films released in 1923 (and in 2020 films from 1924, and so on).

All copyrightable works made by United States government employees as part of their official duties are in the public domain from their creation. The status of works made by contractors is dependent on the terms of their contract. Note that this applies only to the federal government, and not to state or local governments, which [[Copyright status of work by U.S. subnational governments|may or may not claim copyright]] depending on state laws

==== Re-imposing copyright following Uruguay Round ====
Another issue specifically affects copyright of foreign works in the United States. The [[Uruguay Round]] agreements on copyright led to the U.S. Congress re-imposing copyright on some items which had fallen into the public domain (in section 514 of the URAA Act), as of 1996.

In the course of changes made to both U.S. domestic law and international copyright agreements in the last two decades, some works which had fallen in the public domain had copyright restored in the U.S. This was challenged on the grounds that works once in the public domain could not revert to copyright protection - a constitutional question. The see-saw course of court decisions on the matter have caused confusion, with many significant works (such as ''[[The Third Man]]'') changing status several times in a short period.

Specifically, from a holding published on 3 April 2009 to a reversal on 21 June 2010, re-imposition of copyright was not permitted. That brief period came after the 2001 American case ''[[Golan v. Gonzales]]'' was reconsidered as ''[[Golan v. Holder]]''. Since the [[Supreme Court of the U.S.]] (SCOTUS) has granted [[certiorari]], we may expect a definitive answer on point soon; meanwhile, re-imposition of copyright stands.

Initially, Judge Babcock held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was not applicable to resurrecting foreign copyright claims. This holding followed tradition in that the First Amendment (which protects against suppression of free speech by government) has always been held not to prevail against the earlier copyright clause (copyrights are generally held by persons, not the U.S. government).
Subsequently, Babcock reversed himself on advice by a higher court that such an act by an arm of government (Congress) changed the traditional interpretation of copyright and should be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. That reversal was itself reversed on appeal and summary judgement granted for the government.
Babcock's holding - that "In the United States, that body of law includes the bedrock principle that works in the public domain remain in the public domain. Removing works from the public domain violated Plaintiffs’ vested First Amendment interests" - therefore no longer applies. Unless and until review is complete by SCOTUS, public domain works can have copyright re-imposed by international treaty and the First Amendment will not prevent it.

Note that [[photo restoration|restored]], [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]], and [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] versions of films can themselves be subject to [[copyright]], even if other elements of the film are in the public domain. Thus even if a film dates from 1915 and as such is ineligible for copyright in the United States of America, a 2004 version with new visual or audio elements (including the addition of a new recording of the score of a silent film) may be itself eligible for a 2004 copyright to those new elements. Special features and packaging are themselves subject to copyright protection.

The question of whether restored films like the most recent version of ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' can be copyrighted will not be clear until after the SCOTUS review is complete. That is because the SCOTUS review examines both the First Amendment issue, affecting a version which existed in 1996, and also the much more fundamental question whether Congress has the right to remove works from the public domain at all. There is also a legal question in the U.S. whether a restored print, as a copy of a public domain work, is not original - so does not qualify for copyright protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2713">'''Radio Haiti-Inter''' was the first independent [[radio station]] in [[Haiti]]. The station was notable for its use of the [[Haitian Creole]] language, spoken by most Haitians, while most other media broadcast in French, and also for its broadcasting of international and local news. 

==History==
The station was founded as '''Radio Haiti''' and was broadcast on both AM and FM and later renamed to '''Radio Haiti-Inter'''. [[Jean Dominique]], who started working at the station as a reporter, bought the lease to the station in 1968. The station was the target of various attacks by oppressive government regimes throughout its history, due to the democratic and anti-corruption stance of Dominique. 

In 1980 the Haitian regime closed the station and arrested some station journalists, and Dominique was forced into exile. The station resumed its activity in 1986 after the fall of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], but closed again in 1991 after the coup d'état against [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. The station reopened in 1994 after Aristide's return.

Jean Dominique was assassinated on April 3, 2000, upon attempting to enter the station. A station employee Jean-Claude Louissaint was also killed in the attack.

==History==

===Pre-WWII===

The first radio transmissions in Austria started in 1924 in Vienna. Programming started with classical music, daily news were not allowed to be broadcast to protect the newspaper producers. However, near the end of the 1920s, the political influence started to affect the medium radio as well. After 1933, Germany started transmitting propaganda directed at Austria, which was countered by the local radio stations. After Austria joined Germany in 1938, the Austrian radio stations became part of the German radio network.

===Post-WWII===
After the end of World War II, the studio was located inside the Soviet occupation zone, so the programming had a small but noticeable Soviet influence. The other three occupation forces started their own programming as well, which competed with each other causing a huge variety of different radio stations for that time.

After Austria became independent again in 1955, programming consisted of three national radio stations, transmitted via mediumwave and FM. Because the government refused to raise the radio fees, the third program had to be closed due to lack of money in 1962. Only in 1966, after a new law was enacted, could programming restart with three programs - [[Ö1]], [[Ö2]] and [[Ö3]].

Soon, the decision was made to abandon mediumwave, not just due to the lack of frequencies in Austria, but also because the alpine terrain proved to be difficult to cover by mediumwave. By 1976, only 80% of the population was covered by mediumwave at daytime, at night this number fell to 65%. Therefore, all medium wave stations were shut off, with the exception of the frequency 1476&amp;nbsp;kHz from Vienna ([[Sendeanlage Bisamberg]]) to cover [[Czechoslovakia]]. As well, a shortwave transmitter in [[Aldrans]] was used until the 80s to cover the deep Tyrolean valleys which couldn't be reached by mediumwave or FM.

Especially Ö3 was innovative with their pop music format, which was unusual in Europe in the 60s and 70s. It caused a huge popularity of the station, as well as the [[Austropop]] music genre. In 1979, [[Blue Danube Radio]] was launched to target the various [[United Nations]] personnel present in Austria.

In the 1980s, because commercial radio stations were still illegal, the first radio stations started to broadcast from foreign territory, especially [[South Tyrol]] and the former Socialist countries in the east. In 1993, the European Union condemned Austria for forbidding commercial radio stations and thus violating free speech rights. In July 1993, the monopoly of [[Österreichischer Rundfunk]] was softened, allowing the launch of the first commercial radio stations in 1995. It took until 1997 for the ban on commercial radio stations to be lifted completely, and in 1998 several new stations launched in Austria.

Like in Germany, radio in Austria was completely separated by state, allowing radio stations to transmit in one state only. A law change 2001 allowed licenses for country-wide radio stations to be given out. So far, the only such license is owned by [[KroneHit]].

A '''self-fulfilling prophecy''' is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to [[positive feedback]] between belief and behavior. Although examples of such [[prophecy|prophecies]] can be found in literature as far back as [[ancient Greece]] and [[History of India|ancient India]], it is 20th-century [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] who is credited with coining the expression "self-fulfilling prophecy" and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article ''Self-Fulfilling Prophecy'', Merton defines it in the following terms: 
{{quote|The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a ''false'' definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come ''true''. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=SFP-48&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In other words, a positive or negative prophecy, strongly held belief, or [[delusion]]—declared as truth when it is actually false—may sufficiently influence people so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy.

Self-fulfilling prophecy are effects in ''[[behavioral confirmation]] effect'', in which behavior, influenced by expectations, causes those expectations to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darley |first=John M. |first2=Paget H. |last2=Gross |title=Stereotypes and prejudice: essential readings |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Stangor |year=2000 |publisher= Psychology Press |page=212 |chapter=A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labelling Effects |isbn=978-0-86377-589-5 |oclc=42823720}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is complementary to the [[self-defeating prophecy]].

==History of the concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Merton's concept of the ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' stems from the [[Thomas theorem]], which states that "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences".&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Child in America: Behavior Problems and Programs |last=Thomas |first=W. I. |authorlink=W. I. Thomas |year=1928 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn= |pages=572 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas, people react not only to the situations they are in, but also, and often primarily, to the way they perceive the situations and to the meaning they assign to their perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/nominal-interest-rates-and-money-supply-and-demand-1147766|title=How Money Supply and Demand Determine Nominal Interest Rates|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Therefore, their behaviour is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to the situations they are in, rather than by the situations themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.

Merton took the concept a step further and applied it to recent social phenomena. In his book ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', he conceives of a [[bank run]] at the fictional Last National Bank, over which Cartwright Millingville presides. It is a typical bank, and Millingville has run it honestly and quite properly. As a result, like all banks, it has some [[Asset|liquid assets]] (cash), but most of its assets are invested in various ventures. Then one day, a large number of customers come to the bank at once—the exact reason is never made clear. Customers, seeing so many others at the bank, begin to worry. False rumours spread that something is wrong with the bank, and more customers rush to the bank to try to get some of their money out while they still can. The number of customers at the bank increases, as does their annoyance and excitement, which in turn fuels the false rumours of the bank's [[insolvency]] and upcoming [[bankruptcy]], causing more customers to come and try to withdraw their money. At the beginning of the day—the last one for Millingville's bank—the bank was not insolvent. But the rumour of insolvency caused a sudden demand of withdrawal of too many customers, which could not be answered, causing the bank to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy. Merton concludes this example with the following analysis:

{{quote|The parable tells us that public definitions of a situation (prophecies or predictions) become an integral part of the situation and thus affect subsequent developments. This is peculiar to human affairs. It is not found in the world of nature, untouched by human hands. Predictions of the return of [[Comet Halley|Halley's comet]] do not influence its orbit. But the rumoured insolvency of Millingville's bank did affect the actual outcome. The prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfilment.&lt;ref name="merton"&gt;{{cite book |title= Social Theory and Social Structure|last= Merton|first= Robert K|authorlink= Robert K. Merton|year= 1968|publisher= [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 978-0-02-921130-4|oclc= 253949|pages= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Merton concluded that the only way to break the cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy is by redefining the propositions on which its false assumptions are originally based.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In economic "expectations models" of inflation, peoples' expectations of future inflation lead them to spend more today and demand higher nominal interest rates for any savings, since they expect that prices will be rising. This demand for higher nominal interest rates and increased spending in the present, in turn, create inflationary pressure and can cause inflation even if the expectations of future inflation are unfounded.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The expectations theory of inflation played a large role in [[Paul Volcker]]'s actions during his tenure as the Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] in combating the "[[stagflation]]" of the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the self-fulfilling prophecy the ''Oedipus effect'':

{{quote|One of the ideas I had discussed in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' was the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted. I had called this the "Oedipus effect", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. … For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences. But in biology, too—even in molecular biology—expectations often play a role in bringing about what has been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |year=1976 |publisher=Open Court |location=LaSalle, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87548-343-6 |oclc=2927208 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early precursor of the concept appears in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'': "During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment" (chapter I, part II).

===Applications===
Examples abound{{examples|date=May 2014}} in studies of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] and the related [[self-perception theory]]; people will often change their [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] to come into line with what they profess publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco-Villanueva, M. A., [http://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/econo/article/view/14336 El Efecto “Pricebo”: Cómo los precios pueden influenciar la percepción sobre la calidad del cannabis y sus implicaciones en las políticas de precios"], ''Pensamiento Crítico,'' vol. 22, n. 2, pp 175-210&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the United States, the concept was broadly and consistently applied in the field of public education reform, following the "[[War on Poverty]]". Theodore Brameld noted: "In simplest terms, education already projects and thereby reinforces whatever habits of personal and cultural life are considered to be acceptable and dominant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brameld |first=T. |authorlink= |year=1972 |title=Education as self-fulfilling prophecy |journal=Phi Beta Kappa |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=8–11, 58–61 [p. 9]|url= |quote= }} Quoted by Wilkins (1976), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of teacher attitudes, beliefs and values, affecting their expectations have been tested repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkins |first=William E. |authorlink= |year=1976 |title=The Concept of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=Sociology of Education |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–183 |issn=0038-0407|quote= |doi=10.2307/2112523 |jstor= 2112523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of the "inevitability of war" is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has received considerable study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The role of expectancy |title=The Tensions That Cause Wars |last=Allport |first=G. |authorlink= |editor=Cantrill, H. |year=1950 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana |isbn= |pages=43–78 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is similar to that discussed by the philosopher [[William James]] as "[[The Will to Believe]]." But James viewed it positively, as the self-validation of a belief.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Just as, in Merton's example, the belief that a bank is insolvent may help create the fact, so too, on the positive side, confidence in the bank's prospects may help brighten them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Similarly, Stock-exchange panic episodes, and speculative bubble episodes, can be triggered with the belief that the stock will go down (or up), thus starting the selling/buying mass move, etc.

A more Jamesian example: a swain, convinced that the fair maiden ''must'' love him, may prove more effective in his wooing than he would had his initial prophecy been defeatist.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is extensive evidence{{where|date=May 2014}} of "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", where the seemingly private expectations of individuals can predict the outcome of the world around them. The mechanisms by which this occurs are also reasonably well understood: it is simply that our own expectations change our behaviour in ways we may not notice and correct. In the case of the "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", others pick up on non-verbal behaviour, which affects their attitudes. A famous{{according to whom|date=May 2014}} example includes a study where teachers were told arbitrarily that random students were "going to blossom".{{Failed verification|date=May 2014}}  Oddly, those random students actually ended the year with significantly greater improvements.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal-2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenthal |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Covert communication in laboratories, classrooms, and the truly real world |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |publisher=Blackwell |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=151–154 |doi= 10.1111/1467-8721.t01-1-01250|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Rosenthal2003.pdf |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pygmalion in the Classroom|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Robert|last2=Jacobson|first2=Lenore|year=2003|publisher=Crown House|isbn=9781904424062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In Canadian ice hockey, junior league players are selected based on skill, motor coordination, physical maturity, and other individual merit criteria. However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0–11 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates. These factors make them actually become the best players, fulfilling the prophecy, while the real selection criterion was age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=978-0-316-01792-3|pages=20–25|chapter=1 – The Matthew Effect|laysummary=http://www.rugbyiq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1199:is-it-because-of-talent-that-athletes-succeed&amp;catid=102:mental-toughness&amp;Itemid=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same [[relative age effect]] has been noticed in Belgian soccer after 1997, when the start of the selection year was changed from August 1 to January 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helsen|first=WF |author2=Starkes, JL |author3=Van Winckel, J|title=Effect of a change in selection year on success in male soccer players|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2000-11-01|volume=12|issue=6|pages=729–735|pmid=11534065|doi=10.1002/1520-6300(200011/12)12:6&lt;729::AID-AJHB2&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype==
{{Main|Stereotype threat}}
This specific form of self-fulfilling prophecy is very common and takes many forms. For example, the expectancy for a political party to act in a certain way—based on [[Internalized racism|race]], religion, gender and much more—can eventually lead the said party to imitate the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R. (19992000). Personality. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 492). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, media, and the arts==
In literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as [[plot device]]s. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.

===Classical===
Many myths, legends and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. "Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change". (Wilkins 1976:177).&lt;/ref&gt; In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.&lt;!--own what?--&gt; The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.

====Greek====
[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]
The best known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.

Although the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Danaë]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Danaë to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Danaë because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Danaë's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.

Greek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked—but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88&lt;/ref&gt; In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.

People do not necessarily have to unsuccessfully avoid a prophecy in order for the prophecy to be self-fulfilling. For example, when it was predicted that [[Zeus]] would overthrow his father, [[Cronus|Cronos]], and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, he actively waged war against him in a direct attempt to fulfill this prophecy. This makes the prophecy a self-fulfilling one because it was the prophecy itself that gave Zeus the inspiration to do it in the first place.

====Roman====
[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]
The story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him like he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.

====Persian====
Another example of a self-fulfilling prophecy is detailed by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his account of [[Cyrus the Great]]'s life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams. Both dreams involved something particular (in the first dream, a flood, while in the second dream, a fruit bearing vine) emerging from his daughter Mandane's pelvis and covering the entirety of Asia. After consulting the Magi, he was informed that the dreams
foreshadowed the birth of a child who would eventually rule in his place. Terrified by the prophecies, Astyages summoned [[Harpagus]] and commanded him to kill the child after it's born. Harpagus, however, was reluctant to kill the child and so assigned the task to one of Astyages' cowherds. The cowherd likewise hesitated and so he and his wife devised a plan to expose their own child, that was born dead, to a desolate place in the mountains while raising the other child as their own. The child was afterwards named Cyrus. One day, when Cyrus was 10 years old, an incident with one of the children he was playing with brought him before king Astyages to give account for his actions. While listening to Cyrus' words, Astyages became suspicious that Cyrus could be the child he wanted to kill. After pressuring his cowherd to relay to him everything about the child, the cowherd finally revealed everything about how he happened upon the child and how he decided to raise him as his own. Astyages, angered with Harpagus summoned him as well and Harpagus likewise revealed the truth. In revenge, the king killed Harpagus' son and later made this act known to Harpagus. However, he spared Cyrus' life as the magi, attempting to further clarify the prophecy to him, accidentally misinterpreted it and thus saved Cyrus. After some time Harpagus, possibly driven by revenge, took advantage of Cyrus' prosperous growth and Astyages' misdeeds to persuade him to revolt against Astyages. His efforts eventually proved successful as Cyrus became king and Astyages was imprisoned. {{sfn|Herodotus|p=1.107-130}}

====Arabic====
A variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is "[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the "[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in "[[The Tale of Attaf]]", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]
Self-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

====Russian====
[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad "The Song of the Wise Oleg". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].

====European fairy tales====
Many fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.

Another fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.

In some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.

====Shakespeare====
[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.

The later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should "Beware Macduff" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.

===Modern===
Similar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symoné]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it.

====New Thought====
The [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that "like attracts like" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, ''Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour'', Journal of Australian Studies: 101&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, all things are created first by imagination, which leads to thoughts, then to words and actions. The thoughts, words and actions held in mind affect someone's intentions which makes the expected result happen. Although there are some cases where positive or negative attitudes can produce corresponding results (principally the [[placebo]] and [[nocebo]] effects), there is no scientific basis to the law of attraction.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web

==Causal loop==
{{see also|Causal loop|Newcomb's paradox}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, 37–49&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he cannot change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}

A '''solo dance''' is [[dance]]d by an individual dancing alone, as opposed to [[Partner dance|couples]] dancing together but independently of others dancing at the same time, if any, and as opposed to [[Group dance|groups of people]] dancing simultaneously in a coordinated manner. Solo dancers are usually the best dancers in a group or dance school. Most solo dancers start after about 6–7 years of dance or sooner. Most soloists are company kids of their dance school. They are usually in more than one dance.

In [[Comparsa]]s, there are various soloists who strut in front.  They usually dance at the edges of the street so that the viewing public can appreciate their moves. Most male soloists carry a large lantern-like artifact on a large pole, resting on an oily pouch, which they make spin at will. Dance is a way to express emotions.

'''TV Avisen '''is the name of the [[news programme]] of the Danish TV channel [[DR1]].

== History ==
''TV Avisen'' was broadcast for the first time on 15 October 1965 - up until this point, television had already been broadcast regularly in [[Denmark]] for 14 years. This was due to an agreement signed between [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] and the press in 1926 which guaranteed the press' control of the broadcast of news on television and radio. The agreement remained in place after the introduction of [[television]] and was rescinded on 1 July 1964.

Initially, ''TV Avisen'' mostly consisted of footage from foreign [[news agencies]] with a musical accompaniment in the style of a [[newsreel]]. The programme began broadcasting in colour in October 1978. Five years later, the television news operation moved from its small studios at [[Radiohuset]] in [[Rosenørns Allé]] to [[TV-Byen]] in [[Gladsaxe]].

In 1988, DR lost its monopoly in Danish television news when second government broadcaster [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] (founded in 1988) began broadcasting its own news service. In an effort to compete, the main 7.30pm programme was replaced in 1993 by two evening bulletins at 6pm and 8.30pm. The following year, the programmes were moved half an hour later to 6.30pm and 9pm.

In 2006, the morning edition of ''TV Avisen'' was axed due to low viewing figures. In the same year, DR's television, radio and online operations were combined in the new [[DR Byen]] complex in [[Copenhagen]]. TV Avisen received a new design and began broadcasting in [[16:9]] widescreen. In 2012, the late evening programme was moved to 9.30pm on Monday - Thursday nights. On June 13 2017, TV Avisen was rebranded with updated titles and a new studio design.

== Current Broadcasting Times ==
* Daily at 18:30 for 30 minutes.
* Daily (except Saturday) at 21:30, Monday-Friday for 25 minutes and Sunday for 15 minutes.

== Features of the Programme ==
TV Avisen always begins with a short summary of the news. The top story tends to concern a Danish issue. TV Avisen has its own permanent correspondents in [[Washington DC]], [[New York City]], [[Rome]], [[Brussels]], [[China]] and the [[Middle East]], as well as a special climate correspondent.

As is usual for Danish television, reports which contain foreign languages (for example interviews with foreign politicians or foreign press conferences) are not dubbed in [[Danish language|Danish]], but subtitled. 

== Online Streaming ==
All TV Avisen programmes from the previous 30 days are available from the DR website. [[Livestreaming]] is only possible when using an [[IP address|IP]] address from Denmark.

'''''The Light Princess (Original Cast Recording)''''' is the commercial music release from the stage adaptation of the Scottish [[fairy tale]] by [[George MacDonald]].

''[[The Light Princess]]'' was the first stage musical to feature original compositions by singer-songwriter [[Tori Amos]]. The play debuted at London's [[Royal National Theatre]] on 9 October 2013 with music and lyrics by Amos and book and lyrics by Australian playwright and screenwriter [[Samuel Adamson]].

The story centres around teenage princess Althea of Lagobel who lost gravity when refusing to mourn over her mother’s death and is therefore bound to float above ground. When war breaks out Althea, pushed by her father to come to ground and take responsibility, flees only to fall in love with the rivalling kingdoms prince.

The musical opened to positive reviews in September 2013, starring [[Rosalie Craig]] in the titular role, subsequently singled out as a stand-out performance. Craig was nominated for many awards, and ultimately won the Evening Standard's award for best actress in a musical. The choreography, lighting, set design, music (Amos) and other cast performances were also lauded and nominated for a range of awards. In 2014, Amos stated that the production team had ambitions of bringing ''The Light Princess'' to American [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but expressed worry that the original National Theatre production might not be commercial enough for the American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.broadway.com/buzz/175796/odds-ends-anna-kendrick-finds-mr-right-tori-amos-broadway-hopes-for-the-light-princess-more |title= Odds &amp; Ends: Anna Kendrick Finds ''Mr. Right'', Tori Amos' Broadway Hopes for The Light Princess &amp; More! |last=Lloyd Webber |first=Imogen |authorlink=Imogen Lloyd Webber |date=5 May 2014 |website= Broadway.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Original Cast Recording features 30 original recordings by the cast plus three bonus tracks, including two performed by Amos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/light-princess-original-cast/id1037204134?app=itunes |title= The Light Princess (Original Cast Recording) at iTunes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early incarnation of the song "Coronation" appeared on Tori Amos's seasonal album [[Midwinter Graces]] in 2009. Then known as "Winter's Carol", much of the song's core melody remains the same as the version that would become "Coronation". In its place as the closing number of ''The Light Princess'', the lyrics, structure and arrangements have been almost completely re-written, though some lyrical content remains similar to "Winter's Carol".

'''''The Moon's a Balloon''''' is a [[best-selling]] memoir by British actor [[David Niven]] (1910–1983), published in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/71884561 |title=Brief Record (The moon's a balloon: reminiscences.) |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It details his early life. There have been several editions and many translations of the book over the years. Niven followed it with a sequel ''Bring on the Empty Horses'' in 1975.

The book is a funny yet tragic tale, detailing everything from the loss of Niven's father to his natural knowledge of how to lead a good life. 

The book is read by the character of Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman/Gene Takovic the [[Cinnabon]] Manager on his lunch break during the opening black and white scene of "Better Call Saul" season 3, episode one: "Mabel".
