[[File:Highsmithmaycompanywilshire.jpg|thumb|Future museum location at the 1939 [[Streamline Moderne]] [[May Company Building (Wilshire, Los Angeles)|May Company building]]]]

The '''Academy Museum of Motion Pictures''' is a future [[museum]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, currently under construction by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. Set to open in 2019, the Academy Museum will be the nation's first, large-scale museum entirely dedicated to the art, science, craft, business, and history of film. The permanent and rotating exhibits will provide an immersive experience for visitors to explore the cultural and creative contributions that Hollywood and the film industry have made around the world. &lt;ref name="Oscars"&gt;{{cite news|title=What Academy Museum Means For LA |url= http://www.oscars.org/museum/what-academy-museum-means-los-angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Museum will be established in the historic May Company building—renamed the Saban Building following a $50M gift from Cheryl and [[Haim Saban]]—located on the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax along Los Angeles' Museum Mile. The 300,000 square-foot facility is being designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect [[Renzo Piano]] with Renzo Piano Building Workshop and Gensler. &lt;ref name="Academy Museum"&gt;{{cite news |title=Academy Museum of Motion Pictures |url= https://www.academymuseum.org/#about}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project is currently led by [[Kerry Brougher]], Director of the Academy Museum, with NBCUniversal's Vice Chairman [[Ronald Meyer|Ron Meyer]] as head of the Academy Museum's Board of Trustees. &lt;ref name="LACMA Academy Museum"&gt;{{cite news|title=LACMA sees the big picture as Academy Museum moves in next door |url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ca-lacma-academy-museum-20150412-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


== Design ==
Pritzker-prize winning [[Renzo Piano]] designed two buildings for the 300,000 square-foot campus: the Saban Building (the former May Company building, a historical LA landmark) and The Sphere – a spherical structure featuring the 1,000-seat state-of-the-art David Geffen Theater and the Dolby Terrace, offering a panoramic view of the [[Hollywood Hills]], including the iconic [[Hollywood sign]]. 

The combined building space will include 50,000 square feet of galleries, two theaters, cutting edge project spaces, an outdoor piazza, a rooftop terrace with sweeping views of the Hollywood Hills, an active education studio, special event spaces, a restaurant, and store.

== Theaters ==
'''The David Geffen Theater''' 

Located in The Sphere building of the Museum, the 1,000-seat David Geffen Theater will represent the relationship between art and technology. The theater’s programming will include presentations illuminating the art of filmmaking, film premieres from new and established filmmakers, and other high-profile events. &lt;ref name= "Deadline Academy Museum"&gt; {{cite news|title=David Geffen Foundation Donates $25M To Academy Museum of Motion Pictures: New Theatre To Be Named For Him |url= http://deadline.com/2013/04/david-geffen-foundation-donates-25m-to-academy-museum-of-motion-pictures-theater-to-be-named-for-him-470041/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
'''Ted Mann Theater'''

The 288-seat Ted Mann Theater will provide a more intimate space for visitors and will offer special programs and screenings. &lt;ref name= "Academy Museum Raises"&gt; {{cite news|title=Academy Museum Raises $5M From 3 Gifts|url= http://deadline.com/2013/07/academy-museum-raises-5m-from-3-gifts-547181//}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
Since the 1930s, the Academy has been collecting movie-related materials and is now considered the world's prominent curator of cinema history. The Academy's permanent collection of over 12 million photographs, 190,000 video assets, 80,000 screenplays, 61,000 posters and over 104,000 pieces of production art will influence the Museum's future exhibitions. &lt;ref name= "Academy Museum Collection"&gt;{{cite news|title=Collection Overview|url= http://www.oscars.org/museum/collection}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Some key objects in the Museum's collection include:
*Dorothy's ruby red slippers from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939)
*[[Shirley Temple]]'s tap shoes from ''[[The Little Colonel (1935 film)|The Little Colonel]]'' (1935)
*Typewriter used to write the screenplay for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960)
*Only surviving shark mold from ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975)
*Tablets from ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956)
*The Aries 1B spaceship model from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968)

== Board of Trustees ==
Formed in December 2017, the Board of Trustees serves as the main governing body of the Museum and is responsible for overseeing the Museum’s overall strategic vision. The Board comprises 12 film-industry professionals with the intention to add more Trustees in the future.

Currently, the Trustees include: [[NBCUniversal]] Vice Chairman [[Ronald Meyer|Ron Meyer]] (Chair),  [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] President [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]], [[Blumhouse Productions]] founder [[Jason Blum]] (Treasurer), [[Paramount Pictures]] Chairman and CEO [[Jim Gianopulos]], five-time Oscar nominated actor [[Tom Hanks]], [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] CEO [[Dawn Hudson]], [[LucasFilm]] President [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]], [[Cinepolis]] CEO Alejandro Ramirez Magaña, [[Netflix]] CCO [[Ted Sarandos]] (Vice-Chair), K Period Media founder [[Kimberly Steward]], world-renowned fashion designer [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], and [[Dolby Laboratories]] President and CEO Kevin Yeaman. &lt;ref name= "Board of Trustees"&gt; {{cite news|title=Academy Museum Sets Board of Trustees Under Ron Meyer |url= http://deadline.com/2017/12/academy-museum-board-of-trustees-ron-meyer-ted-sarandos-list-1202220647/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Angers Fragment''' is four [[parchment]] pages from c. 1200. It is one of the four fragments remaining of the original [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]] ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. This fragment is the only fragment attested to be of Saxo's own handwriting. It consists of four pages with 8 written sides.

==History==
It is first spoken of in [[Albert Lemarchand]]'s book ''Catalogue des manuscripts de la Bibliothèque d'Angers'', 1863, page 90, in the same library where it had been used as binding for an old book from the 15th century. First identified in 1877, by [[Gaston Paris]] and in 1878 exchanged to the [[Danish Royal Library]] for the manuscript charter of the [[Priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs|abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs]] in [[Paris]]. It has the Royal Library signature of ''Ny kgl. Saml. 4to, 869 g''.

Correspond to page 24-29 in [[Peter Erasmus Müller]] Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1839 or page 11.19 – 16.29 in [[Jørgen Olrik]] &amp; H. Ræder's Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1931.

The '''''Annuario Pontificio''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for ''Pontifical Yearbook'') is the annual directory of the [[Holy See]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. It [[List of popes|lists all the popes]] to date and all officials of the Holy See's [[dicastery|departments]]. It also gives complete lists with contact information of the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[Catholic bishop]]s throughout the world, the [[diocese]]s (with statistics about each), the departments of the [[Roman Curia]], the Holy See's [[diplomatic mission]]s abroad, the [[embassy|embassies]] accredited to the Holy See, the headquarters of [[religious institute]]s (again with statistics on each), certain academic institutions, and other similar information. The index includes, along with all the names in the body of the book, those of all priests who have been granted the title of "[[Monsignor]]".
As the title suggests, the red-covered yearbook, compiled by the [[Central Statistics Office of the Church]] and published by [[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]], is mostly in Italian.

The 2015 edition had more than 2,400 pages and cost {{€|78}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanum.com/en/annuario-pontificio-2015-book-2|access-date=April 5, 2016|title=Annuario Pontificio 2015|publisher=Città del Vaticano}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the ''Pontifical Yearbook of 2017'', the number of Catholics in the world increased to 1,284,810,000 at the end of 2015.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

A [[yearbook]] of the Catholic Church was published, with some interruptions, from 1716 to 1859 by the Cracas printing firm in Rome, under the title (in Italian) ''Information for the Year ...'' From 1851, a department of the Holy See began producing a different publication called (in Italian) ''Hierarchy of the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church Worldwide and in Every Rite, with historical notes'', which took the title ''Annuario Pontificio'' in 1860, but ceased publication in 1870. This was the first yearbook published by the Holy See itself, but its compilation was entrusted to the newspaper ''[[Giornale di Roma]]''. The publishers "Fratelli Monaldi" (Monaldi Brothers) began in 1872 to produce their own yearbook entitled (in Italian) ''The Catholic Hierarchy and the Papal Household for the Year ... with an appendix of other information concerning the Holy See''.

The [[Holy See Press Office|Vatican Press]] took this over in 1885, thus making it a semi-official publication.  It bore the indication "official publication" from 1899 to 1904, but this ceased when, giving the word "official" a more restricted sense, the ''Acta Sanctae Sedis'', forerunner of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', was declared the only "official" publication of the Holy See. In 1912, it resumed the title ''Annuario Pontificio''. From 1912 to 1924, it included not only lists of names, but also brief illustrative notes on departments of the [[Roman Curia]] and on certain posts within the [[papal court]], a practice to which it returned in 1940.

For some years, beginning in 1898, the ''Maison de [[la Bonne Presse]]'' publishing house of [[Paris]] produced a similar yearbook in [[French language|French]] called ''Annuaire Pontifical Catholique'', not compiled by the Holy See. This contained much additional information, such as detailed historical articles on the [[Swiss Guards]] and the [[Apostolic Palace|Papal Palace]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].

== Statistical data ==
According to the ''Annuario Pontificio 2012'' the statistical data given in the yearbook regarding [[archdiocese]]s and [[diocese]]s are furnished by the diocesan curias concerned and reflect the diocesan situation on 31 December of the year prior to the date on the yearbook, unless there is another indication.  The data recorded are shown in the following order next to these abbreviations:
* Su – area in square kilometers of the diocesan territory
* pp – population of the diocese
* ct – number of Catholics
* pr – parishes and quasi-parishes
* ch – churches or mission stations
* sd – secular priests resident in the diocese
* dn – diocesan priests ordained during the year
* sr – religious priests resident in the diocese
* rn – religious priests ordained during the year
* dp – permanent deacons
* sm – seminarians taking courses of philosophy and theology
* rm – members of men's religious institutes
* rf – members of women's religious institutes
* ie – educational institutes
* ib – charitable institutes
* ba – baptisms

* ''Volumes X, XI and XII:'' [[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu]]'s city books of Italy, covering the [[Papal States]], [[Rome]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], all of 1663.
* ''Volumes XIII and XIV:'' Two volumes of the French edition of Blaeu's ''[[Atlas Maior]]'', covering France and Switzerland, both of 1663.
* ''Volumes XV and XVI:'' Blaeu's ''[[Toonneel der Steeden]]'', city books covering both the [[Dutch Republic|Northern]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands|Southern Netherlands]], of 1649
* ''Volume XVII:'' [[Pieter Goos]]'s ''Zee-atlas ofte water-wereld'' (''Maritime Atlas or Water World'') of 1676
* ''Volume XVIII:'' The French edition of [[Johannes Janssonius]]'s ''Zeeatlas'' (''Maritime Atlas'') of 1657

The Atlas van Loon was acquired by the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in 1996.

[[File:Saint Augustine Portrait.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Augustine (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1480, [[Chiesa di Ognissanti]], [[Florence, Italy]].]]
The '''Augustine of Hippo bibliography''' contains a list of works published by fourth-century Christian bishop and theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]].
{{augustine}}
Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.&lt;ref&gt;Passage based on F. A. Wright and T. A. Sinclair, ''A History of Later Latin Literature'' (London 1931), pp. 56 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermons]] and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life. 

Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''Confessions'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate dei'' (''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the sack of [[Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time. He also wrote ''On Free Choice Of The Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

==Works==
* ''On the Beautiful and the Fitting'' ({{lang-la|De Pulchra et Apto}}, 380)
* ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'' ({{lang-la|De doctrina Christiana}}, 397–426)

* ''[[Retractationes]]'' (''Retractations''): At the end of his life (c. 426–428) Augustine revisited his previous works in chronological order. The English translation of the title has led some to assume that at the end of his career, Augustine retreated from his earlier theological positions. In fact, the Latin title literally means 're-treatments" (not "Retractions") and though in this work Augustine suggested what he would have said differently, it provides little in the way of actual "retraction." It does, however, give the reader a rare picture of the development of a writer and his final thoughts.

{{refimprove|date=March 2015}}

The '''barber [[paradox]]''' is a [[puzzle]] derived from [[Russell's paradox]]. It was used by [[Bertrand Russell]] himself as an illustration of the [[paradox]], though he attributes it to an unnamed person who suggested it to him.&lt;ref name=atomism&gt;''The Philosophy of Logical Atomism'', reprinted in ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, 1914-19'', Vol 8., p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; It shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible. Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself.

== Paradox ==
&lt;!-- Please don't add supposed resolutions of the paradox here; when properly phrased, the only solution is that no such barber can exist. Otherwise, see the "Non-paradoxical variations" section. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Why not?  "Non-paradoxical variations" suggest that Barber paradox without variations is really a paradox, which it is not. --&gt;

The barber is the "one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves." The question is, does the barber shave himself?&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell:
 ''The Philosophy of Logical Atomism'', 1918, in: ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', 1914-19, Vol 8., p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Answering this question results in a contradiction. The barber cannot shave himself as he only shaves those who do not shave themselves. As such, if he shaves himself he ceases to be the barber. Conversely, if the barber does not shave himself, then he fits into the group of people who would be shaved by the barber, and thus, as the barber, he must shave himself.

== History ==

This paradox is often incorrectly attributed to [[Bertrand Russell]] (e.g., by [[Martin Gardner]] in ''Aha!''). It was suggested to him as an alternative form of [[Russell's paradox]],&lt;ref name=atomism/&gt; which he had devised to show that [[set theory]] as it was used by [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] contained contradictions. However, Russell denied that the Barber's paradox was an instance of his own:

{{Quotation|That contradiction [Russell's paradox] is extremely interesting. You can modify its form; some forms of modification are valid and some are not. I once had a form suggested to me which was not valid, namely the question whether the barber shaves himself or not. You can define the barber as "one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves." The question is, does the barber shave himself? In this form the contradiction is not very difficult to solve. But in our previous form I think it is clear that you can only get around it by observing that the whole question whether a class is or is not a member of itself is nonsense, i.e. that no class either is or is not a member of itself, and that it is not even true to say that, because the whole form of words is just noise without meaning.|Bertrand Russell, ''The Philosophy of Logical Atomism''}}

This point is elaborated further under [[Russell's paradox#Applied versions|Applied versions of Russell's paradox]].

== In first-order logic ==

: &lt;math&gt;(\exists x ) (\text{person}(x) \wedge (\forall y) (\text{person}(y) \rightarrow (\text{shaves}(x, y)  \leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(y, y))))&lt;/math&gt;

This sentence is unsatisfiable (a contradiction) because of the [[Universal quantification|universal quantifier]] &lt;math&gt;(\forall)&lt;/math&gt;. The universal quantifier y will include every single element in the domain, including our infamous barber x. So when the value x is assigned to y, the sentence can be rewritten to &lt;math&gt; \text{shaves}(x,x)\leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;, which is an instance of the contradiction &lt;math&gt;a \leftrightarrow \neg a&lt;/math&gt;.

== In Prolog ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
In [[Prolog]], one aspect of the barber paradox can be expressed by a self-referencing clause:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="prolog"&gt;
shaves(barber, X) :- person(X), not shaves(X,X).
person(barber).
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

where [[negation as failure]] is assumed. If we apply the [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] test known from [[Datalog]], the predicate shaves is exposed as unstratifiable since it is defined recursively over its negation.

== In literature ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

In his book ''Alice in Puzzleland'', the [[logic]]ian [[Raymond Smullyan]] had the character [[Humpty Dumpty]] explain the apparent paradox to [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]. Smullyan argues that the paradox is akin to the statement "I know a man who is both five feet tall and six feet tall," in effect claiming that the "paradox" is merely a [[contradiction]] and not a true paradox at all, as the two [[axiom]]s above are mutually exclusive. A paradox is supposed to arise from plausible and apparently consistent statements; Smullyan suggests that the "rule" the barber is supposed to be following is too absurd to seem plausible. 

The paradox is also mentioned several times in David Foster Wallace's first novel, ''[[The Broom of the System]],'' as well as ''[[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood|The Information]]'' by James Gleick. In Timescape by Gregory Benford a high street barber shop sign states, "Barrett is willing to shave all, and only, men unwilling to shave themselves."

== Multiple barbers ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
If the paradox is altered so that there may be multiple barbers in the town, then the paradox may or may not be resolved, depending on the exact phrasing of the initial rules.

If the initial rules state that every man in town must keep himself clean-shaven, either by
# Shaving himself, or
# going to a barber.
(but not both at once), then the paradox is solved. Each barber can be shaved by another barber.

However, if the initial rules describe the responsibilities of the barbers rather than the town's residents in general, then the paradox remains. In this version, the rules state that each barber must shave everyone in town who does not shave himself (and no one else). If Barber A asks Barber B to shave his beard, then Barber A counts as "a person who does not shave himself". But because of this classification, Barber A must shave himself, rather than let Barber B do it for him. However, if Barber A is shaving himself, then he must ''not'' shave himself. Either way, Barber A is stuck. Other barbers face the same problem.

== Non-paradoxical variations ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
A modified version of the barber paradox is frequently encountered in the form of a [[brain teaser]] puzzle or joke. The joke is phrased nearly identically to the standard paradox, but omitting a detail that allows an answer to escape the paradox entirely. For example, the puzzle can be stated as occurring in a small town whose barber claims: I shave ''all'' and ''only'' the men in our town who do not shave themselves. This version identifies the sex of the clients, but omits the sex of the barber, so a simple solution is that ''the barber is a woman''. The barber's claim applies to only "men in our town," so there is no paradox if the barber is a woman (or a gorilla, or a child, or a man from some other town—or anything other than a "man in our town"). Such a variation is not considered to be a paradox at all: the true barber paradox requires the contradiction arising from the situation where the barber's claim applies to himself.

Notice that the paradox still occurs if we claim that the barber is a man in our town with a beard. In this case, the barber does not shave himself (because he has a beard); but then according to his claim (that he shaves all men who do not shave themselves), he must shave himself.

In a similar way, the paradox still occurs if the barber is a man in our town who ''cannot'' grow a beard. Once again, he does not shave himself (because he has no hair on his face), but that implies that he does shave himself.

[[Image:CommonWorshipBooks.jpg|thumb|Three ''Common Worship'' liturgy books. From left to right they are ''Daily Prayer'' (red), ''Pastoral Services'' (green) and the ''Main Volume'' (black).]]'''''Common Worship''''' is the name given to the series of services authorised by the General Synod of the [[Church of England]] and launched on the first Sunday of [[Advent]] in 2000. It represents the most recent stage of development of the [[Liturgical Movement]] within the Church and is the successor to the ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'' (ASB) of 1980. Like the ASB, it is an alternative to the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP) of 1662, which remains officially the normative liturgy of the Church of England.

It has been published as a series of books, rather than a single volume, offering a wider choice of forms of worship than any of its predecessors. It was drafted by the Church of England's [[Liturgical]] Commission; the material was then either authorised by [[General Synod]] (sometimes with amendments), or simply commended for use by the [[House of Bishops]].

==Series==
The main ''Common Worship'' book is called '''''Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England'''''. It was published in 2000 alongside '''''Common Worship: President's Edition'''''. These volumes contain the material for Sunday services but, unlike the ASB, contain no readings.

The third book to be published (also in 2000), '''''Common Worship: Pastoral Services''''', provides for the first time a range of healing services as well as revised provision for weddings and funerals. The former has a completely rewritten preface that no longer describes the threefold purposes of marriage and is much more secular in tone. It includes, for the first time, a congregational response to the declarations by the couple and a long nuptial blessing. The funeral provisions includes material for before and after the service, all completely rewritten. The funeral now includes an optional penitential section, no longer has a required psalm and includes set intercessions. It also allows for a eulogy by one of the mourners, a new departure, at the beginning of the service.

In 2005 the fourth book, '''''Common Worship: Daily Prayer''''', was published. The form and style of daily morning and evening prayer no longer shows the influence of the ''BCP'' but the work of the English Franciscan community and its book ''[[Celebrating Common Prayer]]''. The offices are not dissimilar to those of the Roman Catholic Church. Penitence becomes optional, as does the Creed; the ''[[Te Deum]]'' disappears almost completely, and a Gospel canticle—the ''[[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]]'' in the morning and the ''[[Magnificat]]'' in the evening—follows the reading(s); there is a wide range of intercessions; collects are provided for lesser festivals (unlike in the main book); and there is a [[psalter]]. Both the book and the new daily lectionary were tried out in parishes before final publication.

In 2006, three more volumes, '''''Common Worship: Christian Initiation''''', '''''Common Worship: Ordination Services''''' and '''''Common Worship: Times and Seasons''''', were published. In the first, there is provision for Baptism, Confirmation and related rites (including Reconciliation). In the second, there are rites for the ordination of deacons, priests and bishops. In the third, there is provision for all the seasons of the church's year, including sections on the Agricultural Year and [[Ember days|Embertide]].&lt;ref&gt;Church of England, [https://www.churchofengland.org/media/41162/tsembertide.pdf Embertide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final book, '''''Common Worship: Festivals''''', was published in 2008 and provides [[Proper (liturgy)|propers]] for all the [[Festival (Church of England)|Festivals]] and [[Lesser Festival]]s of the Church of England's [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar]].

Several other books, although not part of the principal series, are part of the ''Common Worship'' series. Some reproduce parts of ''Common Worship'' in a different or more concise form, such as ''Holy Communion Order One'', ''Additional Collects'', ''Funeral'', ''Marriage'', ''Rites on the Way'', ''Ministry to the Sick'', ''The Reconciliation of a Penitent Form One'', ''Holy Week and Easter'' (includes readings), and ''Time to Pray'' (containing Prayer During the Day and Night Prayer). Those that contain material not found in the rest of ''Common Worship'' series include books of readings (e.g. the ''Daily Eucharistic Lectionary''), the annual lectionary (with references only), and ''Proclaiming the Passion: The Passion Narratives in Dramatized Form''. Although not part of ''Common Worship'', ''New Patterns for Worship'' is part of the same liturgical phase in the Church of England.

==Content and style==
{{advert|section|date=December 2013}}
''Common Worship'' represents a radical change in the distribution of liturgy and production of worship materials within the Church of England. It is published in electronic as well as paper form, with the intent that congregations can assemble their own orders of service using the forms they prefer for each section of the service, and if desired extend them with prayers and readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 5
| pages = 33–64

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers a wider choice of forms for each section of the liturgy than any previous liturgy. Many churches have produced separate books for each of a number of different types of service (Parish Communion, all age service, different church seasons, etc.) to their own specifications. A software package (''Visual Liturgy'', for [[Microsoft Windows]] only) is designed to facilitate the production of complete material for each Sunday, including [[hymn]]s.

Like the ''ASB'', ''Common Worship'' is mostly in modern language (though it retains versions of the [[Eucharist]] and other material in the language and using the structure of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''). The text of the modern language Eucharist is essentially identical to Rite A of the ASB and derives from the work of the [[International Commission on English in the Liturgy]]. The wording of the [[Ordinary (liturgy)|ordinary of the mass]] was therefore very similar to that of the first English version of the post-[[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] [[Roman Missal]] (used until 2011). Unlike the ''ASB'' it consists not of one book but of several. The main book includes the Sunday services of [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] and [[Evening Prayer (Common Worship)|Evening Prayer]], [[Baptism]] (though not [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]]), and various forms of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]], including eight Eucharistic Prayers, not all of which adhere to the [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytan]] form, and all of which are designed to be interpreted in a broadly [[Reformed]] sense, avoiding, for example, explicitly epicletic language with regard to the elements themselves. A separate book styled ''Pastoral Services'' contains the forms for Wholeness and Healing, [[Marriage]], emergency Baptism, Thanksgiving for the Gift of a Child, and [[Funeral]]s. The ''Daily Prayer'' book was published in 2005 (although a "Preliminary edition" circulated before that) and the seasonal book, ''Times and Seasons'' in 2006. This last is intended to make revised provision for the winter period including Advent, and Epiphany as far as Candlemas - thus replacing the book, ''The Promise of his Glory'' - and to replace the book ''Lent, Holy Week and Easter''.

The new [[lectionary]] authorised at the same time derives from the 1969 Roman Catholic ''Common Lectionary'', which was revised in 1983 with ecumenical input as the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] and adopted by many denominations worldwide. The Common Worship lectionary differs from the Revised Common Lectionary at certain times of the year. This runs on a three-year cycle, A, B, and C, with, respectively, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] being given the Gospel readings in one of the three years. The attempt to provide themes has been deliberately abandoned in favor of writers having their own voice in a sequence of readings, either of the whole book or, where books are long, parts of it. One of the reasons for this was to encourage consecutive expository preaching. There is, however, some provision for themes, in that the [[Old Testament]] reading can be chosen either to run continuously or to be chosen because it relates to the [[Gospel]]. No such provision is made for the [[New Testament]] reading. Material from [[Gospel of John|St John]]'s gospel is introduced at various points, especially at Festivals and in the summer of Year B.

The books provide a huge number of alternatives, rather than a single form, extending the process begun with the ''Alternative Services Book'', but with the clear intention that it be treated as a resource book rather than used for worship. The expectation (contained in the electronic version) is that parishes will print (or project onto screens) texts for each week. The Service of the Word, authorised earlier but now incorporated into ''Common Worship'', somewhat resembles the ''[[Directory of Public Worship]]'' produced during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], containing as it does directions as to structure rather than a full liturgy. The "common" of ''Common Worship'' is in the framework and structure for each service but then allowing for a variety of prayers and resources to be used within those common structures. In that respect it is a departure from [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]]'s principle of uniformity: 'from henceforth all the whole Realm shall have but one use'.

The desire for diversity and variation has been criticised by some scholars, such as Mark Dalby (''The Renewal of Common Prayer'' ed Perham (CHP 1993)), as making light of the principle of worship being 'common prayer'. Common Worship bears more than a passing resemblance to the pre-Reformation church of which Cranmer commented 'many times there was more business to find out what should be read than to read it when it was found out'. Others, however, have challenged this view. ''Common Worship Today'' (Mark Earey and Gilly Myers, eds.) makes the point that worship has always been more diverse than is implied by the use of a single book, and views diversity as realistic and necessary.

One other respect in which ''Common Worship'' differs from its predecessor is in relation to the [[saints]]. While in the main volume only one eucharistic preface is provided for the saints, other books in the series (particularly ''Common Worship: Daily Prayer'' and ''Common Worship: Festivals'') provide far more resources. The provision is distinctly Anglican, however, in that individuals are included who have not undergone formal canonization. The text tends to avoid statements about the eternal destiny of those who are celebrated.

==Drafting and approval==

The services and resources that comprise ''Common Worship'' represent the latest stage of a process of liturgical revision that began in the 1920s. They were originally drafted by the Liturgical Commission. The Commission is made up of a variety of people with different expertise, including lay people, parish clergy and bishops, liturgists, and theologians. The material was passed on to the [[House of Bishops]], which amended the material as it saw fit. It was then presented to the [[General Synod]].

Forms of services that were alternative to equivalents in the Book of Common Prayer were debated by Synod and revised by a synodical Revision Committee in the light of the comments made by Synod members and the wider public. The House of Bishops then reconsidered them, put them into their final form and submitted them to the General Synod for Final Approval as Authorized Services. To be authorized, each service had to gain a two-thirds majority in each House of the Synod ([[bishop]]s, [[clergy]], and [[laity]]).

Additional material, which had no equivalent in the ''Book of Common Prayer'', was debated by the [[General Synod]] and then put in its final form and Commended by the House of Bishops.

In the case of authorized services in ''Common Worship'', the [[Archbishops' Council]] gave some 800 parishes permission to use draft forms of service on an experimental basis before they were presented to the General Synod. The services were adjusted in the light of feedback from this "field testing".

''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' are American [[media franchise]]s which present alternative scenarios of space adventure. The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of [[intellectual property]], providing employment and [[entertainment]] for billions of people around the world.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=130035|title=Trekkers VS Lucasites|date=May 14, 1999|author=Richard Ho|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
''Star Trek'' was introduced as [[Star Trek: The Original Series|a live-action television series]] in 1966 that lasted three years. ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matt |last=Forbeck|title=Star Wars vs. Star Trek: Could the Empire kick the Federation's ass? And other galaxy-shaking enigmas|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=J1sSa6uBdlQC}}|date=18 April 2011|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-2577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the subsequent publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, ''Star Trek'' grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/07/18/star-trek-vs-star-wars-the-space-battle-that-will-never-end/|title=Star Trek vs Star Wars: the space battle that will never end|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' was introduced as a feature film, ''[[A New Hope (film)|A New Hope]]'' (1977). A novelization titled ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'', based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, ''Star Wars'' quickly grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

==Differences==
''Star Trek'' debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and the adventure stories of [[Horatio Hornblower]], but evolved into an idealistic, [[utopia]]n prospect of future human society. Inspired by ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'',&lt;ref name="Simon1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Keller Simon|title=Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOtvQHj1AdIC&amp;pg=PA139|date=23 November 1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92442-0|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Clark|title=Star Trek FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the First Voyages of the Starship Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_lxVMh_5xwC&amp;pg=PT22|date=1 April 2012|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=978-1-55783-963-3|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Trek''{{'}}s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. ''Star Trek'' occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] and [[Multiverse|interdimensional travel]]. The [[Earth in science fiction|Earth of the ''Star Trek'']] universe shares most of its history with the real world.

''Star Wars'' debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. ''Star Wars'' mainly belongs to the [[space opera]] [[subgenre]] of science fiction that follows [[The Hero's Journey]]&lt;ref&gt;Clive Williams, The Hero’s Journey: A Mudmap for Change, Journal of Humanistic Psychology, (002216781770549), (2017).
Crossref&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by works such as [[Beowulf]], [[King Arthur]]&lt;ref name=Dreams&gt;''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''. ''Star Wars'' Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucasfilm|title=Star Wars and History|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=m81Bg4E_y_IC}}|date=15 October 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-28525-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. ''Star Wars'' is set "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away", although many characters are human, occasionally use [[Earth]] metaphors and exhibit human character traits.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. ''Star Wars'' has not produced any live-action television series while ''Star Trek'' has produced seven live-action television series.

''Star Trek'' likewise has not produced any [[television film]]s; whereas ''Star Wars'' has produced at least three live-action television films outside the ''Star Wars'' film saga. The ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', ''[[Ewoks: Caravan of Courage]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: Battle for Endor]]'' are all live-action television spin-off films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe, but not considered part of the official ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Star Wars canon]]''.

===Runtime===
* ~513 hours (''Star Trek'' television) + ~25 hours (''Star Trek'' films)
* ~84 hours (''Star Wars'' films) + ''Star Wars'' canon series + expanded universe films and TV productions.

==Similarities and commonalities==
Aside from both having the word ''star'' in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the [[space western]] subgenre.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Both stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in ''Star Trek'' consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the [[United Federation of Planets]]. ''Star Wars'' depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and was again later reformed into a new society called the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]] after a series of wars.

Both franchises promote philosophical and political messages.

The primary philosophies of ''Star Trek'' convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was inspired by [[morality play|morality tales]] such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="Simon1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"/&gt;

The primary philosophical messages of ''Star Wars'' are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another.&lt;ref name="Decker2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin S. |last=Decker|title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pDMRdxLocsUC}}|date=1 October 2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=978-1-4596-0101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' preaches against [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] systems and favors societies that offer equality.&lt;ref name="Redmond2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sean |last=Redmond|title=Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ha5O_0BCCrgC|page=303}}|year=2004|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-87-1|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on the ''Star Wars'' 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, [[Patrick Stewart]] stated "A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of ''Star Wars'' is a very very positive one."

There have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' and ''Seaquest''.

Both franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]]. Many planets and alien species in ''Star Trek'', for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various ''Star Trek'' television series, such as "[[Who Mourns for Adonais]]", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings.&lt;ref name="Kapell2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew Wilhelm |last=Kapell|title=Star Trek as Myth: Essays on Symbol and Archetype at the Final Frontier|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hWS7v3pGynUC}}|date=1 March 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5594-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also make references to [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]] and its [[Babylonian religion|mythic folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksarchive.com/viewstory.php?sid=4899|title=Star Trek as Myth Through an Analysis of the Similarities and Differences Between the Gilgamesh/Enkidu and Kirk/Spock Relationships|publisher=The Kirk/Spock fanfiction archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Klingon]]s and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencynow.com/startrek/startrek1.htm|title=Star Trek And the New Myth of the Machine as Seen in the Talosians, Trelane, and the Organians|work=Ken Sanes|publisher=Transperancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ''Star Wars''{{'}} story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including [[Classical antiquity|classical Greece and Rome]], such as the fall of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] in ''Star Wars'', followed by the rise of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], which parallels the fall of the ancient [[Roman Republic]] followed by the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

A 1983 documentary on the making of ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' was hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]], who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.blastr.com/2014-2-20/leonard-nimoy-hosts-1983-return-jedi-set-visit-awesome-long-lost-clip|title=Leonard Nimoy hosts 1983 Return of the Jedi set visit in this awesome, long-lost clip|work=Trent Moore|publisher=SyFyWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abrams era ===
[[J. J. Abrams]], director and producer of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and producer of ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016), directed and produced ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015). ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as [[Simon Pegg]] starred in both series.

''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002) was poorly received and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.

The newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/star-wars-abu-dhabi-the-worthy-zinzana-rattle-the-cage-justice-1201677541/|title=Star Wars: The Force Awakens Helps Abu Dhabi Build Road To Somewhere - Deadline|author=Ali Jaafar|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scenes for cities in the film ''Star Trek Beyond'' (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates247.com/entertainment/star-trek-beyond-descends-on-dubai-jlt-difc-raided-2015-10-13-1.606444|title='Star Trek Beyond' descends on Dubai: JLT, DIFC 'raided'|work=Emirates 24-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.

==Estimated financial comparisons==
Despite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the ''Star Wars'' film series exceed the profit of the ''Star Trek'' film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.

==Critique and commentaries==
Science fiction writer [[David Brin]] criticized ''Star Wars'' at the time of the release of ''The Phantom Menace'', arguing that while the ''Star Wars'' movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with ''Star Wars'' and George Lucas, whom he accused of "having an agenda", is that the ''Star Wars'' galaxy is too "elitist", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the [[Galactic Civil War]] as part of the "same genetically superior royal family".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/|title="Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists|first=David|last=Brin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds the ''Star Wars'' universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that [[Luke Skywalker]] killing [[Palpatine]] would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Among the many other flaws he sees with ''Star Wars'' is that [[Anakin Skywalker]] becomes a hero in the ending of ''Return of the Jedi'' simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, ''Star Trek'' is "democratic" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

[[William Shatner]] argues that ''Star Trek'' is superior to ''Star Wars''. According to him, "''Star Trek'' had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions."&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Shatner believes that ''Star Wars'' was only better than ''Star Trek'' in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, ''Star Trek'' was able to "supersede ''Star Wars'' on every level".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/william-shatner-star-trek-star-wars_n_964530.html|title=William Shatner: 'Star Wars Is Derivative Of Star Trek'|first1=Gazelle Emami Deputy Features|last1=Editor|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=15 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Russ]], who played [[Tuvok]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that ''Star Trek'' reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. ''Star Wars'' in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the [[Eastern philosophy]] of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, ''Star Trek'' comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in "our" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas ''Star Wars'' takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

[[Jeremy Bulloch]] is best known for his role as [[Boba Fett]] in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. He is a huge fan of ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. He argued that while both franchises are popular, ''Star Wars'' comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

Contrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued, "''Trek'' fandom revolves around technology because the ''Star Trek'' universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and ''Gong Show''-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. [[Physics and Star Wars|The science in ''Star Wars'']] is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because ''Star Wars'' isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second [[Death Star]] works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/technology/game-theory-star-wars-world-with-a-sense-of-humor.html|title='Star Wars' World With a Sense of Humor|date=29 October 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wenzel of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' highlighted two differences in approach, noting the "swashbuckling" and "gunslinger" style of ''Star Wars'' compared with ''Star Trek''{{'}}s "broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity" and that the spiritual aspect of ''Star Wars'' contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13518101|title="Star Wars" vs. "Star Trek": The final frontier of marketing is an expanding universe|author=John Wenzel|date=11 October 2009|publisher=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billionaire [[Peter Thiel]] told Dowd "I'm a capitalist. ''Star Wars'' is the capitalist show. ''Star Trek'' is the communist one". He further stated "There is no money in ''Star Trek'' because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of ''Star Wars'' starts with [[Han Solo]] having this debt that he owes and so the plot in ''Star Wars'' is driven by money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/peter-thiel-star-trek-communist-star-wars-capitalist/|title=Peter Thiel Thinks 'Star Trek' Is 'Communist' While 'Star Wars' Is 'Capitalist'|date=11 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archived footage in ''[[Trek Nation]]'' showed [[Gene Roddenberry]] saying, "I like ''Star Wars''. It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;[[Trek Nation]] [2010 documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on each other==
{{see also|Star Wars sources and analogues}} 
The two franchises have a "symbiotic relationship" stated Shatner, who credits ''Star Wars'' for launching the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]].&lt;ref name="dominguez19990517"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112134840/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archivedate=2012-01-12 | title=William Shatner's Trek Never Ends The Actor-author Keeps Seeking New Challenges While Feeding Fans' Hunger For All Things Kirk | work=New York Daily News | date=1999-05-17 | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 ''Star Trek'' fan convention in [[Las Vegas]] by stating "''Star Wars'' created ''Star Trek''". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first ''Star Wars'' film (''A New Hope''), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A ''Star Trek'' relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/08/07/william-shatner-says-star-wars-created-star-trek/|title=William Shatner Says Star Wars Created Star Trek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It was ''Star Wars'' that thrust ''Star Trek'' into the people of Paramount's consciousness" Shatner stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/06/media/william-shatner-star-wars-star-trek/index.html|title=Captain Kirk thanks Star Wars!|first=Jose|last=Pagliery|date=6 August 2016|website=CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/07/star-trek-star-wars-shatner/|title=William Shatner: 'Star Trek' owes a big thanks to 'Star Wars'|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|website=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''[[Trek Nation]]'' features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that ''Star Trek'' was an influence while writing the original screenplay for ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; He explained that while both franchises were so "far out", ''Star Trek'' produced a fanbase that "softened up the entertainment arena" so that ''Star Wars'' could "come along and stand on its shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars/26348/george-lucas-on-how-star-trek-helped-star-wars|title=George Lucas on how Star Trek helped Star Wars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call ''Star Wars'' a "derivative" of ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A few references to ''Star Wars'' have been inserted into ''Star Trek'' films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from ''Star Wars'' in both ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/10/star-wars-r2d2-star-trek-into-darkness|title=Star Wars droid R2D2 spotted in Star Trek Into Darkness|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2013-09-10|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''Star Trek'' films and television episodes used the ''Star Wars'' animation shop, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], for their special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilm.com/archive/|title=Archive|newspaper=Industrial Light &amp; Magic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Roddenberry was honored at a ''Star Trek'' convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as [[Darth Vader]]. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of ''Star Wars'' and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Comic relief==
William Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' [[American Film Institute]] Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfilm.afi.com/issue/2013/4/film-exclusive|title=Shatner Honors Lucas|publisher=American Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a live concert, Shatner dressed as an [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|imperial stormtrooper]] singing "[[Girl Crush]]" alongside [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Brad Paisley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6753087/william-shatner-star-wars-stormtrooper-girl-crush-cmas|title=William Shatner Dresses as 'Star Wars' Stormtrooper, Sings 'Girl Crush' at CMAs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Shatner and [[Carrie Fisher]] posted a series of humorous YouTube videos [[satire|satirizing]] each other's franchises.

In a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Princess Leia]] eloping and running off into the sunset would be the "perfect union" between ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Shatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his [[Twitter]] account mocking ''Star Wars''. Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received ''Star Wars Holiday Special''. It was then that ''Star Wars'' actor [[Peter Mayhew]] posted a "retaliation" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', another poorly received film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/03/22/william-shatner-cant-stop-trolling-star-wars-fans/|title=William Shatner can't stop trolling Star Wars fans|publisher=The Telegraph}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Both franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.

''Star Trek'' was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' reboot]] (2009), which was followed by ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled ''[[Star Trek: Discovery|Discovery]]'', serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on [[CBS All Access]], an online streaming platform, in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/new-star-trek-series-premieres-january-2017|title=Star Trek New Star Trek Series Premieres January 2017|work=StarTrek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' picked up from where ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' left off, with ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' the first in the new trilogy, and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', a television series set in between the ''Star Wars'' prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone ''Star Wars'' films, starting with ''[[Rogue One]]'', which was released in December 2016, and ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' following in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Upcoming-Star-Wars-Movies-List-Titles-Release-Dates-100467.html|title=Upcoming Star Wars Movies: List Of Titles And Release Dates - CINEMABLEND|date=2015-12-16|newspaper=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fan works===
{{further|Star Trek fan productions|Star Wars fan films}}
Aside from official works by the producers of ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'', many [[fan film]]s and [[webisode]]s set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in relation to either franchise.

'''Deletionpedia''' is an online [[archive]] [[wiki]] containing articles deleted from the [[English Wikipedia]]. Its version of each article includes a header with more information about the deletion such as whether a {{srlink|Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedy deletion}} occurred, where the deletion discussion about the article can be found and which editor deleted the article. The original Deletionpedia operated from February to September 2008. The site was restarted under new management in December 2013.&lt;ref name=v2&gt;{{cite web|title=Homepage|url=http://deletionpedia.org/en/Main_Page|publisher=Deletionpedia.org|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is based on [[MediaWiki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Category:Deletionpedia:Pages_by_deletion_date Category:Deletionpedia:Pages by deletion date], from the Deletionpedia website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stats&gt;{{cite web|title=Deletionpedia statistics|url=http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Special:Statistics|publisher=Deletionpedia|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site functions as something of a "wikimorgue"; it automatically collects articles deleted from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="CIO"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cio.com/article/print/141650 |title=Wikipedia's Awkward Adolescence |last=Schneider |first=K.

In addition to categories preserved from Wikipedia, Deletionpedia has its own categories for articles, based upon the deletion criteria. Pages are organized by the month in which they were deleted, by the number of editors that had worked on a page and by the length of time the article had existed on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Category:Deletionpedia:Pages_on_Wikipedia_for_1000_or_more_days|title=Pages on Wikipedia for 1000 or more days|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

An '''ecomuseum''' is a [[museum]] focused on the identity of a place, largely based on local participation and aiming to enhance the welfare and development of [[local community|local communities]]. Ecomuseums originated in [[France]], the concept being developed by [[Georges Henri Rivière]] and [[Hugues de Varine]], who coined the term ‘ecomusée’ in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Odile de Bary, André Desvalles, Françoise  Wasserman (editors), 1994, ''Vagues: une anthologie de la nouvelle muséologie'',  Mâcon; Savigny-le Temple (77), Editions W ; M.N.E.S.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "éco" is a shortened form for "écologie", but it refers especially to a new idea of holistic interpretation of [[cultural heritage]], in opposition to the focus on specific items and objects, performed by traditional museums.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davis, 1999, ''Ecomuseums: a sense of place'', Leicester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are presently about 300 operating ecomuseums in the world; about 200 are in [[Europe]], mainly in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;For an up-to-date directory of websites on this subject, see Clémence Perrier-Latour, 2005,  [http://icom.museum/ecomuseums_links.html Web links and bibliography on ecomuseums], ''[[ICOM News]]'', n. 3/2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

Introduced by the French museologist Hugues de Varine in 1971, the word ''ecomuseum'' has often been misused and the definition of an ecomuseum is still a controversial matter for contemporary [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Hauenschild, 1998, [http://museumstudies.si.edu/claims2000.htm Claims and reality of new museology : case studies in Canada, the United States and Mexico], Washington, D.C.: Center for Museum Studies, [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many museologists sought to define the distinctive features of ecomuseums, listing their characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;For a synthetic view  on ecomuseum definitions, see: Gerard Corsane, Peter Davis, Sarah Elliott, Maurizio Maggi, Donatella Murtas &amp; Sally Rogers, ''[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section~content=a770945812~db=all~fulltext=713240928~dontcount=true Ecomuseum Evaluation: Experiences in Piemonte and Liguria, Italy]'', International Journal of Heritage Studies, Vol. 13, No. 2, March 2007, pp. 101–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a complexity approach, in recent definitions, ecomuseums are more properly defined by ''what they do'' rather than by ''what they are''.&lt;ref&gt;See Coveney Peter and Roger Highfield,1995, ''Frontiers of Complexity'', Faber &amp; Faber, New York-London,  (p. 17) on the difference between ''form'' and ''matter'' in complex evaluation and Gerard Corsane, Peter Davis, Sarah Elliott, Maurizio Maggi, Donatella Murtas &amp; Sally Rogers, ''[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a777253453~db=all Ecomuseum Performance in Piemonte  and Liguria, Italy: The Significance of  Capital]'', International Journal of Heritage Studies, Vol. 13, No. 3, May 2007, pp. 224–239 for an applied example&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecomuseum phenomenon has grown dramatically over the years, with no one ecomuseum model but rather an entire philosophy that has been adapted and molded for use in a variety of situations. As many more ecomuseums are established across the world the idea has been growing and the changes in the approach towards the philosophy are reflected in the reactions of the communities involved. In recent time particular significance is the rise in ecomuseology in India, China, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, with significant increase in Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey.

Ecomuseums are an important medium through which a community can take control of its heritage and enable new approaches to make meaning out of conserving its local distinctiveness.

== Definition from the European Network of Ecomuseums ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;An Ecomuseum is a dynamic way in which communities preserve, interpret, and manage their heritage for a sustainable development. An Ecomuseum is based on a community agreement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

— ''Declaration of Intent of the Long Net Workshop'', Trento (Italy), May 2004

''Dynamic way'' means to go beyond the formal aspect of an ecomuseum, beyond a simple set course, designed on paper; it is about designing real actions, able to change our society and improve our landscape. Community means a group with:

* General involvement;
* Shared responsibilities;
* Interchangeable roles: public officers, representatives, volunteers and other local actors are all playing a vital role in an ecomuseum.

''Community'' involvement does not mean that local administrations, a unique historical heritage of European democracy, are irrelevant. On the contrary their role, to be effective, must involve people, going beyond the narrow circle of “''authorized personnel''”.

''Preservation, interpretation and management'' means that reading and communicating heritage values, providing new 
interpretations of it and raising its profile, are part of the day-to-day activity for ecomuseums. ''Heritage'' is very close to Place as a notion, including history of inhabitants and things, what is visible and what it is not, tangibles and intangibles, memories and future.

''Sustainable development'' is a central issue for ecomuseums and it implies also to increase the value of a place instead of diminishing it. Evidence from best practices identifies in this process two key elements: place-based development, as previously described, and the improvement of local networks, where ecomuseums have to play a key role as catalysts of social capital development.

''Agreement'' means a mutual consent, implying reciprocal commitments between local players. The Polish national meeting, once more, put forward the idea of “voluntary meeting of people”.

== The 2016 Milan Cooperation Charter ==
In 2016 inside the 24th ICOM General Conference "Museums and cultural landscape" of Milan, the first Forum of ecomuseums and community museums took place&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/1041602|title=Ecomuseums and cultural landscapes. State of the art and future prospects|last=Riva|first=Raffaella|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9788891624963|editor-mask=Maggioli Editore|location=Santarcangelo di Romagna, Italy|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The goals of the forum were to share experiences, questions and difficulties that ecomuseums face; to share their future projects; to envisage any prospect of exchange or collaboration with the visitors. During the Forum "it was proposed to establish an International Platform for exchanges and experience sharing", and "decided to create a permanent international Working Group to keep watch and make proposals on the theme territory-heritage-landscape."
In the early 2017 on the basis of ideas, issues and debates raised by participants during the Forum a common vision was drawn and a provisional [http://www.ecomusei.eu/?page_id=1038 “Milan Cooperation Charter”] was adopted.

== The DROPS Platform ==
In the early 2017 the world platform for exchange and experience sharing between ecomuseums and community museums was published. The platform called [https://sites.google.com/view/drops-platform/home DROPS] aims at “connecting all national Ecomuseums and Community Museums and their networks, existing or to be established, and all other heritage and landscape NGOs, in a virtual and interactive space” and at the “production of a multilingual documentary and a bibliographic pool of resources on ecomuseology and its best practices” &lt;ref&gt;Santo, R. D., Baldi, N., Duca, A. D. and Rossi, A. (2017), The Strategic Manifesto of Italian Ecomuseums. Museum, 69: 86–95. doi:10.1111/muse.12153&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''''English Encyclopaedia''''' was an [[encyclopedia]] printed in [[London]] for George Kearsley in 1802.

It was 10 volumes; Vol. I 820pp., Vol. II 871pp., Vol. III 810pp., Vol. IV 805pp., Vol. V 812pp., Vol. VI 801pp., Vol. VII 796pp., Vol.VIII 784pp., Vol. IX 804pp., Vol.X 1150pp. plus 16pp., description of plates &amp; 2pp. book ads by Kearsley &amp; also incl. supplement which commences at page 183.

Title page says "A collection of treatises and a dictionary of terms covering the arts &amp; sciences, illustrated with upwards of 400 copperplates. Compiled from modern authors of the first eminence in the different branches of science."

This encyclopedia would form the basis of Kearsley's later work ''[[Pantologia]]'' which he began compiling in 1802.&lt;ref&gt;S. Padraig Walsh ''Anglo-American general encyclopedias 1703-1967'' New York and London; R.R. Bowser Company 1968 pp.61, 140-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hollywood Motion Picture and Television Museum''' is a film museum planned for 2017. It is due to be built on a 4-acre site directly across from the [[Hollywood Bowl]] on Highland Ave. The building will include two [[sound stage]]s and an observation gallery, where visitors will view the actual production of motion picture and television shows, and a theater with a seating capacity of 500 people, where great films of the past and present will be shown. There will be projection rooms for private viewing or lectures, a library, restaurant and research facilities. The major portion of the museum will be devoted to displays, depicting the history of motion picture, television and radio and recording industries and showing the technical aspects of each.

Bill Kramer is the managing director of the academy's $300 million museum project. The museum is expected to open in the summer of 2017.&lt;ref name="Card Cow"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cardcow.com/373194/hollywood-motion-picture-television-museum-california/|title=Hollywood Motion Picture &amp; Television Museum|work=CardCow Vintage Postcards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/20/entertainment/la-et-cm-steven-spielberg-jeffrey-katzenberg-film-museum-donations-20131119|title=Spielberg and Katzenberg give $10 million each to L.A. film museum|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boehm|first1=Mike|title=The long Yellow Brick Road to Hollywood's new museum|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/02/entertainment/la-et-cm-ca-academy-museum-motion-pictures-20131103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4680">An '''index term''', '''subject term''', '''subject heading''', or '''descriptor''', in [[information retrieval]], is a term that captures the essence of the topic of a document. Index terms make up a [[controlled vocabulary]] for use in [[bibliographic record]]s. They are an integral part of bibliographic control, which is the function by which libraries collect, organize and disseminate documents. They are used as keywords to retrieve documents in an information system, for instance, a catalog or a [[search engine]].  A popular form of keywords on the web are [[tag (metadata)|tags]] which are directly visible and can be assigned by non-experts. Index terms can consist of a word, phrase, or alphanumerical term. They are created by analyzing the document either manually with [[subject indexing]] or automatically with [[Index (search engine)|automatic indexing]] or more sophisticated methods of keyword extraction. Index terms can either come from a controlled vocabulary or be freely assigned.

Keywords are stored in a [[Index (search engine)|search index]]. Common words like [[article (grammar)|articles]] (a, an, the) and conjunctions (and, or, but) are not treated as keywords because it's inefficient. Almost every English-language site on the Internet has the article "''the''", and so it makes no sense to search for it. The most popular search engine, [[Google]] removed [[stop words]] such as "the" and "a" from its indexes for several years, but then re-introduced them, making certain types of precise search possible again.

The term "descriptor" was coined by [[Calvin Mooers]] in 1948. It is in particular used about a preferred term from a [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]].

The [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] language (SKOS) provides a way to express index terms with [[Resource Description Framework]] for use in the context of [[Semantic Web]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Svenonius|first=Elaine|author-link=Elaine Svenonius|title=The intellectual foundation of information organization|date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262512619|edition=1st MIT Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In web search engines==
Most [[web search engine]]s are designed to search for words anywhere in a document—the title, the body, and so on. This being the case, a keyword can be any term that exists within the document. However, priority is given to words that occur in the title, words that recur numerous times, and words that are explicitly assigned as keywords within the coding.&lt;ref&gt;Cutts, Matt. (2010, March 4). ''How search works.'' Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNHR6IQJGZs&lt;/ref&gt; Index terms can be further refined using [[Boolean algebra|Boolean operators]] such as "AND, OR, NOT." "AND" is normally unnecessary as most search engines infer it. "OR" will search for results with one search term or another, or both. "NOT" eliminates a word or phrase from the search, getting rid of any results that include it. Multiple words can also be enclosed in quotation marks to turn the individual index terms into a specific index ''phrase''. These modifiers and methods all help to refine search terms, to better maximize the accuracy of search results.&lt;ref&gt;CLIO. ''Keyword search''. Columbia University Libraries. Retrieved from http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/help/clio/keyword.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author keywords==
Author keywords are an integral part of literature.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Many journals and databases provide access to index terms made by authors of the respective articles. How qualified the provider is decides the quality of both indexer-provided index terms and author-provided index terms. The quality of these two types of index terms is of research interest, particularly in relation to [[information retrieval]]. In general, an author will have difficulty providing indexing terms that characterizes his or her document ''relative'' to other documents in the database.

'''James Lawrence Powell''' (born July 17, 1936 in [[Berea, Kentucky]]) is an American geologist. He was the chairman of the geology department at [[Oberlin College]] from 1965 to 1973, and served as its provost from 1975 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oberlin.edu/archive/holdings/finding/RG4/adminhist.html | title=Office of the Provost | publisher=[[Oberlin College]] | accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 to 1988, Powell was the president of [[Franklin and Marshall College]].&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; He served as the president of [[Reed College]] from 1988 to 1991, after which he became the president of the [[Franklin Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reed.edu/president/reed_presidents/powell.html | title=James L.

He was formerly the director of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History]],&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-21/local/me-48577_1_county-museum | title=Natural History Museum Names New Head | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=21 April 1994 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=Hernandez, Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the executive director of the [[National Physical Science Consortium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamespowell.org/Bio/Bio.html James L.

In 2012, Powell conducted a survey of scientific papers regarding the topic of [[anthropogenic global warming]] by searching [[Web of Science]] for scientific papers published from 1991 to 2012. He identified 13,950 papers, but only 24 which argued that humans were not the primary cause of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2012/12/11/climate_change_denial_why_don_t_they_publish_scientific_papers.html | title=Why Climate Change Denial Is Just Hot Air | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=11 December 2012 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=Plait, Phil|authorlink=Phil Plait}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/11/chart-only-017-percent-peer-reviewed-papers-question-global-warming | title=CHART: Only 0.17 Percent of Peer-Reviewed Papers Question Global Warming | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | date=1 December 2012 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=Sheppard, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt; He updated his survey in 2014 to include 2,258 studies published from November 12, 2012, to December 21, 2013, and identified only one study published during this time that argued that global warming was not caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/article/science/infographic-scientists-who-doubt-human-caused-climate-change | title=Infographic: Scientists Who Doubt Human-Caused Climate Change | work=[[Popular Science]] | date=10 January 2014 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=Gertz, Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The study in question was: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1134/S1019331613030015| title = The role of solar activity in global warming| journal = Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences| volume = 83| issue = 3| pages = 275| year = 2013| last1 = Avakyan | first1 = S. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Powell was elected a fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ten Distinguished Scientists and Scholars  Named Fellows of Committee for Skeptical Inquiry – CSI|url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ten_distinguished_scientists_and_scholars_named_fellows_of_committee_for_sk|website = www.csicop.org|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming, 2017.jpg|thumb|Peer-reviewed studies of the consensus on anthropogenic global warming ]]
In his latest paper, a metastudy of the consensus among scientists on anthropogenic global warming, Powell reported that using rejection as the criterion, five surveys of the peer-reviewed literature from 1991 to 2015 combine to 54,195 articles with an average consensus of 99.94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=James Lawrence|date=2017-05-24|title=The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming Matters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0270467617707079|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1177/0270467617707079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Music Department at the University Library of Southern Denmark''' in [[Odense]] has through donations and acquisitions since 1997 achieved the status of research archive of specialised jazz studies.

The Danish Jazz Center closed on 1 July 1997. Much of the collection was transferred to the former [[Odense University]] Library, including the Center's public collection, the [[Timme Rosenkrantz]] Collection, the [[Ben Webster]] Collection, the Radio Jazz Collection, and the Erik Lindemann Collection. A smaller part went to the Danish Jazz Association while that part of the collection which belonged to the Head of the Center, Arnvid Meyer, has been purchased by the [[Danish Royal Library]] although it has up to now remained in Meyer's possession. The collections at the [[University Library of Southern Denmark]] have been enlarged due to purchases and donations, such as the private collections of [[Svend Asmussen]] and [[Richard Boone (musician)|Richard Boone]].

The collections are housed in the Music Department and can be used during the Music Department's open hours. They are only for use on the premises and are not for loan. A room with all forms of listening facilities is available. Indexes to the Jazz Center's collections of tape recordings and videos and the Rosenkrantz, Webster, and Lindemann collections accompanied the collections and they can be used on the premises. All the books, sheet music, records, CDs and DVDs are catalogued and can be retrieved in the library's catalogue. Current registration is concentrated on the reel-to-reel tapes in Rosenkrantz's collection.

==The specific collections (as of June 1, 2007)==

===The Danish Jazz Center's Public Collection===
This part of the Danish Jazz Center's collection was purchased with funds allocated by the former Statens Musikråd. The collection contains more than 50 sheets of music, 49 books, 1516 78-rpm records, 482 LPs, 300 CDs and a number of journals, some of which are not to be found in any other Danish library.

The collection consists of more than 2600 reel-to-reel tapes, 1000 [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] and 500 [[Digital Audio Tape]]s of jazz broadcasts including both music and interviews taped from Denmark's Radio between 1975-1997. These tapes are invaluable documentation of what went on the jazz scene during this period. On top of this there are about 700 [[Videocassette recorder|video tapes]] taped from both Danish, Swedish and [[German television]] between 1980-1997, spanning from old [[Short subject|short films]] to contemporary concert recordings.

===Timme Rosenkrantz's Collection===
Timme Rosenkrantz (1911-1969) was an author, a jazz enthusiast and collector, speaker and radio broadcaster. The collection, which is concentrated on [[Swing (genre)|swing music]], consists of 1679 78’s, 170 EPs, 1055 LPs, 411 acetates, 923 reel-to-reel tapes and 103 books. The acetates are unique as they are privately cut acetate records with recordings made by Rosenkrantz himself in New York during [[World War II|the Second World War]] with famous musicians or recorded from the radio. 
There are rarities as there are many valuable jazz concerts recorded from Danish, Swedish and American radio, which haven't otherwise been preserved. There are also many catalogues, press cuttings and manuscripts for radio broadcasts and articles as well as a fine collection of more than 3000 photos of musicians and orchestras, many of which were taken by Rosenkrantz himself.

===Ben Webster's Collection===
This collection contains 45 78-rpm records, 211 LPs, 12 acetate records, 137 reel-to-reel tapes and one book. They are all catalogued in the library's catalogue. There are some sensational recordings to be found on the privately cut acetate records and reel-to-reel tapes, some of them by Webster himself. There is also a large collection memorabilia in the form of more than 1600 slides, 20 narrow-gauge films, 700 photographs and some private papers.

===Erik Lindemann's Collection===
This collection consists of 160 cassette tapes with recordings made by Lindemann at Copenhagen music clubs from 1994-1995, primarily with groups, which are not otherwise found on any records.

===Radio Jazz's Collection===
Radio Jazz is a Copenhagen local radio programme broadcasting several times a week. The collection consists of 100 reel-to-reel tapes and 600 digital audio tapes containing broadcasts of especially important documentation value, such as interviews and concerts. It documents the jazz scene in Copenhagen since Radio Jazz started broadcasting in 1987. The library hasn't received broadcasts from Radio Jazz since 2006 because it hasn't been possible to get hold of more digital audio tapes. The library has a complete collection of the publication ''Radio Jazz'', which among other things, registers and reviews all the broadcasts.

===Svend Asmussen's Collection===
The library received a collection from Svend Asmussen in September 2003 consisting of 14 LPs, 33 CDs, 25 reel-to-reel tapes, 11 cassette tapes, 2 videos, 8 books and 7 journal issues plus 189 photos and a large collection of concert programmes, reviews, press mentions, posters, and other memorabilia covering all his career.

===Richard Boone's Collection===
The library received a large collection, primarily of a private character, from Inga Boone, widow of the trombone player and singer Richard Boone, in November 2006. This collection contains many private papers, contracts and photos, plus instruments, microphones, cases, hats, portrait paintings, scrapbooks, posters, and other items, plus 2 LPs, 24 CDs and 10 books.

===The Other Collections of SDUB===
Since the introduction in 1991 of a rhythmical line of study at the Carl Nielsen Academy of Music Odense, the library's acquisition within the jazz genre has increased to the point that on 1 May 2007 the collection consisted of more than 900 books, 850 sheet music, 312 78's, 191 EPs, 4100 LPs, 4200 CDs, 179 DAT tapes and 73 videos plus a number of current and ceased to be published journals including older Danish publications. There is a collection of documents in the form of miscellaneous jazz festival and jazz concert programmes from Denmark and abroad, a complete set of programmes from [[Jazzhus Montmartre]] (1983-1990), Jazzhus Sophus Ferdinand, Odense (1974-1986), Værtshuset i Odense (1971-1972), Jazzhus Dexter in Odense (1998- ) as well as Brande Bookshops's postal order catalogue of jazz records (1955-1973). The library has also received minutes of meetings, letters, applications and regulations, and other materials from the Danish Jazz Association (1970-1977) and a very fine donation in the form of Ole "Fessor" Lindgreen's scrapbooks (1957-2001) from his Big City Band in all of 13 volumes.
Much of the collection has been received as donations and the library will be very happy to continue receiving jazz donations but it reserves the right to take out duplicate copies and give them to the students.

'''''Judith and Holofernes''''' (1457–1464)&lt;ref&gt;Kevin R. Brine, Elena Ciletti, Henrike Lähneman, ''The Sword of Judith: Judith Studies Across the Disciplines, Open Book Publishers, 2010, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bronze sculpture]] created by the Italian [[Renaissance]] sculptor [[Donatello]] at the end of his career. It can be seen in the Hall of Lilies (Sala dei Gigli), in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]], Italy. A copy stands in one of the sculpture's original positions on the [[Piazza della Signoria]], in front of the Palazzo Vecchio.

It depicts the assassination of the Assyrian general [[Holofernes]] by [[Judith]] and is remarkable for being one of the first Renaissance sculptures to be conceived in the round, with its four distinct faces. The subject of [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], depicting the climax of the story in the deuterocanonical [[Book of Judith]], was a common subject in art and is associated with the [[Power of Women]] topos.

==Background and description==
The statue was commissioned by [[Cosimo de' Medici]] as a decoration for the fountain in the garden of the [[Palazzo Medici|Palazzo Medici-Riccardi]]. Together with Donatello's ''[[David (Donatello)|David]]'', it was positioned in front of the palace around 1457, when Cosimo de' Medici's extended family decided to move into it.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, Sarah Blake. "Donatello's Bronze "David" and "Judith" as Metaphors of Medici Rule in Florence." ''The Art Bulletin'' 83, no. 1 (March 2001): 32-47. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3177189.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact place where these two were displayed is unknown, both of these statues became a symbol for the power Florence possessed.

''Judith and Holofernes'' depicts Judith standing powerfully with a raised sword, holding the head of Holofernes by his hair. The statue was originally gilded; some gilding remains on the sword. To facilitate the gilding the bronze was cast in 11 parts. The base of the sculpture resembles a [[cushion]], a naturalistic device first used by Donatello for his ''[[St. Mark (Donatello)|St. Mark]]'' in the [[Orsanmichele]]. Intended to function as a fountain, this statue sits on a triangular pedestal with holes for water to flow through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Florence|date=1952|publisher=Hollis &amp; Carter|edition=2|location=London|pages=53–54|last1=Hutton|first1=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism of Judith ==
Both [[Judith]] and [[David]] are underdogs from [[Old Testament]] stories, and are also seen placed in close proximity in the fresco of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] as well as on [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s East Baptistry Doors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=3177189|title=Donatello's Bronze "David" and "Judith" as Metaphors of Medici Rule in Florence on JSTOR|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith is considered the symbol of liberty, virtue and victory of the weak over the strong in a just cause. Christian symbolism of Judith reveals her actions over Holofernes to be a victory of virtue, particularly concerning self-control, chastity and humility, as opposed to promiscuity and pride.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her story in the [[Power of Women]] topos depicts the weak overcoming the assumed victor in an effort to protect her home. This is symbolic of the city of Florence, who fought to protect their [[Republic of Florence]] from foreign powers and to the Medici specifically upholding their pride in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Donatello|last=B. Bennett and D. Willkins|first=|publisher=|year=1984|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The anticipated slashing of the general's neck and overall notion of beheading is emphasized visually in the statue through Judith's intent gaze and strongly cocked arm wielding her blade ready to strike. In addition, carved into Holofernes' back, is a medallion structured to appear hanging from his neck has been historically known as a symbol of pride.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kauffmann, Donatello. Eine Einfuhrung in sein Bilden und Denken, Berlin, 1936, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars believe that in this instance the necklace is direct symbolism of pride evidenced by Psalms 73:6, which states, "the wicked wear pride like a necklace and violence wraps them round."&lt;ref&gt;V. Herzner, "Die 'Judith' de Medici," ''Zeitschrift fur Kunstgeschichte'' XLIII pp.154&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that the statue is meant to be viewed from the side rather than straight on. By viewing from an angle, the emphasis is on Holofernes' neck, flanked by both of Judith's legs underneath her garments, and is the center of attention as Judith pulls her arm back to strike. This would render the inscription "Behold the neck of pride served by the hand of humility" the most accurately depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crum|first=Roger J.|year=2001|title=Severing the Neck of Pride: Donatello's "Judith and Holofernes" and the Recollection of Albizzi Shame in Medicean Florence|jstor=1483711|journal=Artibus et Historiae|volume=22| issue =  44|pages=23–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that an inscription on the granite pedestal originally read, "Kingdoms fall through luxury [sin], cities rise through virtues. Behold the neck of pride severed by the hand of humility." This dramatic and detailed statue is thus a [[metaphor]] of the [[Medici]] rule, as the defenders of Florentine liberty, akin to Judith, slayer of the tyrant [[Holofernes]] and defender of the people.  This view is supported by accounts that mention a second inscription on the pedestal which read, "The salvation of the state. Piero de' Medici son of Cosimo dedicated this statue of a woman both to liberty and to fortitude, whereby the citizens with unvanquished and constant heart might return to the republic." Inscribed on the cushion are the words &lt;small&gt;OPVS . DONATELLI . FLO&lt;/small&gt; (the work of the Florentine, Donatello).

== Placement ==
In 1495, the sculpture was placed on the Piazza della Signoria, at the side of main door the Palazzo Vecchio, in memory of the expulsion of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici]] from Florence and the introduction of the Florentine republic under [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. This time, this statue symbolized the expulsion of the tyrannical Medici. The statue was later moved to the courtyard inside the Palazzo Vecchio, and still later into the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]. In 1919, it was then placed on the left side of the Palazzo Vecchio. It was replaced by a bronze copy in 1988 and the original, after restoration, was given a final place in the Sala dei Gigli inside the Palazzo Vecchio.

[[File:Untitled map of the world on a double cordiform projection, Lafreri atlas, circa 1564.jpg|thumb|400px|Untitled map of the world on a double cordiform projection from "Lafreri atlas", c. 1564]]
The cartographic Renaissance of the sixteenth century in Europe was based on a rapid increase in geographical knowledge sourced from exploration and discovery, and the European map of the world "had literally doubled in size within just over a century."&lt;ref&gt;David Woodward. [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V3_Pt1/HOC_VOLUME3_Part1_chapter1.pdf Cartography and the Renaissance: Continuity and Change]. In: The History of Cartography, Volume 3, ed. by David Woodward. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007. {{ISBN|9780226907321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the important trading centers of Rome and [[Venice]], many individual maps were printed in Italy from about 1544. Each publisher worked independently, producing maps based upon his own customers' needs. These maps often varied greatly in size.

Over time, it became common to bind maps together into composite works. Although the word "atlas" was not in use for these composite works until 1570, they now are termed "IATO [Italian, Assembled To Order] atlases" or, more frequently, "Lafreri atlases" (one of the leading publishers of the period, [[Antonio Lafreri]] is thought to have been the first to add an engraved title page to a collection of maps – around 1570 or 1572&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapforum.com/01/lafreri.htm  Lafreri School:  Maps &amp; Atlases".  On line.],&lt;/ref&gt; about the same time as the [[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]] was published in [[Antwerp]].

Each of the atlases was put together from a list of many different available maps, chosen to satisfy the needs or request of the individual customer; so few if any atlases are identical. About sixty or seventy of these atlases survive today, most held in institutions. The atlases are very important in the history of cartography, for many sixteenth-century Italian maps survive only in these atlases.

Collectors of antique maps value Lafreri atlases highly for their lovely engraving style and because of their rarity.

==Cartographers of the Lafréri atlases==

The most notable cartographers involved in publication of the Lafreri maps and atlases include:
:*[[Giacomo Gastaldi]] – based in Venice; the most important Italian mapmaker of his time
:*[[Battista Agnese]] – Genoa
:*[[Antonio Lafreri]] (or ''Antoine du Pérac Lafréry 1512–77'') – Rome; publisher of some of the composite atlases
:*[[Antonio Salamanca]] – Lafreri's partner

[[File:Letters of Charles Lamb.jpg|thumb|170px|Title page to the 1837 Talfourd edition of Lamb's letters]]
The 19th-century English writer '''[[Charles Lamb]]'s letters''' were addressed to, among others, [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Godwin]], and [[Thomas Hood]], all of whom were close friends. They are valued for the light they throw on the English literary world in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and on the evolution of Lamb's essays, and still more for their own "charm, wit and quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t113.e4287 |title=Lamb, Charles |author=Dinah Birch (ed.) |work=The Oxford Companion to English Literature |publisher=Oxford Reference Online |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manuscripts ==

More than 1,150 of Lamb's letters survive, scattered among institutions and private collections in Britain and the United States. The largest collection, comprising about 200 letters, is in the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]]. There are very few existing letters addressed to Lamb apart from those sent by his friend [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]], since Lamb usually destroyed his old correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR92&amp;dq=%22IV+The+present+edition%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |pages=xcii–xciii }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Courtney |first1=Winifred P. |title=Young Charles Lamb 1775–1802 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMSyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22His+later+friend+Thomas+Manning%22&amp;dq=%22His+later+friend+Thomas+Manning%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1982 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=0333315340 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb wrote his letters in a "bold free hand and a fearless flourish" (his own words), which present no great difficulties to editors, though his spelling and punctuation were sometimes erratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas|title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcENAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Lamb's+pen-work%22&amp;dq=%22Lamb's+pen-work%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |page=viii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==

Lamb's main correspondents were the poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, [[Robert Southey]], Thomas Hood, [[Bernard Barton]], [[Mary Matilda Betham]] and [[Bryan Procter]]; the philosopher and novelist William Godwin; the music critic [[William Ayrton (music critic)|William Ayrton]]; the publishers [[Edward Moxon]], [[William Hone]], [[Charles Ollier]], [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] and J. A. Hessey; the statistician [[John Rickman]]; the actress Fanny Kelly; the political agitator [[Thomas Allsop]]; the [[Sinology|Sinologist]] Thomas Manning; the lawyer [[Henry Crabb Robinson]]; also John Bates Dibdin, member of a theatrical family, and Robert Lloyd from a literary Quaker family. The surviving letters extend over a period of nearly 40 years, beginning in May 1796 and ending only a few days before his death in December 1834. In the first sequence of 30 letters written to Coleridge he minutely criticises his friend's poems, advising him to abandon conventional poetic diction and "cultivate simplicity". The influence he exercised on his friend is seen as crucial in preparing Coleridge for the Romantic revolution that he and Wordsworth launched two years later in their ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Holmes (biographer) |title=Coleridge: Early Visions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2q7gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22crucial+in+the+maturing%22&amp;dq=%22crucial+in+the+maturing%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1990 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth |isbn=0140124403 |page=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKenna |first1=Wayne |title=Charles Lamb and the Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvFaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Cultivate+simplicity,+Coleridge%22&amp;dq=%22Cultivate+simplicity,+Coleridge%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1978 |origyear=1974 |publisher=Smythe |location=Gerrards Cross |isbn=0901072613 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pierce |first1=Frederick E. |title=Currents and Eddies in the English Romantic Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPdVIHbghfEC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Cultivate+simplicity,+Coleridge%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |year=1918 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |pages=57–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the beginning the letters show Lamb's sense of duty to his family and friends, but after a few years, without abandoning his moral convictions, Lamb found a lighter means of expression. In an 1801 letter he wrote, "I have had a time of seriousness, and I have known the importance and reality of a religious belief. Latterly, I acknowledge, much of my seriousness has gone off…but I still retain at bottom a conviction of the truth, and a certainty of the usefulness of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas |title=Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dQvAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Why+it+should+have+so+moved+Thackeray%22&amp;q=%22time+of+seriousness%22 |accessdate=21 April 2012 |page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birrell |title=Essays |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/62550/ |accessdate=21 April 2012 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later letters it is often possible to see Lamb forming and developing the ideas that he later presented in fully matured form in the ''[[Essays of Elia]]'' and other magazine pieces, and in this way they proved to be essential to his career as a published writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lordbyron.org/contents.php?doc=ChLamb.1905.Contents |title=Charles Lamb: Works of Charles and Mary Lamb. VI-VII. Letters |author=Radcliffe, David Hill |work=Lord Byron and his Times |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The humour and (as he often said) "nonsense" of his letters is sometimes seen as a disguise for mental instability and deep anguish. The essayist [[Augustine Birrell]] wrote that "He took refuge in trivialities seriously, and played the fool in order to remain sane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birrell |title=Essays |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/62550/ |accessdate=21 April 2012 |pages=20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters have a great deal to say about Lamb's incessant reading, often among 17th century writers, and it has been argued that his love of [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], [[Thomas Browne]] and the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] tragedies may show an underlying depression and despair which answered to theirs. Lamb's words on Burton have frequently been taken as applying to himself: "Burton was a man often assailed by deepest melancholy, and at other times much given to laughing and jesting, as is the way with melancholy men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lordbyron.org/contents.php?doc=ChLamb.1905.Contents |title=Charles Lamb: Works of Charles and Mary Lamb.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] was so impressed by the beauty of Lamb's character as revealed in his letters that he once pressed one of them to his forehead and exclaimed "Saint Charles!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas |title=Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dQvAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Why+it+should+have+so+moved+Thackeray%22&amp;dq=%22Why+it+should+have+so+moved+Thackeray%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=21 April 2012|pages=533–534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the opinion of [[Thomas Noon Talfourd]], who knew Lamb well, that there was scarcely one of his letters "which has not some tinge of that quaint sweetness, some hint of that peculiar union of kindness and whim, which distinguishes him from all other poets and humorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Will D. |authorlink1=Will D.

V. Lucas]] as to "the value and importance of these letters, their good sense, their wit, their humanity, their fun, their timeliness and timelessness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15912?docPos=1 |title=Lamb, Charles |author=Swaab, Peter |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford Reference Online |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ww8AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22their+good+sense,+their+wit%22&amp;dq=%22their+good+sense,+their+wit%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012 |page=vii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==

As early as February 1835 a decision was made to prepare a collection of Lamb's letters. Thomas Noon Talfourd was chosen as the editor, and his ''Letters of Charles Lamb'' appeared in 1837. 180 of Lamb's letters appeared in this collection, according to Edwin Marrs's count, though Talfourd's contents page suggests a different number because of his (and several later editors') practice of separating and recombining passages to form, in effect, letters that never were. The number he could print was limited by the need to protect the feelings of Lamb's surviving friends, and still more those of his sister [[Mary Lamb|Mary]], whose periodic fits of insanity Lamb had many times explicitly referred to. With Mary's death the need for tactful suppression became less pressing, and a supplementary collection consisting of 82 entirely new letters, Talfourd's ''Final Memorials of Charles Lamb'', appeared in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR62 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxii–lxvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A projected third edition of the letters was to have been edited first by Talfourd and then by [[William Carew Hazlitt]], but both editors successively abandoned the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR67 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxvii–lxviii }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorship was then given to the journalist [[George Augustus Henry Sala]], who completed the first volume of a ''Complete Correspondence and Works of Charles Lamb''. This was printed in 1868, but no further volumes were ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucas |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcENAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=22 April 2012 |page=ix }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new ''Complete Correspondence and Works of Charles Lamb'', edited by the drama critic [[Thomas Purnell (critic)|Thomas Purnell]], containing 337 letters, appeared in 1870 in 4 volumes, the letters being also issued separately in one volume. Another drama critic, [[Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald|Percy Fitzgerald]], edited a ''Life, Letters and Writings of Charles Lamb'' in 1876 with 451 letters, and this, like all previous collections, was published by [[Edward Moxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR68 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxviii–lxx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Carew Hazlitt then returned to the task he had previously abandoned, and produced a ''Letters of Charles Lamb'' in 1886, based on Talfourd's two collections but with much revision and addition, so that the number of letters now totalled 488.  ''The Letters of Charles Lamb'' were edited only two years later by [[Alfred Ainger]] in 1888, and re-edited in 1900 and 1904; these collections numbered 414, 446 and 464 letters respectively, making them in point of size inferior to Hazlitt's edition, and further disfigured by a good deal of bowdlerisation. An edition by William Macdonald, containing 581 letters, appeared in 1903.  ''The Letters of Charles Lamb'', issued by the Bibliophile Society of Boston in 1905 with an introduction by Henry Howard Harper, increased the tally considerably to 746 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR71 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxxi–lxxxiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of E. V. Lucas's editions appeared as volumes 6 and 7 of his ''Works of Charles and Mary Lamb'' (1903–1905), and for the first time included Mary's correspondence on equal terms. It contained only 590 letters, but he highlighted one of the problems which had caused his and several previous editions to leave out easily findable material:&lt;blockquote&gt;Owing to the curious operations of the law of copyright, it will not for at least forty-two years be possible for any one edition of Lamb's correspondence to contain all the letters.  To-day, in order to possess a set complete down to the present time, one must purchase at least nine, and possibly more, works, amounting to many volumes―among them ''Charles Lamb and the Lloyds'', of which I was the editor, but which I am debarred from using.&lt;/blockquote&gt;His second edition was published in 1912 with 604 letters.  His third edition, ''The Letters of Charles Lamb, to which is Added Those of His Sister Mary Lamb'' (1935), included as many as 1,027 letters, Lucas's publishers having negotiated a solution to the copyright problems, so that he was able to claim that "The present edition of the letters of Charles Lamb is the first to bring all the known material into one work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrs |title=Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR84 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pages=lxxxiv–lxxxviii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Lucas's harshest critics acknowledge that the 1935 edition's completeness made it the best available up to that point, but several papers in academic journals by George L. Barnett and other Lamb scholars have made it clear that the texts are unreliable. Barnett complained that Lucas appeared not to have read manuscript letters of whose location he was well aware, that on the contrary &lt;blockquote&gt;many, if not most, of the letters are based on previous and faulty editions, and that Lucas has failed to avoid the tendency of editors of Lamb's letters to perpetuate errors and to inaugurate others by overzealous emendation, excessive editing, and downright carelessness.&lt;/blockquote&gt; He elsewhere referred to "faulty dating, erroneous location of manuscripts, incorrect transcription of text, and misinformation in the notes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riehl |title=Dangerous |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9wcin_BkcMC&amp;pg=PA134 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=George L. |title=A Critical Analysis of the Lucas Edition of Lamb's Letters  |journal=Modern Language Quarterly |volume=9 |date=September 1948 |page=314 |doi=10.1215/00267929-9-3-303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=George L. |title=Corrections in the Text of Lamb's Letters |journal=Huntington Library Quarterly |volume=18 |date=February 1955 |page=147 |doi=10.2307/3816539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1975 to 1978 three volumes of a new edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's letters were published by Edwin W. Marrs, which included many new letters discovered during the previous 40 years. Lamb's life was covered up to 1817, and further volumes were intended to carry on up to his death in 1834, but to date none have appeared. The three published volumes have attracted great praise for their exceptionally full annotation and for the completeness and accuracy of the texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riehl |title=Dangerous |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9wcin_BkcMC&amp;pg=PA134 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lyttelton/Hart-Davis Letters''' are a correspondence between two literary Englishmen, [[George William Lyttelton|George Lyttelton]] (1883–1962) and [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] (1907–99), written between 1955 and Lyttelton's death, and published by Hart-Davis in six volumes between 1978 and 1984.

==History==
George Lyttelton had been a master at [[Eton College]], where he encouraged the literary tastes of the teenaged Hart-Davis during the latter's final year (1925–26) there.  After Hart-Davis left Eton their paths diverged, but they embarked on a weekly correspondence in 1955, by which time Lyttelton had retired and Hart-Davis had become an eminent (if not outstandingly profitable) publisher. The letters continued without a break for the rest of Lyttelton's life. In 1978, 16 years after Lyttelton's death, Hart-Davis began publishing the correspondence, and by 1984 all the letters had been published, in six volumes.

The philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] observed:

:Hart-Davis was a civilised and well-connected man, whose quotidian avocations brought him into contact with almost all the great literary, theatrical and musical names of the 1950s and 1960s. His letters are casually star-studded, and give absorbing glimpses of the affairs of [[the Literary Society]], the [[London Library]], publishing, and a long cast-list of celebrities from [[Siegfried Sassoon]] to [[T. S. Eliot|T.{{space}}S. Eliot]], from [[Winston Churchill]] to the Fleming brothers [[Ian Fleming|Ian]] and [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]] (the latter a brilliant prose-stylist). Throughout the period of the correspondence (1955-1962), he was editing the letters of [[Oscar Wilde]], a mammoth undertaking whose difficulties and challenges are documented in great detail in the letters, giving a satisfying portrayal of what dedication in literary scholarship looks like from the inside...But the indisputable star of the show is George Lyttelton. What a wonderfully well-stocked, amusing, perceptive, agreeable mind! And what a genius as a letter-writer, touching exactly the right notes with every stroke of his pen, which is a fountain of allusion and delicious wit.&lt;ref name=grayling&gt;A. C. Grayling in ''The Independent on Sunday'', 30 September 2001, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Times]]'' [[Philip Ziegler]] commented, "If twentieth century civilisation has to put forward one champion by which it will be judged, their letters would not be an unworthy candidate."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on the cover of the paperback of Volumes 3 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kenneth Rose]], in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', called the letters, "One of the most urbane, civilised and entertaining correspondences of our time." ''The Independent on Sunday'' commented, "Lyttelton's wit and huge fund of literary knowledge make every page of this volume a complete delight. He is ably abetted by Hart-Davis, who well understood how to elicit the gems from Lyttelton's mighty store. The result is one of the most enjoyable books in the world."&lt;ref name=grayling/&gt;

==Content of the correspondence==
The letters are bookish, revealing a shared delight in, and encyclopaedic knowledge of, the English language and its texts. Neither man made claim to expertise in music or the visual arts, where their tastes were conventional;&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, Volume 1, p. 38; and Volume 2, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; their forte was literature. To admirers of the letters, not least of the pleasures of reading them is being spurred to go and read a poem, a play or a book quoted with approval and delight by one or other of the correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth, Christopher. "Saraband for a dead mother", ''The Observer'', 18 November 1979, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Another diversion is spotting their allusions:

*"Writing in your summer house in January! Please go indoors at once and try no more alfresco composition until the swallow dares. We have [[aconitum|aconites]] and many [[snowdrop]]s in flower: can Spring be far behind? Yes, it bloody well can, as we shall doubtless see".&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, Volume 3, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;quoting ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (4 iv) as well as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s ''[[Ode to the West Wind]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"I am once again writing in my club – and rather slowly, as I must hear why a stoutish man is urging a still stouter one to have a local and not general anaesthetic. I itch to tell the speaker to be more lucid and set my mind at rest on the precise nature and geography of the contemplated operation. I only think, and cannot be absolutely certain, that the trouble calling for the knife is a boil on the [[gluteus maximus]], but it may be that distressing and almost universal complaint. ('Poor Alfred, he's got 'em again,' as [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s doctor said when he read ''[[Maud (poem)|Maud]]''.)"&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, Volume 2, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
*"You are hereby absolved from struggling with ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. When an American professor was sent for a review a book called ''A Key to F.W.'', he sent it back, saying 'What ''F.W.'' needs is not a key but a lock'."&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, Volume 2, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;
*"I love re-reading. Each night from 10.30 to 12 I read [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] out loud. I read slowly, richly, not to say juicily; and like [[Prospero]]'s isle the room is full of noises – little, dry, gentle noises. Some matter-of-fact man of blunt or gross perceptions might say it was the ashes cooling in the grate, but I know better. It is the little creatures of the night, moths and crickets and spiderlings, a mouse or two perhaps and small gnats in a wailful choir,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;quoting [[John Keats]], ''[[To Autumn]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; come out to listen to the Gibbonian music – 'Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand volumes, attested the variety of his inclinations; [and from the productions which he left behind him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than for ostentation].' – what sentient being, however humble, could resist that?" &lt;ref&gt;''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]],'' Chapter VII, Part I, quoted by Lyttelton across two letters of 2 and 9 May 1957, the last 27 words of the quotation being added in the latter.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
All volumes were originally published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray Ltd.]]:
*Vol 1 (1955-6 letters) published 1978 {{ISBN|978-0-7195-3478-2}}

In 2001, a single-volume abridgement of the full set of letters was published by John Murray ({{ISBN|978-0-7195-6206-8}}). The abridgement, made by Roger Hudson, received widespread and generally favourable reviews. Hudson added many extra footnotes for the benefit of a new generation of readers. A paperback version of this edition was later released by the same publisher ({{ISBN|978-0-7195-6210-5}}).

===U.S. editions===
In the USA, the original six volumes were published by Academy Chicago Publications.

The single-volume edition edited by Roger Hudson was issued by the Akadine Press, {{ISBN|978-1-58579-040-1}}.

The '''''Maroonbook''''' is a system of [[legal citation]] that is intended to be simpler and more straightforward than the more widely used [[Bluebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Posner |date=1986 |title=Goodbye to the Bluebook |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?context=journal_articles&amp;article=2797#page=2 |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume=53 |pages=1343–1368 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502011213/http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?context=journal_articles&amp;article=2797 |archive-date=2015-05-02 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed at the [[University of Chicago]] and is the citation system for the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]''. As a simplified and modernized citation method, it tends to be closer to the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' in its conventions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">A '''marriage settlement''' in England was a historic arrangement whereby, most commonly and in its simplest form, a [[Settlement (trust)|trust]] of land or other assets was established jointly by the parents of a bride and bridegroom. The trustees were established as legal owners of the assets, and the bride and bridegroom as beneficial owners of the assets during their lifetimes, and after their deaths, beneficial ownership would descend to one or more of the children of the union. The marriage settlement should not be confused with the modern [[prenuptial agreement]], which is concerned mainly with the division of assets after [[divorce]]. Such settlements were also commonly made in the British colonies in North America, among families with assets to protect.

==Purposes==
It was a means of ensuring the proper use of a [[dowry]] provided by a bride's father to be used for his daughter's financial support throughout her married life and into her widowhood, and also a means by which the bride's father was able to obtain from the bridegroom's father a financial commitment to the intended marriage and to the children resulting therefrom. It also was an instrument by which the practice of [[primogeniture]] was effected by the use of an [[entail]] in [[tail male]].  

==Historic usage==
The marriage contract was in common use from the earliest times, and throughout the [[middle ages]] up to the early 20th century. It is little used today in modern England and Wales due to several reasons, including the disuse of the giving of dowries, the establishment of the legal power of married women to own assets in their own right, following the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]]; the lesser involvement and powers of parents in selecting marriage partners, the abandonment by modern society of the aspiration to establish dynasties, the introduction of [[death duties]], the abandonment of primogeniture as a desirable social model, and the comparatively modern trend of the "working wife and mother", who earns her own money and is often financially independent of her husband.

== Controversies ==
In 2004, its rival [[Moneysupermarket.com]] paid Moneyfacts £3.9 million in an [[out of court settlement]] to settle a dispute of alleged [[intellectual property]] theft. At the time, Moneysupermarket was going public at a price between £864 million and £1.05 billion, and it was thought best to resolve the issue beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812710/Moneysupermarket-paid-rival-3.9m.html Moneysupermarket paid rival £3.9m]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the "best buy" tables used in the UK press were criticised by Mike Lazenby, the then 'maverick'&lt;ref&gt;Mortgage Strategy: [http://www.mortgagestrategy.co.uk/lendingzone/opinion/twist-at-the-end-of-society-soap/1040662.article Twist at the end of society soap]&lt;/ref&gt; CEO of the [[Kent Reliance Building Society]], for not reflecting the products which offered the best long-term value, with Moneyfacts bearing the brunt of the criticism. The main objections were:&lt;ref&gt;BBC: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/moneybox/6695029.stm Attack on money 'best buy' tables]&lt;/ref&gt;
* At that time Moneyfacts charged an £11,000 yearly fee to its subscribers, and did not always list non-subscribers in its best buy tables.
* It was possible for products to boost their position in best buy tables by offering short term introductory bonuses.

The historic issue was that some non-subscribers tended not to volunteer their data within the time required. With the benefit of more widely available digital data, this is no longer an issue. To resolve the issue of product providers manipulating submissions by introductory bonuses, Moneyfacts now produces its tables in versions with and without these bonuses.

Subsequently, in 2013, Moneyfacts were praised in the ''Sunday Times'',&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times: [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1255161.ece Best deal is one zat pays us. Simples!]&lt;/ref&gt; which highlighted that [[Moneyfacts.co.uk]] always lists the genuine best buy products for its customers regardless of any financial arrangements with product providers, whilst other comparison websites were found to purely recommend financial products on a commercial basis.

A '''national security letter''' ('''NSL''') is an [[administrative subpoena]] issued by the [[United States government]] to gather information for [[national security]] purposes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} NSLs do not require prior approval from a judge. The [[Stored Communications Act]], [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], and [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] authorize the [[United States government]] to seek such information that is "relevant" to authorized national security investigations.  By law, NSLs can request only non-content information, for example, transactional records and phone numbers dialed, but never the content of telephone calls or e-mails.&lt;ref name=crs&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RL33332.pdf USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005: A Legal Analysis] [[Congressional Research Service]]'s report for Congress, Brian T. Yeh, Charles Doyle, December 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSLs typically contain a nondisclosure requirement forbidding the recipient of an NSL from disclosing that the FBI had requested the information.&lt;ref name=bustillos&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-its-like-to-get-a-national-security-letter|title=What It's Like to Get a National-Security Letter|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=June 27, 2013|first=Maria|last=Bustillos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nondisclosure provision must be authorized by the [[Director of the FBI]], and only after he or she certifies "that otherwise there may result a danger to the [[national security of the United States]]; interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation; interference with diplomatic relations; or danger to the life or physical safety of any person."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2709(c)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a recipient of the NSL may still challenge the nondisclosure provision in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|3511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutionality of such nondisclosure provisions has been repeatedly challenged.  The requirement was initially ruled to be unconstitutional as an infringement of [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]] in the ''[[Doe v. Gonzales]]'' case, but that decision was later [[vacatur|vacated]] in 2008 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] after it held the [[USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act]] gave the recipient of an NSL that included a nondisclosure provision the right to challenge the nondisclosure provision in federal court.  In March 2013, a judge in the Northern District of California held the nondisclosure provision in an NSL was unconstitutional.  But on August 24, 2015, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.  On remand, the district court held the "NSLs were issued in full compliance with the procedural and substantive requirements suggested by the Second Circuit in ''John Doe, Inc. v. Mukasey'', 549 F.3d 861 (2d Cir. 2008), which had held that the 2006 NSL law could be constitutionally applied" ... and "the NSL law, as amended [by the USA FREEDOM ACT of 2015], was constitutional."  The two petitioners then appealed.  On appeal, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the district court ruling, holding that NSLs are constitutional and held, "the nondisclosure requirement does not run afoul of the First Amendment."  ''Under Seal v. Jefferson B. Sessions, III, Attorney General'', Nos. 16-16067, 16-16081, and 16-16082, July 17, 2017.

== History ==

The oldest NSL provisions were created in 1978 as a little-used investigative tool in terrorism and espionage investigations to obtain financial records.   Under the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] (RFPA), part of the [[Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978]], the FBI could obtain the records only if the FBI could first demonstrate the person was a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.  Compliance by the recipient of the NSL was voluntary, and states' [[consumer privacy]] laws often allowed financial institutions to reject the requests.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E. Nieland, National Security Letters and the Amended Patriot Act, 92 ''[[Cornell L. Rev.]]'' 1201, 1207 (2007) [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Nieland.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, Congress amended RFPA to allow the government to request disclosure of the requested information.  In 1986, Congress passed the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] (ECPA), part of the [[Stored Communications Act]]), which created provisions similar to the RFPA that allowed the FBI to issue NSLs.  Still, neither RFPA or ECPA act included penalties for not complying with the NSL.  A 1993 amendment removed the restriction regarding "foreign powers" and allowed the use of NSLs to request information concerning persons who are not the direct subject of the investigation.

In 2001, section 505 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] expanded the use of the NSLs. In March 2006, the [[USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act]] allowed for judicial review of an NSL.  A federal judge could repeal or modify an NSL if the court found the request for information was "unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful."  The nondisclosure provision the government could include in an NSL was also weakened.  The court could repeal the nondisclosure provision if it found it had been made in bad faith.  Other amendments allowed the recipient of an NSL to inform their attorney about the request and the government had to rely on the courts to enforce compliance with an NSL.

== Patriot Act ==
{{Main|Patriot Act}}

Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act (2001) allowed the use of the NSLs when seeking information "relevant" in authorized national security investigations to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.  The act also provided the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] when conducting a law enforcement investigation, [[counterintelligence]] inquiry, or security determination. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] has also allegedly issued NSLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/washington/14spy.html Military Expands Intelligence Role in U.S.|title=Military Expands Intelligence Role in U.S.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 14, 2007|first1=Eric|last=Lichtblau|first2=Mark|last2=Mezzetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriot Act reauthorization statutes passed during the [[109th Congress]] added potential penalties for failure to comply with an NSL or disclosing an NSL if the NSL included a nondisclosure provision.

== Contentious aspects ==

Two contentious aspects of NSLs are the nondisclosure provision and [[judicial oversight]] when the FBI issues an NSL.  When the Director of the FBI (or his designee) authorizes the inclusion of a nondisclosure provision in an NSL, the recipient may face criminal prosecution if it reveals the contents of the NSL or that it was received.  The purpose of a nondisclosure provision is to prevent the recipient of an NSL from compromising both the current FBI investigation involving a specific person and future investigations as well (''see'' 18 U.S.C. 2709), which could fetter the Government's efforts to address national security threats.&lt;ref name="Post2007"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201882.html My National Security Letter], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 2007 Mar 23&lt;/ref&gt;  An NSL recipient (later revealed to be [[Nicholas Merrill]]&lt;ref name="zetwir1"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/nsl-gag-order-lifted/#ixzz0wcPM40Dg John Doe’ Who Fought FBI Spying Freed From Gag Order After 6 Years] Kim Zetter, Wired.com, 2010 8 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doe v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[L]iving under the gag order has been stressful and surreal.  Under the threat of criminal prosecution, I must hide all aspects of my involvement in the case...from my colleagues, my family and my friends. When I meet with my attorneys I cannot tell my girlfriend where I am going or where I have been.&lt;ref name=Post2007 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like other administrative subpoenas, NSLs do not require judicial approval.  For NSLs, that is because the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has held the types of information the FBI obtains with NSLs provide no constitutionally protected [[reasonable expectation of privacy]]. Because a person has already provided the information to a third party, e.g., their telephone company, they no longer have a reasonable expectation of privacy to the information, and therefore there is no Fourth Amendment requirement to obtain a judge's approval to obtain the information.&lt;ref&gt;Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979); Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the recipient of the NSL may still challenge the nondisclosure provision in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;3511&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported in 2007 that a government audit found the FBI had violated the rules more than 1,000 times in an audit of 10% of its national investigations between 2002 and 2007.&lt;ref name="rte1"&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI agents broke the rules 1,000 times|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0614/fbi.html|work=RTÉ News Online|date=2007-06-14|accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty such incidents involved requests by agents for information not permitted under the law.  A subsequent report in 2014 by the Justice Department Office of Inspector General concluded the FBI had corrected its practices and that NSLs complied federal statutes.

According to 2,500 pages of documents the FBI provided to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] lawsuit, the FBI had used NSLs to obtain information about individuals who were the subject of an FBI terrorism or counterintelligence investigation and information from telecommunications companies about individuals with whom the subject of the investigation had communicated.  According to a September 9, 2007, ''New York Times'' report, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In many cases, the target of a[n FBI] national security letter whose records are being sought is not necessarily the actual subject of a terrorism investigation.  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, the FBI must assert only that the records gathered through the letter are considered relevant to a terrorism [or counterintelligence] investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In April 2008, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] alleged that the military was using the FBI to skirt legal restrictions on domestic surveillance to obtain private records of Americans' [[Internet service provider]]s, financial institutions, and telephone companies.  The ACLU based its allegation on a review of more than 1,000 documents provided by the Defense Department.  The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General later determined the Department of Defense (not the FBI) had lawfully obtained the information under the [[National Security Act of 1947]], not through NSLs.

== ''Doe v. Ashcroft'' ==
{{Main|Doe v. Ashcroft}}
[[File:4610 001 redactednsl.pdf|thumb|Letter in ''[[Doe v. Ashcroft]]'' case]]

The lack of judicial oversight and the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'' was the core of ''Doe v. Ashcroft'', a test case brought by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] concerning the use of NSLs.  The lawsuit was file on behalf of "[[John Doe]]" plaintiff [[Nicholas Merrill]], founder of Calyx Internet Access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/29/terror/main614638.shtml|title=ACLU Sues Over Internet Privacy|website=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had received an NSL.  The action challenged the constitutionality of NSLs, specifically the nondisclosure provision.  At the district court, Judge of the [[Southern District of New York]] held in September 2004 that NSLs violated the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] ("it has the effect of authorizing coercive searches effectively immune from any judicial process") and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].  However, Judge Marrero stayed his ruling while the case proceeded to the court of appeals.

Because of the New York district court ruling, while the case was still on appeal, Congress amended the USA PATRIOT Act to provide for more judicial review of NSLs and clarified the NSL nondisclosure provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/toGPObss/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ177.109|title=Congress.gov – Library of Congress|website=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the U.S. Supreme Court rulings, there is still no requirement to seek judicial approval for the FBI issuing an NSL.

The government appealed Judge Marrero's decision to the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], which heard arguments in May 2006.  In March 2008, the Second Circuit ruled that nondisclosure provisions were permissible only when the FBI certified that disclosure may result in certain statutorily enumerated harms (see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 2709), and held the nondisclosure provision to a [[strict scrutiny]] standard.  The Second Circuit then returned the case to the district court based on amendments to the USA PATRIOT Act that Congress had enacted while the case had been on appeal.

[[File:Nsl kenneth sutton.pdf|thumb|Letter in the Doe v. Gonzales case]]

Another effect of ''Doe v. Ashcroft'' was increased [[congressional oversight]].  The amendments to the USA PATRIOT Act mentioned above included requirements for semiannual reporting to Congress.  Although the reports are classified, a nonclassified accounting of how many NSLs are issued is also required.  On April 28, 2006, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] reported to the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] that in calendar year 2005, "The Government made requests for certain information concerning 3,501 United States persons pursuant to NSLs. During this period, the total number of NSL requests ... for information concerning U.S. persons totaled 9,254."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/oipr/readingroom/2005fisa-ltr.pdf Report of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629094615/http://www.usdoj.gov/oipr/readingroom/2005fisa-ltr.pdf |date=2006-06-29 }}, United States Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the FBI agreed to lift partially the nondisclosure provision to allow Merrill to reveal his identity.&lt;ref name=mclaughlin&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Jenna|title=Federal Court Lifts National Security Letter Gag Order; First Time in 14 Years|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/09/14/federal-court-fully-lifts-fbi-gag-order-first-time-14-years/|accessdate=16 September 2015|agency=The Intercept|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merrill has since created a corporation for the purposes of educating and researching privacy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Security Letters and Gag Orders: Transcript|journal=[[On the Media]]|date=January 21, 2011|quote=Although you're allowed to challenge the gag every year now under the new [amended] law, the last time I did it, the government presented secret evidence that only they and the judge could see, and my attorneys could not see, and therefore could not challenge. It does kind of add up to a lot of responsibility, and that's part of what motivated me to start my nonprofit organization, the Calyx Institute. Part of it is to defend people who are gagged. Part of it is also to promote best practices among telecommunications companies in regards to the privacy of customer data. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2015, Judge Marrero rescinded the nondisclosure provision associated with the NSL Merrill had received, thereby allowing him to speak about the contents of the NSL. On November 30, 2015, the unredacted court ruling was published in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nicholas Merrill able to reveal the national security letter previously undisclosed|url = http://isp.yale.edu/node/6037|website = Information Society Project|accessdate = 2015-11-30|publisher = Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|la|Puer aeternus}}''''' (sometimes shortened to '''''puer'''''), Latin for "eternal boy", in mythology is a child-god who is forever young. In psychology it is an older person whose emotional life has remained at an adolescent level. The ''puer'' typically leads a [[wikt:provisional|provisional]] life due to the fear of being caught in a situation from which it might not be possible to escape. He covets independence and freedom, opposes boundaries and limits, and tends to find any restriction intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''puer'' in mythology==
The phrase ''puer aeternus'' comes from ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', an epic work by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC – c. 17 AD) dealing with Greek and Roman myths. In the poem, Ovid addresses the child-god [[Iacchus]] as ''puer aeternus'' and praises him for his role in the [[Eleusinian mysteries]]. Iacchus is later identified with the gods [[Dionysus]] and [[Eros]]. The ''puer'' is a god of vegetation and resurrection, the god of divine youth, such as [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Attis]], and [[Adonis]].&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of a young god who is slain and resurrected also appears in Egyptian mythology as the story of [[Osiris]].

==The ''puer'' in Jungian psychology==
Swiss [[psychiatrist]] [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]] developed a school of thought called [[analytical psychology]], distinguishing it from the [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). In analytical psychology (often called "Jungian psychology") the ''puer aeternus'' is an example of what Jung called an [[archetype]], one of the "primordial, structural elements of the human psyche".&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]] of the ''puer'' is the ''[[senex]]'' (Latin for "old man"), associated with the god [[Cronus]]—disciplined, controlled, responsible, rational, ordered. Conversely, the shadow of the ''senex'' is the ''puer'', related to [[Hermes]] or [[Dionysus]]—unbounded instinct, disorder, intoxication, whimsy.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.110"&gt;Sharp, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all archetypes, the ''puer'' is bi-polar, exhibiting both a "positive" and a "negative" aspect. The "positive" side of the ''puer'' appears as the Divine Child who symbolizes newness, potential for growth, hope for the future. He also foreshadows the hero that he sometimes becomes (e.g. [[Heracles]]). The "negative" side is the child-man who refuses to grow up and meet the challenges of life face on, waiting instead for his ship to come in and solve all his problems.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For the time being one is doing this or that... it is ''not yet'' what is really wanted, and there is always the fantasy that sometime in the future the real thing will come about.... The one thing dreaded throughout by such a type of man is to be bound to anything whatever."&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Common symptoms of ''puer'' psychology are dreams of an imprisonment and similar imagery: chains, bars, cages, entrapment, bondage. Life itself...is experienced as a prison."&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.110"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the subject is a female the Latin term is '''''puella aeterna''''', imaged in mythology as the [[Persephone|Kore]] (Greek for "maiden").&lt;ref&gt;Hopcke, ch. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  One might also speak of a ''puer [[anima and animus|animus]]'' when describing the masculine side of the female psyche, or a ''puella [[anima and animus|anima]]'' when speaking of a man's inner feminine component.

===Works concerning===
[[Image:Peter Pan 1915 cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of 1915 edition of J.M. Barrie's novel, first published in 1911.]]

C.G. Jung wrote a paper on the ''puer aeternus'', "The Psychology of the Child Archetype", contained in Part IV of ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (Collected Works, Vol. 9i). The hero-child aspect and his relationship to the [[Mother goddess|Great Mother]] is dealt with in chapters 4 and 5 of Part Two of ''Symbols of Transformation'' (Collected Works, Vol. 5).&lt;ref&gt;Hopcke, ch. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "Answer to Job" (contained in ''Psychology and Religion:  West and East'', Vol. 11 of the Collected Works; but also published separately) Jung refers to the ''puer aeternus'' as a figure representing the future psychological development of human beings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"That higher and 'complete' (''teleios'') man is begotten by the 'unknown' father and born from Wisdom, and it is he who, in the figure of the ''puer aeternus''—'vultu mutabilis albus et ater'&lt;ref&gt;"Of changeful countenance, both white and black." Horace, ''Epistulae'', II, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;—represents our totality, which transcends consciousness. It was this boy into whom [[Faust]] had to change, abandoning his inflated onesidedness which saw the devil only outside. Christ's 'Except ye become as little children' prefigures this change, for in them the opposites lie close together; but what is meant is the boy who is born from the maturity of the adult man, and not the unconscious child we would like to remain."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, "Answer to Job", par. 742&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Problem of the Puer Aeternus'' is a book based on a series of lectures that Jungian analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] gave at the C.G. Jung Institute, Zurich, during the Winter Semester, 1959–1960. In the first eight of twelve lectures, von Franz illustrates the theme of the ''puer aeternus'' by examining the story of [[The Little Prince]] from the book of the same name by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]. The remaining four lectures are devoted to a study of a German novel by [[Bruno Goetz]], ''Das Reich ohne Raum'' (The Kingdom Without Space), first published in 1919. Of this novel von Franz says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is interesting that it was written and published before the Nazi movement came into being in 1933, before Hitler was ruminating on his morbid ideas. Bruno Goetz certainly had a prophetic gift about what was coming, and ... his book anticipates the whole Nazi problem, throwing light upon it from the angle of the ''puer aeternus''".&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Now or Neverland'' is a 1998 book written by Jungian analyst Ann Yeoman dealing with the ''puer aeternus'' in the form of [[Peter Pan]], one of the most well-known examples of the concept in the modern era. The book is a psychological overview of the eternal boy archetype, from its ancient roots to contemporary experience, including a detailed interpretation of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s popular play and novel.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mythologically, Peter Pan is linked to [...] the young god who dies and is reborn...as well as to Mercury/Hermes, [[psychopomp]] and messenger of the gods who moves freely between the divine and human realms, and, of course, to the great goat-god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] [....] In early performances of Barrie's play, Peter Pan appeared on stage with both pipes and a live goat.  Such undisguised references to the [[chthonic]], often lascivious and far from childlike goat-god were, not surprisingly, soon excised from both play and novel."&lt;ref&gt;Yeoman, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Peter Pan syndrome==
{{Other uses|Peter Pan syndrome (disambiguation){{!}}Peter Pan syndrome}}
{{see also|Boomerang Generation}}
Peter Pan syndrome is the [[pop-psychology]] concept of an adult who is socially immature.  The category is an informal one invoked by laypeople and some psychology professionals in popular psychology. It is not listed in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]],'' and is not recognized by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] as a specific [[mental disorder]].

Psychologist Dan Kiley popularized the Peter Pan syndrome in his 1983 book, ''The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up|author=Kiley, Dr. Dan|publisher= Avon Books|year=1983|isbn= 978-0380688906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''His next book, ''The Wendy Dilemma'' (1984), advises women romantically involved with "Peter Pans" how to improve their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wendy Dilemma: When Women Stop Mothering Their Men|author=Kiley, Dr. Dan|publisher=Arbor House Publishing|year=1984|isbn=9780877956259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Race}}

'''Race and health''' refers to the relationship between individual [[health]] and one's [[race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Differences in health status, health outcomes, [[life expectancy]], and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups are well documented, and referred to as racial [[health disparities]]. Some individuals in certain racial groups receive less care, have less access to resources, and live shorter lives in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Race is a complex concept, and the two major competing theories of race use biological definitions and social construction to define racial difference. A "race" is also viewed as physically distinguishable populations that share a common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |first1=Roberta |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this relationship can vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include but are not limited to ancestry, social [[Identity (social science)|identity]], visible [[phenotype]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=171|author=National Human Genome Research Institute|title=Race|work=Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"&gt;[[World Health Organization]]. [http://www.who.int/hia/evidence/doh/en/ ''The determinants of health'']. Geneva. Accessed 12 May 2011 (which are inter-related with all three, but mostly social factors).&lt;/ref&gt; Race and medicine are related additionally by how environmental factors and physiological factors respond to each other. Additionally, how genetic needs coerce with environmental standings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1047-2797(97)00051-3 |pmid=9250627 |title=Race and health: Basic questions, emerging directions |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=322–33 |year=1997 |last1=Williams |first1=David R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health disparities ==
Health disparities refer to gaps in the quality of health and [[health care]] across racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] defines health disparities as "population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Janet |last1=Goldberg |first2=William |last2=Hayes |first3=Jill |last3=Huntley |date=November 2004 |title=Understanding Health Disparities |publisher=Health Policy Institute of Ohio |url=http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010615/http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Health is measured through variables such as life expectancy and incidence of diseases.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Collins |first=Francis S. |title=What we do and don't know about 'race', 'ethnicity', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=36 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=S13–S15 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15507997 |doi=10.1038/ng1436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How researchers view race is often linked to how we address racial disparities because the national administrator of health uses these research findings to implement policies.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.brown.edu/reserves/pdffiles/34469_Whitmarsh_Vernaculars.pdf|title=Brown University Authentication for Web-Based Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining race ==
{{main|Race (human categorization)}}

There are various paradigms used to discuss race, including biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"/&gt; The terms race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race.

Biological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe "races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, aka use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences".&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Morning/|title=On Distinction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that "race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference|chapter=Chapter 4: Teaching Race|author=Ann Morning|p=114|year=2011|publisher= University of California Press |doi=10.1525/j.ctt1pnrht |isbn=978-0-520-27031-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social definitions are commonly constructionist. Racial groups are "constructed" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future.&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"/&gt;

Social views also better explain the ambiguity of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social interpretations of race]]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rds.epi-ucsf.org/ticr/syllabus/courses/23/2012/03/29/Lecture/readings/The%20Importance%20of%20Race%20&amp;%20Ethnicity%20in%20Biomedical%20Research%20and%20Clinical%20Practice..pdf|title=Training in Clinical Research Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.

==Race and disease==
There are a myriad of factors that affect health disparities between racial groups. Among these factors are genetic differences within racial populations, cultural [[mores]], and social and environmental factors. For instance, in some populations where perceptions of race are linked with socioeconomic disparities and differences, the access to care can be considerably lesser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=D R|last2=Lavizzo-Mourey|first2=R|last3=Warren|first3=R C|date=1994-01-01|title=The concept of race and health status in America.|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=109|issue=1|pages=26–41|issn=0033-3549|pmc=1402239|pmid=8303011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dually, bias in healthcare systems themselves can perpetuate non-biologically founded higher instances of disease. A study conducted by the [[National Health Service]] checks program in the United Kingdom, which aims to increase diagnosis across demographics, noted that "the reported lower screening in specific black and minority ethnic communities... may increase inequalities in health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Ruth|last2=Coghill|first2=Nikki|last3=Montgomery|first3=Alan|last4=Feder|first4=Gene|last5=Horwood|first5=Jeremy|date=2015-12-10|title=The provision of NHS health checks in a community setting: an ethnographic account|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=15|pages=546|doi=10.1186/s12913-015-1209-1|issn=1472-6963|pmc=4676171|pmid=26651487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this specific case, the lack of attention to certain demographics can be seen as a cause of increased instances of disease from this lack of proper, equal preventative care. One must consider these external factors when evaluating statistics on the prevalence of disease in populations, even though genetic components can play a role in predispositions to contracting some illnesses. These linkages should be more closely evaluated than by ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Carol R.|last2=Davis|first2=Margaret H.|last3=Palermo|first3=Ann-Gel S.|last4=Vladeck|first4=Bruce C.|date=2000-01-01|title=Approaches to Eliminating Sociocultural Disparities in Health|journal=Health Care Financing Review|volume=21|issue=4|pages=57–74|issn=0195-8631|pmc=4194638|pmid=11481745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, health disparities, which include variations in life expectancy and prevalence of disease, due to the differences in health conditions across various ethnic populations that can be attributed to inequalities in living environment and access to healthcare may also play a role.

===Single-gene disorders===
{{See also|Genetic disorder}}
There are many single gene [[genetic disorder]]s that differ in frequency between different populations due to the region, though many assume it to be solely based on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=YF|last2=Goldstein|first2=DB|last3=Angrist|first3=M|last4=Cavalleri|first4=G|title=Personalized medicine and human genetic diversity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine|date=24 July 2014|volume=4|issue=9|pages=a008581|pmid=25059740|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a008581|pmc=4143101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*[[Cystic fibrosis]], the most common life-limiting [[autosomal recessive]] disease among people of Northern European heritage
*[[Sickle-cell anemia]], most prevalent in populations with sub-Saharan African ancestry but also common among Latin-American, Middle Eastern populations, as well as those people of South European regions such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/sca.shtml|title=Human Genome Project Information Site Has Been Updated|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Miriam. ''Understanding Sickle Cell Disease.'' University Press of Mississippi, 1995. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thalassemia]], most prevalent in populations having Mediterranean ancestry, to the point that the disease's name is derived from Greek ''thalasson'', "sea"
*[[Tay–Sachs disease]], an autosomal recessive disorder more frequent among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] than among other Jewish groups and non-Jewish populations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5945951 | last1 = Myrianthopoulos  |name-list-format=vanc| first1 = NC | last2 = Aronson | first2 = SM | title = Population dynamics of Tay-Sachs disease. I. Reproductive fitness and selection. | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics| volume=18 | issue=4 |date=July 1966 | pages=313–27 | pmc = 1706099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hereditary hemochromatosis]], most common among persons having Northern European ancestry, in particular those people of Celtic descent
*[[Lactose intolerance]] affects (over their lifetime) as many as 25% of Europeans but up to 50-80% of Hispanics, along with Ashkenazi Jews, but nearly 100% of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Shinjini | last1=Bhatnagar | first2=Rakesh | last2=Aggarwal  | journal=British Medical Journal| year=2007 | pages=1331–1332 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39252.524375.80 | volume=334 | issue=7608 | title=Lactose intolerance | pmid=17599979 | pmc=1906652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multifactorial polygenic diseases===
Many diseases differ in frequency between different populations. However, complex diseases are affected by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. There is controversy over the extent to which some of these conditions are influenced by genes, and ongoing research aims to identify which genetic loci, if any, are linked to these diseases. "Risk is the probability that an event will occur. In epidemiology, it is most often used to express the probability that a particular outcome will occur following a particular exposure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf|title=Definitions of Risk|journal=Journal of Dental Education|date=October 1, 2001|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1007–8 |author=Brian A. Burt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031003820/http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf|archivedate=October 31, 2004|pmid=11699970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index3.html|title=WHO - Genes and human disease|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different populations are considered "high-risk" or "low-risk" groups for various diseases due to the probability of that particular population being more exposed to certain risk factors. Beyond genetic factors, history and culture, as well as current environmental and social conditions, influence a certain populations' risk for specific diseases.

===Disease progression===
Groups may differ in how a disease progresses. Black men who were diagnosed with HIV generally fared worse than their white and Hispanic counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2007|title=Racial/ethnic and age disparities in HIV prevalence and disease progression among men who have sex with men in the United States|url=|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1060–6|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.087551|pmc=1874211|pmid=17463370|author1=Hall HI|author2=Byers RH|author3=Ling Q|author4=Espinoza L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of men studied with very low CD4+ T-cell count, defined as fewer than 50 cells per microliter, at AIDS diagnosis was 24.1% for white men, 27.8% for Hispanic men, and 34.4% for Black men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Black men were also significantly less likely to be alive three years after diagnosis (80.6%) than Hispanic or white men, who had 85.2% and 84.5% survival rates, respectively. However, the reasons for these differences are not clear, and should not be understood as an essential difference between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Prevention===
Genetics have been proven to be a strong predictor for common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric illnesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernandez|first=Lyla M.|last2=Blazer|first2=Dan G.|last3=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Assessing Interactions Among Social|first3=Behavioral|date=2006-01-01|title=Genetics and Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19932/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and geneticists have been able to determine that "[[human genetic variation]] is geographically structured".  The different geographic regions correlate with different races,&lt;ref name=pmid15508000&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorde|first=Lynn B.|last2=Wooding|first2=Stephen P.|date=2004-10-26|title=Genetic variation, classification and 'race' |journal=Nature Genetics|language=en|volume=36|issue=11 Suppl|pages=S28–S33|doi=10.1038/ng1435|pmid=15508000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is logical when looking at the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|"Out of Africa" theory]] and understanding how changes in genetics of a population acquire over time.

Examples of diseases which are more common in certain racial groups are [[sickle-cell disease]] in African and Mediterranean populations, and [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[HFE hereditary haemochromatosis|hemochromatosis]] in northern European populations.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;  This information can be made available to people by their physicians, and is useful in prevention or early detection of these diseases.  For instance, a baby with sickle cell disease should be more closely monitored throughout their life than a baby without it.

While genetics certainly play a role in determining how susceptible a person is to specific diseases, environmental factors and lifestyle play a large role as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Norman B.|last2=Bulatao|first2=Rodolfo A.|last3=Cohen|first3=Barney|last4=National Research Council (US) Panel on Race|first4=Ethnicity|date=2004-01-01|title=Genetic Factors in Ethnic Disparities in Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25517/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, it is impossible to discern exactly what causes a person to acquire a disease, but it's clear that a mixture of all 3 factors are at play.  Each person's health is unique, as they have different genetic compositions and life histories.

===Race-based treatment===

"Race-based medicine" is the term for medicines that are targeted at specific ethnic clusters which are shown to have a propensity for a certain disorder. The first example of this in the U.S. was when [[BiDil]], a medication for congestive heart failure, was licensed specifically for use in American patients that self-identify as black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = AL | last2 = Ziesche | first2 = S | last3 = Yancy | first3 = C |name-list-format=vanc| last4 = Carson | first4 = P | last5 = D'agostino Jr | first5 = R | last6 = Ferdinand | first6 = K | last7 = Taylor | first7 = M | last8 = Adams | first8 = K | last9 = Sabolinski | first9 = M| last10 = Worcel | first10 = Manuel | last11 = Cohn | first11 = Jay N. | date = November 2004 | title=Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | url = | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 20| pages = 2049–57 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042934 | pmid = 15533851 | display-authors = 8 | author12 = African-American Heart Failure Trial Investigators }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had shown that African American patients with congestive heart failure generally respond less effectively to traditional treatments than white patients with similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Exner | first1 = DV | last2 = Dries | first2 = DL | last3 = Domanski | first3 = MJ | last4 = Cohn | first4 = JN |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2001 | title = Lesser response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy in blacks as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 344 | issue = 18| pages = 1351–7 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105033441802 | pmid = 11333991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two trials, BiDil was licensed exclusively for use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely that it was more effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2006.00181.x |title=Medicine in black and white: BiDil®: race and the limits of evidence‐based medicine |journal=Significance |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=118–21 |year=2006 |last1=Ellison |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics are concerned that the trend of research on race-specific pharmaceutical treatments will result in inequitable access to pharmaceutical innovation and smaller minority groups may be ignored. This has led to a call for regulatory approaches to be put in place to ensure scientific validity of racial disparity in pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Winichoff, D. E.|author2=Obasagie, O.

An alternative to "race-based medicine" is personalized medicine that involves identifying genetic, genomic (i.e., genomic sequencing), and clinical information—as opposed to using race as a proxy for these data—to better predict a patient's predisposition to certain diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-conditions/cancer/personalized-medicine#2|title=2.

==Environmental factors==

A positive correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in [[health]]. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that [[Minority group|minorities]] in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets.&lt;ref name="Suarez 912–920"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Jonathan J.|last2=Isakova|first2=Tamara|last3=Anderson|first3=Cheryl A.

Furthermore, this can also occur when minorities living in rural areas undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students who participated in this study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]], or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angkurawaranon|first=Chaisiri|last2=Wisetborisut|first2=Anawat|last3=Rerkasem|first3=Kittipan|last4=Seubsman|first4=Sam-ang|last5=Sleigh|first5=Adrian|last6=Doyle|first6=Pat|last7=Nitsch|first7=Dorothea|date=2015-09-16|title=Early life urban exposure as a risk factor for developing obesity and impaired fasting glucose in later adulthood: results from two cohorts in Thailand|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=15 |pages=902|doi=10.1186/s12889-015-2220-5|issn=1471-2458|pmc=4572635|pmid=26376960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food.  Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet;  this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from [[Cyprus]], a country east of the mediterranean sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazarou|first=Chrystalleni|last2=Kalavana|first2=Theano|date=2009-01-01|title=Urbanization influences dietary habits of Cypriot children: the CYKIDS study|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=54|issue=2|pages=69–77|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-8054-0|issn=1661-8564|pmid=19234670}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.

==Genetic factors==
The fact that every human has a unique genetic code is the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting. Versions of a trait, known as alleles, occur at different frequencies in different human populations; populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more.

A phenotype is the "outward, physical manifestation" of an organism."&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/BioInfo/GP/Definition.html|title=Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, phenotypic differences are most readily seen via skin color, eye color, hair color, or height; however, any observable structure, function, or behavior can be considered part of a phenotype. A genotype is the "internally coded, inheritable information" carried by all living organisms. The human genome is encoded in DNA&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"/&gt;

For any trait of interest, observed differences among individuals "may be due to differences in the genes" coding for a trait or "the result of variation in environmental condition". This variability is due to gene-environment interactions that influence genetic expression patterns and trait heritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/heritability/heritability.htm|title=Estimating additive genetic variation and heritability of phenotypic traits|website=userwww.sfsu.edu|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For humans, there is "more genetic variation among individual people than between larger racial groups".&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt; In general, an average of 80% of genetic variation exists within local populations, around 10% is between local populations within the same continent, and approximately 8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-9063-3_14 |chapter=The Apportionment of Human Diversity |title=Evolutionary Biology |pages=381–98 |year=1972 |last1=Lewontin |first1=R.

Genes may be under strong selection in response to local diseases. For example, people who are [[duffy antigen|duffy negative]] tend to have higher resistance to malaria. Most Africans are duffy negative and most non-Africans are duffy positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria and the Red Cell|publisher=Harvard University|year=2002|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127201806/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|archivedate=2011-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of genetic diseases more prevalent in malaria-afflicted areas may provide some [[genetic resistance to malaria]] including [[sickle cell disease]], [[thalassaemias]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and possibly others.

[[Cystic fibrosis#Theories about prevalence|Many theories about the origin of the cystic fibrosis]] have suggested that it provides a [[heterozygote advantage]] by giving resistance to diseases earlier common in Europe.

In earlier research, a common theory was the "[[common disease-common variant]]" model. It argues that for common illnesses, the genetic contribution comes from the additive or multiplicative effects of gene variants that each one is common in the population. Each such gene variant is argued to cause only a small risk of disease and no single variant is enough to cause the disease. An individual must have many of these common gene variants in order for the risk of disease to be substantial.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = King | first2 = M.

More recent research indicates that the "common disease-rare variant" may be a better explanation for many common diseases. In this model, rare but higher-risk gene variants cause common diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schork|first=N.J|year=2009|title=Common vs. rare allele hypotheses for complex diseases|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=19|issue=3|pages=212–219|via=|pmid=19481926|pmc=2914559|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2009.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model may be relevant for diseases that reduces fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krausz|first=C|year=2015|title=Genetics of male infertility: From research to clinic|journal=Reproduction|volume=150|issue=5|pages=R159–R174|via=|pmid=26447148|doi= 10.1530/REP-15-0261|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/150/5/R159.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, for common genes associated with common disease to persist they must either have little effect during the reproductive period of life (like [[Alzheimer's disease]]) or provide some advantage in the original environment (like genes causing autoimmune diseases also providing resistance against infections). In either case varying frequencies of genes variants in different populations may be an explanation for health disparities.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315/&gt; Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, [[deep venous thrombosis]], [[Crohn disease]], and [[type 2 diabetes]] appear to adhere to "common disease-common variant" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lohmueller KE, Pearce CL, Pike M, Lander ES, Hirschhorn JN | year = 2003 | title = Meta-analysis of genetic association studies supports a contribution of common variants to susceptibility to common disease | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 177–182 | doi = 10.1038/ng1071 | pmid = 12524541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene flow===
[[Gene flow]] and [[Genetic admixture|admixture]] can also have an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders. Multiple sclerosis, for example, is typically associated with people of European descent, but due to admixture African Americans have elevated levels of the disorder relative to Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15596747  |name-list-format=vanc| last1 = Cree | first1 = BA | last2 = Khan | first2 = O | last3 = Bourdette | first3 = D | last4 = Goodin | first4 = DS | last5 = Cohen | first5 = JA | last6 = Marrie | first6 = RA | last7 = Glidden | first7 = D | last8 = Weinstock-Guttman | first8 = B | last9 = Reich | first9 = D | last10 =Patterson | first10 =N. | last11 =Haines | first11 =J.

Some diseases and physiological variables vary depending upon their admixture ratios. Examples include measures of [[insulin]] functioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gower B. A.| year = 2003 | title = Using genetic admixture to explain racial differences in insulin-related phenotypes | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 1047–1051 | doi=10.2337/diabetes.52.4.1047|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernandez J.

=== Gene interactions ===
The same gene variant, or group of gene variants, may produce different effects in different populations depending on differences in the gene variants, or groups of gene variants, they interact with. One example is the rate of progression to [[AIDS]] and death in [[HIV]]&amp;ndash;infected patients. In Caucasians and Hispanics, HHC [[haplotype]]s were associated with disease retardation, particularly a delayed progression to death, while for African Americans, possession of HHC haplotypes was associated with disease acceleration. In contrast, while the disease-retarding effects of the CCR2-641 allele were found in African Americans, they were not found in Caucasians.&lt;ref name=gonz1996&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gonzalez E, etal | year = 1999 | title = Race-specific HIV-1 disease-modifying effects associated with CCR5 haplotypes | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.21.12004 | journal = Proc.

==Controversy==
{{See also|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}

There is a controversy regarding race as a method for classifying humans. Different sources argue it is purely social construct&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witzig|first=Ritchie|date=1996-10-15|title=The Medicalization of Race: Scientific Legitimization of a Flawed Social Construct|url=http://annals.org/aim/article/710064/medicalization-race-scientific-legitimization-flawed-social-construct|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=125|issue=8|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-125-8-199610150-00008|issn=0003-4819|pmid=8849153|pages=675–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a biological reality reflecting average genetic group differences.  New interest in human biological variation has resulted in a resurgence of the use of race in biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Page 188. "Far from waning in the age of molecular genetics, race has been resurgent in biomedical discourse, especially in relation to a torrent of new interest in human biological variation and its quantification."&lt;/ref&gt;

The main impetus for this development is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of certain [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors, such as genetically conditioned health factors, based on more easily ascertained characteristics such as phenotype and racial self-identification. Since medical judgment often involves decision making under uncertain conditions,&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; many doctors consider it useful to take race into account when treating disease because diseases and treatment responses tend to cluster by geographic ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/magazine/i-am-a-racially-profiling-doctor.html "I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor"]. The New York Times, published May 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup.

Race in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

Taking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9" /&gt;

The continued use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the continued use of racial categories in health care and as risk factors could result in increased [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and discrimination in society and health services.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 5"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S.

Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.

David Williams (1994) argued, after an examination of articles in the journal ''Health Services Research'' during the 1966–90 period, that how race was determined and defined was seldom described. At a minimum, researchers should describe if race was assessed by self-report, proxy report, extraction from records, or direct observation. Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator of socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Williams DR |title=The concept of race in Health Services Research: 1966 to 1990 |journal=Health Services Research |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=261–74 |date=August 1994 |pmid=8063565 |pmc=1070005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with and the role of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Goodman AH |title=Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health) |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1699–702 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11076233 |pmc=1446406 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.11.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is general agreement that a goal of health-related genetics should be to move past the weak surrogate relationships of racial health disparity and get to the root causes of health and disease. This includes research which strives to analyze human genetic variation in smaller groups than races across the world.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

One such method is called ethnogenetic layering. It works by focusing on geographically identified microethnic groups. For example, in the Mississippi Delta region ethnogenetic layering might include such microethnic groups as the Cajun (as a subset of European Americans), the Creole and Black groups [with African origins in Senegambia, Central Africa and Bight of Benin] (as a subset of African Americans), and Choctaw, Houmas, Chickasaw, Coushatta, Caddo, Atakapa, Karankawa and Chitimacha peoples (as subsets of Native Americans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson F.L.C. | year = 2008 | title = Ethnogenetic layering (EL): an alternative to the traditional race model in human variation and health disparity studies | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 121–144 | doi = 10.1080/03014460801941752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = F.

Better still may be individual genetic assessment of relevant genes.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt; As genotyping and sequencing have become more accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/internet/site/data/sup_data/2253/individual_genomes_instead_of_race_for_personalized_medicine.pdf |title=Individual Genomes Instead of Race for Personalized Medicine|vauthors=Ng PC, Zhao Q, Levy S, Strausberg RL, Venter JC|journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|year=2008|volume=84|issue=3|pages=306–309|doi=10.1038/clpt.2008.114|pmid=18714319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when such methods become commonly available, race will continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;

Some doctors and scientists such as geneticist [[Neil Risch]] argue that using self-identified race as a proxy for ancestry is necessary to be able to get a sufficiently broad sample of different ancestral populations, and in turn to be able to provide health care that is tailored to the needs of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Risch N. |author2=Burchard E. |author3=Ziv E. |author4=Tang H. | year = 2002 | title = Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007| journal = Genome Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 7| pages = 1–12 | pmc=139378 | pmid=12184798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association studies==
{{See also|Genetic association}}
One area in which population categories can be important considerations in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. [[Association studies]] can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that are not related to the disease being studied,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cardon LR, Palmer LJ | year = 2003 | title = Population stratification and spurious allelic association | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9357| pages = 598–604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12520-2 | pmid = 12598158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchini J, Cardon LR, Phillips MS, Donnelly P | year = 2004 | title = The effects of human population structure on large genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 512–517 | doi = 10.1038/ng1337 | pmid = 15052271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas DC, Witte JS | year = 2002 | title = Point: population stratification: a problem for case-control studies of candidate-gene associations? | url = | journal = Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 505–512 | pmid = 12050090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wacholder S, Rothman N, Caporaso N|title=Counterpoint: bias from population stratification is not a major threat to the validity of conclusions from epidemiological studies of common polymorphisms and cancer|journal=Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev|year=2002|volume=11|issue=6|pages=513–20 |pmid=12050091|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/6/513.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various techniques detect and account for population substructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton NE, Collins A | year = 1998 | title = Tests and estimates of allelic association in complex inheritance | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 95 | issue = 19| pages = 11389–11393 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.19.11389 | pmid = 9736746 | pmc = 21652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoggart CJ, Parra EJ, Shriver MD, Bonilla C, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2003 | title = Control of confounding of genetic associations in stratified populations | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 72 | issue = 6| pages = 1492–1504 | doi = 10.1086/375613 | pmid = 12817591 | pmc = 1180309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these methods can be difficult to apply in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Freedman ML|author2=Reich D|author3=Penney KL|author4=McDonald GJ|author5=Mignault AA|author6=Patterson N|author7=Gabriel SB|author8=Topol EJ|author9=Smoller JW | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the impact of population stratification on genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 388–393 | pmid = 15052270 | doi = 10.1038/ng1333 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population genetic substructure also can aid genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range [[linkage disequilibrium]] between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers than is the case for other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoggart CJ, Shriver MD, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2004 | title = Design and analysis of admixture mapping studies | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5| pages = 965–978 | pmid = 15088268 | doi = 10.1086/420855 | pmc = 1181989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors  = Patterson N, Hattangadi N, Lane B, Lohmueller KE, Hafler DA, Oksenberg JR, Hauser SL, Smith MW, O'Brien SJ | year = 2004 | title = Methods for high-density admixture mapping of disease genes | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5| pages = 979–1000 | pmid = 15088269 | doi = 10.1086/420871 | pmc = 1181990 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith| first1 = Michael W.| last2 = Patterson| first2 = Nick| last3 = Lautenberger| first3 = James A.| last4 = Truelove| first4 = Ann L.| last5 = McDonald| first5 = Gavin J.| last6 = Waliszewska| first6 = Alicja| last7 = Kessing| first7 = Bailey D.| last8 = Malasky| first8 = Michael J.| last9 = Scafe| first9 = Charles| last10 = Le| first10 = Ernest| last11 = Jager| first11 = Philip L.

==Human genome projects==
The [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] has collected genetic samples from 52 indigenous populations.

==Sources of racial disparities in care==
In a report by the [[Institute of Medicine]] called Unequal Treatment, three major source categories are put forth as potential explanations for disparities in health care: patient-level variables, healthcare system-level factors, and care process-level variables.&lt;ref name=Smed2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Smedley|first=Brian D.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=0-309-50911-4|pages=7–12|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient-level variables===
There are many individual factors that could explain the established differences in health care between different racial and ethnic groups.  First, attitudes and behaviors of minority patients are different.  They are more likely to refuse recommended services, adhere poorly to treatment regimens, and delay seeking care, yet despite this, these behaviors and attitudes are unlikely to explain the differences in health care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; In addition to behaviors and attitudes, biological based racial differences have been documented, but these also seem unlikely to explain the majority of observed disparities in care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt;

===Health system-level factors===
Health system-level factors include any aspects of health systems that can have different effects on patient outcomes.  Some of these factors include different access to services, access to insurance or other means to pay for services, access to adequate language and interpretation services, and geographic availability of different services.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Many studies assert that these factors explain portions of the existing disparities in health of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States when compared to their white counterparts.

===Care process-level variables===
Three major mechanisms are suggested by the Institute of Medicine that may contribute to healthcare disparities from the provider's side: bias (or prejudice) against racial and ethnic minorities; greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority patients; and beliefs held by the provider about the behavior or health of minorities.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Research in this area is new and ongoing.

''Sakuteiki'' is most likely the oldest garden planning text in the world. It was written in the mid-to-late 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Takei, Jiro ''et al.'' (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Eunlt5YbXcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq= ''Sakuteiki Visions of the Japanese Garden: A Modern Translation of Japan's Gardening Classic,'' p. 3 n1].&lt;/ref&gt; During the Kamakura period, it was referred to as the '''''Senzai Hisshō''''', or the ''Secret Selection on Gardens'' before it acquired the title ''Sakuteiki'' in the Edo period.

==Overview==
The unillustrated ''Sakuteiki'' is the first systematic record of the styles of gardening in the [[Heian period]], which had been the product of oral tradition for many years. It precisely defines the art of landscape gardening as an aesthetic endeavor based on poetic feeling of the designer and the site.&lt;ref&gt;Kuitert, Wybe. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dVr1-YSziUIC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq= ''Themes in the History of Japanese Garden Art,'' p. 30-52].&lt;/ref&gt; It enumerates five styles of gardening, including
* the "Ocean Style" (''taikai no yō'')&lt;ref name="takei162"&gt;Takei, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Eunlt5YbXcC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=  p. 162].&lt;/ref&gt;  
* the "Mountain Torrent Style" (''yama kawa no yō'')&lt;ref name="takei162"/&gt; 
* the "Broad River Style" (''taiga no yō'')&lt;ref name="takei162"/&gt; 
* the "Wetland Style" (''numa ike no yō'')&lt;ref name="takei162"/&gt; 
* the "Reed Style" (''ashide no yō'')&lt;ref name="takei162"/&gt; 

The ''Sakuteiki'' was written in a time during which the placing of stones was the most important part of gardening, and it literally defined the art of garden making, using the expression ''ishi wo tateru koto'' to mean not only stone placement but garden making itself. It advises the reader not only how to place the stones but also how to follow the "desire" of the stones.

His second novel, ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (1981), won the [[Booker Prize]] in 1981 and was deemed to be "the best novel of all winners" on two separate occasions, marking the [[Man Booker Prize#Winners|25th]] and the [[The Best of the Booker|40th anniversary of the prize]]. Much of his fiction is set on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He combines [[magical realism]] with [[Historical novel|historical fiction]]; his work is concerned with the many connections, disruptions, and migrations between [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western civilization]]s.

His fourth novel, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1988), was the subject of [[The Satanic Verses controversy|a major controversy]], provoking protests from [[Muslim]]s in several countries. Death threats were made against him, including a ''[[fatwā]]'' calling for his assassination issued by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], on 14 February 1989. The British government put Rushdie under police protection.

In 1983 Rushdie was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]], the UK's senior literary organisation. He was appointed Commandeur de l'[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] of France in January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-01-07/news/9901070421_1_indian-born-writer-british-novelist-salman-rushdie-fatwa "Rushdie to Receive Top Literary Award",] ''Chicago Tribune'', 7 January 1999.

==Career==

===Copywriter===
Rushdie worked as a [[copywriting|copywriter]] for the advertising agency [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], where he came up with "irresistibubble" for [[Aero (chocolate)|Aero]] and "Naughty but Nice" for cream cakes, and for the agency Ayer Barker, for whom he wrote the memorable line "That'll do nicely" for [[American Express]].&lt;ref name=southasiandiaspora&gt;Ravikrishnan, Ashutosh.

===Major literary work===
Rushdie's first novel, ''[[Grimus]]'' (1975), a part-science fiction tale, was generally ignored by the public and literary critics. His next novel, ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (1981), catapulted him to literary notability. This work won the 1981 [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] and, in 1993 and 2008, was awarded the Best of the Bookers as the best novel to have received the prize during its first 25 and 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Midnight's Children'' follows the life of a child, born at the stroke of midnight as India gained its independence, who is endowed with special powers and a connection to other children born at the dawn of a new and tumultuous age in the history of the Indian sub-continent and [[History of the Republic of India|the birth of the modern nation of India]]. The character of Saleem Sinai has been compared to Rushdie.&lt;ref&gt;''Saleem (Sinai) is not Salman (Rushdie)(although he marries a Padma) and Saleem's grandfather Dr Aadam Aziz is not him either, but there is a touching prescience at work here. In the opening pages of Midnight's Children, Dr Aziz while bending down on his prayer mat, bumps his nose on a hard tussock of earth. His nose bleeds and his eyes water and he decides then and there that never again will he bow before God or man. 'This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history.' Battered by a fatwa and one femme fatale too many, Salman would have some understanding of this.'' One more bouquet for Saleem Sinai 20 July 2008 by Nina Martyris, TNN. ''The Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author has refuted the idea of having written any of his characters as autobiographical, stating, "People assume that because certain things in the character are drawn from your own experience, it just becomes you. In that sense, I’ve never felt that I’ve written an autobiographical character."&lt;ref name=Meer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meer|first1=Ameena|title=Interview: Salman Rushdie|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]]|date=1989|volume=27|issue=Spring|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/1199/|accessdate=22 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111324/http://bombmagazine.org/article/1199/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Midnight's Children'', Rushdie wrote ''[[Shame (Rushdie novel)|Shame]]'' (1983), in which he depicts the political turmoil in [[Pakistan]], basing his characters on [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. ''Shame'' won France's ''[[Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger]]'' (Best Foreign Book) and was a close runner-up for the Booker Prize. Both these works of [[postcolonial literature]] are characterised by a style of [[magic realism]] and the immigrant outlook that Rushdie is very conscious of as a member of the [[Kashmiri diaspora]].

Rushdie wrote a non-fiction book about [[Nicaragua]] in 1987 called ''[[The Jaguar Smile]]''. This book has a political focus and is based on his first-hand experiences and research at the scene of [[Sandinista]] political experiments.

His most controversial work, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', was published in 1988 (see [[#Satanic Verses and the fatwā|section below]]).

In addition to books, Rushdie has published many short stories, including those collected in ''[[East, West]]'' (1994). ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'', a family epic ranging over some 100 years of India's history was published in 1995. ''[[The Ground Beneath Her Feet]]'' (1999) presents an [[Alternate history|alternative history]] of modern rock music. The [[The Ground Beneath Her Feet (song)|song of the same name]] by [[U2]] is one of many song lyrics included in the book; hence Rushdie is credited as the lyricist. He also wrote ''[[Haroun and the Sea of Stories]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haroun and the sea of stories|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/haroun-and-the-sea-of-stories/oclc/469624687&amp;referer=brief_results|website=WorldCat|publisher=OCLC|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salman-Rushdie-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Salman Rushdie presenting his book ''[[Shalimar the Clown]]'']]

Rushdie has had a string of commercially successful and critically acclaimed novels. His 2005 novel ''[[Shalimar the Clown]]'' received, in India, the prestigious [[Hutch Crossword Book Award]], and was, in the UK, a finalist for the [[Whitbread Book Awards]]. It was shortlisted for the 2007 [[International Dublin Literary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.impacdublinaward.ie/2007/shortlist.htm | title=The 2007 Shortlist | year=2007 | accessdate=5 April 2007 | publisher=Dublin City Public Libraries/International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429175834/http://www.impacdublinaward.ie/2007/shortlist.htm | archivedate=29 April 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 non-fiction collection ''Step Across This Line'', he professes his admiration for the Italian writer [[Italo Calvino]] and the American writer [[Thomas Pynchon]], among others. His early influences included [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Günter Grass]], and [[James Joyce]]. Rushdie was a personal friend of [[Angela Carter]]'s and praised her highly in the foreword of her collection ''Burning your Boats''.

His novel ''[[Luka and the Fire of Life]]'' was published in November 2010. Earlier that year, he announced that he was writing his memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/12/salman-rushdie-fatwa-memoir "Salman Rushdie at work on fatwa memoir"], ''The Guardian'', 12 October 2010. Retrieved 14 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''[[Joseph Anton: A Memoir]]'', which was published in September 2012.

In 2012, Salman Rushdie became one of the first major authors to embrace [[Booktrack]] (a company that synchronises ebooks with customised soundtracks), when he published his short story "[[In the South (Short Story)|In the South]]" on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://booktrack.serveronline.net/blog/?p=164|title=Salman Rushdie Collaborates With Booktrack and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Booktrack Launches A New E-reader Platform|publisher=Booktrack|accessdate=2 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404115658/http://booktrack.serveronline.net/blog/?p=164|archivedate=4 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Year 2015 saw the publication of Rushdie's novel [[Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights]], a shift back to his old beloved technique of magic realism. This novel is designed in the structure of a Chinese mystery box with different layers. Based on the central conflict of scholar [[Ibn Rushd]], (from whom Rushdie's family name derives), Rushdie goes on to explore several themes of [[transnationalism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]] by depicting a war of the universe which a supernatural world of [[jinns]] also accompanies.

===Other activities===
Rushdie has quietly mentored younger Indian (and ethnic-Indian) writers, influenced an entire generation of [[Indo-Anglian]] writers, and is an influential writer in postcolonial literature in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000701000000*/http://www.csulb.edu/~bhfinney/SalmanRushdie.html |date=1 July 2000 |title=Demonizing Discourse in Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received many plaudits for his writings, including the European Union's [[Aristeion Prize]] for Literature, the [[Premio Grinzane Cavour]] (Italy), and the Writer of the Year Award in Germany and many of literature's highest honours.&lt;ref&gt;Times of India Story on Rushdie's influence and awards [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Review/One_more_bouquet_for_Saleem_Sinai/articleshow/3254751.cms Indiatimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Rushdie was the President of [[PEN American Center]] from 2004 to 2006 and founder of the [[PEN World Voices]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/rushdie-brings-pen-festival-to-close/| title=PEN New York Times Rushdie, founder of PEN World Voices Festival | work=The New York Times | first=Larry | last=Rohter | date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He opposed the British government's introduction of the [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006|Racial and Religious Hatred Act]], something he writes about in his contribution to ''Free Expression Is No Offence'', a collection of essays by several writers, published by [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] in November 2005.

In May 2008 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2.php Academicians Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504085720/http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2.php |date=4 May 2012 }}, American Academy of Arts and Letters. Retrieved 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, he joined the [[New York University]] Journalism Faculty as a Distinguished Writer in Residence.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalism.nyu.edu/about-us/news-post/2015/03/05/new-distinguished-writer-in-residence-salman-rushdie/&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he enjoys writing, Salman Rushdie says that he would have become an actor if his writing career had not been successful. Even from early childhood, he dreamed of appearing in Hollywood movies (which he later realised in his frequent cameo appearances).

Rushdie includes fictional television and movie characters in some of his writings. He had a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (2001 film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' based on the [[Bridget Jones's Diary|book of the same name]], which is itself full of literary in-jokes. On 12 May 2006, Rushdie was a guest host on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', where he interviewed [[Indo-Canadian]] filmmaker [[Deepa Mehta]], whose 2005 film, ''[[Water (2005 film)|Water]]'', faced violent protests. He appears in the role of [[Helen Hunt]]'s [[obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician-gynecologist]] in the film adaptation (Hunt's directorial debut) of [[Elinor Lipman]]'s novel ''[[Then She Found Me]]''. In September 2008, and again in March 2009, he appeared as a panellist on the HBO program ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''. Rushdie has said that he was approached for a cameo in ''[[Talladega Nights]]'': "They had this idea, just one shot in which three very, very unlikely people were seen as [[NASCAR]] drivers. And I think they approached [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Lou Reed]], and me. We were all supposed to be wearing the uniforms and the helmet, walking in slow motion with the heat haze." In the end their schedules didn't allow for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Salman Rushdie|url=http://the-talks.com/interviews/salman-rushdie/|publisher=The Talks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushdie collaborated on the screenplay for the cinematic adaptation of his novel ''Midnight's Children'' with director [[Deepa Mehta]].

[[File:9.21.14WritersLifePanelByLuigiNovi18.jpg|thumb|Rushdie, right, with writers [[Catherine Lacey (author)|Catherine Lacey]] and [[Siri Hustvedt]] at the 2014 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]
Rushdie announced in June 2011 that he had written the first draft of a script for a new television series for the US cable network [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], a project on which he will also serve as an executive producer. The new series, to be called ''The Next People'', will be, according to Rushdie, "a sort of paranoid science-fiction series, people disappearing and being replaced by other people." The idea of a television series was suggested by his US agents, said Rushdie, who felt that television would allow him more creative control than feature film. ''The Next People'' is being made by the British film production company [[Working Title]], the firm behind such projects as ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Salman Rushdie says TV drama series have taken the place of novels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/12/salman-rushdie-write-tv-drama|work=The Guardian |date=12 June 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' in September 1988 caused immediate controversy in the [[Islamic world]] because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depiction of [[Muhammad]]. The title refers to a disputed [[hadith|Muslim tradition]] that is related in the book. According to this tradition, Muhammad ([[Mahound]] in the book) added verses (''[[Ayah]]'') to the [[Qur'an]] accepting three goddesses who used to be worshipped in [[Mecca]] as divine beings. According to the legend, Muhammad later revoked the verses, saying [[the devil]] tempted him to utter these lines to appease the Meccans (hence the "Satanic" verses). However, the narrator reveals to the reader that these disputed verses were actually from the mouth of the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]]. The [[banned books|book was banned]] in many countries with large Muslim communities (13 in total: Iran, India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, Singapore, Venezuela, and Pakistan).

In response to the protests, on 22 January 1989 Rushdie published a column in ''[[The Observer]]'' that called Muhammad "one of the great geniuses of world history," but noted that Islamic doctrine holds Muhammad to be human, and in no way perfect. He held that the novel is not "an anti-religious novel. It is, however, an attempt to write about migration, its stresses and transformations."&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rushdie|first1=Salman|title=Choice between light and dark|work=[[The Observer]]|date=22 January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 1989—Valentine's Day, and also the day of his close friend [[Bruce Chatwin]]'s funeral—a ''[[fatwā]]'' ordering Rushdie's execution was proclaimed on Radio Tehran by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]], the [[Supreme leader of Iran|spiritual leader of Iran]] at the time, calling the book "[[blasphemy|blasphemous]] against Islam". (Chapter IV of the book depicts the character of an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]] in [[exile]] who returns to incite revolt from the people of his country with no regard for their safety.)  A bounty was offered for Rushdie's death,&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/salman-rushdie-iranian-state-media-renew-fatwa-on-satanic-verses-author-with-600000-bounty-a6887141.html The Independent: Salman Rushdie fatwa history]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was thus forced to live under police protection for several years.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; On 7 March 1989, the United Kingdom and [[Iran]] broke [[Iran&amp;nbsp;– United Kingdom relations|diplomatic]] relations over the Rushdie controversy.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

When, on [[BBC Radio 4]], he was asked for a response to the threat, Rushdie said, "Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book," and 'I'm very sad that it should have happened. It's not true that this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much that Khomeini or anyone else in Iran has read the book or more than selected extracts out of context.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/1989/feb/15/salmanrushdie The Guardian: 'Rushdie in hiding after Ayatollah's death threat']&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, he wrote that he was "proud, then and always", of that statement; while he did not feel his book was especially critical of Islam, "a religion whose leaders behaved in this way could probably use a little criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rushdie|first=Salman|title=The Disappeared|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/17/120917fa_fact_rushdie|publisher=''The New Yorker'' (17 September 2012), p. 50|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the book and the ''fatwā'' sparked violence around the world, with bookstores firebombed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/29/satanic-verses-sowed-seeds-of-rift-grown-ever-wider The Guardian: 'The Satanic Verses sowed the seeds of rifts that have grown ever wider']&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim communities in several nations in the West held public rallies, [[Book burning|burning]] copies of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/07/satanic-verses-salman-rushdie-low-point The Guardian: The Satanic Verses affair (book burning photograph)]&lt;/ref&gt; Several people associated with translating or publishing the book were attacked, seriously injured, and even killed.{{efn|See [[Hitoshi Igarashi]], [[Ettore Capriolo]], [[William Nygaard]].}} Many more people died in riots in some countries. Despite the danger posed by the fatwā, Rushdie made a public appearance at London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 11 August 1993 during a [[Zoo TV Tour|concert by U2]]. In 2010, U2 bassist [[Adam Clayton]] recalled that "[lead vocalist] Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from [drummer] Larry Mullen, Jr.'s face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man who was supposed to be in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stairway to Devon − OK, Somerset!|work=Q|date=July 2010|page=101|author=U2|authorlink=U2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 1998, as a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic relations with the UK, the Iranian government, then headed by [[Mohammad Khatami]], gave a public commitment that it would "neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie."&lt;ref name="Tomb"&gt;{{cite news|date=8 June 2005|title=Tomb of the unknown assassin reveals mission to kill Rushdie|author=Anthony Loyd|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article531110.ece|work=The Times |location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171205/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article531110.ece|archivedate=1 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/26/newsid_2542000/2542873.stm|publisher=BBC News: On This Day |title=26 December 1990: Iranian leader upholds Rushdie fatwa|accessdate=10 October 2006|date=26 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushdie has reported that he still receives a "sort of [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]]'s card" from Iran each year on 14 February letting him know the country has not forgotten the vow to kill him and has jokingly referred it as "my unfunny Valentine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/02/15/my-unfunny-valentine |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |title=My Unfunny Valentine |first=Salman |last=Rushdie |date=15 February 1999 |access-date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sly reference to the song "My Funny Valentine".

Rushdie himself has been prevented from entering Pakistan, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidcronenberg.de/cr_rushd.htm |title=Cronenberg meets Rushdie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403045531/http://www.davidcronenberg.de/cr_rushd.htm |archivedate=3 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former bodyguard to Rushdie, Ron Evans, planned to publish a book recounting the behaviour of the author during the time he was in hiding. Evans claimed that Rushdie tried to profit financially from the ''fatwa'' and was suicidal, but Rushdie dismissed the book as a "bunch of lies" and took legal action against Evans, his co-author and their publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7538875.stm|title=Rushdie anger at policeman's book|publisher=BBC|date=2 August 2008|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2008, Rushdie received an apology at the High Court in London from all three parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7581842.stm|title=Bodyguard apologises to Rushdie|publisher=BBC|date=26 August 2008|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memoir of his years of hiding, ''Joseph Anton'', was released on 18 September 2012.

In February 1997, [[Hassan Sane'i|Ayatollah Hasan Sane'i]], leader of the bonyad panzdah-e khordad (Fifteenth of Khordad Foundation),
reported that the blood money offered by the foundation for the assassination of Rushdie would be increased from $2 million to $2.5 million.&lt;ref name=buchta&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchta|first=Wilfried|title=Who rules Iran?|year=2000|publisher=The Washington Institute and The Konrad Adenauer|pages=6|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/WhoRulesIran.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then a semi-official religious foundation in Iran increased the reward it had offered for the killing of Rushdie from $2.8 million to $3.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran adds to reward for Salman Rushdie's death|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/iran_adds_to_reward_for_salman_rushdie_saVWIyfViyXOr0vgnUEvRK|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=The New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Iran's former president [[Mohammad Khatami]] proclaimed the fatwa “finished”; but it has never been officially lifted, and in fact has been reiterated several times by Ali Khamenei and other religious officials.  Yet more money was added to the bounty in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/22/salman-rushdie-iranian-media-raise-more-money-for-fatwa|title=Salman Rushdie: Iranian media raise more money for fatwa|author=Sian Cain|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed assassination attempt and Hezbollah's comments===
On 3 August 1989, while Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh was priming a book bomb loaded with [[RDX]] explosive in a hotel in [[Paddington]], Central London, the bomb exploded prematurely, destroying two floors of the hotel and killing Mazeh. A previously unknown [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] group, the Organization of the Mujahidin of Islam, said he died preparing an attack "on the [[apostate]] Rushdie". There is a shrine in Tehran's [[Behesht-e Zahra]] cemetery for Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh that says he was "Martyred in London, 3 August 1989. The first martyr to die on a mission to kill Salman Rushdie." Mazeh's mother was invited to relocate to Iran, and the Islamic World Movement of Martyrs' Commemoration built his shrine in the cemetery that holds thousands of Iranian soldiers slain in the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="Tomb"/&gt; During the 2006 [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]], Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] declared that "If there had been a Muslim to carry out Imam Khomeini's ''fatwā'' against the renegade Salman Rushdie, this rabble who insult our Prophet Mohammed in Denmark, Norway and France would not have dared to do so. I am sure there are millions of Muslims who are ready to give their lives to defend our prophet's honour and we have to be ready to do anything for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.natashatynes.com/newswire/2006/02/hezbollah_killi.html|date=2 February 2006|title=Hezbollah: Rushdie death would stop Prophet insults|agency=Agence France-Presse|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070807085216/http://www.natashatynes.com/newswire/2006/02/hezbollah_killi.html|archivedate= 7 August 2007|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''International Guerillas''===
In 1990, soon after the publication of ''The Satanic Verses'', a [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistani film]] entitled ''[[International Guerillas (film)|International Gorillay]]'' (''International Guerillas'') was released that depicted Rushdie as a villain plotting to cause the downfall of [[Pakistan]] by opening a chain of casinos and discos in the country; he is ultimately killed at the end of the movie. The film was popular with Pakistani audiences, and it "presents Rushdie as a [[John Rambo|Rambo]]-like figure pursued by four Pakistani guerrillas".&lt;ref name="Tamney"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Resilience of Conservative Religion: The Case of Popular, Conservative Protestant Congregations|author=Joseph Bernard Tamney|publisher=The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge| location=Cambridge, UK|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Board of Film Classification]] refused to allow it a certificate, as "it was felt that the portrayal of Rushdie might qualify as criminal libel, causing a breach of the peace as opposed to merely tarnishing his reputation." This effectively prevented the release of the film in the UK. Two months later, however, Rushdie himself wrote to the board, saying that while he thought the film "a distorted, incompetent piece of trash", he would not sue if it were released. He later said, "If that film had been banned, it would have become the hottest video in town: everyone would have seen it". While the film was a great hit in Pakistan, it went virtually unnoticed elsewhere.&lt;ref name="IGlibel"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Guerrillas and Criminal Libel|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/460938/index.html|publisher=Screenonline|accessdate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Jaipur Literature Festival events===
{{main|Jaipur Literature Festival}}

Rushdie was due to appear at the Jaipur Literature Festival in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jaipurliteraturefestival.org/program-2011/speakers-2012/#o 2012 Speakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125234432/http://jaipurliteraturefestival.org/program-2011/speakers-2012 |date=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later cancelled his event appearance, and a further tour of India at the time citing a possible threat to his life as the primary reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-20/india/30646521_1_jaipur-literature-festival-salman-rushdie-satanic-verses|title=Salman Rushdie not to attend Jaipur Literature Festival|author=Singh, Akhilesh Kumar|date=20 January 2012|work=The Times of India|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16644782|title= Salman Rushdie pulls out of Jaipur literature festival|date=20 January 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days after, he indicated that state police agencies had lied, in order to keep him away, when they informed that paid assassins were being sent to Jaipur to kill him. Police contended that they were afraid Rushdie would read from the banned ''The Satanic Verses'', and that the threat was real, considering imminent protests by Muslim organizations.&lt;ref name=virtual_rushdie_unwelcome/&gt;

Meanwhile, Indian authors [[Ruchir Joshi]], [[Jeet Thayil]], [[Hari Kunzru]] and [[Amitava Kumar]] abruptly left the festival, and Jaipur, after reading excerpts from Rushdie's banned novel at the festival. The four were urged to leave by organizers as there was a real possibility they would be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-23/jaipur/30655383_1_jaipur-literature-festival-hari-kunzru-organizers|title= Salman Rushdie shadow on Jaipur Literature Festival: 4 authors who read from 'The Satanic Verses' sent packing|author1=Singh, Akhilesh Kumar |author2=Chowdhury, Shreya Roy |date=23 January 2012|work=The Times of India|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India the import of the book is banned via customs.

Rushdie expressed his support for ''Charlie Hebdo''. He said, "I stand with ''Charlie Hebdo'', as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity&amp;nbsp;... religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. 7 January 2015.

==Knighthood==
{{main|Knighthood of Salman Rushdie}}

Rushdie was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for services to literature in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] on 16 June 2007. He remarked, "I am thrilled and humbled to receive this great honour, and am very grateful that my work has been recognised in this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6756149.stm |publisher=BBC News|title=15 June 2007 Rushdie knighted in honours list  |accessdate=16 June 2007 | date=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his knighthood, many nations with Muslim majorities protested. Parliamentarians of several of these countries condemned the action, and Iran and Pakistan called in their British envoys to protest formally. Controversial condemnation issued by Pakistan's Religious Affairs Minister [[Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq]] was in turn rebuffed by former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2193993/Salman-Rushdie-is-knighted-by-the-Queen.html|title=Salman Rushdie is knighted by the Queen|last=Pierce|first=By Andrew|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=23 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, their respective fathers [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] had been earlier portrayed in Rushdie's novel ''Shame''. Mass demonstrations against Rushdie's knighthood took place in Pakistan and [[Malaysia]]. Several called publicly for his death. Some non-Muslims expressed disappointment at Rushdie's knighthood, claiming that the writer did not merit such an honour and there were several other writers who deserved the knighthood more than Rushdie.&lt;ref&gt;'Sir Rubbish: Does Rushdie Deserve a Knighthood', Times Higher Educational Supplement, 20 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/world/asia/20iht-rushdie.1.6228425.html|title=Protests spread to Malaysia over knighthood for Salman Rushdie|date=20 June 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=23 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Qaeda]] condemned the Rushdie honour. The Al-Qaeda leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] is quoted as saying in an audio recording that UK's award for Kashmiri-born Rushdie was "an insult to Islam", and it was planning "a very precise response."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6289110.stm |publisher=BBC News|title=10 July 2007 Al-Qaeda condemns Rushdie honour  |accessdate=10 July 2007 | date=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushdie came from a liberal [[Muslim]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/salman-rushdie-39245|title=Salman Rushdie|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he now identifies as an [[atheist]]. In a 2006 interview with [[PBS]], Rushdie called himself a "hardline atheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/faithandreason101_print.html|title=Bill Moyers on Faith &amp; Reason . Bill Moyers and Salman Rushdie . June 23, 2006 - PBS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, in an interview following the ''fatwa'', Rushdie said that he was in a sense a lapsed Muslim, though "shaped by Muslim culture more than any other", and a student of Islam.&lt;ref name = Meer/&gt; In another interview the same year, he said, "My point of view is that of a secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities, whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fact, faith and fiction|work=[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]|date=2 March 1989|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, in the "hope that it would reduce the threat of Muslims acting on the fatwa to kill him," he issued a statement claiming he had renewed his Muslim faith, had repudiated the attacks on Islam made by characters in his novel and was committed to working for better understanding of the religion across the world. However, Rushdie later said that he was only "pretending".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_i-was-deranged-when-i-embraced-islam-rushdie_1158782 "Rushdie: I was deranged when I embraced Islam"], ''[[Daily News and Analysis]]'', 6 April 2008. Retrieved 14 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

His books often focus on the role of religion in society and conflicts between faiths and between the religious and those of no faith.

Rushdie advocates the application of [[higher criticism]], pioneered during the late 19th century. Rushdie called for a reform in Islam&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1072-1729998,00.html "Muslims unite! A new Reformation will bring your faith into the modern era"], ''The Times'', 11 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in a guest opinion piece printed in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' in mid-August 2005:

{{quote|What is needed is a move beyond tradition, nothing less than a reform movement to bring the core concepts of Islam into the modern age, a Muslim Reformation to combat not only the jihadist ideologues but also the dusty, stifling seminaries of the traditionalists, throwing open the windows to let in much-needed fresh air. (…) It is high time, for starters, that Muslims were able to study the revelation of their religion as an event inside history, not supernaturally above it. (…) Broad-mindedness is related to tolerance; open-mindedness is the sibling of peace.}}

Rushdie is a critic of [[cultural relativism]]. He favours calling things by their true names and constantly argues about what is wrong and what is right. In an interview with [[Point of Inquiry]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salman Rushdie – Secular Values, Human Rights and Islamism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/salman_rushdie_secular_values_human_rights_and_islamism/|publisher=Point of Inquiry|accessdate=11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; he described his view as follows:

{{quote|We need all of us, whatever our background, to constantly examine the stories inside which and with which we live. We all live in stories, so called grand narratives. Nation is a story. Family is a story. Religion is a story. Community is a story. We all live within and with these narratives. And it seems to me that a definition of any living vibrant society is that you constantly question those stories. That you constantly argue about the stories. In fact the arguing never stops. The argument itself is freedom. It's not that you come to a conclusion about it. And through that argument you change your mind sometimes. … And that's how societies grow. When you can't retell for yourself the stories  of your life then you live in a prison. … Somebody else controls the story. … Now it seems to me that we have to say that a problem in contemporary Islam is the inability to re-examine the ground narrative of the religion. … The fact that in Islam it is very difficult to do this, makes it difficult to think new thoughts.}}

Rushdie is an advocate of religious satire. He condemned the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] and defended comedic criticism of religions in a comment originally posted on [[English PEN]] where he called religions a medieval form of unreason. Rushdie called the attack a consequence of "religious totalitarianism" which according to him had caused "a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam".:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/07/salman-rushdie-charlie-hebdo_n_6430904.html|title= Salman Rushdie Responds To Charlie Hebdo Attack, Says Religion Must Be Subject To Satire|author= Maddie Crum|work= [[Huffington Post]]|date= 7 January 2015|accessdate= 20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Religion, a medieval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today. I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. ‘Respect for religion’ has become a code phrase meaning ‘fear of religion.’ Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect.}}

He strongly supports feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/11/15-famous-men-whether-theyre-feminists.html|title=15 Male Celebrities Answer ‘Are You a Feminist?’ -- The Cut|author=The Cut|work=The Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political background===
In the 1980s in the United Kingdom, he was a supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and championed measures to end racial discrimination and alienation of immigrant youth and racial minorities.

Rushdie supported the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], leading the leftist [[Tariq Ali]] to label Rushdie and other "warrior writers" as "the belligerati'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Mandel (law professor)|Michael Mandel]], ''How America Gets Away With Murder'', Pluto Press, 2004, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; He was supportive of the US-led campaign to remove the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, but was a vocal critic of the 2003 [[war in Iraq]]. He has stated that while there was a "case to be made for the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]]", US [[unilateral]] military intervention was unjustifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/09/iraq.usa |title=Letters, Salman Rushdie: No fondness for the Pentagon's politics &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian  |date= 9 July 2007|accessdate=13 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Auster, Salman Rushdie and Shimon Peres.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Auster]] and Rushdie greeting Israeli President  [[Shimon Peres]]  with Caro Llewelyn in 2008.]]

In the wake of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in March 2006—which many considered an echo of the death threats and ''fatwā'' that followed publication of ''The Satanic Verses'' in 1989—Rushdie signed the manifesto ''Together Facing the New Totalitarianism'', a statement warning of the dangers of [[religious extremism]]. The Manifesto was published in the left-leaning French weekly ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writers issue cartoon row warning|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4763520.stm|accessdate=19 February 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernie Sanders and Salman Rushdie.jpg|thumb|left|Rushdie and [[Bernie Sanders]] in 2004]]
In 2006, Rushdie stated that he supported comments by the then-Leader of the House of Commons [[Jack Straw]], who [[United Kingdom debate over veils|criticised the wearing]] of the [[niqab]] (a veil that covers all of the face except the eyes). Rushdie stated that his three sisters would never wear the veil. He said, "I think the battle against the veil has been a long and continuing battle against the limitation of women, so in that sense I'm completely on [[Jack Straw|Straw's]] side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20061010-0539-britain-veildispute.html |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |author=Wagner, Thomas |title=Blair, Rushdie support former British foreign secretary who ignited veil debate |date=10 October 2006 |accessdate=10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist critic [[Terry Eagleton]], a former admirer of Rushdie's work, attacked him, saying he "cheered on [[the Pentagon]]'s criminal ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2603984.ece |title=The ageing punk of lit crit still knows how to spit&amp;nbsp;– Times Online |accessdate=30 July 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512090519/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2603984.ece |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eagleton subsequently apologised for having misrepresented Rushdie's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/12/comment.letters|title= Letters: Writers challenging so-called civilisation|author1=Terry Eagleton |author2=Michael Kustow |author3=Matthew Wright |author4=Neil Morris |work= [[The Guardian]]|publisher= [[Scott Trust Limited]]|date= 12 July 2007|accessdate= 20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Amnesty International]] suspended human rights activist [[Gita Sahgal]] for saying to the press that she thought Amnesty International should distance itself from [[Moazzam Begg]] and his organisation, Rushdie said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Amnesty … has done its reputation incalculable damage by allying itself with Moazzam Begg and his group Cageprisoners, and holding them up as human rights advocates. It looks very much as if Amnesty's leadership is suffering from a kind of [[moral bankruptcy]], and has lost the ability to distinguish right from wrong. It has greatly compounded its error by suspending the redoubtable Gita Sahgal for the crime of going public with her concerns. [[Gita Sahgal]] is a woman of immense integrity and distinction.... It is people like Gita Sahgal who are the true voices of the human rights movement; Amnesty and Begg have revealed, by their statements and actions, that they deserve our contempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7034773.ece Salman Rushdie's statement on Amnesty International], ''The Sunday Times'', 21 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rushdie supported the election of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] for the American presidency and has often criticized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In Indian politics, Rushdie has criticised the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and its Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]].&lt;ref name="bodeill"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Narendra Modi victory would bode ill for India, say Rushdie and Kapoor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/indian-artists-letter-guardian-worry-election |first=Jason |last=Burke |date=10 April 2014 |work=The Guardian |location=Delhi |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushdie was involved in the [[Occupy Movement]], both as a presence at [[Occupy Boston]] and as a founding member of [http://occupywriters.com/ Occupy Writers].

Rushdie is a supporter of [[gun control]], blaming a [[2012 Aurora shooting|shooting at a Colorado cinema]] in July 2012 on the American right to keep and bear arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/pageviews/2012/07/salman-rushdie-stirs-up-frenzy-with-tweets-in-response-to-colorado-multiplex-shoot |title=Salman Rushdie stirs up frenzy with tweets in response to Colorado multiplex shooting &amp;#124; New York Daily News |work=Daily News|location=New York |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheney |first=Alexandra |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/07/20/salman-rushdie-sparks-furor-with-colorado-shooting-tweets/ |title=Salman Rushdie Sparks Furor With Colorado Theater Shooting Tweets – Speakeasy |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushdie supported the vote to remain in the EU during the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]].

==Personal life==
Rushdie has been married four times. He was married to his first wife Clarissa Luard&lt;ref&gt;Descended from the gentry family LUARD formerly of Byborough. See Burke's Landed Gentry 18th edn vol 1 (pub 1965) page 465 col 2&lt;/ref&gt; from 1976 to 1987 and fathered a son, Zafar (born 1979).&lt;ref&gt;Free BMD website. Birth registered Q3 1979 Camden&lt;/ref&gt; He left her in the mid-'80s for the Australian writer [[Robyn Davidson]], to whom he was introduced by their mutual friend [[Bruce Chatwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Chatwin, letter to Ninette Dutton, 1 November 1984, in ''Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin'', ed. Elizabeth Chatwin and [[Nicholas Shakespeare]], p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife was the American novelist [[Marianne Wiggins]]; they were married in 1988 and divorced in 1993. His third wife, from 1997 to 2004, was Elizabeth West; they have a son, Milan (born 1997). In 2004, he married the Indian American [[Padma Lakshmi]], an actress, model, and host of the American reality-television show ''[[Top Chef]]''. The marriage ended on 2 July 2007.

In 1999, Rushdie had an operation to correct [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], a tendon condition that causes drooping eyelids and that, according to him, was making it increasingly difficult for him to open his eyes. "If I hadn't had an operation, in a couple of years from now I wouldn't have been able to open my eyes at all," he said.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9904/15/rushdie/ Rushdie: New book out from under shadow of fatwa]", CNN, 15 April 1999.

A '''structured document''' is an [[electronic document]] where some method of [[embedded coding]], such as [[markup language|mark-up]], is used to give the whole, and parts, of the document various structural meanings according to a [[Database schema|schema]]. A structured document whose mark-up doesn't break the schema and is designed to conform to and which obeys the [[syntax]] rules of its [[markup language|mark-up language]] is "well-formed".

As of 2009 the most widely used [[markup language]], in all its evolving forms, is [[HTML]], which is used to structure documents according to various [[Document Type Definition|Document Type Definition (DTD)]] schema defined and described by the [[W3C]], which continually reviews, refines and evolves the specifications.

{{Quote|[[XML]] is the universal format for structured documents and data on the Web|[http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#related XHTML2 Working Group], [[W3C]]}}

==Structural semantics==
In writing structured documents the focus is on encoding the logical structure of a document, with no explicit concern in the structural markup for its presentation to humans by printed pages, screens or other means. Structured documents, especially well formed ones, can easily be processed by computer systems to extract and present [[metadata]] about the document. In most Wikipedia articles for example, a table of contents is automatically generated from the different heading tags in the body of the document. Popular [[word processor]]s can have such a function available.

In [[HTML]] a part of the logical structure of a document may be the document body; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, containing a first level heading; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and a paragraph; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang="html"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Structured document&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong class="selflink"&gt;structured document&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;a href="/wiki/Electronic_document" title="Electronic document"&gt;electronic document&lt;/a&gt; where some method of &lt;a href="/w/index.php?title=Embedded_coding&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Embedded coding (page does not exist)"&gt;embedded coding&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="/wiki/Markup_language" title="Markup language"&gt;markup&lt;/a&gt;, is used to give the whole, and parts, of the document various structural meanings according to a &lt;a href="/wiki/Schema" title="Schema"&gt;schema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;
One of the most attractive features of structured documents is that they can be reused in many contexts and presented in various ways on mobile phones, TV screens, speech synthesisers, and any other device which can be programmed to process them.

=== Other semantics ===
Other meaning can be ascribed to text which isn't structural. In the [[HTML]] fragment above, there is semantic markup which has nothing to do with structure; the first of these, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, means that the enclosed text should be given a strong emphasis. In visual terms this is equivalent to the bold, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, but in speech synthesisers this means a voice inflection giving strong emphasis is used. The term [[semantic markup]] excludes markup like the bold tag which has no meaning other than an instruction to a visual display. The strong tag means that the presentation of the enclosed text should have a strong emphasis in all presentation forms, not just visual.&lt;br /&gt;
The anchor &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is a more obvious example of semantic markup unconcerned with structure, with its href attribute set it means that the text it surrounds is a [[hyperlink]].

[[HTML]] from early on has also had tags which gave presentational semantics, i.e. there were tags to give '''bold''' (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)or ''italic'' (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) text, or to alter &lt;small&gt;font sizes&lt;/small&gt; or which had other effects on the presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern versions of markup languages discourage such markup in favour of [[Style sheet language|style sheets]]. Different style sheets can be attached to any markup, semantic or presentational, to produce different presentations. In [[HTML]], tags such as; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;a&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and others do not have a structural meaning, but do have a meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11177">'''Surveillance Detection Units''' ('''SDU''') are organizations belonging to the US Government that have conducted secret surveillance that potentially broke national laws in various European countries. The Norwegian broadcaster [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]] first publicly reported the existence of the network of SDUs, on 3 November 2010.&lt;ref name=TV2&gt;{{cite news |title=Her drev USA systematisk overvåkning av nordmenn |first= |last= |url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/her-drev-usa-systematisk-overvaakning-av-nordmenn-3332987.html |publisher=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]] |date=3 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ORF&gt;{{cite news |title=Medien: USA überwachen Norweger in deren Heimat |url=http://orf.at/stories/2023536/ |publisher=[[Österreichischer Rundfunk]] |date=4 November 2010 |language=German |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}
In the year 2000, at least 22 [[United States]] (US) embassies and consulates around the world operated the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]]'s "worldwide surveillance detection program", which "[emphasised] quasi-covert operations and information gathering."&lt;ref name="FAS_WillBridg2000"&gt;{{cite news |title=Statement of Jacquelyn L.

==Norway==
Since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Did US’ Oslo embassy breach Norwegian law? |first1=Ramona |last1=Tancau |first2=Michael |last2=Sandelson |url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/did-us-oslo-embassy-breach-norwegian-law/ |newspaper=The Foreigner |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; former leaders of the police force of Oslo, the [[Norwegian Police Security Service]], and the [[National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)|National Criminal Investigation Service]] have been recruited to conduct [[secret]] surveillance of Norwegians in order to prevent [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] on the U.S. Embassy and the residence of the U.S. Ambassador.&lt;ref name=ORF/&gt; The unit consists of 15-20 people that were based on the sixth floor of the building ''Handelsbygningen'' at Solli Plass, several hundred metres from the embassy at Henrik Ibsens Gate, until the November 2010 controversy.&lt;ref name=TV2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="scandal_Norway" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Flere hundre registrert av hemmelig gruppe i Norge |trans-title=Several hundred recorded by secret group in Norway |first=Harald S. |last=Klungtveit |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/11/03/nyheter/overvakning/usa/politiets_sikkerhetstjeneste/14138978/ |newspaper=[[Dagbladet]] |date=3 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader, Olaf Johansen, was a former anti-terrorism chief before being recruited for the American unit.&lt;ref name=TV2/&gt; [[Knut Storberget]], Norway's Minister of Justice, initially claimed the government was unaware of the program and that there would be an investigation,&lt;ref name=ORF/&gt; but later presented updated information to the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] after the U.S. Embassy stated that notification had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US embassy spy scandal mystery may never be solved |first=Michael |last=Sandelson |url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/us-embassy-spy-scandal-mystery-may-never-be-solved/ |newspaper=The Foreigner |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TV 2 (Norway)|Norway television channel TV 2]] claimed that the SDU's surveillance of Norwegian citizens was illegal.&lt;ref name="starcity_SDUillegal"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=Emon | pages= | language =| title=Norwegian Authorities Outraged at U.S. Surveillance of Norwegian Citizens | date=5 November 2010 | publisher=Star City News | url=http://www.starcitynews.com/norwegian-authorities-outraged-at-u-s-surveillance-of-norwegian-citizens/1812 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vIl9SseP |archivedate=27 December 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the Norwegian surveillance agency, ''Datatilsynet'', Bjørn Erik Thon, said that the operation was unprecedented, stating "I think it's very serious that something like this can be conducted on Norwegian territory and that it's Norwegian citizens carrying out the work."&lt;ref name="scandal_Norway"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title= Officials howling over US Embassy’s secret surveillance in Norway| date=4 November 2010 | publisher=Views and News from Norway | url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/11/04/officials-howling-over-us-embassys-secret-surveillance-in-norway |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vIm5XgL2 |archivedate=27 December 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thon stated that the SDU violated the Norwegian privacy law ''Personopplysningsloven''. He said that he was disturbed "that the Norwegians employed by the embassy to, for example, take photos of persons engaging in political demonstrations, apparently have felt they can avoid the law because they were working for a foreign employer."&lt;ref name="scandal_Norway" /&gt;

Parliamentary reactions ranged from "To the degree [it's] true, it's frightening information" from [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] parliamentarian André Oktay Dahl to a "scandal" for [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] parliamentarians.&lt;ref name="scandal_Norway" /&gt; Foreign Minister [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] took up the surveillance issue with State Secretary Hillary Clinton in a meeting on 7 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign Minister discussed surveillance with Hillary Clinton |url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/12/09/st%C3%B8re-discussed-surveillance-with-clinton/ |publisher=newsinenglish.no |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
In late 2010, the [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service|Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo/FSIS)]] initially stated that it was unaware of an SDU at the US Embassy in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="hel_sanomat_1" /&gt; The following week, SUPO stated that it was aware of US Embassy surveillance work, that the surveillance was legal and that it had consulted with the embassy. The US Embassy stated that it does have an SDU unit in operation and that the unit does not carry out espionage.&lt;ref name="hel_sanomat_2"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title=Security Police knew about security activities of US Embassy - Embassy says Surveillance Detection Unit broke no laws  | year=2010 | publisher=Helsingin Sanomat | url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Security+Police+knew+about+security+activities+of+US+Embassy/1135261518332 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vIqRTcRW |archivedate=27 December 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The German government initially said that it was unaware of the SDU program, but in December confirmed that the groups were providing security for U.S. installations and that some German security experts were part of them. A statement signed by [[Ole Schröder]], Secretary of State in the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Ministry of the Interior]], said that such measures were understandable in view of the security threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Geheim-Organisation überwacht US-Botschaft |first=Damir |last=Fras |url=http://www.fr-online.de/politik/geheim-organisation-ueberwacht-us-botschaft/-/1472596/4893308/-/index.html |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Rundschau]] |date=3 December 2010 |language=German |accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iceland==
A US Embassy SDU in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] has been "broadening security surveillance beyond the embassy building and into the immediate surrounding area." The Icelandic Foreign Office stated that it had found no records of the SDU operations having been discussed with Icelandic authorities. The Vice-Chairperson of the [[Left-Green Movement]] parliamentary group [[:is:Álfheiður Ingadóttir|Álfheiður Ingadóttir]], asked for the SDU to be investigated.&lt;ref name="Iceland_SDU"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |pages= | language =| title=U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik monitoring Icelandic citizens | date=9 November 2010 | publisher=IceNews - News from the Nordics | url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/11/09/u-s-embassy-in-reykjavik-monitoring-icelandic-citizens/ |accessdate=28 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vIlS2nIT |archivedate=27 December 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==

The '''Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria''' is the "largest [[transgender]] [[archive]] in the world".&lt;ref name=dedyna&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dedyna |first1=Katherine |title=UVic now has the largest transgender archive in the world |url=http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/uvic-now-has-the-largest-transgender-archive-in-the-world-1.13867 |accessdate=23 January 2015 |agency=The Victoria Times Colonist |publisher=Dave Obie |date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection is located at the [[University of Victoria]] Libraries, Special Collections and University Archives (Mearns Centre for Learning), in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and is co-ordinated by founder and academic director [[Aaron H. Devor]] and managed by Director of Special Collections and University Archivist Lara Wilson.

All holdings of the Transgender Archives are accessible to the public, free of charge, for personal research, investigation, and exploration.

==History==

While there are numerous [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[Transgender|trans]], or [[LGBT]], archival collections in North America, only a few exclusively feature [[Transgender|trans]], [[non-binary]], and [[Two-spirit|Two-Spirit]] material.

The genesis of the Transgender Archives occurred in 2005 with a conversation between the founder of the archives, Aaron Devor, and Rikki Swin, a one-time Chicago manufacturer of plastic injection moulding and founder of the Rikki Swin Institute who moved to Victoria in 2007.&lt;ref name=dedyna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rikki Swin Institute (RSI) |url=http://transgenderarchives.uvic.ca/rikki-swin-institute-rsi-2 |website=The Transgender Archives University of Victoria |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion led Swin to donate her institute's entire material holdings to the University of Victoria Libraries' Archives and Special Collections. Swin's founding donation is one of three major donations held in the archives.

The second major donation of material occurred when the daughter of [[Reed Erickson]] donated her father's extensive papers to the archives. Reed Erickson, founder of the Erickson Educational Foundation, died in 1992.

The third major donation occurred when Professor Richard Ekins donated the entire University of Ulster (Northern Ireland, United Kingdom) Trans-Gender Archive.

Officially opening in 2011, the Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria has gathered other smaller donations and has grown to be "exceptional in its focus, size, and scope"&lt;ref name=preserving&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devor |first1=Aaron |title=Preserving the Footprints of Transgender Activism: The Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria |journal=QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking |date=Summer 2014 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=200–204 |doi=10.1353/qed.2014.0043 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/qed_a_journal_of_glbtq_worldmaking/v001/1.2.devor.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its unique position as being one of the only archives in the world that institutionally houses material exclusively reflecting trans, non-binary, and Two-Spirit experiences.

[[Libraries and the LGBTQ community]] lists the Transgender Archives in their ''List of LGBTQ Archives/Libraries/Special Collections'' as one of the only archival institutions that exclusively houses trans material.

==Collection==

The Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria contains archival material from both large and small trans organizations and focuses on the contributions of activists and researchers working for the betterment of trans, non-binary, and Two-Spirit people.&lt;ref name=dedyna/&gt;

While the archive currently emphasizes collections from North America and Europe, there are over 20 countries represented in the collection reflecting over a century of activism and research; if the materials were all lined up along one long shelf, the collection would stretch the length of one-and-a-half football fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Devor |first1=Aaron |title=Moving trans history forward |url=https://ring.uvic.ca/opinion/moving-trans-history-forward |website=The Ring: University of Victoria |publisher=University of Victoria |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdings include: approximately 2,000 books, including many rare and first editions; large collection of informational pamphlets and booklets produced by advocacy organizations for educational purposes; historical and organizational records for several significant trans activist groups including personal papers from some leaders; international newsletters from trans communities; multimedia collection representing and recording trans experience; and a large collection of ephemera.&lt;ref name=preserving/&gt;

At approximately {{convert|162|m|ft|adj=pre|linear}} of books, periodicals, and archival materials, the collection is the "largest trans-focused archival collection in the world".&lt;ref name=preserving/&gt;

Approximately 25 per cent of the collection is cataloged and is available to the public, with 60 per cent of the collection reflecting male-to-female experiences.&lt;ref name=dedyna/&gt;

While the archives is accessible to the public, free of charge, key documents are slowly being made available online (see external links).

Moving Trans History Forward conferences are a series of international conferences, founded and led by the Chair in Transgender Studies and the Academic Director of the Transgender Archives, which draw community activists, researchers, educators, artists, service providers, and allies of all ages from around the world. Conferences consider the history of trans activism and research, and the issues which impact trans, non-binary, and two-spirit people today locally, nationally, and globally. 

The first conference, held at the University of Victoria, March 21–23, 2014, was entitled "Moving Trans* History Forward."  Researchers and activists gathered to retrieve and preserve the stories and records of transgender pioneers of the early 1960s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smart |first1=Amy |title=Trans pioneers to lead University of Victoria symposium |url=http://www.timescolonist.com/trans-pioneers-to-lead-university-of-victoria-symposium-1.914878 |accessdate=24 January 2015 |agency=Times Colonist |publisher=Dave Obie |date=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pioneers of transgender activism |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/photos/pioneers-of-transgender-activism-1.2581912 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2358">'''Wulfstan  v Thomas''' was an early court case in [[English law]].&lt;ref&gt;This cases predates the establishment of the [[Common Law]] under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], and should more properly be considered a hearing under [[Norman Law]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Bishop Wulstan]] latter Saint Wulfstan, was appealing to the [[William the Conqueror|new king]] against the taking of estates that had belonged to the [[Cathedral]] at [[Worcester]].

==Background==
Prior to the [[Norman Conquest]] a former [[Bishop]], [[Ealdred (archbishop of York)|Ealdred]] had taken ''[[in personum]]'' (as private property) various estates that had belonged to the [[diocese]] of Worcester, when he left to become the [[Bishop]] at [[Bishop of York|York]].  Following the death of Ealred these estates were now held by the [[Bishopric]] of York.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Van Caenegem,  ENGLISH LAWSUITS FROM WILLIAM I TO RICHARD I Vol.I. William I to Stephen. Vol. 106, (Selden Society,1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Placita Anglo-Normannica [electronic resource] : Law Cases from William I to Richard I - Preserved in Historical Records (London: S. Low, Marston, Searle, &amp; Rivington, 1879)&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case the new [[Bishop of Worcester]] was seeking from [[William the Conqueror]], the new [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] king, that [[Thomas of Bayeux|Thomas]] the [[Bishop of York]] restore the lands that had belonged to Worcester.

This was a very brave move as [[Thomas of Bayeux|Thomas]] the new Bishop at [[York]] was a favorite of William and trusted disciple of Williams Brother [[Odo of Bayeux]].

==Result==
The Plaint was successful.

The court cases can be viewed as a part of a large collection of pleadings against a process of Nomanization that within a decade saw 64% of land in England consolidated into the hands of just 150 individuals, and many of the nobility deprived of their estates.
