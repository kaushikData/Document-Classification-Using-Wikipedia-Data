      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18068">The '''AAA Travel High School Challenge''' (sometimes shortened to '''AAA Travel Challenge''') was an annual travel-themed scholarship competition run by the [[American Automobile Association]], open to students in grades 9-12 in the fifty [[United States]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. First run in 2003 as part of AAA's centennial celebrations, the competition became an annual event and a premier high school scholarship program for a time.  The competition was notable for its national coverage

The National Finals were held yearly in [[Orlando, Florida]]. In its five years of existence, the contest awarded over $600,000 worth of scholarships. The 2007 competition featured a $20,000 top prize (down from $25,000 in past years), won by Samuel Brandt of Oregon. In addition, the 2007 competition, for the first time, also included a separate essay contest for those interested in seeking majors in travel-, tourism-, or hospitality-related careers.

Often compared to the [[National Geographic Bee]], a middle-school competition, the AAA Travel Challenge featured a similar format, with a local, state, and national level, each with progressively tougher questions and material. Unlike the National Geography Bee, however, the AAA Travel Challenge stressed team competition, rather than individual achievement.

The 2007 competition was the last Challenge to take place. Afterwards, administrators opted for a one-year hiatus from the program. Challenge administrators had hoped to use this hiatus to work out and analyze the event "to develop strategies and tactics for an improved program." AAA decided that it would be best to find a single co-sponsor for the event, rather than the multiple sponsors who had supported the competition in previous years. Unfortunately, the recession and other factors made this difficult. On September 26, 2008, it was announced that the Challenge would be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.com/TravelChallenge Travel Challenge Home Page], retrieved September 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Students were eligible to participate in the AAA Travel High School Challenge if they met the following requirements (from the [http://www.aaa.com/TravelChallenge/contestrules.html Official Site]):

*Must be a legal US resident residing in a US state or the District of Columbia. If a student studies abroad but has their legal residence in the US, that student may participate, but must pay for their own travel expenses to US testing locations if they advance in the competition.
*Must be in grade 9, 10, 11, or 12.
*Must be at least 13 years old.
*Must be enrolled in an accredited public or private junior or senior high school, and/or a certified home school program (the school itself does not have to register).
*Must have parental consent, if under 18 years of age.
*Must not have (for the 2007 Competition) individually placed first, second, or third in previous National AAA Travel Challenges, nor placed first or second in team rounds of previous National AAA Travel Challenges

==Procedure==
{{Update|date=November 2010}}

===Registration===
The competition began in December, when registration on the [http://www.aaa.com/TravelChallenge/enroll.html AAA Travel Challenge Official Site] opened. Eligible students could apply and create a unique username and password which they would later use for the Stage One Internet test. From 2007 onward, students could also indicate if they desired to participate in the travel career-related Essay Competition.

A student could, at any time, take a Practice Test offered on the Official Site, which gave a general sampling of questions that might have appeared.

===Stage One: Internet Test===

For a specified period of time in January (usually 8–10 days), the Official Site would run the Stage One qualifying test. After students entered their unique user name and password, they would then proceed to the test.

The test consisted of 40 multiple-choice travel-themed questions to be completed in 15 minutes time (20 minutes from 2003–2006), with a countdown clock visible throughout the test. No two tests were alike, as the questions were picked from a pool of several thousand questions, with each test being "weighted" with an equal number of easy, medium, and hard questions. Neither reference materials (printed or electronic) nor help from another person was allowed, and this was agreed to when a student checked the "Integrity Oath" box during registration.

Questions had to do with destinations popular with American tourists, with most questions centering on the United States and foreign destinations such as Europe and East Asia.

The top five scorers in each state would advance to Stage Two (state of residence, not school, determined in which state one is competing for). In the event of a tie, the student(s) who used the least amount of time to answer questions would advance (from 2003–2006, random drawings initially served as tiebreakers). If a tie still existed, then, like in previous years, a random drawing determined who advances. These Top Five were usually notified 1–2 weeks after the testing period ended via e-mail. If one of the five was unable to continue, or if nothing was heard from after 72 hours of the notification e-mail being sent, then the next highest scorer would be notified.

===Stage Two: The State Test===
Once all five in each state and D.C. had been confirmed (255 across the nation), each student would be sent an information packet with instructions for Stage Two.

Stage Two was another 40 multiple-choice question, 15-minute test (20 minutes from 2003–2006), this time, however, written and taken at the nearest AAA Office nearest to the contestant's home. The test was monitored by a AAA Official. The time period for taking the test was usually three days in March, and arrangements (through AAA) had to have been made with the office at which the test would be taken.

Questions again focused on tourist destinations, but this time become more global in nature and slightly more obscure. It is unknown whether tests were the same throughout the nation or if each state or even each individual received different tests, like Stage One.

The winner, the top scorer of the five in each state, was notified approximately one week after the testing period finishes. If the winner was unable to proceed, then the next highest scorer would notified. In the event of a tie for the top score, a random drawing determined the winner.

===Stage Three: The National Finals===
The National Finals were a four-day event usually held in early to mid May. Each of the 51 Stage Two Winners and one chaperone per finalist were awarded an all-expenses paid trip to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]], for the competition. Additional guests could attend, and arrangements could be made through [[American Automobile Association|AAA Travel]] at the expense of the Finalist's family.

====Phase One: The Preliminary Test====

The first phase was a preliminary test taken by all 51 finalists, usually in a conference room held at a sponsor hotel. The test was once again a monitored 40-question multiple choice written test to be completed in 20 minutes. Questions at this level were at their hardest yet, focusing mostly on global destinations, some familiar, but most obscure.

====Phase Two: The Individual Competition====

The top 24 scorers on the written test were invited back to participate in Phase Two (random drawings served as tiebreakers). These 24 contestants were then divided into six preliminary groups, consisting of four participants each. Contestants within each group then participated in a single-elimination oral competition, answering more questions covering the material. One winner emerged in each group, and these six winners advanced to the second half of Phase Two.

The second half of Phase Two was an individual competition introduced for the 2006 Challenge. The six finalists (which, in 2006 only, were actually the twelve finalists who had participated in the team rounds) were brought out and assigned a random order to sit in on the stage. Each contestant was then asked a question, one by one, by moderator Dr. [[Marc Mancini]]. In a manner similar to the [[National Spelling Bee]], if the student answered correctly, he advanced to the next round. If not, then the student was eliminated. If all the contestants in a round answered incorrectly, then all were brought back to participate in the next round.

The winner was the contestant who managed to answer his/her question correctly while everyone else in the round answered incorrectly, in addition to one more question. Such procedures allowed for ties for second and third place, as shown in the [[AAA Travel High School Challenge#Champions|results of the 2006 and 2007 competitions]].

After another day to enjoy Orlando, a banquet was held at the [[Hard Rock Cafe|Hard Rock Live]] that evening. Prizes were officially awarded as well as other miscellaneous closing remarks and "housekeeping notes".

====The Team Rounds (2003-2006)====

The Top 12 scorers, with random drawings acting as tiebreakers, advanced to the second phase of the competition. These finalists were usually announced about 30 minutes after testing had completed. Afterwards the twelve finalists stayed for a briefing and practice round, as all were later released to enjoy Orlando.

The next day the 12 remaining contestants as well as the 39 other finalists and families gathered for the Final Round, usually at [[Universal Orlando]] (this competition was sometimes open to the public). The 12 Finalists had been divided into four teams of three contestants each. Three game-show style rounds were conducted. The first featured two teams versus each other. The second put the other two teams against each other. The winners of each of these rounds advanced to a final head-to-head round.

A round lasted 20 minutes, and featured these types of questions:
*'''Gateway Questions''' - worth 20 points, these were toss-up questions that could be answered by any team member buzzing in. If a contestant answered incorrectly, 20 points were deducted from the team's score, and the other team was then given a chance to answer. Team members were not allowed to consult with each other.
*'''Add-On Questions''' - posed to a team once one of their team members had answered a Gateway Question correctly. The question was divided into three parts, with each part worth ten points (e.g. "Name the three North American national capital cities with the word 'City' in their name"). Team members were allowed to consult with each other, and no points were deducted for an incorrect response.
*'''Upgrade Questions''' - a special kind of add-on, where teams could significantly increase their point total. Before the question was posed, the team was given a category to which the question pertained. The team then could wager up to 100 or their total number of points, whichever was lower. If the question was answered correctly, the team was awarded that number of points. An incorrect answer deducted that number of points from the team's score.

The winner of the round was the team with the highest score. The team competition was discontinued in 2007.

*An all-expenses paid trip to Orlando, Florida, for them and one chaperone each.
*Two-day two-park passes for [[Universal Orlando]] (usually intended to be used during the National Finals)
*A $1,000 US Savings Bond
*Two $150 AAA Gift Cards (one for the finalist, and one for the chaperone)

'''Alfredo Corvino''' (February 2, 1916 &amp;ndash; August 2, 2005)&lt;ref name="NYT obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/obituaries/05corvino.html?_r=1|title=Alfredo Corvino, 89, Dancer and Juilliard Ballet Teacher, Dies|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|date=August 5, 2005|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Uruguayan ballet dancer and ballet teacher.

==Early life and education==
Corvino was born in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and studied [[violin]] with his father who was a member of the [[Philharmonic Orchestra]] of [[Montevideo]]. He studied ballet as a scholarship student of Alberto Pouyanne at the National Academy of Ballet, now known as the Uruguay National Ballet School.  He became a principal dancer with the Municipal Theater in Uruguay and was a choreographer and assistant ballet-master for the company as well.&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;

==Ballet career==
Corvino first toured Latin America with the Ballets Jooss, directed by the German-born expressionist, [[Kurt Jooss]]. He toured the United States with the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] as a soloist, performing ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'', Bluebird from ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Carnaval (ballet)|Carnaval]]''. He enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II and later joined the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Ballet in [[New York City|New York]].  At the MET, Corvino performed and became ballet master of the ballet company.  He was also a dedicated teacher at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School for 20 years.

Corvino's exceptional training was greatly influenced by [[Enrico Cecchetti]], the Italian master ballet teacher who worked with the Russian Imperial Ballet and [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] troupe. Other notable ballet instructors, including Anatole Vilzak, Edward Caton, Boris Romanoff, and Alexander Gavrilov, contributed to Corvino's training. The Cecchetti training method was passed down to him by the British authority, [[Margaret Craske]].  Corvino also studied with [[Antony Tudor]], a founding choreographer of American Ballet Theater and director of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and its school in the 1950s. Tudor invited Corvino to join the newly created dance division at [[The Juilliard School]] in 1952. Thus began Corvino's association with The Juilliard School, where he was a dedicated teacher for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name="juillard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juilliard.edu/update/journal/1113journal_substory_0305.asp|title=Alfredo Corvino|last=Jacobson|first=Josh|date=May 2003|publisher=The Juillard School|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corvino has appeared with numerous dance groups, including the Radio City Music Hall Ballet, Dance Players, Herbert Ross's company, the Gavrilov Company, the Classic Ballet Company of New Jersey and Dance Circle. His international teaching credits include the [[Folkwang University of the Arts|Folkwang Hochschule]] in Germany, Bellas Artes in Caracas, the Rotterdamse Dansacademie in the Netherlands, the Theatre Contemporain de la Danse in Paris, the [[Cloud Gate Dance Theatre]] in Taiwan, and the International Festival of Dance Academies in Hong Kong. As a choreographer, Corvino worked with the Roxy Theater, the Amato Opera, the Princeton Ballet, the Maryland Ballet, and the Dance Circle troupe. He also performed with and for 10 years directed the New Jersey Dance Theater Guild (NJDTE).&lt;ref name="NYT obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juillard"/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
On May 23, 2003, The Juilliard School awarded Alfredo Corvino an honorary doctor of fine arts degree in recognition of his contributions to dance instruction, his career as a performer and choreographer, and his dedication and commitment to dance.&lt;ref name="juillard"/&gt; He was also the recipient of the 2002 [[Martha Hill]] Award for Leadership in Dance and the Juilliard Centennial Medal (May 2005).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Corvino was often described as soft-spoken, gentle, precise, generous and elegant.{{by whom|date=May 2016}} Dancers sought out Corvino as a teacher and coach due to his extensive knowledge, his patience, and his diplomacy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} He understood that a classical dancer had to be developed, often stating that a dancer could be born with facility, but that there would be no technique without the proper training. He believed that true dancers possessed an inner fire in addition to a refined technique. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Corvino taught ballet with great respect of human anatomy. He recognized that many dancers became injured because they consistently worked against their own body.  He stressed anatomical accuracy, musicality in dance, energy and resistance and the basic principles behind movement.

'''Aspect''' was a former [[trade union]] in the [[United Kingdom]] for professionals working in children's services.

The union was founded in 1919 by four school inspectors as the '''National Association of Inspectors of Schools and Educational Organisers''' ('''NAIEO''').&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.aspect.org.uk/about/history/ History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615191139/http://www.aspect.org.uk/about/history/ |date=June 15, 2010 }}, Aspect&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership rose to around 200 by the mid-1920s, and the organisation affiliated to [[NALGO]] for representation and negotiation for some years.  The two unions then separated due to policy differences, but membership continued its slow rise, reaching 800 in 1970.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;Arthur Ivor Marsh and Victoria Ryan, ''Historical Directory of Trade Unions'', p.417&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the union became the '''National Association of Inspectors and Educational Advisers''' ('''NAIEA'''), and began recruiting educational consultants.  In 1977, it first gained its Certificate of Independence.  By 1980, membership had reached 1,400, and the union affiliated to the [[National Association of Head Teachers]] for the provision of some services.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;  Under the secretaryship of Bill Wright, in 1993, the union once again asserted its independence, and renamed itself as the '''National Association of Educational Inspectors, Advisers and Consultants''' ('''NAEIAC''').&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The union appointed John Chowcat as its first full-time general secretary in 1999, and affiliated to the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 2002.  In 2005, membership reached 4,000, and it adopted its most recent name, a [[backronym]] for "Association of Professionals in Education and Children's Trusts".

In 2012, the union merged into [[Prospect (trade union)|Prospect]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.prospect.org.uk/news/id/2011/01243 Aspect education union votes to transfer into Prospect]", Prospect, 7 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Choosing Wisely Canada''' ('''CWC''') is a Canadian-based health education campaign launched on April 2, 2014 under the leadership of Dr. [[Wendy Levinson]], in partnership with the [[Canadian Medical Association]], and  based at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Lev CMAJ"&gt;Levinson W, Huynh T. Engaging physicians and patients in conversations about unnecessary tests and procedures: Choosing Wisely Canada. CMAJ. 2014 Mar 18;186(5):325-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aims to help physicians and patients engage in conversations about [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures]], and to assist physicians and patients in making informed and effective choices to ensure high quality care.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Medical Association [website]. Choosing Wisely Canada.Ottawa, ON: Canadian Medical Association; 2014. Available from:www.cma.ca/En/Pages/choosing-wisely-canada.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign is based on the notion that unnecessary tests, treatments, and procedures often do more harm than good, resulting in poor clinical outcomes and significant waste in the [[Canadian healthcare system]].&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz LI, Masica AL, Auerbach AD. Introducing Choosing Wisely®: Next steps in improving healthcare value. J Hosp Med. 2015 Mar;10(3):187-9&lt;/ref&gt; These unnecessary tests and procedures take away from care by potentially exposing patients to harm, leading to more testing to investigate [[False positives and false negatives|false positive tests]], and contributing to unnecessary anxiety and avoidable costs for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =ANDRÉ PICARD: When health care becomes unnecessary care |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/when-health-care-becomes-unnecessary-care/article25486001/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Choosing Wisely Canada'' aims to encourage and empower physicians to assimilate, evaluate, and implement the ever-increasing amount of evidence on current best practice. The campaign also supports the equally important role of patient education and the need to dispel the false notion that “more care is better care”.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

Central to the campaign are lists of "Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question" developed by more than forty-five Canadian specialty societies. These lists are intended to encourage physicians to adopt a "think twice" attitude to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful tests and procedures, and to foster discussions between patients and physicians about inappropriate care. The campaign also uses patient-friendly education materials to complement these lists, as well as teaches medical trainees about resource stewardship. As of June 2, 2015, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released .

''Choosing Wisely Canada'' leads an international community, made up of nations who are implementing similar programs in their respective countries. At present, this community includes representation from [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]] and [[Wales]].

Choosing Wisely Canada stems from worldwide concern around providing unnecessary treatment when the risk of harm exceeds its potential benefit ("medical overuse").&lt;ref&gt;Morgan DJ, Wright SM, Dhruva S. Update on medical overuse. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Jan;175(1):120-4&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of studies have highlighted the prevalence of medical overuse in Canada, which include findings that approximately 50% of prescriptions for respiratory infections in [[Saskatchewan]] are inappropriate,&lt;ref&gt;Wang, E. E., Einarson, T. R., Kellner, J. D., &amp; Conly, J. M. (1999). Antibiotic prescribing for Canadian preschool children: evidence of overprescribing for viral respiratory infections. Clinical infectious diseases, 29(1), 155-160.&lt;/ref&gt; 28% of [[lumbar spine]] [[MRI]]s in [[Alberta]] and [[Ontario]] are unnecessary,&lt;ref&gt;Emery, D. J., Shojania, K. G., Forster, A. J., Mojaverian, N., &amp; Feasby, T. E. (2013). Overuse of magnetic resonance imaging. JAMA Internal Medicine,173(9), 823-825.&lt;/ref&gt;  and 28% of [[bone mineral density]] scans are inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Papaioannou A, Morin S, Cheung AM, Atkinson S, Brown JP, Feldman S, et al. 2010 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in Canada: Summary. CMAJ. 2010 Nov 23;182(17):1864-73.&lt;/ref&gt; These unnecessary invasive procedures and low value care are major causes of preventable harm and increased waste of medical resources.&lt;ref&gt;Berwick, D. M., &amp; Hackbarth, A. D. (2012). Eliminating waste in US health care. Jama, 307(14), 1513-1516.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical overuse has been associated with decreased [[patient satisfaction]] and poor clinical outcomes, including higher mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, E. S., Wennberg, D. E., Stukel, T. A., Gottlieb, D. J., Lucas, F. L., &amp; Pinder, E. L. (2003). The implications of regional variations in Medicare spending. Part 1: the content, quality, and accessibility of care. Annals of Internal Medicine, 138(4), 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic survey of patients in seven countries revealed that 10-20% of patients believed that their physicians had provided treatment of little or no value in the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;Schoen, C., Osborn, R., Doty, M. M., Bishop, M., Peugh, J., &amp; Murukutla, N. (2007). Toward higher-performance health systems: adults’ health care experiences in seven countries, 2007. Health Affairs, 26(6), w717-w734.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies highlighted the financial strain of medical overuse, such as the analysis conducted by the [[Institute of Medicine]], which found that up to 30% of American health care spending is on unnecessary tests and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz AL, Landon BE, Elshaug AG, Chernew ME, McWilliams JM. Measuring Low-Value Care in Medicare. JAMA Intern Med. 2014. Epub ahead of print.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these concerns, Choosing Wisely Canada hopes to optimize value, reduce waste and improve patient outcomes by promoting patient-physician conversations about low-value care.

==History==
[[File:Dr. Wendy Levinson, MD, OC..jpg|thumb|Dr. Wendy Levinson (MD, OC) Chair of Choosing Wisely Canada]]

Choosing Wisely Canada is modeled after the [[Choosing Wisely]] campaign launched by the [[ABIM Foundation]] of the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] in the United States in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey EJ. Choosing wisely (and carefully) Canada. Can J Surg. 2014 Jun;57(3):149, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Wendy Levinson]], a Canadian physician and previous chair of the ABIM Board of Directors, was involved in launching the Choosing Wisely campaign in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. D., &amp; Levinson, W. S. (2015). A Commitment to High-Value Care Education From the Internal Medicine Community. Annals of Internal Medicine,162(9), 639-640&lt;/ref&gt; After its successful launch, she decided to bring the movement to Canada and partnered with the [[Canadian Medical Association]] and the [[University of Toronto]] to launch Choosing Wisely Canada on April 2, 2014.&lt;ref name="Lev CMAJ"/&gt; In the first wave of the campaign, nine national medical specialty societies released [[evidence-based]] lists of 41 tests, treatments and procedures that provided no benefit or potentially caused harm to patients.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

Under the leadership of Dr. Wendy Levinson and the Canadian Medical Association, Choosing Wisely Canada initially gained momentum in [[Ontario]] and subsequently became a national movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta S, Detsky AS. Development of Choosing Wisely Recommendations for an Inpatient Internal Medicine Service. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Feb 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third waves of physician recommendation lists and patient education materials were launched on October 29, 2014, and June 2, 2015, respectively.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;Vogel, L. More Hospitals Choose Wisely.CMAJ June 8, 2015 cmaj.109-5078&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of June 2, 2015, more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies are engaged and at various stages of recommendations development .  In total, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released in the three waves from 2014-2015.&lt;ref name="Vogel" /&gt;

==Campaign==

''Choosing Wisely Canada'' has adopted a multi-faceted campaign approach, engaging physicians, patients, and medical trainees at all levels. The campaign has partnered with more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies to develop evidence-supported lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question”, hoping to promote conversation about inappropriate care.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt; The underlying premise is that physicians must lead such conversations, since they determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of resources.&lt;ref name= "Vogel" /&gt; CWC has also developed complementary patient-friendly education materials, and has begun to embed lessons focusing on resource stewardship in undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula.&lt;ref name= "Vogel"/&gt; In order to unify grassroots projects occurring across Canada to implement physician recommendations, CWC additionally developed the Early Adopters Collaborative, which serves as a “learning platform for sharing knowledge, tools and experiences among participating organizations”.&lt;ref name ="ICU"&gt;Holton, E. Choosing Wisely: Tackling Unnecessary X-rays in the ICUS. St. Michael's Hospital Newsroom. Available at: http://www.stmichaelshospital.com/media/detail.php?source=hospital_news/2015/20150624_hn&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physician Recommendations Lists ===

[[File:CWC List Development Process.JPG|thumb|CWC List Development Process]]

At the core of the campaign are lists of "Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question" developed by national specialty societies representing a broad spectrum of physicians. These lists contain tests, treatments or procedures commonly used in their specialty, but which are not supported by evidence, and/or could expose patients to unnecessary harm.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, R. (2014). Can doctors reduce harmful medical overuse worldwide?. BMJ, 349, g4289.&lt;/ref&gt;

List items recommend practices to be avoided and typically begin with the word “Don’t” or “Avoid”; for example, one of the recommendations released in the first wave of the campaign was ''Don’t order screening chest X-rays and ECGs for asymptomatic or low risk outpatients''.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Association of Radiologists. Medical imaging primer with a focus on x-ray usage and safety [Internet]. [Cited 2014 Feb 15]. Available from: http://www.car.ca/uploads/standards%20guidelines/20130128_en_guide_radiation_primer.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; National specialty societies are free to determine the process for generating their lists, as long as they are done in accordance with the following principles:&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

# The development process is thoroughly documented and publicly available
# Each recommendation is within the specialty’s scope of practice (and not pertaining to other specialties such as family medicine) 
# Tests, treatments or procedures included are those that (a) are frequently used, and, (b) may expose patients to harm or stress.
# Each recommendation is supported by evidence

Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations are not intended to be used to establish payment and coverage decisions. Rather, the lists are meant to spur conversation about what is appropriate and necessary treatment. As each patient situation is unique, Choosing Wisely Canada recommends that its materials be used as guidelines for physicians and patients to determine an appropriate treatment plan together.&lt;ref&gt;Baron RJ, Wolfson D. Advancing medical professionalism and the choosing wisely campaign. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Mar 1;175(3):464-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient education===

In order to encourage patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care, Choosing Wisely Canada uses patient-friendly materials with lay language to complement the lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question”. These patient educational materials are meant to inform patients about the tests, treatments and procedures used within various medical specialties, when they may or may not be necessary, and what patients can do to improve their overall health.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson D, Santa J, Slass L. Engaging physicians and consumers in conversations about treatment overuse and waste: a short history of the choosing wisely campaign. Acad Med. 2014 Jul;89(7):990-5.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the patient educational materials released on June 2, 2015, addressed concerns regarding the amount of bed rest required to treat lower back pain, advising that staying in bed longer than 48 hours will not help, and in fact, may actually delay recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Recommendations target overuse of unnecessary medical procedures. BCMJ, Vol. 57, No. 6, July, August 2015, page(s) 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial was written by Dr. Wendy Levinson in ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' as a part of the weekly feature titled "Doctor's Notes".  The article highlighted the Choosing Wisely campaign and encouraged patients to engage in conversations with their physicians about unnecessary care.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/08/10/why-that-medical-test-might-not-be-necessary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other campaign avenues===

Healthcare stakeholder groups have begun to mobilize around the CWC campaign at provincial and local levels. In Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, multi-stakeholder tables have been established to organize, coordinate and focus provincial implementation efforts.&lt;ref name ="Vogel" /&gt; At the local level, hospitals, health regions and physician groups across the country are working under their own initiative to find innovative ways to put the recommendations into practice.&lt;ref name= "ICU" /&gt; Such local implementation efforts are beginning to emerge across Canada, with activities ranging from physician and patient education, to modifying clinical processes and information systems, to providing data back to providers about their practice patterns.&lt;ref name="WCH"/&gt;

Another major aspect of the campaign is engaging medical trainees at all levels. The Draft 2015 CanMEDS Framework identifies leadership as one of seven essential physician competencies, urging medical professionals to “engage in the stewardship of health care resources”, particularly to “allocate health care resources for optimal patient care” and “to apply evidence and management processes to achieve cost-appropriate care”.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, J. R., Snell, L., &amp; Sherbino, J. (2014). The Draft CanMEDS 2015: Physician Competency Framework. Ottawa: Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; In order to embody these ideals, CWC is working with Canadian medical schools to introduce new content focussing on resource stewardship into the undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education curricula.&lt;ref name= "Vogel" /&gt;

On the media front, the campaign includes partnerships with patient organizations and media outlets to develop and disseminate complementary content to increase patient awareness, and to support them in conversations surrounding inappropriate care. CWC has also developed a bilingual mobile app available on both Android and Apple platforms, which contains all physician recommendations and patient educational materials organized categorically.&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.choosingwiselycanada.CWC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/choosing-wisely-canada/id933897108?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations range from avoiding overuse of broad practices such as unnecessary and potentially harmful screening, diagnostic and radiographic services, to specific tests which are not supported by evidence to improve patient outcomes.

Examples of recommendations which advise against overuse of broad practices include:

* Don’t perform routine [[cancer screening]], or surveillance for a new primary cancer, in the majority of patients with [[metastatic disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitera, G., Earle, C., Latosinsky, S., Booth, C., Bezjak, A., Desbiens, C., ... &amp; Porter, G. (2015). Choosing Wisely Canada Cancer List: Ten Low-Value or Harmful Practices That Should Be Avoided In Cancer Care. Journal of Oncology Practice, 11(3), e296-e303.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Don’t perform annual [[Cardiac imaging|stress cardiac imaging]] or advanced non-invasive imaging as part of routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients.&lt;ref&gt;Natarajan MK, Paul N, Mercuri M, Waller EJ, Leipsic J, Traboulsi M, et al. Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement on radiation exposure from cardiac imaging and interventional procedures. Can J Cardiol. 2013 Nov;29(11):1361-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of specific low-value tests to avoid in certain circumstances include:

*Don’t order [[testosterone (hormone)|serum testosterone]] in men without symptoms of [[hypogonadism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Endocrine Society. Testosterone Therapy in Adult Men with Androgen Deficiency Syndromes: An Endocrinology Society Clinical Practice Guideline [Internet]. 2010 [cited 2015 Jun 18]. Available from: http://www.endocrine.org/~/media/endosociety/Files/Publications/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/FINAL-Androgens-in-Men-Standalone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Don’t order [[thrombophilia]] testing in women with early pregnancy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, L. K., Bering, H., Carson, K. R., Haynes, A. E., Kleinerman, J., Kukreti, V., ... &amp; Wood, W. A. (2014). Five hematologic tests and treatments to question. ASH Education Program Book, 2014(1), 599-603&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

Campaign leaders have identified a number of challenges which could potentially undermine the efforts of Choosing Wisely Canada. Since reducing unnecessary tests and procedures may result in lowering healthcare costs, the campaign may be viewed as a [[Health care rationing|cost-cutting or rationing measure]], which could in turn "undermine both physician engagement and patient trust."&lt;ref name ="International"&gt;Levinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the campaign is centered around patient safety with particular emphasis on quality of care. Furthermore, Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations do not determine payment for individual services.&lt;ref name ="International" /&gt;

Some physicians report feeling pressure to engage in defensive medicine (e.g., ordering more tests than necessary) because they feel that it will help them avoid litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Volpp, K. G., Loewenstein, G., &amp; Asch, D. A. (2012). Choosing wisely: low-value services, utilization, and patient cost sharing. Jama, 308(16), 1635-1636.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian healthcare system is also set up so that specialty physicians get paid for tests and procedures conducted, and not for practicing conservative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Allin, S., &amp; Rudoler, D. (2015). The Canadian Health Care System, 2014.International Profiles of Health Care Systems, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a system may create a pattern for physicians to recommend more treatment. This pattern may also contribute to unwilling of physicians to put recommendations on their lists pertaining specifically to their specialty, instead focusing their recommendations on overuse by other specialties.&lt;ref name ="International" /&gt;

Evaluation of the campaign has also been identified as a major challenge. Campaign leaders concede that measuring the impact of Choosing Wisely is complex and may require multiple approaches, including physician and patient awareness of the campaign, documented curriculum inclusion in medical curricula, and demonstrated reduction in unnecessary testing following campaign efforts.&lt;ref name ="Bhatia"&gt;Bhatia, R. S., Levinson, W., &amp; Lee, D. S. (2014). Low value cardiac testing and Choosing Wisely. BMJ quality &amp; safety, bmjqs-2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring progress of reduction in inappropriate care is particularly complex, since “the definition of appropriateness often includes knowing about symptoms and physical exam findings often not included in electronic health records and administrative databases”.&lt;ref name ="Bhatia" /&gt;  Recognizing the complexity of evaluation efforts, Choosing Wisely Canada along with other international Choosing Wisely movements is working with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to develop metrics that might be used to compare countries on specific measures of overuse, as well to develop cross-country metrics.&lt;ref name = "International" /&gt;

Since patient education is a core facet of the campaign, communication with patients presents another challenge. Some campaign recommendations may require clinical education for complete comprehension.&lt;ref name = "Brody"&gt;Brody H. Talking with patients about cost containment. J Gen Intern Med. 2014 Jan;29(1):5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many patients tend to follow physician recommendations without question, even if they have questions. As such, a major portion of the campaign focuses on encouraging patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care.&lt;ref name ="Brody" /&gt;  Additionally, Choosing Wisely Canada has developed patient-friendly materials with straightforward, lay language to explain common tests, with a “When you need them and when you don’t” approach. These materials complement the lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question” developed by specialty societies.&lt;ref name ="Vogel" /&gt;

}}
The response to Choosing Wisely Canada has been positive, with physicians across the country expressing support for the campaign and highlighting the need for more resource stewardship.&lt;ref name="Glauser"/&gt; Dr. [[Danielle Martin]], family physician and Vice-President Medical Affairs and Health Systems Solutions at [[Women's College Hospital]], lists Choosing Wisely Canada as one of three major ideas to improve Canadian healthcare, highlighting that “Choosing Wisely Canada is not a rationing or cost-cutting exercising. It is about reorganizing healthcare services so we only do things for people that truly benefit their health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Danielle Martin's Three Big Ideas to Improve Healthcare |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/simon-fraser-university/Danielle+Martin+three+ideas+transform+health+care/10417270/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Chris Simpson (surgeon)|Chris Simpson]], past president of the Canadian Medical Association, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Cardiology at [[Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], notes "Physicians are really embracing the principles behind Choosing Wisely. It’s all about the right thing to do for patients and avoiding the harm that can come from unnecessary testing. Let’s do more of what works and…and less of what is done ‘just in case’. Society expects us to lead the way, and the physicians of Canada intend to do just that”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Choosing Wisely to Avoid Harm |url=http://deptmed.queensu.ca/blog/?p=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Rick Glazier]], senior scientist in primary care and population health at the [[Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences]] in [[Toronto]], highlights two aspects of the campaign that he believes are unique and have great potential. “The first”, he states, “is that it’s targeted to the public, and the second is that it’s driven not only by scientists and medical journals, but by the professional organizations themselves. For radiologists to come forward and say you shouldn’t order radiology tests under these circumstances, this is unprecedented”.&lt;ref name= "Glauser"&gt;Glauser W. Choosing Wisely campaign well received. CMAJ. 2014 May 13;186(8):E239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report of the [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/innovation/index-eng.php Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation] to [[Rona Ambrose]], [[Minister of Health (Canada)]], saluted Choosing Wisely Canada “as an innovative physician-led and patient-centered approach that has the potential to shift healthcare away from a culture of consumption to a focus on appropriateness and quality of care”. Furthermore, the panel urged “governments to support the implementation of [Choosing Wisely Canada] in all jurisdictions and to carefully evaluate its impact”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Report of the Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation: "Unleashing Innovation: Excellent Healthcare for Canada" |url= http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/health-system-systeme-sante/report-healthcare-innovation-rapport-soins/alt/report-healthcare-innovation-rapport-soins-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to endorsements from eminent physician leaders and professional organizations, Choosing Wisely Canada received positive media coverage in national media sources, including ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Medical Associations to Urge Canada's Doctors to Limit Unnecessary Tests |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/medical-associations-to-urge-canadas-doctors-to-limit-unnecessary-tests/article16953492/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Unnecessary Medical Tests Need a Rethink |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/unnecessary-medical-tests-need-a-rethink-1.2541790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toronto Star]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Doctors Weigh in on 2013's Biggest Medical Breakthroughs |url= https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2013/12/27/doctors_weigh_in_on_2013s_biggest_medical_breakthroughs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which heralded ''Choosing Wisely Canada'' as one of the top medical breakthroughs of the year. .

On the other hand, early criticism of Choosing Wisely in the United States highlighted that some specialty recommendations addressed overuse of resources by primary care specialties, instead of addressing unnecessary tests and procedures conducted by their own specialty colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Morden, N. E., Colla, C. H., Sequist, T. D., &amp; Rosenthal, M. B. (2014). Choosing wisely—the politics and economics of labeling low-value services.New England Journal of Medicine, 370(7), 589-592&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing Wisely Canada responded to such criticisms by setting guidelines for its list development, which required recommendations put forward by specialty societies to pertain specifically to the specialty’s scope of practice.&lt;ref name= "Bhatia" /&gt;

Many physician bloggers assert that most medical overuse is a result of practicing defensive medicine in an effort to avoid lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why 'Choosing Wisely' Won't Protect You in a Lawsuit |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/837399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others recognize the noble goal of reducing overuse and harm, but lament that the lists are too simplistic and do not necessarily advance the identification of low-value care, but merely synthesize “agreed-upon, well-established practices”.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens DR, Finelli A. Choosing Wisely Canada: It's our turn. Can Urol Assoc J. 2014 Jul;8(7-8):E580-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A critique of the Choosing Wisely campaign published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] by Clement and Charlton highlights a number of shortcomings in the overall movement. While the critique commends the campaign for succeeding in its goal of promoting conversations about low-value care, the authors of the critique believed that the process of list development were based on “quasi-systematic methods that focus on physician participation to increase support”.&lt;ref name ="Clement"&gt;Clement, F., &amp; Charlton, B. (2015). Challenges in Choosing Wisely’s international future: support, evidence, and burnout. JAMA Internal Medicine,175(4), 644-645&lt;/ref&gt; The critique additionally called for increased evidence of the efficacy of the “Top Five” lists in terms of reduction in wasteful practices. Clement and Charlton furthermore warn of “Top Five List Burnout”, noting that when faced with multiple guidelines on a single topic, physicians become confused regarding which protocol to follow.&lt;ref name= "Clement"/&gt; In spite of these criticisms, Clement and Charlton “strongly believe in the global spirit behind the Choosing Wisely campaigns and movement” and “advocate that the priority in 2015 should be thoughtful implementation and rigorous evaluation of existing top five lists” &lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

==Impact==

Choosing Wisely Canada has identified a multifaceted evaluation approach to measure its impact, which includes:&lt;ref name= "Bhatia" /&gt;

*Physician attitudes and self-reported experience (through physician surveys)
*Patient receptiveness to campaign messages
*Reduction in ordering of low-value tests and procedures
*Implementation in medical education

Evaluation of campaign impact on patient education and receptiveness included a [[randomized control trial]] entitled EMPOWER (Eliminating Medications Through Patient Ownership of End Results), led by Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, geriatrician and Professor in the Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name ="EMPOWER"&gt;Tannenbaum C, Martin P, Tamblyn R, Benedetti A, Ahmed S. Reduction of inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions among older adults through direct patient education: the EMPOWER cluster randomized trial. JAMA Intern Med. 2014 Jun;174(6):890-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial recruited more than 300 patients aged 65–95 years in the greater Montréal area who were long term users of benzodiazepines. Approximately half the patients were exposed to educational intervention, which included Choosing Wisely recommendations around excessive benzodiazepine therapy. The patients were then followed for 6 months. The study found that 62% of patients who received the intervention initiated conversation regarding benzodiazepine therapy discontinuation with physicians and/or pharmacists.&lt;ref name ="EMPOWER" /&gt; After six months, 27% of the intervention group had stopped taking benzodiazepines, compared with 5% of the patients who did not receive the educational intervention.&lt;ref name= "EMPOWER" /&gt;

The impact of Choosing Wisely Canada on test ordering and utilization was studied at the [[North York General Hospital]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]], one of the early adopters of the campaign. A multi-faceted campaign was implemented particularly in the hospital Emergency Department in June, 2014. Test utilization in the Emergency Department was analyzed between September 15 and November 21, 2014, and compared to the same 10-week period in 2013 to account for any seasonal variances.&lt;ref name ="NYGH"&gt;{{cite web|title = CWC in North York General Hospital ED |url= http://www.choosingwiselycanada.org/resources/updates-from-the-field/2014/11/20/north-york-general-hospital-ontario-oct-2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found a 41% decline in the number of laboratory tests ordered pre- and post- CWC program implementation, without any observable change in outcomes.&lt;ref name= "NYGH" /&gt; A preliminary cost analysis revealed annual departmental savings of approximately $215,000 while maintaining the same quality of care.&lt;ref name= "NYGH" /&gt;

A [[quality improvement]] initiative based on CWC principles was launched under the supervision of Dr. [[Danielle Martin]] at the [[Women's College Hospital|Women’s College Hospital]] (WCH) in Toronto. The [[American Thyroid Association]] and Choosing Wisely Canada recommends testing only [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|Thyroid Stimulating Hormone]] (TSH) levels rather than testing both TSH and [[Thyroid hormones|free thyroid hormones]] (such as T4) for assessment of suspected [[hypothyroidism]], since majority of patients with hypothyroidism will present with abnormal TSH levels. A baseline audit at Women’s College Hospital revealed that 60% of all free thyroid hormones tests were performed in patients who had normal TSH levels, amounting to approximately $50,000 annually in additional laboratory testing expenditure.&lt;ref name ="WCH"&gt;Gilmour, J., Weisman, A., Vecchiarelli, J., Orlov, S., Goldberg, R. J., &amp; Goldberg, A. (2015). THR-191: Reducing Inappropriate Thyroid Function Tests at an Academic Ambulatory Hospital: Baseline Assessment for a Quality Improvement Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; A “Reflex T4” approach was implemented at WCH, wherein free T4 tests would not be conducted unless TSH levels are abnormal, or if there are clinical indications of situations when measurement of free thyroid hormones would be necessary. When it is found that TSH levels are abnormal, free T4 levels would then be automatically measured.&lt;ref name= "WCH"/&gt; In addition to reducing inappropriate thyroid function testing, the impact of Choosing Wisely Canada is felt through numerous physician and patient awareness campaigns conducted at the hospital.&lt;ref name= "WCH"/&gt;

Medical education efforts of CWC are currently centered at the [[University of Toronto]], where Choosing Wisely principles are integrated into the undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula through [[Problem-Based Learning]] seminars, lectures, resident research projects and academic half days.&lt;ref&gt;Leon-Carlyle, M., &amp; Srivastava, R. (2014). Medicine’s Push for Resource Stewardship in Education and Practice. University of Toronto Medical Journal,92(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the example of Choosing Wisely in the United States and Choosing Wisely Canada, health leaders from [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Wales]] have committed to initiating similar campaigns revolving around medical stewardship and low-value care in their respective countries. Italy has integrated the principles of Choosing Wisely in a campaign called “Doing more does not mean doing better”, and the Netherlands has launched “Choosing Wisely Netherlands”, both contributing to a growing international Choosing Wisely movement&lt;ref&gt;Levinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''concept map''' or '''conceptual diagram''' is a [[diagram]] that depicts suggested relationships between [[concept]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Hager, Nancy C. Corbin. ''Designing &amp; Delivering: Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Presentations,'' 1997, . 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a graphical tool that [[instructional designer]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[Technical communication|technical writers]], and others use to organize and structure [[knowledge]].

A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in '''linking phrases''' such as ''causes'', ''requires'', or ''contributes to''.&lt;ref name=theory&gt;[[Joseph D. Novak]] &amp; Alberto J. Cañas (2006). [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm "The Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How To Construct and Use Them"], [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]].

The technique for [[Visualization (graphic)|visualizing]] these relationships among different concepts is called ''concept mapping''. Concept maps have been used to define the [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of computer systems, for example with the [[object-role modeling]] or [[Unified Modeling Language]] formalism.

== Overview ==
A concept map is a way of representing relationships between [[idea]]s, [[image]]s, or [[word]]s in the same way that a [[sentence diagram]] represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a [[circuit diagram]] represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel.{{clarify|why is this noteworthy?|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="CMP"&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf CONCEPT MAPPING FUELS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062626/http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept maps were developed{{according to whom|date=November 2016}} to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. A well-made concept map grows within a ''context frame'' defined by an explicit "focus question", while a [[mind map]] often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. Some research evidence suggests that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on [[declarative memory]] content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., &amp; Lebiere, C. (1998). The atomic components of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., Byrne, M. D., Douglass, S., Lebiere, C., &amp; Qin, Y. (2004). An Integrated Theory of the Mind. Psychological Review, 111(4), 1036&amp;ndash;1050.&lt;/ref&gt; Because concept maps are constructed to reflect organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.

== Differences from other visualizations ==

* ''Topic maps'': Concept maps are rather similar to [[topic map]]s in that both allow to concepts or topics via [[graph (data structure)|graphs]]. Among the various schema and techniques for visualizing ideas, processes, and organizations, concept mapping, as developed by [[Joseph D. Novak|Joseph Novak]] is unique in its philosophical basis, which "makes concepts, and propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the structure of knowledge and construction of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Novak, J.D. &amp; Gowin, D.B. (1996). Learning How To Learn, Cambridge University Press: New York, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mind maps'': Both concept maps and topic maps can be contrasted with [[mind mapping]], which is often restricted to radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s. Another contrast between concept mapping and mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a mind map is created. A mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming. A concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts. Concept maps are more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mind maps, which typically emerge from a single center.

== History ==
Concept mapping was developed by [[Joseph D. Novak]] and his research team at [[Cornell University]] in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihmc.us/users/user.php?UserID=jnovak|title=Joseph D. Novak|publisher=Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)|accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin  in the learning movement called [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge.

Novak's work is based on the cognitive theories of [[David Ausubel]], who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or ''assimilate'') new concepts: "The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as "What is water?" "What causes the seasons?" In his book ''Learning How to Learn'', Novak states that a "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures."

Various attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of ''off-loading''. In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of Sowa&lt;ref&gt;Sowa, J.F., 1983. ''Conceptual structures: information processing in mind and machine'', Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper by Sweller &amp; Chandler.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J. &amp; Chandler, P., 1991. Evidence for Cognitive Load Theory. ''Cognition and Instruction'', 8(4), p.351-362.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using ''nodes'' and ''relationships'', allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R. (1998) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6(3), p.251–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know.&lt;ref&gt;Birbili, M. (2006) [http://ecrp.uiuc.edu/v8n2/birbili.html "Mapping Knowledge: Concept Maps in Early Childhood Education"], ''Early Childhood Research &amp; Practice'', ''8(2)'', Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''knowledge arena'' is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know.

==Use==
[[Image:Conceptmap.png|thumb|450px|Example concept map created using the IHMC CmapTools computer program.]]
Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="theory"/&gt; Concept mapping is also sometimes used for [[brain-storming]]. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.

Formalized concept maps are used in [[software design]], where a common usage is [[Unified Modeling Language]] diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.

Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument &amp;mdash; similar to [[argument map]]s.

Concept maps are widely used in education and business. Uses include:
*[[Note taking]] and summarizing gleaning key concepts, their relationships and hierarchy from documents and source materials
*New knowledge creation: e.g., transforming [[tacit knowledge]] into an organizational resource, mapping team knowledge
*Institutional knowledge preservation (retention), e.g., eliciting and mapping expert knowledge of employees prior to retirement
*Collaborative knowledge modeling and the transfer of expert knowledge
*Facilitating the creation of shared vision and shared understanding within a team or organization
*Instructional design: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advance organizers" that provide an initial conceptual frame for subsequent information and learning.
*Training: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advanced organizers" to represent the training context and its relationship to their jobs, to the organization's strategic objectives, to training goals.
*Communicating complex ideas and arguments
*Examining the symmetry of complex ideas and arguments and associated terminology
*Detailing the entire structure of an idea, [[train of thought]], or line of argument (with the specific goal of exposing faults, errors, or gaps in one's own reasoning) for the scrutiny of others.
*Enhancing [[metacognition]] (learning to learn, and thinking about knowledge)
*Improving language ability
*Assessing learner understanding of learning objectives, concepts, and the relationship among those concepts
*Lexicon development

The '''Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair''' was a public controversy involving academics [[Alan Dershowitz]] and [[Norman Finkelstein]] and their scholarship on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] in 2005.

Shortly after the publication of the book ''[[The Case for Israel]]'', by [[Harvard Law School]] professor Alan Dershowitz, Norman Finkelstein alleged that it was "a collection of fraud, falsification, plagiarism and nonsense."&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;[[Amy Goodman]], [http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/24/1730205 "Scholar Norman Finkelstein Calls Professor Alan Dershowitz's New Book On Israel a 'Hoax',"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114124931/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F09%2F24%2F1730205 |date=November 14, 2007 }} ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' September 24, 2003, accessed February 10, 2007.  (Incl. links to full transcript and audio clip and [[MP3]] podcast.)&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein further derided the book, remarking, "If Dershowitz's book were made of cloth, I wouldn't even use it as a [[List of English words of Yiddish origin#schmatta|schmatta]]&amp;nbsp;... his book is such garbage."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from interview in ''[[American Radical: The Trials of Norman Finkelstein]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein charged that Dershowitz had engaged in [[plagiarism]] in his use of [[Joan Peters]]' book ''[[From Time Immemorial]]''.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Norman G. Finkelstein]], [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=4&amp;ar=1 The Dershowitz Hoax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224053121/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=4&amp;ar=1 |date=February 24, 2008 }}, ''normanfinkelstein.com'' (passim), accessed February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz has denied the charges. Former [[Harvard University|Harvard]] president [[Derek Bok]], following a review requested by Harvard Law School Dean [[Elena Kagan]], determined that no plagiarism had occurred.&lt;ref name=Bombardieri&gt;Marcella Bombardieri, The charges of plagiarism and ghost writing were subsequently removed from the text of Finkelstein's book. [http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/07/09/academic_fight_heads_to_print/ "Academic Fight Heads to Print: Authorship Challenge Dropped from Text,"] ''[[Boston Globe]]'' July 9, 2005, accessed February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514516|title=Mercy of the Court of Public Opinion|work=thecrimson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Beyond Chutzpah]]: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', published by [[University of California Press]] on August 28, 2005, Finkelstein aimed to debunk ''The Case for Israel''. Dershowitz had written letters to both [[The New Press]] and to the University of California Press to prevent its publication, claiming it contained massive libel and stating that the book should not be published.&lt;ref name=Younge&gt;Gary Younge,  [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1545972,00.html "J'accuse,"] ''[[The Guardian]]'' August 10, 2005, accessed February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz responded in his book ''[[The Case for Peace]]'' and alleged a politically motivated campaign of vilification spearheaded by Finkelstein, [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Alexander Cockburn]] against several pro-Israel academics.&lt;ref name=DershowitzStatement/&gt;

==Finkelstein's criticisms of Dershowitz==

The bulk of ''Beyond Chutzpah'' consisted of an essay critiquing the "[[new antisemitism]]" and longer chapters contrasting Dershowitz's arguments in ''The Case for Israel'' with the findings of mainstream human rights organisations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], asserting that Dershowitz had lied, misrepresented and fabricated many of his points in order to protect [[Israel]] and hide its record of alleged human rights violations. Finkelstein maintained that "the real issue is Israel's human rights record."&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Norman G. Finkelstein]], [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=50 The Real Issue is Israel's Human Rights Record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812032510/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=50 |date=August 12, 2012 }}, accessed July 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Finkelstein provided what he claimed is evidence of plagiarism in instances where Dershowitz reproduced the exact errors found in Peters's citation of original sources, and thus argues that Dershowitz did not check the original sources he cited, a claim that Dershowitz adamantly denied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Norman G. Finkelstein]], [http://www.workingtv.com/finkelstein.html Speech presented at Vancouver Public Library], link to Part 7, webcasts posted at ''workingtv.com'', n.d., accessed February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein noted that in twenty instances that all occur within as many pages, Dershowitz used some of the same words from the same sources that Joan Peters used, largely in the same order. Several paragraph-long quotations that the two books share have ellipses in the same position. Finkelstein claimed that in one instance Dershowitz refers to the same page number as Peters, although he is citing a different (1996) edition of the same source, in which the words appear on a different page.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Norman G. Finkelstein]], [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/alan-dershowitz-exposed-what-if-a-harvard-student-did-this/ "Alan Dershowitz Exposed: What if a Harvard Student Did This?"] ''normanfinkelstein.com'' n.d., accessed February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein stated: "It is left to readers to decide whether Dershowitz committed plagiarism as defined by Harvard University—'passing off a source's information, ideas, or words as your own by omitting to cite them.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Norman G. Finkelstein]], [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=50 "The Real Issue Is Israel's Human Rights Record:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812032510/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=50 |date=August 12, 2012 }} A Statement by Norman G. Finkelstein upon Publication of ''Beyond Chutzpah'', 25 August 2005, accessed 13 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a book review of ''Beyond Chutzpah'', written by Prof. [[Michael Desch|Michael C. Desch]] in ''[[The American Conservative]]'', "Finkelstein does not accuse Dershowitz of the wholesale lifting of someone else's words, but he does make a very strong case that Dershowitz has violated the spirit, if not the exact letter, of Harvard's prohibitions of the first three forms of plagiarism."&lt;ref name=Desch&gt;[[Michael Desch|Michael C. Desch]],  [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=98 "The Chutzpah of Alan Dershowitz,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327143707/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=98 |date=March 27, 2006 }} ''[[The American Conservative]]'' December 5, 2005, online posting, ''normanfinkelstein.com'', accessed February 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting his perception of Dershowitz's lack of knowledge about specific contents of his own book during an interview of the two men by [[Amy Goodman]] on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Finkelstein also charged that Dershowitz could not have written the book and may not have even read it.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt;  Later, he cited such allegedly "unserious" references as the Sony Pictures website for Kevin Macdonald's documentary film ''[[One Day in September]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/oneday/html/timeline/index.html One Day in September] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320203834/http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/oneday/html/timeline/index.html |date=March 20, 2006 }}'' Sony Pictures Classics official website, accessed February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and an online high-school syllabus from ''Teaching the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: A Unit for High School Students'', by Professor Ronald Stockton,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050902135155/http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/worldreach/assets/docs/israeli-palestinian_conflict/studentkeydates.html "Some Key Dates in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,"] rev. 2nd ed., [[University of Michigan–Dearborn]], [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Michigan]], November 1993, archived September 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; in his criticism of the book.

==Dershowitz's response==

Dershowitz threatened to bring a legal action against the [[University of California Press]] in response to the charges in Finkelstein's book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=1287 June 1, 2005 letter to University of California Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604214612/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=1287 |date=June 4, 2008 }} from Dershowitz's lawyer reads: "...your appendix—if it is not removed before publication—is going to lead to painful surgery for the Press." Verified October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz claimed to have written every word of ''The Case for Israel'' by hand and to have sent the University of California Press his handwritten manuscript. He says there is not a single phrase or sentence in it that was plagiarized, and accused Finkelstein of knowing this and making the charges in order to garner publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dershowitz/statement.html STATEMENT OF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231094329/http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dershowitz/statement.html |date=December 31, 2005 }}, Harvard Law web-site. Verified October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz offered to produce his handwritten drafts (he does not type) to debunk the claim that ''The Case for Israel'' was ghostwritten and claimed Finkelstein has not asked to see them.&lt;ref name=Unfair/&gt;

Dershowitz also asked [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] to intervene in order to prevent the University of California Press from publishing the book.&lt;ref name=Letters&gt;See the reproduction of [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=126 four letters from Dershowitz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314041913/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=126 |date=March 14, 2007 }} as posted on ''normanfinkelstein.com'' with a headnote.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger's legal advisor responded, however, that the governor would not intervene in issues of academic freedom.&lt;ref name=Younge/&gt;

As a result, when ''Beyond Chutzpah'' was published, it no longer used the word "plagiarize" in its argument that Dershowitz inappropriately borrowed from another work, nor did it include the claim that Dershowitz did not write ''The Case for Israel'',&lt;ref name=Bombardieri/&gt; because, the publisher said, "[Finkelstein] couldn't document that."&lt;ref name=Schuker&gt;Daniel J. T. Schuker, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=508242 "Accusations Fly in Academic Feud:] Harvard Law Prof Tries to Prevent Publication of Book about Israel," ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' July 8, 2005, accessed February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; "Dershowitz has said he cited sources properly, attempting to check all primary sources and citing Peters when she was his only source."&lt;ref name=SchukerLAE&gt;Lauren A. E. Schuker, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=349044 "Dershowitz Accused Of Plagiarism:] Law School Professor Denies He Relied on Another's Work,"  ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' September 29, 2003, and [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=349102 "Dershowitz Defends Book.] Professor Calls Plagiarism Accusation 'funny'."  ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' October 2, 2003, both accessed February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dershowitz said that Finkelstein has invented false charges in order to discredit supporters of Israel: "The mode of attack is consistent. Chomsky selects the target and directs Finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn't actually write the work, that it is plagiarized, that it is a hoax and a fraud," alleging that Finkelstein has leveled the same kind of charges against many others, calling at least 10 "distinguished Jews 'hucksters,' 'hoaxters,' 'thieves,' 'extortionists,' and worse."&lt;ref name=JBooks&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz|Alan M. Dershowitz]], [http://www.jbooks.com/interviews/index/IP_Dershowitz.htm "The Hazards of Making ''The Case for Israel'',"] ''jbooks.com'' n.d., accessed February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dershowitz's subsequent book on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ''[[The Case for Peace]]'', contains a chapter rebutting Finkelstein's charges, which Dershowitz has made available on his web site.&lt;ref name=DershowitzStatement/&gt;

==Additional responses by Finkelstein and Dershowitz==

Finkelstein argued in a letter to the ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'' published on October 3, 2003, that Dershowitz reproduced exactly two of Peters' mistakes, and made one relevant mistake of his own.&lt;ref name=FinkLetter&gt;Norman Finkelstein, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=349123 "Finkelstein Proclaims 'The Glove Does Fit',"] Letter to the editors, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' October 3, 2003, accessed February 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In quoting [[Mark Twain]], Finkelstein argued, "Dershowitz cites two paragraphs from Twain as continuous text, just as Peters cites them as continuous text, but in Twain's book the two paragraphs are separated by 87 pages."&lt;ref name=FinkLetter/&gt;  While still quoting Twain, although Dershowitz cited a different edition of Twain's ''[[Innocents Abroad]]'' than Joan Peters cites, Finkelstein continues, "the relevant quotes do not appear on these pages in the edition of Twain's book that Dershowitz cites."  Finkelstein points out that these quotations do, however, appear on the pages that Joan Peters cites as her edition of ''Innocents Abroad''. Finkelstein asserted: "Quoting a statement depicting the miserable fate of Jews in mid-19th century [[Jerusalem]], Peters cites a British consular letter from 'Wm. T. Young to Viscount Canning.' Dershowitz cites the same statement as Peters, reporting that Young 'attributed the plight of the Jew in Jerusalem' to pervasive [[anti-Semitism]]. Turning to the original, however, we find that the relevant statement did not come from Young but, as is unmistakably clear to anyone who actually consulted the original, from an enclosed memorandum written by an 'A. Benisch' that Young was forwarding to Canning."  He concluded: "It would be impossible for anyone who checked the original source[s] to make the[se] error[s]."&lt;ref name=FinkLetter/&gt;

In response to the general charge of plagiarism, Dershowitz had characterized the excerpts as quotations that historians and scholars of the region cite routinely, such as [[Mark Twain]] and the reports of government commissions.&lt;ref&gt;From the preface of "The Case for Israel" by Alan Dershowitz, 2003 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Statement of Alan M. Dershowitz" featured on a faculty webpage at Harvard Law School,
Dershowitz writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will no longer participate in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book ''The Case For Peace'', to be published by Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.

I will not debate Finkelstein. I have a longstanding policy against debating [[Holocaust]] deniers, revisionists, trivializers or minimizers. Nor is a serious debate about Israel possible with someone who acknowledges that he knows "very little" about that country. I will be happy to debate any legitimate experts from [[Amnesty International]] or any other human rights organization. Indeed, I have a debate scheduled with [[Noam Chomsky]] about these issues in the fall [2005].&lt;ref name=DershowitzStatement&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dershowitz/statement.html "Statement of Alan M.

Dershowitz strenuously denied that he did not credit Peters' book adequately in his own book, and [[Harvard University]] supported him in that position in exonerating him against Finkelstein's charges that he committed "[[plagiarism]]".&lt;ref name=DershowitzStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rests&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz|Alan M. Dershowitz]], [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=349122 "Professor Dershowitz 'Rests His Case',"] ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' October 3, 2003, Letter to the Editors (Opinion), accessed February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Unfair&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz]], [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513348 "Plagiarism Accusations Unfairly Characterized,"] ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' May 5, 2006, Letter to the Editors (Opinion) dated May 1, 2006 (appended correction), accessed February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their joint interview aired on Amy Goodman's radio program ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Dershowitz responded to Finkelstein's various arguments.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt;

==$10,000 challenge==

During the joint interview of Dershowitz and Finkelstein in a 2003 ''Democracy Now!'' broadcast, host Amy Goodman alluded to an appearance on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Scarborough Country]]'' in which Dershowitz made a challenge to "give $10,000 to the PLO" ([[Palestine Liberation Organization]]), playing a clip from the other program. In the headnote to the transcript, Goodman wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On MSNBC's Scarborough Country on September 8, 2003, renowned appellate lawyer, Harvard Law professor and author Alan Dershowitz says: "I will give $10,000 to the PLO... if you can find a historical fact in my book that you can prove to be false." The book Dershowitz refers to is his latest work ''The Case For Israel''.
Today author and professor Norman Finkelstein takes him on and charges that Dershowitz makes numerous factual errors in his book. Dershowitz denies the charges. Finkelstein teaches at DePaul University and is the author of four books including ''The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The segment of ''Democracy Now!'' appears in the included transcript of the program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Amy Goodman''': ...we were intrigued on watching ''[[Scarborough Country]]'' when you debated, the offer that you made [....] just play it for a moment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Alan Dershowitz''': Tell you what, I will give $10,000 to the P.L.O. in your name if you can find historical fact in my book that you can prove to be false. I issue that challenge, I issue it to you, I issue it to the [[Palestinian Authority]], I issue it to Noam Chomsky to [[Edward Said]], every word in my book is accurate and you can't just simply say it's false without documenting it. Tell me one thing in the book now that is false?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Amy Goodman''': Okay. Let's go to the book. The Case for Israel $10,000.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!--What is the primary MSNBC source?--&gt;

On ''Democracy Now!'' Finkelstein replied to that specific challenge for material errors found in his book overall, and Dershowitz upped it to $25,000 for another particular "issue" that they disputed.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt;

Finkelstein referred to "concrete facts which are not particularly controversial," stating that in ''The Case for Israel'' Dershowitz attributes to Israeli historian [[Benny Morris]] the figure of between 2,000 and 3,000 Palestinian [[Arabs]] who fled their homes from April to June 1948, when the range in the figures presented by Morris is actually 200,000 to 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benny. "Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict." Vintage Press, 1999, p. 256: "Altogether about two to three hundred thousands Arabs fled their homes during this second stage of the exodus."&lt;/ref&gt;

Dershowitz responded to Finkelstein's reply by stating that such a mistake could not have been intentional, as it harmed his own side of the debate: "Obviously, the phrase '2,000 to 3,000 Arabs' refers either to a sub-phase [of the flight] or is a typographical error."&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt; In this particular context, Dershowitz's argument is that Palestinians left as a result of orders issued by Palestinian commanders: "If in fact, 200,000 were told to leave instead of 2,000, that strengthens my argument considerably."&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt;

==Others on the plagiarism controversy==

===Support for Finkelstein===

In his review of ''Beyond Chutzpah'', echoing Finkelstein's criticisms, Michael Desch, political science professor at [[University of Notre Dame]] observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only did Dershowitz improperly present Peters's ideas, he may not even have bothered to read the original sources she used to come up with them. Finkelstein somehow managed to get uncorrected page proofs of ''The Case for Israel'' in which Dershowitz appears to direct his research assistant to go to certain pages and notes in Peters's book and place them in his footnotes directly (32, col. 3).&lt;ref name=Desch/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oxford academic [[Avi Shlaim]] had also been critical of Dershowitz, saying he believed that the charge of plagiarism "is proved in a manner that would stand up in court."&lt;ref name=Garner&gt;Mandy Garner,"The Good Jewish Boys Go into Battle," ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'', December 16, 2005 {{cite web |url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=112 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102645/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=112 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Angeles attorney Frank Menetrez concluded in an opinion piece that he can find "no way of avoiding the inference that Dershowitz copied the quotation from Twain from Peters' ''From Time Immemorial'', and not from the original source," as Dershowitz claimed.&lt;ref name=Menetrez&gt;Dr Frank J Menetrez,[http://www.counterpunch.org/menetrez02122008.html "The Case Against Alan Dershowitz"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218115934/http://www.counterpunch.org/menetrez02122008.html |date=February 18, 2008 }}, ''counterpunch.org'', accessed June 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz has replied briefly to this charge, in an exchange with Menetrez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/dershowitz02262008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301223055/http://www.counterpunch.org/dershowitz02262008.html |archivedate=March 1, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} Alan M. Dershowitz, Frank J. Menetrez, ‘Debating Norman Finkelstein,' [[CounterPunch]] February 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Menetrez has also said his belief that "neither Dershowitz nor Harvard, however, has identified the specific issues or arguments that Harvard allegedly investigated and rejected. In particular, neither of them has ever said whether Harvard investigated the identical errors issue."&lt;ref name=Menetrez/&gt;

In Desch's review of ''Beyond Chutzpah'', summarizing Finkelstein's case against Dershowitz for "torturing the evidence," particularly Finkelstein's argument relating to Dershowitz's citations of Morris, Desch observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two problems with Dershowitz's heavy reliance on Morris. The first is that Morris is hardly the left-wing peacenik that Dershowitz makes him out to be, which means that calling him as a witness in Israel's defense is not very helpful to the case. The more important problem is that many of the points Dershowitz cites Morris as supporting—that the early Zionists wanted peaceful coexistence with the Arabs, that the Arabs began the 1948 War to destroy Israel, that the Arabs were guilty of many massacres while the Israelis were scrupulous about protecting human rights, and that the Arabs fled at the behest of their leaders rather than being ethnically cleansed by the Israel Defense Forces—turn out to be based on a partial reading or misreading of Morris's books. Finkelstein documents these charges in exhaustive detail in Appendix II of his book and the preponderance of evidence he provides is conclusive." (30–31)&lt;ref name=Desch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Appendix II in ''Beyond Chutzpah'', where Finkelstein says that Morris attributes nearly all of the flight of Palestinians which occurred during that phase of the 1948 war to fear of Jewish military actions, not to any orders from Arab leaders or expulsion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Support for Dershowitz===
{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}

As Desch acknowledges in his book review of ''Beyond Chutzpah'', "In the wake of a number of similar complaints against Dershowitz and two of his Harvard Law School colleagues [[Laurence Tribe]] and [[Charles Ogletree]], former Harvard President [[Derek Bok]] conducted an investigation—the details of which were not made public—that... vindicated Dershowitz" (32, col. 3).&lt;ref name=Desch/&gt;

==Dershowitz's involvement in Finkelstein's denial of tenure==

In September 2006, Alan Dershowitz sent members of [[DePaul University]]'s law and political science faculties what he described as "a dossier of Norman Finkelstein's most egregious academic sins, and especially his outright lies, misquotations, and distortions that... are not incidental to Finkelstein's purported scholarship; they are Finkelstein's purported scholarship," and he lobbied professors, alumni and administrators to deny Finkelstein tenure.&lt;ref name="chron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forer"/&gt;  De Paul's political science committee investigated the accusations against Finkelstein and concluded that they were not based on legitimate criticism. The department subsequently invited [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Ian Lustick]], two independent academics with known expertise on the Israel/Palestine conflict to evaluate the academic merit of Finkelstein's work. Mearsheimer and Lustick came to the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="Forer"&gt;Richard Forer ''Breakthrough: Transforming Fear Into Compassion : a New Perspective on the Israel-Palestine Conflict'' [[E-book]] 2010 {{ISBN|9780615404585}} Pg 45 - 46&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007 the De Paul University Liberal Arts and Sciences' Faculty Governance Council had voted unanimously to send a letter to Harvard University expressing "the council's dismay at Professor Dershowitz's interference in Finkelstein's tenure and promotion case."&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;'' Chronicle of Higher Education'' Thursday, April 5, 2007 [http://chronicle.com/temp/email2.php?id=g4gfPKPrmfSXvwhvXzRPxd2Msdzzgrpm "Harvard Law Professor Works to Disrupt Tenure Bid of Longtime Nemesis at DePaul U."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007 the DePaul University Political Science department voted 9 to 3, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Personnel Committee 5 to 0, in favor of giving Finkelstein [[tenure]]. The three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a minority report opposing tenure, supported by the Dean of the College, Chuck Suchar. Suchar stated he opposed tenure because Finkelstein's "personal and reputation demeaning attacks on Alan Dershowitz, [[Benny Morris]], and the holocaust authors Eli Wiesel and Jerzy Kosinski" were inconsistent with DePaul's [[Vincentian Studies Institute|"Vincentian" values]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sxu.edu/sites/kirstein/?p=680 The Suchar Memorandum] March 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007 a 4–3 vote by DePaul University's Board on Promotion and Tenure (a faculty board), affirmed by the university's president, the Rev. Dennis Holtschneider, denied Finkelstein tenure.&lt;ref name=CNNtenure&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/EDUCATION/06/11/depaul.professor.ap/ "DePaul denies tenure to controversial professor"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, CNN, June 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070707083735/http://sherman.depaul.edu/media/webapp/mrNews.asp?NID=1630 DePaul University Statement on the Tenure and Promotion Decision Concerning Professor Norman Finkelstein] June 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–2008 academic year (the remainder of his contract with DePaul), his sole course having been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/worldwide/story/0,,2158192,00.html Holocaust academic vows to fight axe of university class&lt;/ref&gt; However, in announcing his decision, Holtschneider said the outside attention "was unwelcome and inappropriate and had no impact on either the process or the outcome of this case." On September 5, 2007, Finkelstein resigned after he and the university reached a settlement; they released a joint statement on the resolution of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;

==Additional points of dispute between Finkelstein and Dershowitz==

In ''The Holocaust Industry'', Finkelstein questioned [[Elie Wiesel]]'s claim to have read [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' in Yiddish. According to Finkelstein, no translation of the work existed in Yiddish at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman|title=The Holocaust Industry|date=2003|publisher=Verso|page=82|quote="Because survivors are now revered as secular saints, one doesn't dare question them. Preposterous statements pass without comment. Elie Wiesel reminisces in his acclaimed memoir that, recently liberated from Buchenwald and only eighteen years old, 'I read ''The Critique of Pure Reason'' — don't laugh! — in Yiddish.' Leaving aside Wiesel's acknowledgment that at the time 'I was wholly ignorant of Yiddish grammar,' ''The Critique of Pure Reason'' was never translated into Yiddish."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz responded that this was not so: he alleged that one had been published in [[Warsaw]] in 1929, and said that he had seen a copy at the [[Harvard University Library|Harvard Library]].&lt;ref name=Rests/&gt;

Finkelstein described this latter claim as false and inept, writing that the only work by Kant in Yiddish owned by the library was a partial translation of the ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'', a completely different work than the one referred to by Wiesel and Dershowitz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Norman G. Finkelstein]], [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=6 "Dershowitz Exposed Yet Again: The Critique of Pure Cant,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226182649/http://normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=6 |date=December 26, 2005 }} online posting in "The Dershowitz Hoax", ''normanfinkelstein.com'' December 2003, accessed February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a clash with members of [[J Street]] at the 2010 [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] conference, Dershowitz chastised J Street for pandering to anti-Israel activists and asked, "Why are you so popular with Norman Finkelstein?"&lt;ref name="Httpwwwcommentarymagazinecomblogsindexphppollak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/pollak/265611 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102051900/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/pollak/265611 |archivedate=January 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both J Street&lt;ref name="Httpwwwcommentarymagazinecomblogsindexphppollak" /&gt; and Finkelstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein03032010.html|title=Truth and Consequences in the Gaza Invasion|work=counterpunch.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613134037/http://counterpunch.org/finkelstein03032010.html|archivedate=June 13, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; rebuffed Dershowitz's claim.

'''''Det Nødvendige Seminarium'' (DNS)''' ({{lang-en|The Necessary Teacher Training College}}) is a private teacher training college located in [[Denmark]]. DNS was founded in Denmark in 1972 and has since educated hundreds of teachers now working all over the world in jobs concerned with constant improvement of [[alternative education]] for children, youngsters and adults.

DNS is integrated part of the [[Tvind|School Center Tvind]], and since 2011 DNS is in cooperation with [[One World University]] (OWU) in [[Mozambique]], which opened opportunity of three year alternative [[distance education|distance learning]] program offering a degree of [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] of [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Windisch|first=S|title=One World University and DNS|url=http://www.dns-tvind.dk/cooperation-of-dns-owu/a-substantial-discription-of-dns/cooperation-of-dns-owu|publisher=DNS The Necessary Teacher Training College|accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college is private, and the students are self-financed within the framework of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brendt|first=A|title=What Does Saving Up Mean?|url=http://www.dns-tvind.dk/what-does-saving-up-mean/the-economy-of-dns/what-does-saving-up-mean|work=DNS Newsletter|publisher=DNS The Necessary Teacher Training College|accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is half practical - half theoretical with a [[learning by doing]] approach.

== The Idea And Educational Principals ==
DNS The Necessary Teacher Training program is made for a person to become a human being in its own rights – not defined by a job or a salary, but by humanity, personal values and skills, as well as abilities to live and work together with others and to bring necessary changes to the community. One of the methods of teaching such skills is by principal 'common meetings governs the school'.

DNS educates a student to become a teacher. Obtained teaching skills in a future work with other people enables to explain many complex phenomena of the world. It will be possible to teach social sciences, history, natural sciences, and other subjects, and share many real world experiences, emotions and attitudes.

A teacher plays an important role in society – especially in a society where more and more people – parents and children –  are marginalized and discriminated, and have become poor – not only in material values, but indeed in lack of contemporary care and attention in school and lack of opportunities. The big task of the teacher is to prevent alienation and create a human culture by building bridges between all kinds of people.

== Outline of three year program ==

=== Year 1 – The International Practice Field ===
2 months in Denmark preparing for a 4-month study travel through West Africa; and 3 months of elaboration and information work for people in Europe; 3 months bringing it to the public where the teams bring all they learned about people's life in West Africa to the people in Europe and 3 months saving up to earn money for the expenses of the second year of the education.

=== Year 2 – The European Practice Field ===
6 months training in experiencing and understanding the national reality by seeking employment in factories and other workplaces. Living, studying,working and organizing cultural events in a bigger European city; 3 months studies and exams at the school  and 3 months “Doing what you find most appropriate to do”.

=== Year 3 – The School Practice Field ===
8 months training, working, and understanding the reality of children and teachers by seeking employment in a European school; 4 months at the college studying; 4 months at the college studying and taking the last exams.

== Eligibility ==
In DNS college can enroll students holding EU passports.
The teaching language is English. However, first year students do not need to be fluent in English, but able to communicate and study in English.

== Funding Source ==
The 3-year education includes  working and saving up periods, where the students can earn their basic living expenses and school fees.

The expenses for the 1st Year have to be saved up before the program starts. It includes school fees, the basic living costs like food, accommodation, pocket money, and the costs of the study travel to Africa. Some students can earn all the money in their home countries or somewhere else and just arrive when the program starts. Others earn at least part of the money by themselves and, if they have no possibility of raising the full amount alone, they can apply to join DNS’ ''saving-up group'', where they seek all kinds of jobs together to raise the funds in a common effort, while building up their team. Since 2012 DNS have offered a 1-year saving up period starting August 1 for a limited number of students.

I don’t think the exhibition design is satisfactory at all - it seems to be [more] visual effect than scholarly effort.

[[File:Students fighting homophobia (323289114).jpg|thumb|German students demonstrating fighting homophobia]]
In the recent history of the expansion of [[LGBT rights]], the issue of teaching various aspects of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender life and existence to younger children has become a heated point of debate, with proponents stating that the teaching of LGBT-affirming topics to children will increase a sense of visibility for LGBT students and reduce incidences of [[homophobia]] or [[closeted]] behavior for children, while opponents to the pedagogical discussion of LGBT people to students are afraid that such discussions would encourage children to violate or question [[LGBT and religion topics|religiously]]  or ideologically motivated rejections of non-heterosexuality in private settings (or promote a "[[homosexual agenda]]"). Much of the religious and/or social conservative aversion to non-heterosexuality and the broaching of the topic to juveniles tends to occur in regions with a historic demographic dominance or majority of adherents to an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religion]], particularly the majority of denominations of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], while those who were raised in those religions but advocate or take more favorable/nuanced positions on LGBT issues or are LGBT themselves may often be ostracized from more socially conservative congregations over the issue.

==By issue==

===Organization of students===
{{main article|Gay–straight alliance|LGBT student movement}}
[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|The pride flag, news articles, and flyers for social events on this high school bulletin board represent the diverse support and advocacy purposes that GSAs serve.]]
The primary type of organization for representation of LGBT students on campus is the gay–straight alliance. These are organized in order to represent requests by LGBT and straight ally students on campus to the administration and faculty and encourage a safer environment for students.

===Counseling===
{{main article|LGBT student center}}
LGBT student centers may be organized as offices of the school's administration that offer paid faculty support to students. They not only support the LGBT community but they promote positivity and equality for their students. Resources are also usually given for any kind of information needed. The center heavily enforces others to be respectful and mindful of one's sexual orientation, pronouns, preferences etc. LGBT student centers are in a way, safe zones for people to not feel judged or criticized. They create an awareness that completely shuts out negatively but welcomes anyone in.

=== Homophobia vs. heterosexism ===
[[Homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]] are closely related words, used to represent a fear of equality of the heterosexual population and the LGBT community. Homophobia, for example, is defined by "overt expression of dislike, [[harassment]] and even [[assault]]" towards the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=LGBTQ Youth &amp;Education|last=Mayo|first=Cris|publisher=Teacher College Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8077-5489-4|location=New York|pages=51|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexuality, on the other hand, describes a sense of entitlement  to denounce the superiority of heterosexuality and the need for heterosexuality to be the only sexual orientation. However, homophobia and heterosexism are intermingling, pertaining to the ability to proclaim heterosexuality as "normal" and therefore, homophobia as "abnormal" and "different".  Homophobia can also be used to reinforce heterosexism in an institution such as in education as [[curriculum]] in schools are based on a heterosexual perspective which increases the need for others to conform to heterosexuality and therefore ignore homophobic acts and comments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Prevention of bullying===
{{main article|Anti-LGBT bullying|Safe-space}}
The issue of homophobic bullying and violence by students and teachers is increasingly broached by advocates as a reason for the intervention of administration on behalf of LGBT students.

A restorative approach in schools is a way of preventing bullying of LGBT students. Planning committees can be formed by students who want to help educate their peers on LGBT.  A restorative response that helped educate students and school staff included a Lesbian and Gay Pride week at an elementary school in Canada in the late 1990s. A student-planned unit on Lesbian and Gay Pride week was composed of a series of events dedicated to educate on LGBT history, diverse family structures, and included guest speakers. Restorative responses help provide welcoming, safe, and equitable environments.&lt;ref&gt;Surviving the Pain and Widening the Circle: Celebrating Lesbian and Gay Pride Week in an Elementary Classroom, by John J. Guiney Yallop&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching LGBT history and social sciences===
The inclusion of LGBT topics in teaching of history and social sciences are also advocated by topics in order to increase pride and self-respect among LGBT students and reduce shame or self-pity for the lack of emphasis upon famous LGBT persons.  Sex education.   With regards to the topic, it is somewhat important to acknowledge what it is like to be labeled as LGBT. Often people use words that may relate to the LGBT community with a negative annotation. For example, phrases like "that's so gay" or "you are being a faggot", suggest that being gay is a "bad" thing. The more we allow this kind of communication, it will only continue to be a criticized expression. To some it comes as a relief and sense of empowerment, but others have to deal with the stigma which is attached to LGBT.  The common stereotypes of queer include, but are not limited to: sexually confused, pedophiles, and violation of gender roles.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Stereotypes help to create the stigma which is cast upon the LGBT community, which in turn results in the marginalization of the group. Labeling can effect others attitudes towards the individual being labeled. The labeling perspective also focuses on the roles of moral entrepreneurs, rule creators and enforcers. These are individuals who create rules and enforce them.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

====Sex education====
{{main article|LGBT sex education}}

As general [[sex education]] often faces fierce opposition from religious congregations which are doctrinally averse to contraception, sex education which includes homosexuality is considered especially egregious among opponents. The matter of sex education often leads more devout Abrahamists to withdraw their children from the school's tutelage, leading to further educational terms which emphasize Abrahamic religious mores, such as [[abstinence]], heterosexuality and [[monogamy]]. This aversion is criticized by advocates of sex education who assert that many of the pupils of such education eventually find their own means to those practices or realizations which are expressly forbidden by religious institutions.

As well, sexual education [[curriculum]]s continuously fails to inform LGBTQ students on crucial health issues that may arise during sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=LGBTQ Youth &amp; Education|last=Mayo|first=Cris|publisher=Teachers College|year=2014|isbn=978-0-80775489-4|location=New York|pages=75|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the neglected information reflects on [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases|sexually transmitted diseases]], such as [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], which are commonly enforced upon the gay community through socially accepted stereotypes. Sex ed curriculum also disregards any information pivotal to LGBTQ students in order for schools to avoid tensions with religious groups. Like wise, most of the material presented in schools focus on a heterosexual perspective that encourages "abstinence until marriage",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=96920856{{Full citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a typical practice accredited to various religious groups that promote the need of heterosexuality for a healthy sexual life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Formal event dress and gender identity===
Where schools may hold formal engagements such as [[prom]]s, [[homecoming]]s and [[Winter Formal]]s which typically involve set gender roles, issues have arisen with the following:
* attendance of same-sex student couples
* the wearing of non-gender-conforming dress (i.e., female students wearing tuxedos and male students wearing skirts or blouses)
* the crowning of female event kings and male event queens.

Various jurisdictions have taken different reactions to such issues, which have resulted in controversy and legal disputes over discrimination by state schools (i.e., the [[2010 Itawamba County School District prom controversy]]).

===Queer-inclusive student events===
Campus events have been created for LGBTQ students in order to be inclusive of such students and their allies. These include the [[Anti-prom#Queer proms|queer prom]] and the [[Lavender Graduation]]; the latter was first organized by Dr. Ronni Sanlo, then the director of the LGBT Center at the University of Michigan, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sait.usc.edu/lgbt/lavender/history.html |title=Lavender CC - LGBT |publisher=Sait.usc.edu |date=1995-05-09 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education sector responses to LGBT violence ==
{{main article|Education sector responses to LGBT violence}}

[[Education#Education sector|Education sector]] responses to [[Violence against LGBT people|LGBT violence]] addresses the ways in which education systems work to create safe learning environments for LGTB students. Overall, education sector responses tend to focus on homophobia and violence linked to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, and less on [[transphobia]]. Most responses focus in some way on diverse expressions of gender and support students to understand that gender may be expressed in a different way from [[Gender role|binary models]] (of masculine and feminine). Responses vary greatly in their scope (from a single class to the national level); duration (from one-off events to several years); and level of support that they enjoy (from individual teachers to the highest levels of government).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==By region==

===United States===
Historic legal denigration of non-heterosexuality and non-vaginal sexual intercourse (even among heterosexual partners) continues to have a long-running residual effect on the public discourse.  The first [[gay–straight alliance]]s to be established in public schools in the early 1990s faced stiff opposition from faculty, administration and parents of students, with protests and fierce debates over the matter, but GSAs have since been established for [[middle school]] students in a number of jurisdictions.

In California, GSAs now number over 762, representing over 50% of California's public high schools. In 2011, the State Legislature passed the [[FAIR Education Act]], which, if signed into law, would make California the first state in the United States to mandate the teaching of LGBT-affirmative social sciences (i.e., [[LGBT history]]) in the public school system and forbid discriminatory language in the school curriculum.

One of the pre-eminent organizations advocating for LGBT education and academic rights in the United States is [[GLSEN]].

===Canada===
In 2016 a report titled "The National Inventory of School District Interventions in Support of LGBTQ Student Wellbeing" was issued by Lead Investigator Dr. Catherine Taylor, [[University of Winnipeg]] and her research team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Catherine|last2=Peter|first2=Tracey|last3=Edkins|first3=Tamara|last4=Campbell|first4=Christopher|last5=Emond|first5=Gilbert|last6=Saewyc|first6=Elizabeth|title=The National Inventory of School District Interventions  in Support of LGBTQ Student Wellbeing|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10680/1267|website=WinnSpace|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The report, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, outlines the interventions taken by Canadian public schools in support of LGBTQ students. Findings presented in the report include acknowledgements that urban schools districts are more likely to have LGBTQ-specific interventions than rural districts and that, in general, Alberta and Quebec are less likely than other Canadian provinces to have specific interventions. Interestingly, the report also found that interventions were more likely to occur at the elementary and middle school level than the secondary level.

Also, it should be noted that throughout Canada, school districts were far less likely to have trans-specific policies.

=== Europe ===
The Recommendation to member states on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity was adopted unanimously by the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] in 2010. It advises the education sectors of the 47 member states to take measures ‘at all levels to promote mutual tolerance and respect in schools, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity’. It specifies that this should include ‘providing objective information with respect to sexual orientation and gender identity, for instance in school curricula and educational materials, and providing pupils and students with the necessary information, protection and support to enable them to live in accordance with their sexual orientation and gender identity’. The recommendation further advises countries to ‘design and implement school equality and safety policies and action plans and may ensure access to adequate anti-discrimination training or support and teaching aids’.&lt;ref&gt;CoE, ‘Committee of Ministers Recommendation CM/Rec (2010)5 on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity’, 2010. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1606669&lt;/nowiki&gt;. [Accessed: 15-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=54, 59, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Social Charter guarantees the right to the protection of health, including through the provision of advisory and educational facilities.&lt;ref&gt;CoE, ‘European Social Charter’, 1996. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://conventions.coe.int/&lt;/nowiki&gt; Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/163.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; This positive obligation ‘extends to ensuring that educational materials do not reinforce demeaning stereotypes and perpetuate forms of prejudice which contribute to the social exclusion, embedded discrimination and denial of human dignity often experienced by historically marginalized groups such as persons of non-heterosexual orientation.’&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the [[Safe Schools Coalition Australia|Safe Schools Coalition’s]] approach actively supports the establishment of [[Gay–straight alliance|Gay Straight Alliances]] (GSAs) and other youth-led initiatives for peer support and information. It also provides professional development for teachers and other school staff that can be tailored to schools’ specific needs. It has developed guidelines on non-discrimination, bullying and diversity policies and a broad set of resources, including books and videos.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SSC, ‘Safe Schools Coalition’, 2015. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.safeschoolscoalition&lt;/nowiki&gt;. org.au/. [Accessed: 09-Oct-2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global frameworks ===
Several international [[human rights]] mechanisms mandate safe, accepting and supportive learning environments that are free from violence and discrimination for all students. Together, these frameworks support a rights-based response to violence in schools – one that can be applied to addressing homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The [[right to education]] is recognized under: Article 26 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948); the UNESCO [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] (1960); Article 13 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (1966); Article 10 of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (1981); and Article 28 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the world. The original text, adopted in 1989, did not refer directly to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. However, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has specified how the Convention can be used to protect children who are perceived to not conform to gender norms, including LGBTI children. This is particularly through the Committee’s General Comments, which interpret the content of the human rights provisions. For example, in 2003, the Committee clarified in General Comment (GC #4), Paragraph 6, that ‘States parties have the obligation to ensure that all human beings below 18 enjoy all the rights set forth in the Convention without discrimination (art. 2) [...] These grounds also cover adolescents’ sexual orientation’.&lt;ref&gt;CRC, ‘Adolescent Health and Development in the Context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child: General Comment no.4’, 2003. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/Health/GC4.pdf. [Accessed: 12-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt; This, therefore, recognized that the universal rights described by the Convention apply also to children who are lesbian, gay or bisexual, or perceived as such.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Subsequently, the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child|UN Committee on the Rights of the Child]] made concluding observations to several State Parties (which can be considered as jurisprudence). It also issued additional General Comments related to the protection of the rights of LGBT children using the following three articles of the Convention:
* Article 2: The right to non-discrimination. 
* Article 19: The right to be protected against any form of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse.
* Article 24: The right of the Child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cornu, ‘Preventing and addressing homophobic and transphobic bullying in education: A human rights-based approach using the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child’, Journal of LGBT Youth, Volume 13, Issue 1-2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
Several past and current international development agendas also mandate learning environments that are safe and inclusive for all students and guarantee their well-being, specifying or implying that educational institutions should be free from violence.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A '''flipped classroom''' is an instructional strategy and a type of [[blended learning]] that reverses the traditional [[learning environment]] by delivering instructional content, often online, outside of the classroom.  It moves activities, including those that may have traditionally been considered homework, into the classroom. In a flipped classroom, students watch [[online lecture]]s, collaborate in online discussions, or carry out research at home while engaging in concepts in the classroom with the guidance of a mentor.

In the traditional model of classroom instruction, the teacher is typically the central focus of a lesson and the primary disseminator of information during the class period. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Student engagement in the traditional model may be limited to activities in which students work independently or in small groups on an application task designed by the teacher. Class discussions are typically centered on the teacher, who controls the flow of the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, D., &amp; Sanders, J. (1980). Humanistic versus traditional teaching styles and student satisfaction. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 20(87), 87-90&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Valerie|title=The flip: Turning a classroom upside down|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/the-flip-turning-a-classroom-upside-down/2012/06/03/gJQAYk55BV_story.html|work=Washington Post|date=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flipped classroom intentionally shifts instruction to a learner-centered model in which class time explores topics in greater depth and creates meaningful learning opportunities, while [[educational technology|educational technologies]] such as online videos are used to 'deliver content' outside of the classroom. In a flipped classroom, 'content delivery' may take a variety of forms. Often, video lessons prepared by the teacher or third parties are used to deliver content, although online collaborative discussions, digital research, and text readings may be used. It has been shown that the ideal length of the video lesson to be is eight to twelve minutes.&lt;ref name="Abeysekera, Lakmal 2015"&gt;Abeysekera, Lakmal, and Phillip Dawson (2015). "Motivation and cognitive load in the flipped classroom: definition, rationale and a call for research." Higher Education Research &amp; Development 34(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marco Ronchetti (June 2010), "[http://www.learntechlib.org/d/44898 Using video lectures to make teaching more interactive", International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Topp (6 Oct 2011), "Flipped classrooms take advantage of technology", USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

Flipped classrooms also redefine in-class activities. In-class lessons accompanying flipped classroom may include activity learning or more traditional homework problems, among other practices, to engage students in the content. Class activities vary but may include: using [[Manipulative (mathematics education)|math manipulatives]] and emerging mathematical technologies, in-depth laboratory experiments, original document analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice&lt;ref name="Bergmann, J. 2012"&gt;Bergmann, J., &amp; Sams, A.

(2013). [http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-manifest-823.php "The flipped classroom manifest"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A teacher's interaction with students in a flipped classroom can be more personalized and less didactic, and students are actively involved in knowledge acquisition and construction as they participate in and evaluate their learning.&lt;ref name="Abeysekera, Lakmal 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, B. (2011). "Flipping the classroom: Homework in class, lessons at home".

== History ==
In 1993, Alison King published "From Sage on the Stage to Guide on the Side," in which she focuses on the importance of the use of class time for the construction of meaning rather than information transmission. While not directly illustrating the concept of "flipping" a classroom, King's work is often cited as an impetus for an inversion to allow for the educational space for active learning.&lt;ref&gt;King, Alison. "From sage on the stage to guide on the side." ''College teaching'' '''41''' 1: 30–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor [[Eric Mazur]] played a significant role in the development of concepts influencing flipped teaching through the development of an instructional strategy he called [[peer instruction]]. Mazur published a book in 1997 outlining the strategy, entitled ''Peer Instruction: A User's Manual''. He found that his approach, which moved information transfer out of the classroom and information assimilation into the classroom, allowed him to coach students in their learning instead of lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Mazur (1997). ''Peer Instruction: A User's Manual Series in Educational Innovation''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Crouch &amp; E. Mazur (2001). Peer Instruction: Ten Years of Experience and Results, Am. J. Phys., v69, 970-977&lt;/ref&gt;

Lage, Platt and Treglia published a paper entitled "Inverting the Classroom: A Gateway to Creating an Inclusive Learning Environment" (2000), which discusses their research on flipped classrooms at the college level. In their research focusing on two college economics courses, Lage, Platt, and Treglia assert that one can leverage the class time that becomes available from the inversion of the classroom (moving information presentation via lecture out of the classroom to media such as computers or VCRs) to meet the needs of students with a wide variety of learning styles.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Lage, Glenn Platt, Michael Treglia (2000), Inverting the Classroom: A gateway to Creating an Inclusive Learning Environment, Journal of Economic Education&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Wisconsin-Madison deployed software to replace lectures in large lecture-based computer science course with streaming video of the lecturer and coordinated slides.&lt;ref&gt;Foertsch, Julie, et al. "Reversing the Lecture/Homework Paradigm Using eTEACH® Web‐based Streaming Video Software." Journal of Engineering Education 91.3 (2002): 267-274.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, J. Wesley Baker was experimenting with these same ideas at [[Cedarville University]].  He presented a paper discussing what he termed the "classroom flip" at an education conference in the year 2000 in what may be the first published mention of the word "flip" associated with this model of teaching and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J.W. "The 'Classroom Flip": Using Web course management tools to become the Guide by the Side." In J. A. Chambers (Ed.), Selected papers from the 11th International Conference on College Teaching and Learning (2000), pp. 9-17. Jacksonville, FL: Florida Community College at Jacksonville.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaw and Hess published a paper in 2007 to compare the effectiveness of 4 instructional modalities for a single topic of a STEM course -(i) traditional lecture, (ii) blended (what they called "Web-enhanced lecture"), (iii) Web-based self-study and (iv) flipped (what they called "Web-based self-study and classroom discussion").  Statistical analysis of the assessment data indicated that the second modality, in which Web-based modules for instruction were used during face-to-face lecture delivery mode, resulted in higher levels of student performance and satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Perhaps the most recognizable contributor to the flipped classroom is [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]]. In 2004, Khan began recording videos at the request of a younger cousin he was tutoring because she felt that recorded lessons would let her skip segments she had mastered and replay parts that were troubling her.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Thompson (15 Jul 2011), "How Khan Academy is Changing the Rules of Education", Wired&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah D. Sparks (28 Sep 2011), Lectures Are Homework in Schools Following Khan Academy Lead)&lt;/ref&gt; Salman Khan founded [[Khan Academy]] based on this model. For some, Khan Academy has become synonymous with the flipped classroom; however, these videos are only one form of the flipped classroom strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Sams, Aaron (11 November 2011).

=== In practice ===
Woodland Park High School chemistry teachers Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams began practising flipped teaching at the high school level when, in 2007, they recorded their lectures and posted them online in order to accommodate students who missed their classes.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, J. 2012"/&gt; They note that one person cannot be credited with having invented the inverted or flipped classroom, and assert that there is no one 'right' way to flip a classroom as approaches and teaching styles are diverse, as are needs of schools.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, J. 2012"/&gt; They went on to develop the "Flipped-Mastery" model and wrote extensively about it in their book Flip Your Classroom.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, J. 2012" /&gt;

In 2011 educators in Michigan's [[Clintondale High School]] flipped every classroom.{{Citation needed|reason=Claim needs to be sourced|date=February 2018}} Principal Greg Green led an effort to help teachers develop plans for flipped classrooms, and worked with social studies teacher, Andy Scheel, to run two classes with identical material and assignments, one flipped and one conventional. The flipped class had many students who had already failed the class—some multiple times. After 20 weeks, students in the flipped classroom were outperforming students in the traditional classrooms.{{Citation needed|reason=Statement is vague|date=February 2018}} Further, no students in the flipped classrooms scored lower than a C+, while the previous semester 13 percent had failed. The traditional classroom showed no change.&lt;ref name=fixes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/turning-education-upside-down/?_r=0 |title=Turning Education Upside Down |last=Rosenberg |first=Tina |date=2013-10-09 |accessdate=2013-10-11 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, Clintondale had been designated as among the state's worst 5 percent. The next year when teachers used a flipped model in the 9th grade, the failure rates in English, math, science, and social studies dropped significantly, with the now-flipped school's failure rate dropping from 30 to 10 percent in 2011. Results on standardized tests went up in 2012, but then dropped however.&lt;ref name=fixes/&gt;

While flipped classroom have been found effective in secondary schools,{{Citation needed|reason=Unsubstantiated assertion|date=February 2018}} flipped methods may also be effective in improving student learning at the community college level. The flipped classroom model allows faculty to engage students in innovative ways, both inside and outside the classroom, and to employ a range of modern teaching tools and approaches. This may be effective in diverse classroom environments with students who have different learning preferences.{{clarify|Do you mean "learning style"?

Proponents of flipped classrooms in higher education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2014/02/flipped_classrooms_in_college_lectures_online_and_problem_sets_in_the_classroom.html|title=The Flipped Classroom|last=Schuman|first=Rebecca|date=2014-02-19|work=Slate|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; have had an interest in seeing this put into practice in university classrooms. Professors at the [[University of Graz]] conducted a study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Luttenberger |first=Silke |last2=Macher |first2=Daniel |last3=Maidl |first3=Verena |last4=Rominger |first4=Christian |last5=Aydin |first5=Nilüfer|last6=Paechter|first6=Manuela|date=2018-01-01|title=Different patterns of university students’ integration of lecture podcasts, learning materials, and lecture attendance in a psychology course |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-017-9592-3|journal=Education and Information Technologies |language=en |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=165–178|doi=10.1007/s10639-017-9592-3|issn=1360-2357}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which lectures were video recorded in a manner in which students could have access to them throughout the semester of a lecture-based course on educational psychology. The professors surveyed how the students used their educational tools: attending lectures and watching or rewatching videos. Students subsequently rated (on a scale of 1=none to 6=nearly all) how often they used these materials. The majority of students (68.1%) relied on watching the podcasts but had low attendance rates compared to their podcast usage. The remainder of the students either rarely watched podcasts (19.6%) or somewhat used the podcasts (12.3%), but both had similar lecture attendance. Students that watched the videos more than their peers performed better than those who chose otherwise.

On June 27, 2016, [[Jonathan Bergmann]], one of the originators of flipped learning, launched the Flipped Learning Global Initiative, led by Errol St.Clair Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flipped Learning Global Initiative|url=http://flglobal.org/about/|website=The Flipped Learning Global Initiative|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2018 the Flipped Learning Global Initiative introduced its International Faculty, created to deliver a consistent standard of training and ongoing support to schools and school systems around the world.

==Flipped mastery==
In traditional schools, each topic in class receives a fixed amount of time for all students. Flipped mastery classrooms apply a [[mastery learning]] model that requires each student to master a topic before moving to the next one.&lt;ref name=nyt102313&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/in-flipped-classrooms-a-method-for-mastery |publisher=New York Times |date=October 23, 2013 |title= In 'Flipped' Classrooms, a Method for Mastery |first=Tina |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mastery learning was briefly popular in the 1920s, and was revived by [[Benjamin Bloom]] in 1968. While it is difficult to implement in large, traditional classrooms, it has shown dramatic success in improving student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_197911_brandt2.pdf |title=Brandt 79 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.unicamp.br/%7Ewainer/cursos/2s2004/impactos2004/kulik90.pdf |title=Kulik 90 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mastery model allows teachers to provide the materials, tools and support for learning while students set goals and manage their time.&lt;ref name=nyt102313/&gt;

Mastery rewards students for displaying competence. Students who initially turn in shoddy work must correct it before moving on. Before flipping, mastery learning was impractical in most schools. It was not possible to give different lectures for different groups of students. Testing was also impractical, because fast-learning students could reveal the test to those who followed.&lt;ref name=nyt102313/&gt;

In a flipped mastery classroom, students view each lecture and work on each exercise or project when they have mastered the precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergmann |first1=Jon |first2=Aaron |last2=Sams |title=Flip Your Classroom: Reach Every Student in Every Class Every Day |url={{google books|id=nBi2pwAACAAJ|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=978-1564843159|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Kelly, winner of the Presidential Award for Mathematics and Science Teaching, adopted flipped mastery with his colleagues Corey Sullivan and Mike Brust. Sullivan estimated that 40 to 60 hours of work outside school for each of 12 units per course were required the first year. Another Presidential Award winner, Spencer Bean, converted after his daughter went through Kelly's class.&lt;ref name=nyt102313/&gt;

Flipped mastery eliminates two other out-of-class routines: daily lesson planning and grading papers. The latter happens in class and in person. Replacing lectures with group and individual activities increases in-class activity. Every student has something to do throughout the class. In some classes, students choose how to demonstrate mastery—testing, writing, speaking, debating and even designing a related game. [[Learning Management Systems]] such as [[Moodle]] or [[ILIAS]] provide ways to manage the testing process. They create a different test for each student from a pool of questions. Advocates claim that its efficiency allows most students to do a year's work in much less time. Advanced students work on independent projects while slower learners get more personalized instruction. Some students might not get through the year's material, but demonstrated competence on the parts they did complete.&lt;ref name=nyt102313/&gt;

== Student perception ==
Students may be more likely to favor the Flipped Classroom approach once they have taken the time to personally participate in this specific type of learning course. In a prior pharmaceutics course, for instance, a mere 34.6% of the 19 students initially preferred the Flipped Classroom setting. After all of the students had participated in the Pharmaceutical Flipped Classroom course, the number of those favoring this method of learning increased significantly, reaching a total of 89.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLaughlin |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Griffin |first2=LaToya |last3=Esserman |first3=Denise |last4=Davidson |first4=Christopher |last5=Glatt |first5=Dylan |last6=Roth |first6=Mary |last7=Gharkholonarehe |first7=Nastaran |last8=Mumper |first8=Russell |title=Pharmacy Student Engagement, Performance, and Perception in a Flipped Satellite Classroom |journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education |date=12 November 2013 |volume=77 |issue=9 |page=196 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3831407/ |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals interested in a more problem-solving, hands-on form of learning are more likely to benefit from Flipped Classroom, as it sways from a traditional lecture learning style. Students may initially have certain doubts or fears regarding the use of Flipped Classroom, including:

*The fear of having to "teach oneself", as in, having a lack of proper guidance from a designated instructor, leading to greater pressure on the student to study the content rigorously in order to perform well in the course&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rotellar PharmD, Cristina, Cain EdD, MS, Jeff|first=|date=25 Mar 2016|title=Research, Perspectives, and Recommendations on Implementing the Flipped Classroom|pmc=4827585|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume=80|issue=2|pages=34|doi=10.5688/ajpe80234|pmid=27073287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Obtaining a greater amount of academic work in order to achieve success within the course, as a result of minimal guidance from an instructor&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
*The fear of obtaining a greater sense of confusion on topics discussed, which may correlate to the heavy focus on group discussion and problem-solving activities that Flipped Classroom encourages&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Flipped Classroom is composed of various components, such as (this information only represents a few examples):

#video collections&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mo, Jun, Mao, Chunmei|first=|date=2017|title=An Empirical Study on the Effectiveness of College English Reading Classroom Teaching in the Flipped Classroom Paradigm|url=http://revistadelafacultaddeingenieria.com/index.php/ingenieria/article/viewFile/2165/2125|journal=Revista de la Facultad de Ingeniería U.C.V.|volume=32|pages=632–639|via=PKP}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#powerpoints&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;
#student discussion&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;
#teacher/student online communication&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

It has been determined, through several conducted experiments, that certain aspects of the Flipped Classroom approach are more beneficial to students than others. For instance, in a study conducted on the feedback received from students who had participated in a Flipped Classroom teaching module for college English reading, the following results were derived:

*92.59% of the students ultimately accepted the Flipped Classroom teaching module in general&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;
*59.26% of the students accepted the "video form" of the teaching module, essentially provided as a resource for the course&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;
*100.00% of the students believed that the "learning guide" link provided in the teaching module was necessary for performing well in the course&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

From these specific statistics, it can be determined that students felt that their experience within the Flipped Classroom was greatly benefitted by certain aspects of the course (such as the learning guide provided), while other portions of the module may have been unnecessary or insignificant to their learning (such as the video form of the module).&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
There are various benefits attributed to the idea of utilizing the Flipped Classroom approach, some including:

#A college reading empirical study identifies Flipped Classroom's approach at including all forms of learning (i.e. oral, visual, listening, hands on, problem solving, etc.).&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;
#Rather than learning in a traditional classroom setting, Flipped Classroom uses a more application-based approach for students (i.e. hands on and problem solving activities).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharma, Neel, Lau, C.S, Doherty, Iain, Harbutt, Darren|first=|date=April 2015|title=How we flipped the medical classroom|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=101471602&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Medical Teacher|volume=37|pages=327–330|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glynn|first=James|date=July 2013|title=The Effects of a Flipped Classroom on Achievement and Student Attitudes in Secondary Chemistry|url=https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/2882/GlynnJ0813.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=Montana State University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The accessibility of Flipped Classroom is extremely convenient, especially for students that would face difficulties in traveling to the physical classroom. Such students would still have the foundational information of the course at hand via online.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kettle|first=Maria|date=2013|title=Flipped Physics|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9120/48/5/593/pdf|journal=Physics Education|volume=48|issue=5|pages=593–596|via=EBSCO|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/48/5/593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Communication is greatly emphasized in a Flipped Classroom setting, essentially referring to: student-student and student-teacher interactions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aşıksoy G., Özdamlı F.|first=|date=June 2016|title=Flipped Classroom adapted to the ARCS Model of Motivation and applied to a Physics Course|url=http://www.ejmste.com/Flipped-Classroom-adapted-to-the-ARCS-Model-of-Motivation-and-applied-to-a-Physics-Course,61041,0,2.html|journal=Eurasia Journal of Mathematics|volume=12|pages=1589–1603|via=EJMSTE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Flipped Classroom utilizes a student-centered teaching modeled in order to ensure that the course is primarily aimed at contributing to the student's overall success in obtaining a proper, effective education.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Essentially avoids the overarching idea of "cramming" for exams and forgetting the information post-examination, as it encourages students to understand the underlying rationale behind the information provided being provided to them.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students must account for the responsibilities given to them in regards to learning the foundational information provided, as their personal work and contribution will be reflected in the grade that they receive at the end of the course. This will, in turn, make them better prepared for future, more difficult courses.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

==Limitations and criticisms==
Critics argue the flipped classroom model has some consequences for both students and teachers.

For students, there exists a '[[digital divide]]'. Not all families are from the same socio-economic background, and thus access to computers or video-viewing technology outside of the school environment is not possible for all students. This model of instruction may put undue pressure on some families as they attempt to gain access to videos outside of school hours&lt;ref name="theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca"&gt;Nielsen, L. (2012). [http://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca/2011/10/five-reasons-im-not-flipping-over.html "Five reasons I'm not flipping over the flipped classroom"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some students may struggle due to their developing personal responsibility. In a self-directed, home learning environment students who are not at the developmental stage required to keep on-task with independent learning may fall rapidly behind their peers&lt;ref name="theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, J. F. (2012). How learning in an inverted classroom influences cooperation, innovation and task orientation. Learning Environments Research, 15(2), 171-193. doi:10.1007/s10984-012-9108-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lents, N., &amp; Cifuentes, O. (2009). "Web-based learning enhancements: Video lectures through voice-over PowerPoint in a Majors-level Biology course". ''Journal of College Science Teaching'', '''39''' (2): 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the flipped classroom leads to increased computer time in an era where adolescents already spend too much time in front of computer screens. Inverted models that rely on computerized videos do contribute to this challenge, particularly if videos are long.&lt;ref name="theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca"/&gt;

Additionally, flipped classrooms that rely on videos to deliver instruction suffer some of the same challenges as traditional classrooms. Students may not learn best by listening to a lecture, and watching instructional videos at home is still representative of a more traditional form of teaching. Critics argue a constructivist approach would be more beneficial.&lt;ref name="theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca"/&gt;

Teachers may find challenges with this model as well. Increased preparation time is initially likely needed, as creating high quality videos requires teachers to contribute significant time and effort outside of regular teaching responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, J. 2012"/&gt; Additional funding may also be required to procure training for teachers to navigate computer technologies involved in the successful implementation of the inverted model.&lt;ref name="edweek.org"/&gt;

The potential performance increase from flipped classrooms has been limited in some cases due to teacher and student unfamiliarity with the classroom setup. Some students do not completely understand the rationale behind the flipped classroom. Also, some students are unfamiliar with the arrangement of this education technique. Both of these things can affect the efficacy of the flipped classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lo|first=Chung|date=2017|title=A critical review of flipped classroom challenges in K-12 education: possible solutions and recommendations for future research|url=|journal=Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

*[[Medicine|Medical]] Classroom: In multiple classrooms, short videos about the current medical topic, [[rheumatology]], that was being taught in the class were created and uploaded to [[YouTube|youtube]] or emailed to students for a medical class. The students were to watch the videos before attending [[lecture]]. The lecture class was then used to focus on application of the material learned in the videos through [[Case study|case studies]] and activities in order to give students a more interactive type of learning in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In order to enforce the use of videos for pre-lecture, students were asked to take a quiz or complete a homework assignment and turn it in before class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fatima|first=Syeda Sadia|date=December 2017|title=Flipped classroom instructional approach in undergraduate medical education|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=126921908&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences|volume=33 |issue=6|pages=1424–1428|via=EBSCO|pmid=29492071|pmc=5768837}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*College English Reading: The flipped classroom method of teaching was implemented in an English reading course{{Where|date=September 2018}} for 16 weeks per semester. Teaching through audio outside of the classroom was utilized through videos paired with information slides. Online resources were also supplied. The videos supplemented the readings and allowed for more analysis and participation in class, and they included background knowledge of the subject and analytical questions to be discussed in class.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; A study-guide was provided for each video so that students could come prepared to class. Some classes included software that combined all of the resources accessible by students for the material that was assigned outside of the class period. The software also included small tests in order to assess a student's understanding of video material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou, Shutao, Zhang, Tao|first=|date=2017|title=Research on the Construction of Flipped Classroom Model for English Teaching Based on SPOC|url=https://library.gwu.edu/search-all?query=Research%20on%20the%20Construction%20of%20Flipped%20Classroom%20Model%20for%20English%20Teaching%20Based%20on%20SPOC|journal=Revista de la Facultad de Ingeniería U.C.V.|volume=32|pages=267–273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Physics]]: In one instance, the flipped classroom technique was implemented in a physics classroom{{Where|date=September 2018}}. The pre-Lecture videos were not made specifically by the teacher, but instead they were downloaded from other databases like Ted, [[YouTube|Youtube]], and Khan Academy. Before class, students were supposed to watch the video lecture, take a quiz, and write down any questions they had. During class, the information in the videos was applied to questions through group discussion activities and hands-on simulations. Students were also encouraged to attend other public lectures about soil physics to gain more information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radcliffe, David, Knappenberger, Thorsten, Daigh, Aaron L. M.|first=David|date=Oct 2016|title=Using Khan Academy Videos in Flipped Classroom Mode to Bolster Calculus Skills in Soil Physics Courses|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/nse/abstracts/45/1/nse2016.04.0008|journal=Natural Sciences Education|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;
*[[Chemistry]]: In a chemistry class{{Where|date=September 2018}}, pre-lecture materials were distributed through [[Moodle]] and [[YouTube|Youtube]]. In class, students independently completed problems while the professor acted as a guide in case anyone needed assistance. Along with practice problems, labs were also completed during regular class time, and workshops about choosing the appropriate approach, order and technique were implemented. Study materials for tests were administered through the videos in order to prepare students for assessments. In the chemistry setting, only certain topics were flipped. For example, the flipped classroom technique was implemented for [[chromatography]] and [[electrophoresis]], but the traditional classroom teaching method was used for the topics of absorbance and emission and [[spectroscopy]]. The lecture videos went over the theory, instrumentation and explanation of the flipped topics. Administered exams for the flipped topics were then based more on what was done in class than the lecture videos.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;
*[[Numerical methods|Numerical Methods]]: The flipped classroom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Renee|last2=Kaw|first2=Autar|last3=Lou|first3=Yingyan|last4=Scott|first4=Andrew|last5=Besterfield-Sacre|first5=Mary|date=2018-01-31|title=Evaluating Blended and Flipped Instruction in Numerical Methods at Multiple Engineering Schools|url=https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/ij-sotl/vol12/iss1/11/|journal=International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|doi=10.20429/ijsotl.2018.120111|issn=1931-4744}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for a [[Numerical methods|Numerical Methods]] course{{Where|date=September 2018}}.  The class of 100 is broken into two sections that meet separately twice a week for 75 minutes each for recitation sessions and once a week for 50 minutes together for a lecture session. Pre-lecture materials include YouTube videos&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/numericalmethodsguy|title=numericalmethodsguy|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and textbook materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nm.mathforcollege.com/topics/textbook_index.html|title=Free Numerical Methods with Applications Textbook by Autar K Kaw|last=Kaw|first=Autar|date=2007-04-24|website=nm.mathforcollege.com|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The]] materials for the week are laid out categorically for the student and suggested blogs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://AutarKaw.org|title=The Numerical Methods Guy|website=The Numerical Methods Guy|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extra homework are also mentioned. The students complete an online quiz via the [[Instructure|CANVAS]] [[Learning management system|LMS]] at home before coming to class.  During the recitation session, concept questions and in-class exercises are distributed.  These questions are solved by students individually and then answers are shared in a group of four.  During this time, the instructor and two teaching assistants help students with any difficulties they may come across.  Based on how students are responding, the instructor discusses some of the problems.  The instructor also gives mini-lectures on some topics that may be difficult to process by students on their own.  During the lecture session, the instructor wraps up the topic of the week and introduces students to the topic of the upcoming week.  To enhance the benefits and reduce the workload associated with a flipped classroom, the pre-class preparation is now done through adaptive lessons for half of the course (limited funding). A commercial adaptive platform, [[Smart Sparrow]], that combines video lectures, text and assessment via multiple-choice and algorithmic questions is being used.

==With other educational approaches==
* Flipped learning + peer instruction
Interactive method based on collaborative work that has proven effective in areas such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Dumont, 2014). Specifically consists of sharing with other students a different response to their own and explain the reasons that support the same to learn from each other. In this process the reasoning beyond the answers is analyzed.

* Flipped mastery learning
When the invested learning model is applied in a more advanced way. Educators begin by organizing content around specific goals. Students work on course content at their own pace and upon reaching the end of each unit, they must show mastery of learning objectives before moving on to the next topic and so on (Bergmann and Sams, 2013). Students can show evidence of their learning through videos, worksheets, experimental stories, programs, projects, examples, among others.
There are two challenges in the flipped-mastery model: the first is to deliver instruction to students when they have different levels of learning and understanding of the subjects. The second challenge is to carry out summative assessment when the student has to be evaluated more than once.

* Flipped adaptive learning
The combination of inverted learning and other pedagogical approaches such as [[adaptive learning]] can help educators obtain information from the areas of learning that dominate their students and those in which they still have deficiencies or need to improve. This knowledge can support the teacher in determining how to organize and manage class time in order to maximize student learning (Yilmaz-tuzun, 2008).

* Flipped learning + gamification
A step forward in the flipped-mastery model would be to include [[gamification]] elements in the learning process. Gamification is the application of game mechanisms in situations not directly related to games. The basic idea is to identify what motivates a game and see how it can be applied in the teaching-learning model (in this case it would be Flipped-Mastery). The results of the Fun Theory research showed that fun can significantly change people's behavior in a positive sense, in the same way that it has a positive effect on education (Volkswagen, 2009).

* Flipped learning + cooperative learning
There may also be a symbiosis or complementation between the flipped classroom technique and [[cooperative learning]]. Schoolwork, also commonly known as "homework", is done jointly and in cooperation with the group as the teacher moves the time spent explaining the subject to the flipped classroom method. In this way, the student has to assimilate and understand the content of more theoretical weight at home, through the recordings made by the teacher, and the time in class is dedicated to the development of tasks and problem solving and / or doubts through cooperative learning (Fortanet, González, Mira Pastor and López Ramón, 2013).

* Flipped learning + Inclusive classroom
The qualities of a flipped classroom that are valuable for typical students can also benefit students with disabilities. Inclusive classrooms can be used to change perceptions and reduce the stigma students with disabilities experience.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/treatments-approaches/educational-strategies/5-benefits-of-inclusion-classrooms&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a teacher can develop a lesson about social skills if it is an area of concern for a student diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Altemueller, L., &amp; Lindquist, C. (2017). Flipped classroom instruction for inclusive learning. British Journal Of Special Education, 44(3), 341-358. doi:10.1111/1467-8578.12177&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Maple Award celebrates [[fiction]] (since 1998) and [[non-fiction]] (every other year since 2005) Canadian books for grades 7-8 (12-14) every year. Out of a ten nominated books in each category students must read a minimum of five to vote for their favourite. The winner is chosen by the most popular book in all participating libraries, schools, groups, etc.

The 2017 Winner for fiction is ''Shooter'' by Caroline Pignat.

The 2017 Winner for non-fiction is ''Child Soldier: When Boys and Girls are Used in War'' by Michel Chikwanine, Jessica Dee Humphreys, &amp; Claudia Dávila.

== History ==
Five years after the original Silver Birch Award was created an award for grades 7-9, the Red Maple Award was created. In 2005 a non-fiction subcategory of the Red Maple Award was created. It runs on all odd numbered years.

'''Gymnasia Rehavia''' ({{lang-he-n|גמנסיה רחביה}} ''Gimnazya Rehavya'') is a high school in the [[Rehavia]] neighborhood in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].

==History==
Gymnasia Rehavia was Jerusalem's first and the country’s second modern Jewish high school or [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], after the [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. The school was first established in Jerusalem's [[Bukharim quarter|Bukharan Quarter]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualjerusalem.com/jeisholidays/JerusalemDay/walk3.htm Jerusalem Day on Virtual Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; The building on Keren Kayemet Street in the Rehavia neighborhood was built in 1928. Among its early teachers were [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]], later the second [[president of Israel]], and his wife [[Rachel Yanait]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/jermandate.html Jerusalem neighborhoods: Rehavia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the high school celebrated its centennial at an event attended by generations of alumni, many of whom are leading figures in Israeli society today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0Q8sUH4k57YJ:www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite%3Fcid%3D1246443745904%26pagename%3DJPost%252FJPArticle%252FPrinter+gymnasia+rehavia&amp;cd=15&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk Gymnasia Rehavia centennial]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:080040 - 015 Sen Kim Carr 24 Jan 08.jpg|right|thumb|197x197px|Senator Kim Carr]]
'''Inspiring Australia''' is an Australian national strategy for engagement with the sciences. Its goals include improving science communication and helping engage the Australian community with science. Inspiring Australia has rolled out a range of programs and expanded existing ones to help achieve its goals, including publishing reports from  expert working groups, a Science Engagement Toolkit, [[Prime Minister's Prizes for Science]] and [[National Science Week]].&lt;ref name=Insp.Aus.website&gt;[https://www.industry.gov.au/community-activities/inspiring-australia-resources-for-communicating-science Inspiring Australia] web site&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar initiative in the UK is the British Council, which runs science projects to communicate messages around exciting or topical scientific issues, focusing on science and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcouncil.org.au/society British Council] web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In February 2010 Senator [[Kim Carr]], the then [[Minister for Industry and Innovation (Australia)|Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research]] launched the Inspiring Australia report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smc.org.au/2010/02/rapid-roundup-launch-of-national-science-communication-strategy-inspiring-australia-experts-respond/ Reporting] from the Australian Science Media Centre&lt;/ref&gt; at the Australian Science Communicators conference at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. The report detailed 14 recommendations to fulfill four overarching principles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3906/f/2018-10/inspiring_australia_-_a_national_strategy_for_engagement_with_the_sciences_2010.pdf Inspiring Australia report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian and state and territory governments agreed a shared Framework of Principles for Science Communication Initiatives &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3906/f/2018-10/inspiring-australia-framework-of-principles-science-communication-initiatives_2010.pdf Framework of Principles] document&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspiring Australia was included in the [[Australian Labor Party]]'s Science for Australia's Future policy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capa.edu.au/files/inline-files/100810_ALP_Science_fact_sheet.pdf ALP science policy fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Australian federal election, 2010|August 2010 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/08/11/2979968.htm ABC Science News] story&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] also committed to funding the new initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.org.au/media/MED20100819HO.php Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences] media release&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 Minister Carr announced that "Australians will be encouraged to study and excel in science and research through a new Inspiring Australia program in the 2011-12 Budget." The launch promised Inspiring Australia would coordinate the efforts of Australia’s research agencies, media outlets, universities, academies, professional bodies, the business sector, state-based science centres, museums, and community-based organisations. According to the departmental media release, the three-year $21 million Inspiring Australia program was designed to "help bring science to every Australian, regardless of geography, ethnicity, age or social condition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.innovation.gov.au/ministersarchive2011/carr/MediaReleases/Pages/INSPIRINGAUSTRALIATOLEADTHEWORLDINSCIENCE.html Media Release], Senator the Hon Kim Carr, 10 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the new Minister for Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans, announced $5 million in grants for Inspiring Australia projects across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceinpublic.com.au/category/inspiringaus News bulletin] from Science In Public, a science communication agency based in Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Science Meets Parliament in September 2012, Shadow Minister for Science [[Sophie Mirabella]] referred to the Inspiring Australia program as a bipartisan initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sophiemirabella.com.au/News/SpeechesandTranscripts/tabid/74/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/719/SPEECH--SCIENCE-MEETS-PARLIAMENT-CANBERRA.aspx Speech transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 Science In Public, a science communication agency based in [[Melbourne]], Australia, created a web site for Inspiring Australia, featuring "stories and ideas from Australia's science community, plus events and prize opportunities from around the country".&lt;ref name=Insp.Aus.website /&gt; London-based ScienceRewired announced it was leading the Inspiring Australia funded development of a community component for the web site, to connect over 300 science professionals across Australia in conjunction with Australian Science Communicators and the Australian National Centre for Public Awareness of Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencerewired.org/portfolio/building-the-inspiring-australia-community ScienceRewired] web site&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 the Inspiring Australia funded BIG Science Communication Summit was held at the [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencerewired.org/summit/ Summit web site&lt;/ref&gt; The summit brought together more than 200 science communicators, policy makers and others for two days. The summit was a follow-up to the March 2011 Inspiring Australia Summit held in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/sites/default/files/assets/business/annual-reviews/annual_review_2010_11_WA.pdf Questacon Annual Review 2010/11]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, in the lead up to the [[Australian federal election, 2013|federal election]], the [[Australian Academy of Science]] published an "Election Policy", urging "the next Australian Government" to treat the Academy's proposals as "national priorities", and recommending "strengthening the Inspiring Australia National Science Communication Strategy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.org.au/reports/documents/ElectionPolicy2013.pdf Science Priorities for Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085223/http://www.science.org.au/reports/documents/ElectionPolicy2013.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reaction==
Already in the business of science communication for five years when Kim Carr launched Inspiring Australia, the independent, not-for-profit [[Australian Science Media Centre]] noted the Inspiring Australia report and strategy followed a similar report in the UK in 2008, A Vision for Science and Society, developed by the UK Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, now the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090909140415/http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/scienceandsociety/site/download/ A Vision for Science and Society at the National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Science Media Centre gathered together expert reaction to the launch of the report and strategy. In their editorial overview the Centre explained the Inspiring Australia report set out why effective communication of science was important for Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.smc.org.au/2010/02/rapid-roundup-launch-of-national-science-communication-strategy-inspiring-australia-experts-respond/ Launch of National Science Communication Strategy: Inspiring Australia – Experts respond], Mon Feb 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Graham Durant, Director of [[Questacon]] in Canberra, a lead author of the report, said the consultation around the strategy had found "many excellent science communication initiatives from a vibrant and talented mix of participants across the country", suggesting Inspiring Australia would help coordinate these activities.

Wilson da Silva, then Editor-in-Chief of ''[[Cosmos (magazine)|COSMOS]]'' magazine and former president of the [[World Federation of Science Journalists]] argued science communication was an important and necessary component of science funding, and welcomed the report's key findings.

Dr [[Cathy Foley]], physicist and President of the [[Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies]], said Inspiring Australia would unite the sector.

Associate Professor [[Susan Stocklmayer|Sue Stocklmayer]], Director of the [[Centre for the Public Awareness of Science]] at Australian National University, said while Inspiring Australia provided "an agenda for sharing best practice, more focused outreach, and serious research into communication strategies", this rhetoric needed to be appropriately resourced. She noted Australia’s national research priorities did not include science communication and urged the Government to add this to their list.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Professor Rob Morrison, science communicator and past presenter of ''[[The Curiosity Show]]'', called for more efforts helping people understand how science "works" to avoid confusions and misunderstandings over issues like "climate change, stem cell research, inoculation programs, GM technology, the importance of peer-review and so on". Morrison called for more publishing in the popular realm including "field guides, text books, case studies and popular science books".

Dr Susannah Eliott, CEO of the Australian Science Media Centre, welcomed the report and strategy, hoping it would change the culture which had led to much science communication becoming "focussed on profile raising rather than the public’s need to know". She also argued the report's assertion stating "general mainstream media is not interested in science" did not appear evidence-based and did not tally with the experience of the Science Media Centre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Expert Working Group reports==
Inspiring Australia initiated Expert Working Groups have delivered reports on science engagement issues relating to:
* Science in the media&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3906/f/2018-10/inspiring_australia-science_and_the_media-from_ideas_to_action_2011.pdf Science in the Media report]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Conference on Information Systems''' (ICIS) is an annual international conference for academics and research-oriented practitioners in the area of [[information systems]]. Previously known as the Conference on Information Systems (CIS), ICIS is the flagship conference of the [[Association for Information Systems]], an international professional organization serving academics in information systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://core.edu.au/cms/images/downloads/conference/Astar.pdf | title=2008 Australian Ranking of ICT Conferences | year=2008 | accessdate=2012-08-13}} (Tier A+, highest.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/htmldocs/ConfRanking.html | title=Computer Science Conference Rankings | first=Osmar R. | last=Zaïane | date=August 2009 | accessdate=2009-08-25}} (Rank 1, highest.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cais.ntu.edu.sg/content/research/conference_list.jsp | title=Conference Listing | work=CAIS/NTU | accessdate=2009-08-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204155350/http://www.cais.ntu.edu.sg/content/research/conference_list.jsp | archivedate=2009-12-04 | df= }} (Rank A, second-highest.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sankum/idle/2007/04/research-conferences-in-information.html |title=Research Conferences in Information Systems |first=Sanjeev |last=Kumar |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226181007/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sankum/idle/2007/04/research-conferences-in-information.html |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }} ("…the most prominent research conference in IS research area…")&lt;/ref&gt;

ICIS was founded in 1980 at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and the first conference was held in [[Philadelphia]] the same year. Starting in 1990, when it had its first international venue in [[Copenhagen]], ICIS has been traditionally held outside of North America regularly. ICIS currently rotates between the Americas (AIS Region 1), Europe/Middle East/Africa (AIS Region 2), and Asia/Australia (AIS Region 3). ICIS is usually scheduled in early December and lasts for four days.

The conference is preceded by the ICIS Doctoral Consortium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.aisnet.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=84 ICIS Site Selection Criteria]&lt;/ref&gt; held off site, usually in a nearby resort. The consortium brings together senior faculty from Information Systems (many of whom were participants in past consortia) and ~40 doctoral students, selected from ~120 nominations (each university or institution is allowed to nominate only one participant).

The '''International Council for Traditional Music''' ('''ICTM''') is [[non-governmental organization]] focused on [[musicology]] and [[dance research]]. Founded in [[London]] on 22 September 1947, it publishes the ''[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]'' once a year and the ''[[Bulletin of the ICTM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ictmusic.org/publications/bulletin-ictm/past-issues|title=Bulletin of the ICTM {{!}} International Council for Traditional Music|website=www.ictmusic.org|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' three times a year. The organization was previously known as '''The International Folk Music Council''' ('''IFMC'''). In 1949, it helped found the [[UNESCO]] [[International Music Council]] and remains in formal consultative relationship with UNESCO. Since 2013, its president has been Salwa El-Shawan Castelo-Branco, director of the Instituto de Etnomusicologia – Centro de Estudos em Música e Dança at the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]].

==Background==
After attending high school in Athens, [[Greece]], Asimakopoulos returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/about-2/board-of-directors/more-about-dr-asimakopoulos/ About Dr. Asimakopoulos]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Rutgers University]] (New Jersey) from 1989 to 1992, where he received a bachelor's degree in [[sociology]] and [[economics]]; from 1992 to 1993 receiving his master’s degree in economics; from 1993 to 1994 receiving his master’s degree in [[political science]]; and the sociology program at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]] for his Ph.D. from 1996 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/about-2/board-of-directors/more-about-dr-asimakopoulos/ About Dr. Asimakopoulos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
After teaching as an adjunct professor at New Jersey and New York area universities, in 2004 he began as an assistant professor of social sciences at the [[City University of New York]]-Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/?page=Faculty_Staff# |title=Faculty |access-date=2011-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408104943/http://www.bcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/?page=Faculty_Staff# |archive-date=2011-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to public attention in 2006, when the City University of New York refused to renew his contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechiefleader.com/news/news_of_the_week/article_751a7106-bb33-5941-aebb-e58fe64781c5.html The Chief]&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopoulos alleged this was a political firing because of his outspoken libertarian socialist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best and others, ''Academic Repression: Reflections from the Academic Industrial Complex'', Oakland: AK Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopoulos filed for arbitration which he consequently won in 2008 returning to his position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechiefleader.com/news/news_of_the_week/article_751a7106-bb33-5941-aebb-e58fe64781c5.html The Chief]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimakopoulos set up ''[[Theory in Action]]'', an interdisciplinary journal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/theory-in-action-journal-of-the-transformative-studies-institute/oclc/123904263&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat-''Theory in Action'']&lt;/ref&gt; and sits on the editorial board of the ''Peace Studies Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/publications/theory-in-action-the-journal-of-tsi/ ''Theory in Action'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://peaceconsortium.org/peace-studies-journal/editorial-team ''Peace Studies Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Asimakopoulos launched a YouTube channel, "Crushing Capitalism with Dr. Asimakopoulos", commenting on academic topics and current events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/TSIMedia1 ''Crushing Capitalism with Dr. Asimakopoulos'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulrichsweb.com/ulrichsweb/ulrichsweb_news/uu/newTitles.asp?uuMonthlyFile=uu201006/new_titles.txt&amp;Letter=B&amp;navPage=9&amp; Ulrichsweb]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008}}, he was trying to start a new accredited graduate school based on the principles of [[critical pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/graduate-school/ Graduate school]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.transformativestudies.org.php5-1.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/message-from-the-director1.pdf# |title=Message from the director |access-date=2011-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324101523/http://www.transformativestudies.org.php5-1.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/message-from-the-director1.pdf# |archive-date=2012-03-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Critical pedagogy}}
Asimakopoulos coined the concept of ''Globally Segmented Labor Markets'' expanding theoretical work in the area of [[labor market segmentation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://crs.sagepub.com/content/35/2/175.short Critical Sociology]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
In 2007 Asimakopoulos co-founded the [[Transformative Studies Institute]] (TSI), a progressive 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational think tank based in the United States.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/ Transformative Studies Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.guidestar.org/organizations/20-8770902/transformative-studies-institute-anj-nonprofit-corporation.aspx GuideStar]&lt;/ref&gt; which has a YouTube channel&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/TSIMedia1]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Scribd channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/TSIMedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopoulos uploads activist videos to the YouTube channel. It "was created to provide an inclusive educational space for research and practice for social justice by academics, community organizers, activists, and political leaders".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/about-2/ About TSI]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Gerald Taylor''' (18 August 1931 – 10 March 2012) was a British [[physicist]] and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/mathematics/news/archive/february2012.aspx |title=King's College London – January/February 2012 |publisher=Kcl.ac.uk |date=18 August 1931 |access-date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Taylor attended [[King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford]] and Mid-Essex Polytechnic, before gaining [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA (Cantab)]] and PhD degrees from [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] (1950–1956). He had a wide-ranging academic career in [[mathematical physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. He was an [[emeritus professor]] and Director of the Centre for [[Artificial neural network|Neural Networks]] at [[King's College London]] and guest scientist of the Research Centre at the Institute of Medicine in [[Jülich]], Germany. From 2007 to 2012, Taylor led a unique research program at Commerzbank's Alternative Investment Strategies (COMAS) Group. The program used artificial intelligence techniques to create portfolios of hedge funds. This is the first program of its kind in the fund of hedge funds industry.

In 2011, Taylor co-founded Commonwealth Capital Management LLP together with [[Nathaniel Philip Rothschild]] and [[Mehraj Mattoo]]. The company launched its first systematic fund of CTAs on Deutsche Bank's dbSelect platform based on Taylor's artificial intelligence models developed while he worked at COMAS.

His previous positions and interests, while still at King's College, were in mathematics and physics. He was the author of many popular books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/staff/jg_taylor.html|title=Prof JG Taylor|first=Maths Department|last=Webmaster|date=|website=www.mth.KCL.ac.uk|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/research/cns/people.html|title=King's College CNS Group - Members|author=|date=|website=www.mth.KCL.ac.uk|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor also trained as an actor and performed in plays and films, wrote several science fiction plays and directed stage productions in [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]].

==Parapsychology==

Taylor, after witnessing [[spoon bending]] by [[Uri Geller]], became interested in [[parapsychology]]. At first he believed that Geller's feats as well as other alleged paranormal phenomena were genuine. He wrote a book titled ''Superminds'' (1975) in which he argued for a physical explanation for the paranormal. He believed the explanation for [[extrasensory perception]], [[psychokinesis]], spoon bending and other paranormal phenomena may be found in [[electromagnetism]]. However, experiments that he conducted under laboratory conditions were negative which left him sceptical regarding the validity of paranormal phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v279/n5714/abs/279631a0.html | author1=Taylor, J.

Taylor had tested children in metal bending. According to [[Martin Gardner]] the controls were inadequate as the children would put paper clips in their pockets and later take one out twisted or be left with metal rods unobserved. [[James Randi]] managed to bend an aluminium bar when Taylor was not looking and scratch on it "Bent by Randi". In other experiments two scientists from Bath University examined metal bending with children in a room which was secretly being videotaped through a one-way mirror. The film revealed that the children bent the objects with their hands and feet. Due to the evidence of trickery, Taylor concluded metal bending had no paranormal basis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (1983). ''Science: Good, Bad and Bogus''. Oxford University Press. pp. 179–184. {{ISBN|0-19-286037-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor wrote that the physicalist explanation in which properties of objects have been explained in terms of their constituents has been most successful in science. The forces holding them together are gravity, radioactivity, electromagnetism and the nuclear force. Taylor wrote that only one force could possibly explain alleged paranormal phenomena: electromagnetic forces acting on the normal constituents of bodies. Taylor wrote that when science faces up to the supernatural it is a case of "electromagnetism or bust". In a four-year investigation into the paranormal, Taylor and his colleague Eduardo Balanovski searched for abnormal electromagnetic signals in parapsychological experiments. Electromagnetic and radio-wave detectors were used but no abnormal electromagnetic signals or paranormal effects were observed.&lt;ref name="Evans 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1980"&gt;Taylor, John. (1980). ''Science and the Supernatural: An Investigation of Paranormal Phenomena Including Psychic Healing, Clairvoyance, Telepathy, and Precognition by a Distinguished Physicist and Mathematician''. Temple Smith. pp. 27–170. {{ISBN|0-85117-191-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor wrote that an unknown fifth force causing psychokinesis would have to transmit a great deal of energy. The energy would have to overcome the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic forces]] binding the atoms together. The atoms would need to respond more strongly to the fifth force while it is operative than to electric forces. Such an additional force between atoms should therefore exist all the time and not during only alleged paranormal occurrences. Taylor wrote there is no scientific trace of such a force in physics, down to many orders of magnitude; thus if a scientific viewpoint is to be preserved the idea of any fifth force must be discarded. Taylor concluded there is no possible physical mechanism for psychokinesis and it is in complete contradiction to established science.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1980"/&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Supernatural'' (1980) Taylor concluded that all the paranormal phenomena he investigated turned out to have a naturalistic scientific explanation or did not occur under careful controlled conditions. He wrote many of the results could be explained by fraud, credulity, fantasy and [[sensory cue]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Critics have pointed out that the conditions of any experiment can be labeled as not carefully controlled enough, and have likened such requests for an infinite number of increasingly controlled experiments to the anti-evolutionist requests for an infinite number of transitional fossils. Critics have also pointed out that many of the so-called naturalistic scientific explanations were merely materialist hypotheses with many assumptions that could theoretically explain the phenomena but that were not accordingly scientifically tested and proven to be correct, while many of the paranormal effects were in fact well above the chance level so that such materialist explanations were in fact less likely according to probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldrake|first1=Rupert|title=Science Set Free : Dispelling Dogma.|date=2012|publisher=Random House Inc|location=New York|isbn=9780770436704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katti Anker Møller''' (23 October 1868 &amp;ndash; 20 August 1945) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] feminist, [[Children's rights movement|children's rights]] advocate, and a pioneer of [[reproductive rights]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://snl.no/Katti_Anker_M%C3%B8ller  |title=  Katti Anker Møller|publisher =Store norske leksikon|author=  Elisabeth Lønnå|accessdate= March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born Cathrine Anker in [[Hamar]], the daughter of [[Herman Anker]]. She had nine siblings and grew up around the first [[folk high school]] at [[Sagatun Folk High School|Sagatun]] in Hamar, which was founded by her father. Educated as a teacher, she spent a year in [[France]], where her exposure to the life of [[prostitutes]] and single mothers affected her profoundly. Her mother died at the age of 50, apparently exhausted from her many pregnancies though the number of children she had was normal for her time. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://nbl.snl.no/Herman_Anker   |title=  Herman Anker|publisher =Norsk biografisk leksikon|author= Oddvar Vormeland  |accessdate= March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  http://kvinnesak.no/aeresmedlemmer/katti-anker-moller/  |title=   Katti Anker Møller|publisher =  Norsk Kvinnesaksforening|accessdate= March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married her cousin [[Kai Møller]] from Thorsø  Manor (''Thorsø herregård'') in [[Torsnes]] in 1889, with whom she had three children. Among themwere the physician [[Tove Mohr]], whose daughter [[Tove Pihl]] has carried on the [[pro-choice]] activism in [[Norway]]. Møller took an early interest in the dangers of too many childbirths, and the plight of unmarried women and their [[Illegitimacy|children]]. Her [[modus operandi]] was to travel and give lectures in local meetings, a revolutionary approach for a woman of her time. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  http://www.thorsoe.no/History.htm  |title=  History of Thorsø Herregård|publisher = Thorsø Herregård |accessdate= March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tove Mohr  |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon  |url=http://snl.no/Tove_Mohr |language=Norwegian |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with her brother-in-law [[Johan Castberg]], she worked tirelessly to legislate the rights of children born out of wedlock. This culminated in the institution of the so-called [[Castberg laws]] passed by the [[Stortinget|Norwegian parliament]] in 1915. These laws were revolutionary in their time in giving illegitimate children full rights of inheritance and the right to use their father's surname.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://nbl.snl.no/Johan_Castberg  |title=  Johan Castber|publisher =Norsk biografisk leksikon
|author= Øivind Bjørnson|accessdate= March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She then turned her attention to decriminalizing [[abortion in Norway]], an idea she presented through a lecture called "the liberation of motherhood," with the subtitle "the production of children under culture, the woman's right to decide over her own body." This was met with broad opposition, also from women.
She was not dissuaded and continued her efforts, adding [[birth control]] to her causes. In spite of opposition from opinion leaders such as [[Sigrid Undset]], she managed to establish the first "hygiene office" in Oslo to inform women on contraception.

The [[Norwegian National Women's Council]] (''Norske Kvinners Nasjonalråd'') was founded in 1904 as an umbrella organization for  various Norwegian women's associations. She served as a member of the organization together with fellow rights activists [[Karen Grude Koht]], [[Fredrikke Marie Qvam]], [[Gina Krog]] and [[Betzy Kjelsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =   https://snl.no/Norske_Kvinners_Nasjonalr%C3%A5d|title= Norske Kvinners Nasjonalråd|publisher = Store norske leksikon |author=   Elisabeth Lønnå|accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union''' (KTU, {{lang-ko|전국교직원노동조합}}), also known as '''Jeon&lt;small&gt;(-)&lt;/small&gt;gyojo''' ({{lang-ko|전교조}}; acronym for ''KTU'' in Korean language) is a [[trade union|labor union]] of teachers in [[South Korea]]. The organization has 77,000 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/06/137_46198.html Private Education and Teachers]&lt;/ref&gt; (down from 94,000) among the 360,000 public and private school teachers in the country.

The KTU was founded in 1989 under opposition from the South Korean government. In response to its founding, several thousand members were subsequently fired by the education authorities.  The KTU finally received official recognition in 1999 after the election of [[Kim Dae-Jung]] and many of the dismissed teachers were allowed to return to their former positions.

A major contributor to the [[Korean Confederation of Trade Unions]], the KTU is criticized for promoting pro-[[Juche|North Korea]] ideology&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200607/200607250022.html Teachers' Union Puts Faith in N.Korean History Book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2006072699278 Pro-North Teaching Agenda Uncovered]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_editorial/185757.html The revival of freedom of speech violations from years past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seoul.eduhope.net/bbs/view.php?board=seoul-830&amp;id=193 새학기 환경미화 통일란 참고자료(지부통일위)]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as disseminating "[[Anti-American sentiment in Korea|anti-American]]" propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/117_27328.html Teachers Seek to Warn Students of US Beef Risk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/117_27050.html Teacher Beats Student Over US Beef]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009, the KTU's ranks had dwindled,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/02/113_19811.html Teachers union to shed its radical image]&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to parental and public opposition to its non-education-related political activities. A series of scandals also deeply undermined the union's credibility, including the attempted cover-up of a sexual assault on one of its members, as well as the sexual harassment of trainee teachers by KTU members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/05/117_45034.html Teachers' Union has image problem]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2904466 Rotten behavior, rotten union]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the KTU's offices were raided by police on charges of issuing an anti-government statement allegedly in violation of the Civil Servants Law and the Educational Workers Labor Union Act, which bans political activities for teachers' unions on matters unrelated to working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=080000&amp;biid=2009070409738 Teachers' Union Must Be Punished]&lt;/ref&gt; Union officials protested the investigation for being politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/07/113_47884.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/07/04/200907040030.asp Police raid teachers' union offices]&lt;/ref&gt; Per request by the KTU, the [[Education International]], a multinational federation of teachers' unions, protested the investigations in a formal letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/364385.html Education International protests S. Korea’s punishment against teachers]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2010, [[New Right (South Korea)|New Right]] politician [[Cho Jun-hyuk]] revealed the list of teachers who are affiliated with the KTU. This has led to a series of court decisions against him. This has later backfired as the KTU sought to file compensations against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Teachers union to file compensation suit against ruling party lawmakers | date = 2010-09-08 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2010/09/08/60/0302000000AEN20100908002000315F.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2011, the Seoul Metropolitan Education Board approved two KTU-affiliated school principals that caused controversies in their admission process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = 준삼 (Jun-sam) | last = 이 (Lee) | script-title=ko:`전교조 교장' 논란 가열…또 양분되는 교육계 | date = 2011-02-15 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/02/15/0200000000AKR20110215155800004.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-03-03 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2011, KTU sued Gyeonggi-do regional politician Bak Gwang-jin, for releasing a list of teachers affiliated with the KTU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = 철환 (Cheol-hwan) | last = 황 (Hwang) | script-title=ko:전교조 '조합원 명단공개' 前도의원 고소키로 | date = 2011-05-04 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/05/04/0200000000AKR20110504207500004.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2011, the head of a conservative parents' interest group ''Gyohakyeon'' (교육과 학교를 위한 학부모 연합) sent letters to approximately 60,000 KTU-affiliated teachers ''to resign their affiliation with KTU''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hyeon-suk (현숙) | last = Song (송) | script-title=ko:전교조 교사에 "탈퇴하라" 편지 | date = 2011-05-25 | url = http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201105252140415&amp;code=940401 | work = Kyunghyang Sinmun | accessdate = 2011-08-28 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2011, the [[Incheon District Court]] released an official statement that the decision made by the Superintendent of Incheon Metropolitan Office of Education to penalize KTU-affiliated teachers for donating "illegal" funding to the [[Democratic Labor Party (South Korea)|Democratic Labor Party]] is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Sang-hui (상희) | last = Bae (배) | script-title=ko:법원 "정당 후원 교사 징계는 정치적 자유 침해" | date = 2011-12-09 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/12/09/0200000000AKR20111209208200065.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-12-10 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high quality physical education programs consists of these attributes:&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201493/|title=Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School Environment|last=|first=|date=2013|website=National Academy of Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Physical education teachers are certified
* Students in elementary school have physical education class for a minimum of 150 minutes per week, while students in high school have it for at least 225 minutes per week
* Concrete and achievable standards for students to meet (often for high school graduation)

==Causes==
The causes of lack of physical education vary from country to country.  These include a shortage in facilities and [[Sports equipment|equipment]], a paucity of [[Gym teacher|physical education teachers]], large [[Student–teacher ratio|class sizes]], and budgetary constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some African countries such as [[Botswana]] and [[Malawi]], where children attend school for a minimal amount of time, the budgets allocated for physical education are instead used to concentrate on subjects such as [[language]]s and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A lack of physical education also arises from cultural views: in parts of [[Central America]] (such as the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]) and [[Asia]] (such as [[Pakistan]]), exercise is seen as a form of leisure that should not be featured in an academic [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example exists in [[India]], where girls are often discouraged from engaging in [[sport]]s because such activity is viewed as "unfeminine", as is the possibility of them becoming too muscular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a lack of governmental [[legislation]] and intervention can be to blame. In parts of [[South America]] (with the exception of [[Chile]] and [[Colombia]]), there are no laws that make physical education compulsory: thus, it is omitted from many schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icsspe.org/content/physical-education-schools-update|title=Physical Education in Schools Update {{!}} International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education|website=www.icsspe.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, such as in areas of the [[United States]], the mandated physical education hours are simply not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/education/even-as-schools-battle-obesity-physical-education-is-sidelined.html|title=Even as Obesity Concerns Rise, Physical Education Is Sidelined|last=Baker|first=Al|date=2012-07-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 33 states, students are permitted to be exempt from physical education courses by replacing them with other activities such as marching band practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/2012-shape-of-the-nation-_n_2130115.html|title=Physical Education Programs Stalled By State Loopholes: 2012 Shape Of The Nation Report|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of school, children often fail to engage in physical activity due to lack of [[physical literacy]], inadequate [[Sleep deprivation|sleep]], the increasing attractiveness of rival pastimes such as [[video game]]s, and parents that do not play their part. It is important that parents allow their children the full opportunity to participate in both formal and informal sports and promote healthy physical activity levels. Also, in achievement-oriented populations such as those seen in [[China]], there is an increased emphasis on [[Test (assessment)|academic results]] which also detracts from physical activity time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/05/30/lack_of_physical_education_weighs_heavily_on_many/ |title=Lack of physical education weighs heavily on many |publisher=The Boston Globe |author=Lisa Wangsness |author2= April Simpson |date=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterioration of physical education in schools combined with the elimination of playgrounds and other play facilities forces children to stay inactive and inside for most of the school day which can have serious long-term consequences.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiler|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Is the Lack of Physical Activity Strategy for Children Complicit Mass Child Neglect?|url=|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
[[File:Medical complications of obesity.png|thumb|Physical consequences of obesity]]
An increase in [[sedentary lifestyle]] due to a lack of physical education at home and at school has many physical and psychological consequences on a child in the short and long term.

=== Physical ===
According to a Portuguese study, children with sedentary lifestyles have nine times poorer [[motor coordination]] than active children of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Luís|last2=Santos|first2=Rute|last3=Pereira|first3=Beatriz|last4=Lopes|first4=Vítor Pires|date=2012-11-01|title=Associations between sedentary behavior and motor coordination in children|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22310/abstract|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=746–752|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22310|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have worsened [[bone density]], [[Physical strength|strength]], and [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, they are more likely to use [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[drug]]s than their active peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/healthy-living-vie-saine/being-active-etre-actif/tips-conseils-eng.php|title=Children and physical activity|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Health Canada and the Public health Agency of|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedentary behaviour is strongly associated with [[obesity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2011001/article/11397-eng.htm|title=Physical activity of Canadian children and youth: Accelerometer results from the 2007 to 2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this imparts a great health risk. Obese children are more likely to have [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], high [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[sleep apnea]], [[menstrual cycle]] abnormalities, [[bone]] and [[joint]] problems, increased [[cancer]] risk, and reduced balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/surgery/bariatric/weight-loss-surgery/adolescent-weight-loss/Pages/health-risks.aspx|title=Health Risks of Childhood Obesity - Bariatric and Metabolic Institute {{!}} UC San Diego Health|website=UC Health - UC San Diego|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also more likely to be obese adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood physical inactivity has been correlated to cholesterol and fatty streaks in the aorta in the first decade of life and moves to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body in the second and third decade of life, causing health issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A lack of physical activity is one of the main causes for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other physical health issues among children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guedes|first=Claudia|date=2007|title=Physical Education and Physical Activity: A Historical Perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|volume=78|pages=31-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a direct correlation between active participation in physical activity and the health of school age children, therefore a lack of physical education would cause a lack in physical activity in children, leading to worse health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Psychological ===
As exercise is known to improve well-being and reduce [[Stress (biology)|stress]], physical inactivity is correlated with poor psychological health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Donna L|year=1996|title=Cut-backs to physical education consulting services: consequences and concerns.|url=|journal=CAHPER Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as an increase of major [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win|first=Sithu|last2=Parakh|first2=Kapil|last3=Eze-Nliam|first3=Chete M.|last4=Gottdiener|first4=John S.|last5=Kop|first5=Willem J.|last6=Ziegelstein|first6=Roy C.|date=2011-03-15|title=Depressive symptoms, physical inactivity and risk of cardiovascular mortality in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study|url=http://heart.bmj.com/content/97/6/500|journal=Heart|language=en|volume=97|issue=6|pages=500–505|doi=10.1136/hrt.2010.209767|issn=1468-201X|pmc=3044493|pmid=21339320}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a link between obesity and psychiatric illness and the two feed on each other in a vicious cycle.

A lack of physical activity is associated with poorer [[Concentration (psychology)|concentration]] and [[Academic achievement|academic performance]], particularly in [[mathematics]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201501/|title=Physical Activity, Fitness, and Physical Education: Effects on Academic Performance|last=Harold W. Kohl|first=I. I. I.|last2=Cook|first2=Heather D.|last3=Environment|first3=Committee on Physical Activity and Physical Education in the School|last4=Board|first4=Food and Nutrition|last5=Medicine|first5=Institute of|date=2013-10-30|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obesity induced from lack of exercise also contributes to a decrease in general mental health. Overweight children and teens are more likely to suffer from poor [[self-esteem]], negative [[body image]], [[teasing]], and [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher levels of sedentary and lower levels of physical education are linked to worse mental health and lower cognitive function among children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== In Canada ==

=== Current trends ===
The majority of Canadian children aged 5 to 17 years old (91%) do not meet the daily physical activity recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Canadian physical education programs are improving significantly, with 61-80% of schools offering a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education classes per week in 2016, and participation levels in [[organized sport]] are on the rise, Canadian school programs are ineffective in encouraging healthy habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, most Canadian children (56%) lack physical literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they face many issues related to lifestyle. These include sedentary behaviours such as increased screen time averaging 176 minutes a day from TVs and video games to the detriment of active play. There is also the inevitable decrease in [[Human-powered transport|active transportation]], more [[sleep deprivation]], and a poor quality of [[Dieting|diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.participaction.com/en-ca/thought-leadership/report-card/2016|title=Are Canadian Kids Too Tired to Move? {{!}} ParticipACTION|website=ParticipACTION|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These lifestyle trends have caused youth obesity rates to nearly triple over the past 30 years. In 2013, this consisted of 28% of Canadian children ages 5–19 that were classified as [[overweight]] or [[Obesity|obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|access-date=2016-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

==== Recommendations and Regulations ====
The Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (CAHPERD) has recommended that Canadian schools and [[Board of education|school boards]] take action through specific academic initiatives to ensuring that their physical education [[curriculum]] is effective at encouraging and instilling healthy exercise habits in young Canadians. CAHPERD has suggested that schools focus on checking the quality (adequate facilities, budget and research-verified techniques) and quantity (minimum 30 minutes a day) of a school's physical education courses as well as the professional qualifications of the educators. The consultants should check that classes meet the needs of all students irrespective of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sex]], [[gender]], and [[Agility|ability level]]. The courses should also encourage participation and [[skill]] development, with a healthy balance of [[Competitiveness|competitive]] and noncompetitive activities. Moreover, it is of utmost importance that [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] and [[physical education]] be encouraged by the [[teacher]]: they should never be used to [[Punishment|punish]] a student (such as what is seen through the common practice of making children run if they misbehave). Outside of class hours, CAHPERD recommends that schools provide opportunities for [[Intramural sports|intramural]] activities and involve [[parent]]s in the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phecanada.ca/advocacy/advocacy-tools/making-case-physical-education-canada-presentation-kit-leaders|title=Making the Case for Physical Education in Canada: A Presentation Kit for Leaders {{!}} PHE Canada|date=2010-07-23|website=www.phecanada.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pan-Canadian Public Health Network first decided to prioritize the issue of childhood obesity in September 2010 by creating the framework ''Curbing Childhood Obesity: An overview of the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights.'' In this project, federal, provincial and territorial Ministers of Health agreed to focus on three goals: increasing the predominance of [[Nutrition|nutritious]] food choices, addressing obesity at an early age, and creating better spaces for children that favour physical activity and [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]]. This has allowed the [[action plan]] ''Towards a Healthier Canada'' to be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hp-ps/hl-mvs/framework-cadre/intro-eng.php|title=Curbing Childhood Obesity: An Overview of the FPT Framework for Action to Promote Healthy Weights - Public Health Agency of Canada|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Public Health Agency of|website=www.phac-aspc.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Physical Activity guidelines for children ages 5 to 17 consist of at least 1 hour of daily physical activity. Their exercise should range in intensity from [[Moderate exercise|moderate]] (inducing light [[perspiration]] and harder [[breathing]]) to vigorous (inducing heavy perspiration and heavy breathing). Examples of moderate exercise include [[Bicycle|bike]] riding and [[playground]] activities, and examples of vigorous exercise include [[running]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming.]] It is recommended that they engage in both vigorous activities and activities strengthening bone and muscles at least three times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology also recommends that children ages 5 to 17 limit their sedentary activities, such as [[television]] and video games, [[Transport|sedentary transport]], and extensive [[sitting]]. It is advised that children limit their recreational screen time to a maximum of 120 minutes a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csep.ca/en/guidelines/24-hour-movement-guidelines|title=Guidelines|website=www.csep.ca|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Childhood Obesity]] Foundation'', a Canadian initiative, has invented the 5-2-1-0 [[mnemonic]] to remember the national lifestyle recommendations. This consists of 5 [[Serving size|servings]] or more of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]] per day, no more than 2 hours of screen time a day, 1 hour of [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] or more per day, and 0 [[sugary drink]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://childhoodobesityfoundation.ca/about/|title=About - Childhood Obesity Foundation|newspaper=Childhood Obesity Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of ''Towards a Healthier Canada'', many initiatives have been launched to meet the three goals, and they vary from [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] to province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phn-rsp.ca/thcpr-vcpsre-2015/index-eng.php|title=Towards a Healthier Canada : Compilation of Initiatives|last=|first=|date=|website=towardsahealthiercanada.ca|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are projects made in the name of a framework or jurisdictional approach/governmental department that are either targeted at schools, at a community, or in partnership with other organizations or companies.

== In the United States ==

=== Current Trends ===
Nearly 10 million [[Child|children]] and [[Adolescence|adolescents]] in the United States ages 6–19 are considered [[overweight]] because the lack of physical education in schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Physical Education in Schools|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children aged 6–11 have also more than doubled in rate of [[obesity]] over the last twenty years. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Leslie Haub|title=Childhood obesity and the lack of physical education programs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGNXNAAACAAJ|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual states have set requirements for physical education in their schools, but how physical education is conducted across the country has not been established. Yet, physical education has been a common practice of the K-12 education curriculum in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Thomas|date=2017|title=Studies of Physical Education in the United States Using SOFIT: A Review|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=88|pages=492-502|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No Child Left Behind Act has created an environment in which physical education, art and music have been left behind, viewed as "nonessential" courses. Federal funding is more dependent on schools enhancing their math and reading programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sallis|first=James|date=2012|title=Physical Education's Role in Public Health|url=|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume=83|pages=125-135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
One program the United States has adopted to decrease obesity are before-school exercise programs with elementary aged children. One in particular consists of reaching 100 miles before the end of the school year. Each milestone of 25 miles the child will earn a check mark on a tee-shirt. They will then be rewarded at 100 miles with a trophy and an announcement over the school loudspeaker. Walking is supervised by teachers and done around school grounds or inside the school. This is a great way for a child to improve health, concentration, confidence and happiness.

Throughout the past two decades, federal support for physical education in the public health sector has increased dramatically. Since 1992, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has funded state education agencies to get them to partner with state health departments to promote physical activity and healthy eating in schools among young people. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In February 2010, first lady Michelle Obama started the "Let's Move" initiative to address the childhood obesity epidemic. Efforts to engage in schools to fight against childhood obesity were taken within 1 year of establishing the program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Budget cuts in the United States have led to less funding and support for physical education because it is not a "core" subject.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== In China ==

=== Current Trends ===
Even though obesity has increased among most of the population in China, the burden of obesity has shifted onto the lower educated population, likely due to a lack of physical education or health education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huijun|date=2013|title=Program and Policy Options for Preventing Obesity in China|url=|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=14|pages=134-140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students in China are beginning to gain equal opportunities to physical education and sports to further improve their physical health and strength.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Chiung-Tzu Lucetta|date=2017|title=The History of Sports and Physical Education in China|url=|journal=World Leisure Journal|volume=59|pages=326-337|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport and physical education in China is extremely influenced by Confucianism which emphasizes collectivism. The values it holds emphasizes self-sacrifice and subordination of one's interests to those of others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2011, The Chinese Ministry of Education has developed standards for physical education in schools. These emphasize enhancing children's health development is the primary goal of physical education in schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ding|first=Haiyong|date=2014|title=A Review of Scholarly and Research Work in Physical Education in China During the First Decade of the 21st Century|url=|journal=Quest|volume=66|pages=117-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards include: 

* "Standard 1: Physical activity participation—Students participate in physical activities and are able to enjoy exercise and experience success."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 2: Mastery of knowledge, skill, and safe exercise methods—Students learn knowledge about exercise, perform physical skills, understand safe exercise principles, and learn self-defense."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 3: Developing physical health—Students learn and master knowledge and method of maintaining health, develop and sustain healthy posture and bodily shape, develop and maintain physical fitness, and improve adaptive ability in natural environments."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* "Standard 4: Developing mental health—Students learn to develop mental strength, control emotions, develop ability to collaborate and cooperate, and follow ethical norms of physical activity."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The General Administration of Sport in China has been one of the leading government agencies that promotes the development of physical education and physical health in the elementary and college levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The government has for the most part supported physical education and sport in school, but has often abused it as a political tool which leads to ignoring its importance and the needs of individual students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In European (EU) Countries ==

=== Current Trends ===
In the EU, physical education is a mandatory subject in general education. The time dedicated to physical education varies greatly from country to country.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2016|title=Physical Education in EU Schools|url=|journal=Briefing European Parliamentary Research Service|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About half of EU countries devote 10% of their school curriculum to physical education. Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia devote 15%, while Ireland only 4%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matejek|first=Črtomir|date=2014|title=Physical Education in Primary Education in EU Countries|url=|journal=Revija za Elementarno Izobraževanje|volume=7|pages=57-165|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all EU countries, France devotes the most time to physical education in elementary school, a total of 108 hours, which is only 10% of the total teaching time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The primary education designers in European countries view physical education as less important than other subjects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Physical inactivity is responsible for over 500,000 deaths per year in the European Union and accounts for economic costs of over €80 billion per year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Funding for physical education in EU schools is poor, which has led to poor quality physical education. This lack of funding is reflected in poor quality and lack of equipment at EU schools in respectively 26% and 38% of EU countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Addressing the Lack of Physical Education ===

===== Regulations and Recommendations =====
In 2007, the European Parliament's Resolution on the Role of Sport in Education helped parliament conclude that physical education is “the only school subject which seeks to prepare children for a healthy lifestyle and focuses on their overall physical and mental development, as well as imparting important social values such as fairness, self-discipline, solidarity, team spirit, tolerance and fair play…” and one of the most important tools for social integration.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardman|first=Ken|date=2008|title=Physical Education in Schools: A Global Perspective|url=|journal=University of Worcester, UK|volume=1|pages=5-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Parliament's Resolution places physical education on the European political agenda, highlighting its importance.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The European Physical Education Association recommends daily physical education in elementary grades up to 11 or 12 years of age and 3 hours per week in post-elementary and high school grades.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:Shimer College Susan Henking listening 2013 cropped.jpg|thumb|Listening in conversation.]]
'''Listening''' is giving one's attention to sound, for example [[speech]], [[music]] or natural sounds. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halone|first1=Kelby|last2=Cunconan|first2=Terry|last3=Coakley|first3=Carolyn|last4=Wolvin|first4=Andrew|title=Toward the establishment of general dimensions underlying the listening process.|journal=International Journal of Listening|date=1998|volume=12|pages=12–28|doi=10.1080/10904018.1998.10499016|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10904018.1998.10499016?journalCode=hijl20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective processes include the motivation to attend to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding with verbal and nonverbal feedback.

==What is listening?==
Listening differs from [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeying]].  A person who receives and understands information or an instruction, and then chooses not to comply with it or to agree to it, has listened to the speaker, even though the result is not what the speaker wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Purdy, Michael and Deborah Borisoff, eds. (1997) ''Listening in Everyday Life: A Personal and Professional Approach.  ''University Press of America.  {{ISBN|9780761804611}}.  p. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Listening is a term in which the listener listens to the one who produced the sound to be listened.

==Barthes==
Semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] characterized the distinction between listening and hearing as "Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The Responsibility of Forms|year=1985|publisher=New York Hill and Wang|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing is always occurring, most of the time subconsciously. In contrast, listening is the interpretative action taken by the listener in order to understand and potentially make meaning out of the sound waves. Listening can be understood on three levels:  alerting, deciphering, and  an understanding of how the sound is produced and how the sound affects the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=In the Responsibility of Forms|year=1985|publisher=New York Hill and Wang|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alerting, the first level, is the detection of environmental sound cues. While discussing this level, Barthes mentions the idea of territory being demarcated by sounds. This is best explained using the example of one's home. One's home, for instance, has certain sounds associated with it that make it familiar and comfortable. An intrusion sound (e.g. a squeaking door or floorboard, a breaking window) alerts the dweller of the home to the potential danger.

Deciphering, the second level, describes detecting patterns in and interpreting sounds. An example of this level is that of a child waiting for the sound of his mother's return home. In this scenario the child is waiting to pick up on sound cues (e.g. jingling keys, the turn of the doorknob, etc.) that will mark his mother's approach.

Understanding, the third level of listening, means knowing how what one says will affect another. This sort of listening is important in [[psychoanalysis]]. Barthes states that the psychoanalyst must turn off their judgement while listening to the analysand in order to communicate with their patient's unconscious in an unbiased fashion.

However, in contrast to the distinct levels of listening listed above, it must be understood that they all function within the same plane, and sometimes all at once. Specifically the second and third levels, which overlap vastly, can be intertwined in that obtaining, understanding and deriving meaning are part of the same process. In that the child, upon hearing the doorknob turn (obtaining), can almost automatically assume that someone is at the door (deriving meaning).

==In language learning==
Along with [[speaking]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], and [[writing]], listening is one of the "four skills" of [[language learning]]. All [[language teaching]] approaches except for [[grammar-translation]] incorporate a listening component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Language Listening: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521786479|isbn=0521786479|first1=John |last1=Flowerdew|first2=Lindsay|last2=Miller|year=2005|page=4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some teaching methods, such as [[Total Physical Response]], involve students simply listening and responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Language Arts to English Language Learners|page=171
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415641446
|first1=Anete|last1=Vásquez|first2=Angela L. |last2=Hansen|first3=Philip C. |last3=Smith
|year=2013|isbn=0415641446|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between "intensive listening", in which learners attempt to listen with maximum accuracy to a relatively brief sequence of speech, and "extensive listening", in which learners listen to lengthy passages for general comprehension.  While intensive listening may be more effective in terms of developing specific aspects of listening ability, extensive listening is more effective in building [[fluency]] and maintaining learner [[motivation]].{{sfn|Flowerdew|2005|p=14}}

==Early life==
Marianne Williams, née Marianne Coldham, was born in Yorkshire, England  12 December 1793. Marianne was the oldest child of Wright and Anne Coldham. Wright Coldham and Thomas Williams (Marianne’s father-in-law) were hosiers in [[Nottingham]], and both were Sheriffs.&lt;ref name="NHW2"/&gt; The family had moved to [[Nottingham]] from [[Norwich]]. Her father, Wright Coldham, was an active member of the Presbyterian [[High Pavement Chapel]] in Nottingham.&lt;ref name="NHW3"&gt;{{cite web| last = Harvey-Williams | first = Nevil | title = The Williams Family in the 18th and 19th Centuries - Part 3|chapter=|date=March 2011|publisher= | url= http://www.williams.gen.nz/18and19c.html| accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright Coldham received recognition as a [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]] of Nottingham in 1796;&lt;ref name="NHW2"&gt;{{cite web| last = Harvey-Williams | first = Nevil | title = The Williams Family in the 18th and 19th Centuries - Part 2|chapter=|date=March 2011|publisher= | url= http://www.williams.gen.nz/18and19a.html#thogos| accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a [[Sheriff of Nottingham (position)|Sheriff of Nottingham]] in 1798;&lt;ref name="NHW2"/&gt; and as the Mayor of Nottingham in 1809.&lt;ref name="NHW2"/&gt; In 1810 Anne Coldham died and at the age 16 Marianne took over raising her three sisters, Sarah, Maria and Anne, her blind grandmother Mrs Temple, the running of the mayoral household and acting as Lady Mayoress at civic events. In 1815 Wright Coldham died.&lt;ref name="Caroline Fitzgerald 2004 p. 3"&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' p. 3 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marianne and [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] were married on 20 January 1818 by Henry’s cousin and brother-in law, the Rev. [[Edward Garrard Marsh|Edward Marsh]], a member of the [[Church Missionary Society]].&lt;ref name="Caroline Fitzgerald 2004 p. 3"/&gt;

Marianne and Henry shared a Christian faith and they joined the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS), with the decision eventually being made that Henry would become an ordained minister and CMS missionary in the [[Bay of Islands]], [[New Zealand]]. In a letter to the Committee of the CMS of 6 August 1822, Henry said of Marianne: "''she does not accompany me merely as my wife, but as a fellow-helper in the work''".&lt;ref name="CARv1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB),  University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |chapter= Vol. I |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1038&amp;action=null|quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1w24/1 Sarah Marianne Williams.

==The early years in the Bay of Islands==
[[File:HenryWilliamsPaihia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Watercolour painting by Henry Williams of the CMS mission house at Paihia]]
On 11 September 1822 Henry and Marianne and three children embarked on the ''Lord Sidmouth'', a ship carrying women convicts to [[Port Jackson]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australian]].&lt;ref name="RE"&gt;{{cite web| last =Robert Espie (Surgeon) | first = | title =  Surgeon's Journal of Her Majesty's Female Convict Ship Lord Sidmouth (22 August 1822-1 March 1823) |chapter=|year= |publisher= (Adm. 101/44/10 | url= http://www.femaleconvicts.org.au/docs/ships/LordSidmouth1823_SJ.pdf| accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short stay with Rev. [[Samuel Marsden]], he accompanied them on ship the ''Brampton'' from [[Sydney]] to the [[Bay of Islands]], [[New Zealand]] where they arrived at [[Kerikeri]] on 7 August 1823.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' (7 August 1823) p. 54 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMS had an established mission at [[Kerikeri]] where they stayed while Henry and other CMS members and built a store of plank and timber and a [[Typha orientalis|raupo]] hut on [[Paihia]] beach. On 15 September 1823 the family moved into the raupo hut, which Marianne described as having the appearance of a beehive. In 1830 a more substantial house was built using lath and plaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' (3 September 1830) p. 192, (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chickens, ducks, goats and a horse were brought from [[Sydney]].  A garden was soon cultivated.  Food was either cultivated or imported on the infrequent ships from [[Sydney]].  Pork and [[Kumera]] could be traded from the Māori, however in the early days [[musket]]s were the item of barter which Māori wanted to trade, but [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] refused to trade muskets.   The supply of pork and other food was withheld in an attempt to pressure Henry to trade muskets for food.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Lawrence M., (1973) ''Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams'', Pegasus Press pp. 60 &amp; 75-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands''  (11 February 1824) p. 82 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The protection of the mission by the chiefs of the Ngāpuhi==
The members of the mission were under the protection of [[Hongi Hika]], the [[rangatira]] (chief) and war leader of the [[Ngāpuhi]] [[iwi]] (tribe). The immediate protector of the [[Paihia]] mission was the chief Te Koki and his wife [[Ana Hamu]], a woman of high rank and the owner of the land occupied by the mission at [[Paihia]].&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald2004-62"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Fitzgerald  |first1= Caroline |authorlink1= |title= Marianne Williams: Letters from the Bay of Islands |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year=2004|publisher= Penguin Books, New Zealand |location= |language= |isbn=0-14-301929-5  |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=62 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LMR1874tk"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rogers |first1= Lawrence M. |authorlink1= |title= Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year=1973 |publisher=Pegasus Press |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=55 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Fitzgerald  |first1= Caroline |authorlink1= |title= Te Wiremu: Henry Williams – Early Years in the North |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year=2011|publisher= Huia Publishers, New Zealand |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-86969-439-5  |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=25, 39–40 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827 Hongi Hika lead the Ngāpuhi against the tribes at [[Whangaroa]] which caused anxiety amongst the missionaries as they feared they would be caught up in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' (14 Dec 1826) p. 121, (11-19 Jan 1827) p. 123-131 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The fears of the missionaries were increased when some of the warriors of Hongi Hika, acting contrary to his orders, plundered and burnt the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] mission at Whangaroa.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of [[William Williams (bishop)|William Williams]], (1 March 1827) p.89 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; During a skirmish Hongi Hika was shot in the chest by one of his warriors, which resulted in the missionaries fearing that they would suffer in the event that a muru occurred following his death (an attack launched out of respect for a deceased chief).&lt;ref&gt;Journal of [[William Williams (bishop)|William Williams]], (1 March 1827) p. 89 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 1828 [[Hongi Hika]] spent his last moments "exhorting his followers to be valiant, and repel any force, however great, which might come against them - telling them this was all the utu, or satisfaction, that he desired".&lt;ref&gt;Journal of James Stack, Wesleyan missionary (and later CMS missionary), (12 March 1828) p. 99 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Tiki, a son of [[Pōmare I (Ngāpuhi)|Pōmare I]] (also called Whetoi)&lt;ref name="Pom1"&gt;{{cite web|first= Angela |last= Ballara |title = Pomare I | date =30 October 2012|url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/1p19/pomare-i |publisher= Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent death of [[Te Whareumu]] in 1828 threw the [[Hokianga]] into a state of uncertainty as the other Ngāpuhi chiefs debated what revenge was required.  Henry was asked to mediate between the combatants.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald101"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Fitzgerald  |first1= Caroline |authorlink1= |title= Marianne Williams: Letters from the Bay of Islands |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year=2004|publisher= Penguin Books, New Zealand |location= |language= |isbn=0-14-301929-5  |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=101 |pages=|chapter= Journal of Marianne Williams, (17 March 1828) |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ngāpuhi chiefs did not want to escalate the fighting, a peaceful resolution was achieved.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald107"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Fitzgerald  |first1= Caroline |authorlink1= |title= Te Wiremu: Henry Williams – Early Years in the North |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year=2011|publisher= Huia Publishers, New Zealand |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-86969-439-5  |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=101–107 |chapter= Journals of Henry Williams, Marianne Williams &amp; William Williams, (16–28 March 1828)  |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830 there was a battle, at [[Kororareka]] (Russell), that is called the [[Girls' War]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-SmiMaor-t1-body-d73.html online] at [[New Zealand Electronic Text Centre|NZETC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, S. Percy – Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century. Christchurch 1910&lt;/ref&gt; which also caused the missionaries to fear they would be caught up in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' (12–17 March 1829) p. 139-41 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were misunderstandings and arguments between the missionaries and the Ngāpuhi, the CMS mission was never threatened.

==The Paihia mission==
{{See also|New Zealand Church Missionary Society}}
The missionary work of [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] and his attempts to act as peacemaker in intertribal conflicts meant that he spent months at a time travelling through the North Island of New Zealand.  Marianne shared mission responsibilities with her sister-in-law, Jane Williams, together they cared for and educated their families.   Together with [[Jane Williams (missionary)|Jane Williams]], Marianne set up a boarding school for Māori girls;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' (16 October 1826) p. 112 (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and provided classes to the children of CMS missionaries in the morning with schools for Māori children and adults in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' (6 Nov 1826) pp. 116 &amp; 133 (Caroline Fitzgerald 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Schools were established in the communities inland from the [[Bay of Islands]]. Marianne trained and supervised the teachers, who were her daughters, nieces or future daughters-in-law.&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"/&gt;

The domestic responsibilities of Marianne extended beyond her large family and included Māori and [[Pakeha]] visitors to the mission as well as providing assistance to other CMS members in [[Paihia]], [[Kerikeri]] and [[Waimate North]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Lawrence M., (1973) ''Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams'', Pegasus Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from the Bay of Islands'' (Caroline Fitzgerald, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Marianne and Henry had eleven children:&lt;ref name=faith19&gt;Evans 1992, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life at Pakaraka==
Henry and Marianne moved to [[Pakaraka]] when Henry refused to back down in an argument with Governor [[George Grey]] over the amount of land Henry had acquired so as to provide for his children. In this argument Bishop Selwyn took the side of Grey, and in 1849 the CMS decided to dismiss Henry from service. However, in 1854 Henry was reinstated to the CMS following representations to the CMS by Governor Grey, Bishop Selwyn and supporters of Henry Williams.&lt;ref name=mitcalfe35&gt;Mitcalfe 1963, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry and Marianne lived in the house known as ''The Retreat'', that still stands at Pakaraka.&lt;ref&gt;see: [http://williamshistorichouse.org.nz/ the website] of the Henry and William Williams Memorial Museum Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

Marianne Williams died at [[Pakaraka]], [[New Zealand]], on 16 December 1879 and was buried in the grounds of the Holy Trinity Church at [[Pakaraka]] alongside the grave of [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]].

'''The Milton Fisher Scholarship for Innovation and Creativity''' is an annual four-year [[scholarship]] sponsored by the [[Renée B. Fisher Foundation]] and housed at the [[Community Foundation for Greater New Haven]]. Four-year scholarships of varying amounts based on need are awarded to high school juniors and seniors, and college freshmen, who will be attending a university in the [[Connecticut]] and the [[New York City]] metropolitan area.

==Purpose==
Since 2003, the Milton Fisher Scholarship has sought to reward students who have demonstrated exceptional originality in [[problem solving]]. In particular, applicants are those students who have:
*solved an artistic, scientific, or technical problem in new or unusual ways
*created a distinctive solution to a problem faced by a school, community, or family
*developed an original and innovative approach to save the environment or improve people’s health

Recipients are selected on the basis of their applications, which include [[essay]]s and [[Letter of recommendation|letters of recommendation]]. The deadline for applications varies each year but is often in early to mid-April. 

==Name==
The scholarship is named for [[Milton Fisher]], an [[lawyer|attorney]] and [[investment banker]] from New York City who made his home in Connecticut from 1960 until his death in 2001. He served on the boards of several public companies,  and was the author several books, including two about [[Wall Street]]. His book ''Intuition: How to Use it in Your Life'' has been translated into several languages.

Additionally, he was also deeply devoted to the development of original thinking and [[creative process]]es. For over 25 years, he taught a unique course for adults called "Applied Creativity", which focused less on [[creativity]] as expressed in the arts (as it is often understood), and more on helping people be more creative in all aspects of their lives, developing creative problem-solving skills and innovative approaches to challenges they faced individually, or that faced their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbffoundation.org/about_mfs.html|title=Milton Fisher Scholarship for Innovation and Creativity|website=www.rbffoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monster parents''' ({{lang-ja|モンスターペアレント}}, {{zh|t=怪獸家長}}) is a term characterizing irrational parenting. Monster parents are known to raise their children with a "bizarre blend of authoritarianism and overprotectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201608/the-rise-the-monster-parent|title=The Rise of the Monster Parent|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are overprotective by virtue of making numerous requests and complaints to their children's teachers, which themselves are often viewed as "unreasonable." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mylifetime.com.hk/2012/02/21/i-am-not-a-monster-parent/|title=“Helicopter Parents”? “Monster Parents”? “Free-Range Parenting?” – Part 2 – I Am Not a Monster Parent|date=2012-02-21|website=Lifetime Development|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase originated in Japan and gained widespread usage in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201608/the-rise-the-monster-parent|title=The Rise of the Monster Parent|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
The phrase "monster parent" was originally a [[Wasei-eigo]] term coined by Japanese educator [[Yōichi Mukōyama]] ([[:ja:向山洋一]]) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;教室ツーウェイ, p.9, August 2007 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently made known in Asia by a Japanese TV drama also called ''Monster Parents''. The show depicted a series of observations from real life situations in schools where parents of students often interfered in school affairs and teachers' teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mylifetime.com.hk/2012/02/21/i-am-not-a-monster-parent/|title=“Helicopter Parents”? “Monster Parents”? “Free-Range Parenting?” – Part 2 – I Am Not a Monster Parent|date=2012-02-21|website=Lifetime Development|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was broadcast from July 1, 2008, to September 9, 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Oswald|title=Japan and Origin of Monster Parents|url=http://helicopter-parents-and-anxiety.blogspot.hk/2012/12/monster-parents-in-japan.html|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, the phrase had also seen widespread usage in Hong Kong as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2011/05/23/ED1105230008.htm|title=專家之言：強加負面標籤  隨時弄巧反拙 - 香港文匯報|website=paper.wenweipo.com|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Hong Kong Kids phenomenon}}

===Education system===
Under the [[Hong Kong education system]], most students are required to attend interviews that assess their academic and extracurricular achievements in order for them to attend academically prestigious schools. Most schools will select a group of academically gifted interviewees to attend. Because of this, parents have been observed to pressure their children to excel in school and extracurricular activities in order to get into their selected school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhao|first1=Shirley|title=Hong Kong parents say pushing children too hard doesn't work|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1460601/hong-kong-parents-say-pushing-children-too-hard-doesnt-work?page=all|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once their children get into these schools, the parents may continue to voice complaints in order to make their concerns heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2016/08/04/who-are-hong-kongs-monster-parents/|title=Who Are Hong Kong’s ‘Monster Parents’? · Global Voices|date=2016-08-04|website=Global Voices|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Monster parents exhibit an authoritarian parenting style, forcing children to follow tight schedules with little time to manage their daily lives and routines. They are highly-protective in taking care of their children and are seen as restrictive and controlling. They often spoil their children in order to get them to do tasks that the parents wish them to do. According to [[Global Voices Online|Global Voices]], Hong Kong has been a knowledge-based economic system since the early 2000s. This puts pressure on parents to ensure that their children excel in early childhood and gain acceptance into prestigious schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2016/08/04/who-are-hong-kongs-monster-parents/|title=Who Are Hong Kong’s ‘Monster Parents’? · Global Voices|date=2016-08-04|website=Global Voices|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of monster parents has been thought to be caused by a decline in birth rate in recent years. Children are also coming from other parts of China, often called "cross-border students," and attending schools that only Hong Kong children were originally allowed to attend.

===Traits===
Monster parents are often identified as meeting four criteria, according to many that come in contact with them. They are first identified as having an intense need to control their children. This causes the children to develop an inability to think for themselves. Next, they often force their children to take part in activities that they do not necessarily like. This includes taking extra classes on top of their normal ones, and participating in extracurricular activities that they are not interested in. Third, monster parents look at academics before anything else regarding their children. If their children do poorly in school, monster parents blame it on everything but the children. Lastly, monster parents think that their children are right in everything they do. According to them, they can do no wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201608/the-rise-the-monster-parent|title=The Rise of the Monster Parent|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on children==

===Social effects===
Monster parents often interfere in their children's personal life and tend to cosset them. As a result, these children often end up developing  anti-social personality traits and attitudes and tend to be overly-reliant on their parents. A commonly-used term in Asia to describe this phenomenon is "[[princess sickness|prince/princess sickness]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2016/08/04/who-are-hong-kongs-monster-parents/|title=Who Are Hong Kong’s ‘Monster Parents’? · Global Voices|date=2016-08-04|website=Global Voices|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have also been seen to exhibit tendencies towards aggression and violence to get their way, according to some researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yuen-chan/hong-kong-monster-parents_b_4058306.html|title=The Existential Angst of Hong Kong's 'Monster Parents'|last=Kong|first=Yuen Chan Lecturer of Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong|date=2013-10-07|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological effects===
Monster parents tend to be very overprotective of their children and often coddle them for most of their childhood. Because of this, children of monster parents often grow up to exhibit bad behavior and [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic personality traits]]. Monster parents also place a great deal of pressure on their children to excel in school in order to be admitted into more prestigious schools. This places an enormous amount of pressure and stress on the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201608/the-rise-the-monster-parent|title=The Rise of the Monster Parent|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children have to handle a significant workload at school, which may be too intense for them to deal with. They are constantly expected to expand their knowledge and skills. Children of monster parents often feel depressed and disappointed in themselves if they fail to meet the expectations of their parents. This [[anxiety]] can build up in the children and cause severe mental illness. It may even lead to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Oswald|title=Monster Parents, Helicopter Parents &amp; Anxiety|url=http://helicopter-parents-and-anxiety.blogspot.hk|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
There are foreseeable influences caused by monster parenting style. It may affect children’s academic developments and their future careers as well. With the monster parenting style, it is believed that the parents may have extremely high expectations about their children’s academic achievements. Indeed, children may appear to start feeling the pressure when they start failing to reach the high hopes and expectations of their parents while academic stress arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Oswald|title=Monster Parents, Helicopter Parents &amp; Anxiety|url=http://helicopter-parents-and-anxiety.blogspot.hk|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the lack of independence may influence the children’s future career as there are no opportunities for them to practice and learn before entering the workplace. A good deal of how one parents is shaped by how they were parented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Belkin|first1=Lisa|title=It’s Not Your Mom and Dad’s Parenting|url=http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/changes-in-parenting-over-generations/?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reasonable to assume that monster parenting style is a vicious cycle and becomes a long-term social issue. Parents wield enormous clout in the development of their children, as they are who the children look up to and learn from. Parenting patterns are passed down from generation to generation. Thus, excessively protective parenting style may influence more and more generation until there is an alternative parenting style to replace it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3895">'''''Most Likely To Succeed''''' is a feature-length documentary examining the history of [[education]] in the United States and revealing the growing shortcomings of conventional education methods in today’s innovative world. The film explores compelling new approaches that aim to transform learning as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Likely To Succeed|url=http://www.mltsfilm.org/|website=mostlikelytosucceed.org|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}}

Directed by documentarian [[Greg Whiteley]], the film has been an official selection of two dozen of the world’s top film festivals, including [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]], [[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]], and [[AFI Docs|AFI DOCS]]. Since the film's release, more than 3,000 communities worldwide have shared a screening of ''Most Likely To Succeed''.

== Overview ==

Over a century ago, American education underwent a dramatic transformation as the iconic one-room schoolhouse evolved into an effective system that produced an unmatched workforce tailored for the 20th Century. As the world economy shifts and traditional white-collar jobs begin to disappear, that same system remains intact, producing potentially chronic levels of unemployment among graduates in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dintersmith|first1=Ted|title=Most Likely to Succeed|date=2015|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=1230 Ave. of the Americas, NY, NY|isbn=9781442392489|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film follows students into the classrooms of [[High Tech High School|High Tech High]], an innovative new school in San Diego. There, over the course of a school year, two groups of ninth graders take on ambitious, project-based challenges that promote critical skills rather than rote memorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Dintersmith, Ted (Director) | date=January 25, 2015 | title=Most Likely to Succeed | medium=Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

"Most Likely To Succeed" has received critical praise, ''[[Education Week]]'' calling the film "among the best edu-documentaries ever produced"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Week|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/road-trips-in-education/2015/05/most_likely_to_succeed.html/|website=edweek.org|accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' remarking the movie is "an engaging look" at 21st-century education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/succeed-sundance-review-767812/|website=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the film's premiere, Executive Producer Ted Dintersmith took ''Most Likely To Succeed'' on a 50-state tour, screening the film for learning communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/11/03/a-venture-capitalist-searches-for-the-purpose-of-school-heres-what-he-found/|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dintersmith is now finishing a book inspired by his experiences of sharing the film in every state.

Ross Kasun, 2017 New Jersey Superintendent of the Year, credits "Most Likely To Succeed" for driving change in his district, saying, "It provided a compelling rationale on the new thinking needed for our schools and generated a wave of excitement across the district.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Association of School Administrators|url=http://www.njasa.net/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=1&amp;ModuleInstanceID=825&amp;ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=6293&amp;PageID=1|website=njasa.net|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS)''' program (pronounced ''NAY-Tops'') prescribes general flight and operating instructions and procedures applicable to the operation of all U.S. naval aircraft and related activities.  The program issues policy and procedural guidance of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO) and the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] (CMC) that is applicable to all [[U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] aviation personnel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite book |title=NATOPS General Flight and Operating Instructions: OPNAV Instruction 3710.7T |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-8cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR3|date=1 March 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227114659/http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil/Aviation/aeromedical/downloads/References/OPNAV%203710/3710_7t%20%20MARCH%2004.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2009 |location=Arlington, Va. |publisher=Department of the Navy, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations |isbn=9781935327714 |access-date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each NATOPS manual for each [[USN]] and [[USMC]] Type/Model/Series (T/M/S)&lt;ref&gt;T/M/S for USN and USMC aircraft is analogous to the mission design series (MDS) for USAF aircraft.&lt;/ref&gt; of aircraft has the following statement:

{{quote|NATOPS is a positive approach toward improving combat readiness and achieving a substantial reduction in the aircraft accident rate.  Standardization, based on professional knowledge and experience, provides the basis for development of an efficient and sound operational procedure.  The standardization program is not planned to stifle individual initiative, but rather to aid the commanding officer in increasing the unit’s combat potential without reducing command prestige or responsibility.||OPNAV Instruction 3710.7U&lt;ref&gt;http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/03000%20Naval%20Operations%20and%20Readiness/03-700%20Flight%20and%20Air%20Space%20Support%20Services/3710.7U.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History/raison d'être==
NATOPS was established by the [[United States Navy]] in 1961 as a positive approach towards improving combat readiness and achieving a substantial reduction in naval aircraft mishaps in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.

In 1950, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps lost a total of 776 aircraft (roughly two aircraft per day or a rate of 54 major mishaps per 10,000 flight hours).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014150340/http://safetycenter.navy.mil///presentations/aviation/orm.htm Operational Risk Management Presentation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous technical initiatives, including the angled [[flight deck]] on [[aircraft carrier]]s in 1954 and various standardization programs, were credited with significantly reducing the rate to 19 major mishaps per 10,000 flight hours by 1961, and further to nine major mishaps per 10,000 flight hours by 1970 (the current rate, for comparison, is under two major mishaps per 10,000 flight hours).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

A lack of standardization and training in both aircraft maintenance and flight operations was cited as a causal factor in a large percentage of mishaps.  Several standardization programs were initiated in the late 1950s and early 1960s to counter this problem.  The first was the Naval Aviation Maintenance Program (NAMP) in 1959.  Prior to the NAMP, aircraft maintenance practices were completely non-standardized across US [[naval aviation]].  For example, an aircraft maintenance procedure might be significantly different from one squadron to the next, even though both squadrons operated exactly the same T/M/S aircraft on the same base or in the same air group.  The NAMP standardized maintenance procedures across all of naval aviation, or what has been termed since the early 2000s as the entire "naval aviation enterprise".

The second standardization initiative began in 1961 with the introduction of the [[fleet replacement squadron]] (FRS) program.  The purpose of an FRS is to indoctrinate newly designated aircrew ([[naval aviator]]s, [[naval flight officer]]s, enlisted naval aircrewman) and aircraft maintenance personnel into the peculiarities of specific aircraft.  Prior to the FRS concept, qualified pilots transitioning to a new aircraft were essentially told how to start it, and then sent to go fly.  The final major standardization initiative put in place was the NATOPS program in 1961.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==NATOPS publications==
NATOPS manuals contain standard flight doctrine and the optimum operating procedures for the aircraft model or aviation activity (e.g., CV NATOPS, LSO NATOPS, etc.) concerned.  They do not include tactical doctrine.

There are numerous publications associated with NATOPS covering three basic areas:

* The overarching document establishing the program is Chief of Naval Operations Instruction (OPNAVINST) 3710.7:  ''NATOPS General Flight And Operating Instructions''
* Specific aircraft NATOPS flight manuals for each [[USN]] and [[USMC]] T/M/S aircraft; these are similar to the Air Force Technical Order "Dash 1" series flight manuals in the [[U.S. Air Force]] for each mission design series (MDS) aircraft in [[USAF]] service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baseops.net/militarypilot/glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Miscellaneous manuals

===Compliance===
Compliance with stipulated manual procedures is mandatory, but deviations are allowed per the following statements found in all NATOPS manuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to remain effective, NATOPS must be dynamic and stimulate rather than suppress individual thinking.  Since aviation is a continuing, progressive profession, it is both desirable and necessary that new ideas and new techniques be expeditiously evaluated and incorporated if proven to be sound.

contents of all directives cited must be studied and understood.
:—''NATOPS General Flight and Operating Instructions: OPNAV Instruction 3710.7T'', page 1-1&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===OPNAVINST 3710.7===
The "3710" or "OPNAV 3710", as it is commonly referred to, is issued by the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.  Often called the "General NATOPS", it is the overarching document in the NATOPS program and it provides policy and procedural guidance applicable to a broad spectrum of users.

Among a variety of topics, 3710 covers:
* The general scope and purpose of the NATOPS program
* What naval aircraft may be used for and who may pilot and crew them
* Flight demonstrations, authorized airfields, cross-country flights and fuel planning
* Supersonic flight operations and aerobatic flight
* Individual qualifications, including instrument ratings
* Aircrew and aircraft documentation requirements

===Specific aircraft manuals===
[[Image:Aircraft NATOPS Manual cover.png|thumb|Aircraft specific NATOPS manual cover. These manuals are typically about 2 inches thick.]]

These are manuals for specific aircraft models containing standardized ground and flight operating procedures, training requirements, aircraft limitations, and technical data necessary for safe and effective operation of the aircraft.  There are typically several volumes, including supplements for weapons systems, performance charts, servicing checklist, and post maintenance functional checkflight checklist.
:Pocket checklists (or "PCL") contain pertinent extracts from the main publications necessary to normal operations, emergency procedures, and training.  [[Image:NATOPS Pocket Checklist cover.jpg|thumb|Pocket checklists are designed for quick access to information in the cockpit.]]

NATOPS flight manuals are prepared using a concept that provides the aircrew with information for operation of the aircraft, but detailed operation and interaction is not provided. This concept was selected for a number of reasons: reader interest increases as the size of a technical publication decreases, comprehension increases as the technical complexity decreases, and accidents decrease as reader interest and comprehension increase. To implement this streamlined concept, observance of the following rules was attempted:

# The [[Naval Aviator|pilot]], [[Naval Flight Officer|NFO]] or enlisted naval aircrewman is considered to have above-average intelligence and normal (average) common sense.
# No values (pressure, temperature, quantity, etc.) which cannot be read in the cockpit are stated, except where such use provides the pilot with a value judgment. Only the information required to fly the aircraft is provided.
# Multiple failures (emergencies) are not covered.
# Simple words in preference to more complex or quasi-technical words are used and, unnecessary and/or confusing word modifiers are avoided.

===Miscellaneous manuals===
Miscellaneous NATOPS manuals are issued for special aircraft-related operations or systems that require fleet-wide standardization.  [[Image:CV NATOPS.png|thumb|right|CV NATOPS Manual with distribution notice.]]
They include:

* [[Air traffic control]]
* [[Aerial refueling|Air-to-air refueling]]
* Ground refueling
* Aircraft signals
* Carrier operations (CV NATOPS Manual)
* Air-capable ship operations
* Amphibious assault ship (LHA/LHD) operations
* [[Flight deck]]/hangar deck operations
* [[Instrument flight rules]]
* [[Landing signal officer]] procedures
* Weapons
* Crash and salvage

===Publication changes===
Changing NATOPS publications requires following a full approval process.  Changes can be rapidly accomplished for urgent/safety of flight issues (via electronic directive to make pen and ink modifications to publications/procedures).  There is also an annual conference for manual users (aircrew, maintenance personnel, engineers, policy makers, etc.) do deal with more routine/less urgent matters.  These conferences produce a list of "recommended changes" that are then vetted by an approval process prior to promulgation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/03000%20Naval%20Operations%20and%20Readiness/03-700%20Flight%20and%20Air%20Space%20Support%20Services/3710.7T-1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825043139/http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/03000%20Naval%20Operations%20and%20Readiness/03-700%20Flight%20and%20Air%20Space%20Support%20Services/3710.7T-1.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key people==
The key people involved in NATOPS go from the Chief of Naval Operations all the way down to individual users.

* NATOPS model manager: The unit commander designated to administer the NATOPS program for a specific aircraft model or aircraft related system.  NATOPS model managers conduct annual NATOPS evaluations of units assigned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
* NATOPS program manager: An officer assigned by the NATOPS model manager who performs administrative responsibilities for the NATOPS program for a given T/M/S aircraft, operational system, or training/support system and who is given written authority to act on behalf of the NATOPS model manager in NATOPS-related matters.  The NATOPS program manager is highly qualified in his/her aircraft or activity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
* NATOPS evaluator: A highly qualified air crewmember assigned to a NATOPS evaluation unit who conducts annual unit NATOPS evaluations for a given flight crew position.  NATOPS evaluators are former NATOPS instructors at the fleet squadron level, typically assigned to a "NATOPS training team" embedded within a given [[fleet replacement squadron]] and answering to the NATOPS program manager.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
* NATOPS instructor: A highly qualified air crewmember whose primary or secondary duty within an operational fleet squadron, training command squadron, or air test &amp; evaluation squadron is administering the NATOPS evaluation program by conducting positional upgrade and/or annual periodic check rides of flight crew personnel for specific flight crew positions in a given aircraft within that squadron or unit.  This position is analogous to a unit flight crew standardization/evaluation (Stan/Eval) pilot, navigator/combat systems officer, air battle manager or enlisted aircrewman in a USAF flying wing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
* Unit NATOPS officer: A [[naval aviator]] or [[naval flight officer]] whose primary duty is to administer the NATOPS program within a squadron or unit.  The NATOPS officer may also be a NATOPS instructor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Implementing NATOPS==
The standard operating procedures prescribed in NATOPS manuals represent the optimum methods of operating various aircraft and related equipment.  The NATOPS evaluation is intended to evaluate individual and unit compliance by observing and grading adherence to NATOPS procedures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Individual NATOPS evaluation===

====Flight evaluation====
Individual pilots, flight officers or crewmembers are evaluated when initially qualifying (or requalifying after a non-flying assignment) in a given T/M/S aircraft, and a minimum of annually thereafter.  Flight crews may also be evaluated prior to annually as part of a unit NATOPS evaluation administered by NATOPS evaluators.  NATOPS exams consist of an open book examination, a closed book examination, an oral examination, and an evaluation flight or simulator check.  Use of operational flight trainers (OFTs) / weapon system trainers (WSTs) is encouraged for simulated emergencies and scenarios that present significantly increased risk when actually performed in an aircraft.  If no such flight simulator / training device is available, aircraft may be used.  Evaluation flights in aircraft that require simulated emergencies are avoided.

====Ground evaluation====
Prior to commencing the evaluation flight, an evaluee must achieve a minimum grade of qualified on both open book and closed book NATOPS examinations.  The oral examination is also part of the ground evaluation, but may be conducted as part of the flight evaluation.

===Unit NATOPS evaluation===
A unit NATOPS evaluation is conducted for every squadron/unit every 18 months by the appropriate NATOPS evaluator(s).  The unit NATOPS evaluation includes NATOPS evaluations for each crew position (ground evaluation and an evaluation flight) selected at random by the evaluator to measure overall adherence to NATOPS procedures.  NATOPS evaluators will re-evaluate all squadron NATOPS Instructors during a unit NATOPS evaluation and will also select one flight crewmember from each aircraft position at random for a flight or simulator evaluation.  For random evaluation check selectees who perform well beyond expectations, NATOPS evaluators may recommend to the squadron commanding officer that the individual be tracked for qualification and designation as a NATOPS instructor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The '''Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT)''' is a nonverbal measure of general ability designed by Jack A. Naglieri and published by [[Pearson Education]].
&lt;ref name="PearsonAs"&gt;https://www.pearsonassessments.com/learningassessments/products/100001822/naglieri-nonverbal-ability-test-third-edition-nnat3.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test - Individual Form was first published in 2004. Two versions were published in 2007 and 2008, respectively. This includes the group administered Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test - Second Edition and the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test - Online version. The most current version is NNAT3.&lt;ref name="PearsonAs"/&gt; Like all nonverbal ability tests, the NNAT is intended to assess cognitive ability independently of linguistic and cultural background.&lt;ref name="PearsonAs"/&gt;

== Present use ==
These tests may be administered to K&amp;ndash;12 school children on an individual or group basis as a means to identify potentially gifted children for placement in accelerated programs.&lt;ref name="PearsonAs"/&gt;

== NNAT and the media ==
Beginning in the 2012-13 school year, the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test- 2nd Edition (NNAT-2) replaced the Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA).&lt;ref&gt;http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0E2224D7-DF21-42DA-8C9E-BC4FDEC157FB/0/NYCGiftedandTalentedAssessmentFAQ_413.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision sparked some degree of controversy{{why?|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref name="dnai"&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121024/new-york-city/new-gifted-talented-test-so-hard-it-even-leaves-parents-stumped |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121225318/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121024/new-york-city/new-gifted-talented-test-so-hard-it-even-leaves-parents-stumped |archivedate=2013-01-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The NNAT-2 is considered{{by whom?|date=October 2013}} significantly harder than the Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA) which it replaced. 

In New York City, the NNAT-2 makes up 50% of the gifted and talented exam, the other 50% is the [[Otis–Lennon School Ability Test]] (OLSAT).{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Criticism ==
The NNAT has been found by one study to show excessive score variability, with within-grade standard deviations reaching as high as 20 points. This has the effect of both overrepresenting and underrepresenting index scores - that is, more students received very high or very low scores than expected. Lohman ''et al.'' found that 3.4 times as many students scored in the 130+ range on the NNAT as expected.&lt;ref name=Lohman2008&gt;{{Citation

The '''Permanent University Fund''' ('''PUF''') is a [[sovereign wealth fund]] created by the [[Texas|State of Texas]] to fund public higher education within the state.  A portion of the returns from the PUF are annually directed towards the Available University Fund (AUF), which distributes the funds according to provisions set forth by the 1876 [[Texas Constitution]], subsequent constitutional amendments, and the board of regents of the [[University of Texas System]] and the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]].  The PUF provides extra funds, above monies from tax revenues, to the UT&amp;nbsp;System and the Texas A&amp;M System which collectively have approximately 50&amp;nbsp;percent of state public university students.  The PUF does not provide any funding to other public Universities in the State of Texas.

==History==
The Permanent University Fund was established by the 1876 Constitution of the State of Texas.&lt;ref name="amendments"&gt;{{cite web |title= Amendments to the Texas Constitution Since 1876 |url= http://www.tlc.state.tx.us/pubsconamend/constamend1876.pdf |format=pdf |date=April 2008 |accessdate=2009-02-08 |publisher=Texas Legislative Council (Research division)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, its assets included one-tenth of [[University of Texas at Austin]] lands bordering the railroads (UT Austin was granted {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} in West Texas as compensation) as well as {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} additional.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/annexation/part5/question8.html |title=Texas Annexation Questions and Answers |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2009-02-08 |publisher=Texas State Library &amp; Archives Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the 1876 Constitution organized the University of Texas System, under which governance of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and UT Austin was placed.  The original Constitution provided for preference in PUF investment in Texas and U.S. bonds.&lt;ref name="amendments" /&gt; In 1883, Texas and Pacific Railroad returned {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}}, deemed too worthless to survey, to the State Government, which turned the land over to the PUF.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utimco.org/scripts/internet/puf_timeline.asp |title=PUF Timeline - Home |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-02-08 |publisher=The University of Texas Investment Management Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the little revenue PUF earned from its lands were from [[grazing]] leases.&lt;ref name="txtell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://txtell.lib.utexas.edu/stories/p0002-full.html |title=Permanent University Fund: Investing in the Future of Texas |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |publisher=TxTell (University of Texas at Austin) |author=Block, Lourenda |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204030641/http://txtell.lib.utexas.edu/stories/p0002-full.html |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845 meant that Texas kept its public lands.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt;  The 1894 discovery of oil in [[Corsicana, Texas]] and the 1901 discovery of oil at [[Spindletop]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]], began a subsequent oil boom in Texas and the western U.S.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Dee |authorlink1=Dee Brown (writer) |title=The American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yys8EJC6xWUC |accessdate=2009-02-08 |year=1994 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=978-0-684-80441-5 |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1901, the Texas Legislature authorized UT Austin to "sell, lease and otherwise control" oil and mineral rights for PUF land.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt;  In late 1916, after a report was submitted to the Land Commission of the UT Board of Regents, the Board forbade the sale of any University lands, including those of the PUF.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;  On 28 May 1923, the Santa Rita No. 1 [[oil well]], in [[Reagan County, Texas|Reagan County]] discovered the first oil on PUF land; in the following decades, the PUF's revenue made UT Austin among the best-endowed in the nation.&lt;ref name="txtell" /&gt;  In 1924, the UT Regent Robert Story requested that the legislature direct oil rights revenue directly into the [[Available University Fund]]; the [[Twenty-ninth Texas Legislature|29th legislature]] complied on 3 April 1925 by passing House Bill 246.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcase.com/Google/Start.aspx?C=a84df759c3308816846f698703120a734629ece22903cb6e&amp;D=85811112fced77bb272fb8059ea18d6912a4edcf51cc5e0d |title=State v. Hatcher, 281 S.W. 192 (Tex., 1926) |publisher=Fastcase |author=[[Texas Supreme Court]] |date=1926-03-10 |accessdate=2009-02-14 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The March 10, 1926, Texas Supreme Court case ''State [[ex rel]] Attorney General, v. Hatcher,'' decided against State Treasurer [[W. Gregory Hatcher]], who refused to comply with Attorney General Dan Moody's demands that oil rights revenue be placed into the PUF rather than the AUF.  The Texas Supreme Court concluded that the 1876 Constitution directed subterranean revenue to be "corpus of the estate" rather than UT Austin disposable income.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

In 1928, State Attorney General Claude Pollard issued a legal opinion that the UT Board of Regents could issue bonds against the AUF, the account that holds the annual distributions of the PUF.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;  In 1931, the legislature authorized UT Regent-requested bonds to improve UT Austin's buildings and campus in general.  As the provision was repealed in 1932, it granted the only time ever that PUF principal was spent.&lt;ref name="txtell" /&gt;  The AUF's distributions were directed, in 1931, by the legislature such that 2/3 of the money would go to UT Austin and 1/3 to Texas A&amp;M, and also extended to be available for purchase of equipment and building construction.&lt;ref name="amendments" /&gt;  In 1947, after [[World War II]] and during the education boom from the [[G.I. Bill|Servicemen's Readjustment Act]] of 1944, a constitutional amendment was passed that authorized the issuance of $15 million in AUF bonds, $10 million to the UT System and $5 million to the Texas A&amp;M System.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

1956 saw another amendment to the state constitution, this time setting the maximum bond issuance equal to the PUF's total asset value excluding land, as well as allowing [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School|Southwestern Medical School]], [[The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston|Health Science Center at Houston]], and [[The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center|M. D. Anderson Cancer Center]], all of the UT System, access to AUF funds.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;  In addition, the 1956 amendment guaranteed the 2/3 UT, 1/3 A&amp;M AUF split that the Legislature had directed in 1931.  In 1968, the PUF constitution was amended again to include a broader range of both corporate bonds and investments available to PUF, as well as applying a "prudent person" standard for some amendments.

The State Attorney General in 1978 issued an opinion that interest accruing in the PUF should be used to pay outstanding bonds and finance permanent educational improvements, per the PUF constitution.  In 1984, the bond issuance capacity of the PUF was raised to 30% and the issuance of AUF funds was expanded to all existing University of Texas System and Texas A&amp;M University System schools; another voter-approved amendment the same year authorized the creation of the Higher Education Assistance Fund, to help all public higher education institutions not covered by the PUF.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;  As oil rights revenue was dropping from $262 million in 1981 to $57 million in 1995, the 1991 Texas Legislature reduced funding for the UT and Texas A&amp;M University Systems by about one-quarter.  This placed increased pressure for the PUF to make up much of the difference, even after the 1984 expansion of the PUF's list of beneficiaries.  On 1 March 1996, the UT System Board of Regents authorized the nonprofit University of Texas Investment Management Company (UTIMCO) to manage UT System assets, including all of the PUF.&lt;ref name="txtell" /&gt;

A 1988 constitutional amendment eliminated all investment restrictions related to the PUF for the UT Board of Directors in favor of adopting the "prudent person" standard for all investments, which was subsequently amended in 1999 to the "prudent investor" standard for investments.&lt;ref name="amendments" /&gt;  Another 1999 statewide vote adopted an amendment that made further changes to the PUF.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;  The first was that distributions to the AUF would equal both [[Realization (finance)|realized]] (income return) and unrealized ([[capital gain]]s) PUF assets.  The second directed payments to PUF expenses come from PUF assets; the third directed the establishment of an investment and return policy that would preserve both a stable AUF distribution and the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real value]] of the investments.

In 2001, PUF annual distribution to the AUF was changed from 4.50% to 4.75%.  On 7 February 2008, after months of study, the UT Board of Regents authorized an increase in AUF annual transfers, from 4.75% of the PUF value to 5.00%, citing recent PUF growth of more than 10% per year and unrest over the large annual increases in tuition at UT Austin.  The Texas A&amp;M System chancellor lauded the increased distribution, which now matched other Texas A&amp;M endowment distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-utendow_08met.ART.North.Edition1.4618fa6.html |title=UT System increases endowment spending to help ease tuition burden |author=Hacker, Holly |date=2008-02-08 |publisher=''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' |accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, the Permanent University Fund earned approximately $40,000, mostly from grazing leases;&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/khp02 |title=Permanent University Fund |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2009-02-11 |publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]] Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 1925, income had increased to $2,000 per day (about $700,000 per year), and by 1943 was just under $1 million per year.&lt;ref name="txtell" /&gt;  In the late 1950s, the PUF earned about $8,513,000 per year and was valued above $283,642,000; in 1990, the PUF was valued at $3,541,314,800 and earned $266,119,000 in income. Currently, PUF land assets deliver proceeds through oil, gas, sulfur, and water royalties, rentals on mineral leases, and gains on fiduciary investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://txtell.lib.utexas.edu/stories/p0002-full.html |title=Permanent University Fund: Investing in the Future of Texas |author=TxTell |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204030641/http://txtell.lib.utexas.edu/stories/p0002-full.html |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing leases and other surface rights income are distributed to the AUF.&lt;ref name="audit 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utimco.org/Funds/Endowment/PUF/PUF2010AuditedFinancials.pdf |title=Financial Statements and Independent Auditors’ Report, Permanent University Fund |publisher=UTIMCO |date=2010-10-09 |author=Deloitte &amp; Touche |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

this statement lacks a citiation, and may be contradicted by official externally audited sources:

The PUF principal in fall 2005 was approximately $15 billion, second only to [[Harvard University]]'s endowment.

==Management==
The PUF's land assets are managed by the University of Texas System Administration.&lt;ref name="audit 2010" /&gt; The PUF's fiduciary assets are managed by the University of Texas/Texas A&amp;M Investment Management Company (UTIMCO), a nonprofit group formed to manage various assets of the UT&amp;nbsp;and Texas&amp;nbsp;A&amp;M Systems and governed by a volunteer Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="statesman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/02/07/0207utimco.html |title=Chairman of UT regents defends bonuses for investment staff |date=2009-02-07 |accessdate=2009-02-11 |publisher=''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' |author=Haurwitz, Ralph K.

Of these, at least three of the members appointed by the UT System Regents and one appointed by the Texas A&amp;M System Regents must be investment professionals. Additionally, the UT System chancellor is normally one of that system's seven representatives on the UTIMCO board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utimco.org/funds/allfunds/2017annual/pdf/2017_UTIMCO_Annual_Report%20-%20Printable%20-%20High%20Res.pdf |title=2017 Annual Report |publisher=University of Texas/Texas A&amp;M Investment Management Company |accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utimco.org/pressreleases/20071018_PressRelease.htm |title=Zimmerman Appoints Cathy Iberg President of UTIMCO |date=2008-10-02 |accessdate=2009-02-09 |publisher=University of Texas Investment Management Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, UTIMCO has a [[Chief Executive Officer]] and Chief Investment Officer appointed by the Board and a President appointed by the CEO and Board; all employees of UTIMCO except the nine-member Board of Directors receive a salary and are eligible for annual bonuses.&lt;ref name="statesman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utimco.org/scripts/internet/employment.asp |title=Employment Opportunities |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-02-09 |publisher= University of Texas Investment Management Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, UTIMCO drew criticism from the state's legislative and executive branches for awarding bonuses to employees despite the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]].  Robert Rowling, chairman of UTIMCO and vice chairman of the UT Austin Board of Regents, insisted that the bonuses he authorized were for the fiscal year ending 31 July 2008, in which the PUF net fiduciary assets decreased by 3.26%, or $383 million, as compared to nearly 14% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  The Chairman of the Board of Regents defended Rowling, stating that the contracts obligated bonus payment and the large amounts, $1.05 million for the UTIMCO CEO and $2.3 million for other employees combined, were fairly inflexible.&lt;ref name="statesman" /&gt;

Governor [[Rick Perry]] and Lieutenant Governor [[David Dewhurst]] criticized "[W]e can’t imagine how such compensation is justified considering that in the same month this meeting was held, reports surfaced that UTIMCO’s earnings for the year had dropped an estimated 23 percent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easttexasreview.com/story.htm?StoryID=6111 |title=Regent resigns in UTIMCO controversy |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2009-02-11 |publisher=''East Texas Review'' |author=Lavergne, Mark (''Lone Star Review'') }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perry's spokeswoman attacked the contracts, stating, "The compensation structure ought to incorporate the health of the fund, whereby incentives are not immediately paid out if the fund is in the red."&lt;ref name="statesman" /&gt;  State Senator Kevin Eltife criticized CEO Bruce Zimmerman's bonus.  "Most people out there on the street are scared to death and we just paid you a million-dollar bonus [...] If there's that much money floating around, maybe there's too much."&lt;ref name="chron bonus" /&gt;  After heated interrogation by the State Senate Finance Committee, Rowling resigned from both his chairmanship of UTIMCO and vice chairmanship of UT Austin's Board of Regents.

==Allowed institutions==
The following are all available beneficiaries, as of 2018, of the Available University Fund, which distributes the annual dividends and returns of the Permanent University Fund.  The Texas Constitution (Article 7, Section 18) stipulates that most current institutions under the University of Texas&amp;nbsp;System and Texas&amp;nbsp;A&amp;M System are eligible to receive PUF profits through the AUF, and that a two-third vote of each house in the State Legislature is necessary to create a new institution as part of either system, which would then be automatically eligible for funds.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/CN/htm/CN.7.htm#7.11 |title=Texas Constitution, Article 7. Education |accessdate=2009-02-08 |publisher=Texas Constitution and Statutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Texas public universities—notably all institutions in the [[University of Houston System]], the [[University of North Texas System]], the [[Texas State University System|Texas&amp;nbsp;State System]], the [[Texas Tech University System|Texas&amp;nbsp;Tech System]], and some UT&amp;nbsp;System and Texas&amp;nbsp;A&amp;M System institutions—are prohibited by law from sharing the income from this endowment, but in 1984 a second fund was created to one day serve those schools: the Higher Education Fund (also known as the Higher Education Assistance Fund), a much smaller fund. Addition of the other university systems or individual institutions to the Permanent University Fund would require an amendment to the [[Texas Constitution]] or a two-thirds vote in the legislature.

The most recently added institution to the list of allowed institutions is the [[University of Texas Rio Grande Valley]], which was founded in 2013 with the merger of the [[University of Texas–Pan American]] and [[University of Texas at Brownsville]] and began full operation in 2015. The predecessor schools were not eligible for PUF allocations, but the law that created UTRGV made the new institution PUF-eligible, and was passed by the required two-thirds vote of both legislative chambers.

'''Philosophy For All (PFA)''' is a [[London]]-based association of people interested in philosophy. It was founded in 1998. It aims to bridge the gap between professional and amateur philosophers, by holding talks, lectures and debates. Many of its events are held in pubs; and others in adult education colleges.

According to its website, its aims are: "to encourage philosophical debate between professional and non-professional philosophers in a non-technical way; to provide a forum for an active exchange of ideas and information; to give guidance and information concerning courses as well as relevant literature in philosophy; to inspire those interested in philosophy to develop their interest further."

It is believed to be the largest philosophy organisation in London in terms of membership. Its bi-annual Public Lecture is often attended by more than 100 people and its monthly Kant's Cave talks, which are often given by notable academics, regularly draw 70 or so people to a room above a pub in [[Euston Road|Euston]].

During the early years of the new millennium it organised a series of Round Table debates in which four leading philosophers and an audience of around 150 people would debate issues such as the relationship between science and philosophy.

The PFA Public Lectures are a series of lectures held every six months or so (from around 2003 onwards) in which a well-known thinker gives a lecture and then holds a lengthy discussion session with the audience. The lectures give members of the public the opportunity to question  and discuss with internationally-known philosophers who have included as [[Simon Blackburn]], [[Antony Flew]], [[Piers Benn]], [[Jonathan Glover]], [[Anthony Grayling]], [[Ted Honderich]], [[Moshe Machover]], [[Nicholas Maxwell]], [[Mary Margaret McCabe]], [[Mary Midgley]], [[David Papineau]], [[Janet Radcliffe Richards]], [[Barry C. Smith]], [[Jonathan Wolff (philosopher)|Jonathan Wolff]], [[Raymond Tallis]], and [[Colin Wilson]].

Other regular monthly Philosophy For All events include a philosophy film club, seminars on important philosophical texts and regular Philosophical Walks in the countryside around London.

==PFA Fargo-Moorhead==
Since 2003, Philosophy For All has had a US chapter based in the twin cities of Fargo and Moorhead. The chapter was founded by Dr Mark Chekola, and meets monthly at the [[Plains Art Museum]] in Fargo.  It has a Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Philosophy-For-All-Fargo-Moorhead/879933445356607

== Reviews ==
Physics Bulletin said about the book, "No matter how gently one introduces students to the concept of Dirac’s bras and kets, many are turned off. Shankar attacks the problem head-on in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that there is nothing to be frightened of". [[American Scientist]] called it "An excellent text … The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succinct manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780306447907|title=Principles of Quantum Mechanics {{!}} R.

'''Rachel Podger''' (born 1968 in England) is an English violinist and [[conductor (music)|conductor]] specialising in the performance of [[Baroque music]].

==Career==
Podger was born to a British father and a German mother. She was educated at a German [[Waldorf education|Rudolf Steiner]] school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Stevenson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rachel-podger-mn0001291190 |title=Rachel Podger &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; then returned to study first with Perry Hart, then at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] with David Takeno, Pauline Scott, and Micaela Comberti. During her studies, she co-founded Baroque chamber groups The Palladian Ensemble and [[Florilegium early music ensemble|Florilegium]], and worked with period instrument ensembles such as the New London Consort and London Baroque.

Podger often conducts [[Baroque orchestra]]s from the violin. She was the leader of the Gabrieli Consort and Players and later of [[The English Concert]] from 1997 to 2002, touring extensively, often as soloist in Vivaldi's ''[[Le quattro stagioni]]'' and ''Grosso mogul'' concertos. In 2004 she took up guest directorship of the [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]], opening with a tour in the United States with Bach's ''[[Brandenburg Concertos]]''. She also currently works as a guest director with Arte dei Suonatori (Poland), [[Musica Angelica]] and Santa Fe Pro Musica (both in the United States) and as soloist with [[The Academy of Ancient Music]].

Podger is also a professor of [[Baroque violin]] at both the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]] and also teaches regularly at the [[University of the Arts Bremen|Hochschule für Künste, Bremen]]. On September 2008, she took up the newly founded Micaela Comberti Chair for Baroque violin at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London and then became professor of Baroque violin at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in Copenhagen.

When not touring with various orchestras and other classical players, Podger works with her partner in [[Brecon]], [[South Wales]], helping young musicians through the Mozart Music Fund, which she founded in 2006, as well as holding workshops and giving recitals. In 2006 they also founded the annual Brecon Baroque Festival which is held over the penultimate weekend of October every year.

==Instruments==
Podger plays a violin made in [[Genoa]] in 1739 by Pesarinius, a later student of [[Antonio Stradivari]]. She initially played a [[Stradivarius]] copy from 1988 by Rowland Ross, and has recorded Haydn and Mozart on the 1699 Crespi Stradivarius.

The '''Teacher Development Trust''' is a UK charity which works to raise awareness of the importance of [[professional development]] for teachers and other education professionals.

Founded by teachers in London in March 2012, the Trust promotes access to evidence-based, high quality training through its nationwide programmes.

== Mission ==

Teacher Development Trust mission statement:

:"The Teacher Development Trust is an independent charity, founded by teachers, dedicated to improving the educational outcomes of children by ensuring they experience the most effective learning. We are raising awareness of the importance of professional development and building tools to help teachers to transform their practice and achieve success for all their pupils.
:
:"The Trust believes that demand for professional learning should be driven by the aspiration teachers have for the children they teach and the passion they bring to their work.
:
:"We are determined to bring about radical improvement in the quality of the ongoing training that teachers receive based on the evidence of what creates effective learning."

The Trust also states that it aims to promote types and characteristics of teacher professional development proved successful by "strong international research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teacher Development Trust|title=Mission|url=http://www.teacherdevelopmenttrust.org/mission/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief executive David Weston has said:

:"Our ultimate vision is that in five years, England stands out above other nations in the developed world in the value and priority it gives to [[Continuing professional development|CPD]]. We can do this if we grow what we have achieved so far, rather than starting from scratch."

== Origins ==

In April 2012 the British government closed the [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120203163341/http:/www.tda.gov.uk/ Training and Development Agency for Schools] (TDA), the national body formerly responsible for teachers’ training and professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TDA announce CPD database closure|url=http://www.informededucation.com/?p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the planned closure, Teacher Development Trust was founded by teachers as a new agency aiming to support teachers’ professional learning.

== Programmes ==

Teacher Development Trust currently runs two nationwide programmes alongside its ad hoc consultancy services.

=== TDT Advisor ===

[http://goodcpdguide.com/ TDT Advisor] is the Trust’s professional development database. It provides listings and ratings for professional development training courses, consultancy, and other services.

TDT Advisor was launched in 2012 and is free of charge to providers and users.

Users are able to review courses and resources they have used.

In January 2013, a partnership was set up between Teacher Development Trust, [[Education Endowment Foundation]] and [[Sutton Trust]]. As part of this partnership, GoodCPDGuide professional development listings are aligned with the topics listed in the EEF-Sutton Trust [http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/index.php/toolkit/ Teaching and Learning Toolkit]. This Toolkit summarises research to provide "guidance to teachers and schools on how to use their resources to improve the attainment of disadvantaged pupils."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Toolkit|url=http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/toolkit/about-the-toolkit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All TDT Advisor users must agree to the site’s Code of Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Practice|url=http://goodcpdguide.com/code}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher Development Trust, EEF and Sutton Trust, undertake joint random quality sampling.

=== Teacher Development Trust Network ===

In July 2013, Teacher Development Trust launched the Network (formerly known as the National Teacher Enquiry Network (NTEN)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing the National Teacher Enquiry Network|url=http://www.sec-ed.co.uk/best-practice/introducing-the-national-teacher-enquiry-networkten/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TDT Network is an opt-in UK school network whose member organisations will share and develop evidence-based professional development practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teacher Development Trust Network|url=http://www.TDTrust.org/network/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services offered to members of the network include:
:* A [[Peer review|peer-audit scheme]], whereby members are trained to review provisions for professional development in other member organisations.
:* Support to implement NTEN Lesson Study, a process of practitioner-led enquiry.
:* Networking opportunities and events
:* Advice on optimising professional development in schools

TDT Lesson Study is based on the theory and practice of [[Lesson study|Lesson Study]], a teaching improvement process originating from Japan. In Lesson Study, teachers work in a small group to discuss their learning goals, create a "research lesson", then observe this lesson to revise and report on results. Groups finish by writing and disseminating their findings to assist colleagues and other teachers.

Lesson Study has been credited as enabling "better understanding of student thinking in order to develop lessons that advance student learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang-Iverson|first=Patsy|title=Why Lesson Study?|url=http://www.rbs.org/Special-Topics/Lesson-Study/Lesson-Study-Conference-2002/Why-Lesson-Study/207/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pilot Lesson Study schemes in England in 2003-2005 have also shown that the process allows for "increased risk-taking […] through sharing the ownership of the lesson and its outcomes – which contrasts sharply with much of the effects of inspection and performance management oriented observation which can lead teachers to play safe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dudley|first=Pete|title=The 'lesson study' model of classroom enquiry|url=http://www.teachingexpertise.com/articles/the-lesson-study-model-of-classroom-enquiry-2950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==

The [[Department for Education]], the [[Teaching Agency]] and the [[National College for School Leadership]] have all expressed support for the Teacher Development Trust.&lt;ref name="Optimus Education"/&gt;

In a speech to teachers and headteachers at the [[Department for Education#National College for Teaching .26 Leadership|National College for Teaching and Leadership]] on 25 April 2013, [[Secretary of State for Education]] [[Michael Gove]] said of the Trust’s chief executive David Weston:

"I’m […] indebted to David Weston, Chief Executive of the Teacher Development Trust - who is a principled and non-partisan voice for reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gove|first=Michael|title=Michael Gove speech to teachers and headteachers at the National College for Teaching and Leadership|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/michael-gove-speech-to-teachers-and-headteachers-at-the-national-college-for-teaching-and-leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its September 2013 report on the causes of educational failure, [http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/requires.pdf Requires Improvement], the [[Centre for Social Justice]] used Teacher Development Trust research and reports to demonstrate the importance of professional standards in teacher development.

The Trust has also gained support from major education organisations [http://www.irisconnect.co.uk/ Iris Connect] for its "rigid focus upon the quality of CPD provision"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IRIS Connect|title=A relentless focus upon higher quality CPD|url=http://www.irisconnect.co.uk/news/a-relentless-focus-upon-higher-quality-cpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [http://www.optimus-education.com/ Optimus Education], who described the Trust as a "grass-roots alternative in development, designed to support members of the profession at all stages of their careers."&lt;ref name="Optimus Education"/&gt;

In May 2013, chief executive David Weston was appointed to the judging panel for the [http://www.educationinvestor.co.uk/awards/awards.aspx EducationInvestor awards].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">'''The Beijing Center for Chinese Studies''' (or '''TBC''') was established by Fr. Ron Anton as a [[501(c)(3) organization]] in 1998. TBC's mission is to promote mutual understanding between China and other cultures. The Beijing Center was originally accredited by [[Loyola Marymount University]] and has been academically accredited by [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University-Chicago]] since 2007. The center offers programs for undergraduate students, faculty researchers and administrators, and programs for special academic groups. 

== About TBC ==
The initial focus of TBC was on undergraduate study-abroad in [[China]]. TBC introduced: 
* Chinese language training, 
* English-taught content courses, 
* immersion through Chinese roommate program, Chinese peer language tutors, Chinese family home-stay opportunities for academic-year students, 
* academic excursions within China.

[[The Beijing Center]] offers English-taught semester courses across 13 fields of study.  

When first entering the TBC [[Beijing]] location at the [[Beijing University of International Business and Economics]], there is a replica of an old Beijing alleyway or “[[Hutong]]”. There is a water garden featuring 4,000 years of Chinese water jars, the conference room displays original copies of western maps of China from 1584 to 1745, and the director’s office replicates an old Ming scholar’s studio.

== ChinaContact ==
The [[ChinaContact]] division runs faculty-led short-term, non-credit programs all year long. Several times a year there are programs for faculty members and for university administrators including programs for university presidents. There are workshops and courses for undergraduate classes, MBA groups, and graduate humanities classes.

== TBC Research Center ==
TBC Research Center specializes in supporting primary source research and helping young Chinese scholars in the doctoral or post-doc years. The center’s scholar-in-residence helps TBC students with academic projects during their stay in Beijing.

== TBC Library of Chinese Studies ==
TBC Library of Chinese Studies houses a collection of 18,000 English-language volumes about Chinese life and society. Special collections include a small rare book collection of 17th century volumes that first revealed China to the West, a collection of approximately 1300 older books from 1800 to 1949, and a multi-lingual collection on the history of the Catholic Church in China.

=== "How The West Learned of China" collection ===
The TBC Library of Chinese Studies has obtained a few original copies of these works in its collection entitled: "How the West Learned of China". The collection dates from 1588 until 1840 (with a few later exceptions).
[https://web.archive.org/web/20091009124617/http://www.thebeijingcenter.org/library_western/ "How The West Learned of China" collection list]

=== Historical collection ===
The collection has 1,200 books from the early 19th century to the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Many books were published in the [[Qing Dynasty]] and some are considered rare or collectors items. 
[https://web.archive.org/web/20091009124612/http://www.thebeijingcenter.org/library_historical/ Historical collection list]

=== Christian History collection ===
This is a multilingual collection mainly of primary sources from around the world on early [[Christian]] history in China. Works here are in Chinese, Latin, Portuguese, Dutch, German, Spanish, French, etc. (not English). It contains the work of early [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscans]], [[Jesuits]] and others as well as works from the early local church in China.

'''Tinkering School''' is an educational program created by [[Gever Tulley]] in California and is a registered trademark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Trademark Registration 3792085|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77700266&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|work=USPTO|publisher=US Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Tinkering Unlimited.

== Format ==
One aspect of Tinkering School is a sleepover summer camp where children come and participate in projects. The projects are based on exploration and experimentation. Making use of various materials, students are encouraged to develop projects through which they develop skills such as creativity, communication and working in groups. The children spend an entire week inventing solutions, working on projects, testing their creations, and also having fun.&lt;ref name="comic"&gt;Tinkering School Comic Book, http://storage.ted.com/tinker/Comic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tinker"&gt;Tinkering School Official Site, http://www.tinkeringschool.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tinkering School Blog, http://tinkeringschool.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A core aspect of the Tinkering School pedagogy is the idea of a "projectory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tulley|first=Gever|title=Projectory|url=http://www.tinkeringschool.com/blog/2009/projectory|work=Tinkering School Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple mashup of the notions of “project” and “trajectory," a projectory is a project that leaves the child on a trajectory that extends the experience beyond the end of the project. This is combined with the notion of “escape velocity”. The escape velocity of a project is a measure of the participant's engagement and the resistance that the project offers to further exploration after it is built. A perfect project is one that has very high engagement (which you can measure by how easily distracted they are during the project) and very low resistance to further exploration.

Several affiliate programs have focused their activities on day camps and weekend workshops, rather than sleepover summer camp. While the projects themselves may be smaller, the projectories are no less impactful.

== History ==
Computer scientist Gever Tulley founded Tinkering School in 2005.

== Collaborators ==
Collaborators are the adult participants in the projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tulley|first=Gever|title=Collaborators|url=http://www.sfbrightworks.org/how-we-learn/collaborators/|work=Brightworks Website|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide support, guide the project, and collaborate with the children in the discovery of a solution.

== Curriculum ==
At Tinkering School there is no set curriculum. There are no tests or evaluations, and collaborators do not teach any particular subject. All learning is student-directed and project-based.

'''William Tillyer''' (born 1938 in Middlesbrough) is an English artist. His work has been shown frequently in the UK and internationally since the late 1950s. There are at least 15 works by Tillyer in the [[Tate|Tate collection]], including ''High Force'' (1974).&lt;ref name=monograph&gt;http://theartnewspaper.com/news/stalwart-london-dealer-bernard-jacobson-gives-artist-william-tillyer-a-year-long-platform-with-five-shows-and-a-monograph&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his work are also included in the collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Brooklyn Art Museum]], the [[Fort Worth Art Museum]], Texas, the [[Smith College Museum of Art]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:William Tillyer, Sea, Clouds and Beach (1958).jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Sea, Clouds and Beach, 1958]]
Tillyer studied painting at the [[Middlesbrough College of Art]] from 1956–9, before moving south to London in the 1960s to study at the [[Slade School of Art]], with painting as his main subject and printmaking as his subsidiary. There, he encountered [[William Coldstream]] and [[Anthony Gross]], among others.

In 1959, Tillyer had two of his paintings – ''Painting'' and ''Sea, Clouds and Beach'' (both 1958) – accepted for the 'Young Contemporaries' exhibition, the tenth in a series of annual shows arranged to make public the best work done by students in England's art schools.&lt;ref name=Lynton&gt;Norbert Lynton, William Tillyer: Against the Grain, 2000, 21 Publishing Ltd. London&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings were selected that year by [[Victor Pasmore]], [[Terry Frost]], [[Andrew Forge]], [[Ceri Richards]] and [[William Turnbull (artist)|William Turnbull]].

Following his time at the Slade, Tillyer took up a French Government Scholarship to study [[Rotogravure|gravure]] under [[Stanley William Hayter]], at [[Atelier 17]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Here, Tillyer had what he describes as "the archetypal artist's studio" at rooftop level in the American Pavilion of the [[Cité Universitaire]], where he lived and worked when not in [[Stanley William Hayter|Hayter]]'s studio. There he found a dense population of students, and a properly equipped print workshop. The pressure, though, was such that he spent much of his time in his room, making prints without a press. In 1963 he returned to England, and lived first in Notting Hill, in something close to abject poverty, and then in Middlesbrough.&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt;

==Printmaking==
[[File:William Tillyer, For John Constable (The Cape, New England), 1975.jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, For John Constable: The Cape, New England, 1975]]
Tillyer began experimenting with printmaking in 1958, while a student at the Slade, and it was as a printmaker that he made his first reputation. He won international acclaim at the Second International Print Biennale in Kraków in 1968, and, the following year, found the support of Bernard Jacobson, who has been his dealer ever since.&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; They met after Tillyer paid a visit to Jacobson, one of the leading print dealers and publishers in the country, in his office on Mount Street, Mayfair armed with a selection of his newest prints.&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Jacobson was enthusiastic and selected two for immediate publication, ''Mrs Lumsden's'' and ''The Large Birdhouse''.

The late 1960s saw a sudden explosion in the making and marketing of prints in Britain and generally in the Western world. International print exhibitions became regular events, some of them awarding major prizes. Art magazines gave these media unprecedented attention and support. There are no certain reasons for this. The 1960s in Britain are sometimes referred to as the Age of Affluence and seemed to bread a sense of well-being. For a limited period, average earnings were up a little and taxes down a little while the country operated an effectively balanced system of nationalised and private industries and services. The early '60s had seen Britain expand the field of higher education and introduce, in particular, an almost wholly beneficial programme of reform and broadening of the major art schools of England and Wales, including the better staffing and equipping of printmaking departments. Of the growth of printmaking there is plenty of evidence, not least the opening of galleries specialising in prints, such as, in London, the Curwen Gallery, an outlet for the Curwen Press's own products, and St George's Gallery, subsequently a leading art bookshop but a busy print shop in the later 1960s. UK art magazines, notably ''[[Studio International]]'', took note of this growing activity and interest and gave the subject space. The press confirmed that there was a new interest in prints as an art form, one that attracted the best new artists, as well as previous generations in British art – pointing to the admired graphics of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and the early [[Graham Sutherland]] – and reached out to a growing class of art-interested people not wealthy enough to collect unique paintings and sculpture. Finely edited and packaged suites and portfolios of prints, especially those produced by young and rising artists, were seen as attractive investments.

Tillyer's first major exhibition was held at the much admired [[Arnolfini|Arnolfini Gallery]] in Bristol in 1970 and consisted of 33 etchings, three of which were immediately purchased by the British Council for its enterprising collection. With these prints, Tillyer used a variety of techniques, from etching to five tone screenprinting, to create lattices which through their gradation of tone depict what Pat Gilmour described as "a cool and unpeopled world...in which to reflect the surrounding flux of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Pat Gilmour, 'A Furnished Landscape', Bernard Jacobson Gallery, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by Tillyer's showing at the [[Arnolfini Gallery]], Jacobson published a further four etchings, the ''Dry Lake'' suite. In 1971, 26 of his etchings were shown in the new Print Gallery within the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]]'s [[Serpentine Galleries|Serpentine Gallery]] in London. Henceforth, with Jacobson marketing them, Tillyer's prints were seen and appreciated more widely. Other artists responded to them with enthusiasm, notably [[David Hockney]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Ed Ruscha]] and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; From 1972 onwards, Tillyer's work has been shown regularly in group and solo exhibitions around the world.

During 1975–76, while participating in an artist's a residency at [[Brown University]], Providence, Rhode Island, Tillyer began to use an idiosyncratic tall format for prints produced by diverse processes. He claimed at the time that the format echoed the tall window of his campus studio, and was confirmed for him by Chinese scroll paintings he saw in the university's gallery. Jacobson had asked him to contribute an image to a portfolio of new prints to be published in 1976 in celebration of the bicentenary of [[John Constable]]'s birth; the other artists contributing included [[David Hockney]], [[Robyn Denny]] and [[Richard Smith (artist)|Richard Smith]]. It is strange but also refreshing that Tillyer should use this unfamiliar, anti-landscape format for an etching done in honour of Constable, ''For John Constable: The Cape, New England''; it enabled him to keep his distance from the artist he was paying respect to. Even more remarkable is his use here of a large proportion of aquatint, apparently brushed on like watercolour. Evening light catches on clouds that fill the vertical slice of sky; at the very bottom, aptly presented as a tiny section of black lattice, we glimpse the sails of the Hampstead windmill that appears in certain Constable pictures. Its presence determines the scale of the whole; in addition, the contrast between that one mad-made detail, at the foot of the tall print, and the soft, delicate, but somewhat threatening swathes of lilac that almost fill the rest, is profoundly poetic as well as technically startling.

The ''Providence Prints'' (1976) is a suite of seven woodcuts and linocuts, using the same format but wholly different in technique, expression and subject. Exceptionally, Tillyer here allowed himself a variety of genres within a suite: landscape (waterfall), still like (the cylindrical vase with flowers), the human figure (two images of a nude posed indoors against a screen and a mirror). To each of the seven prints the Tillyer lattice makes major contributions, including in the figure images, where three or four lattices, cut with differing strengths and at varying scales, present floor, screen, background and the figures themselves. These may be echoes of [[Matisse]]'s early figures, more obviously in the instance of the reclining figure, redolent as it is of the ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Blue Nude]]'' of 1907. The other, a standing figure, reflected in a mirror, her elbows raised as her hands meet behind her head, is likewise reminiscent of leftmost figure in Matisse's ''[[Le bonheur de vivre|Le Bonheur de Vivre]]'' of 1905–06, a stock pose adapted from nineteenth-century academic painting.

==Mesh works==
[[File:William Tillyer, The House at Fontenay-aux-Roses by Way of The Admiral's House (1980).jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, The House at Fontenay-aux-Roses by Way of The Admiral's House, 1980]]

The mid-1970s were a busy exhibiting period for Tillyer, but those years also show him reconstructing his professional image. Without playing down his prominence as a printmaker, he was eager to bring painting to the fore as his principal medium and vehicle of artistic expression. There followed a drastic reworking of the methods he had been using, and the images resulting from them, with Tillyer combining the canvas with a steel mesh ground, a bold decision without art historical precedent. In ''Blue Vase and Arrangement'' (1977–78), wire mesh occupies the centre and supplies the frame. The middle is occupied by the vase, which in turn is surrounded by colourful strokes and blotches: the nominal "arrangement" of flowers. These red, orange and green palimpsests burst forth from a dark, canvas ground, the jouissance of the flowers' colour being matched by the artist's self-consciously incongruous and witty identification of steel mesh with a ceramic vase.

There followed a second group of mesh paintings, which do away with the canvas altogether, made in 1979–80. Tillyer calls them the Mesh Works. Among the larger ones is ''Study for the House at Fontenay-aux-Roses by Way of the Admiral's House'' (1980), which was painted on an orthogonally positioned mesh of squares, collaged with bits of board front and back. There is thick paint on the mesh and thick paint on the boards, and these too come in primarily vertical and horizontal units. The white vertical form in the centre is not, this time, a vase, but a glimpse of a house amid foliage; to the left is a tall mottled green horizontal brushstroke, a poplar tree. The upper register, laden with bits of chipped wood panel assumes the form of a clear blue sky, and generally the scene is bathed in sunshine. A baroque gilt frame is hinted at on the right.

Tillyer would seem in this "study" to have tested how much and how little information would serve to convey his theme. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that his artistic interests are couched, he has claimed, in "the tension between the artificial and the real," on the irreconcilable ontological difference between the two. Here is an actual landscape: real; and here is a depiction of it: artificial. Tillyer makes images — often, though not exclusively — with subjects derived from the natural world, which, through varying degrees of transformation, are turned into something essentially different: pictorially and materially. Tillyer's approach to painting — his facture — is playful. He tests, and ultimately expands, the limits of how far he is able to distance the artificial depiction from its real-world referent, without losing the reference itself, the point of this enterprise being to investigate and to demonstrate ever more fully the axiomatic contrivance and conceit implicit in the creation of all art.

==Watercolours==
[[File:William Tillyer, Autumn, Wiltshire (1986).jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Autumn, Wiltshire, 1986]]
In 1987, the Bernard Jacobson Gallery showed a selection of Tillyer's 'English Landscape Watercolours'. The title-page of the catalogue states: "From April 1985 until March 1987, William Tillyer travelled throughout the British Isles and produces over 200 watercolours."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Twenty-seven of these were exhibited and finely reproduced in the catalogue. [[Peter Fuller]]'s thoughtful introduction raises a number of points. It outlines Tillyer's position vis-à-vis tradition and innovation: "Tillyer's paintings depend, for their aesthetic effects, upon his responses to the world of nature; and yet, at the same time, his pictures do not offer a reproduction of the appearances of that world. Indeed, they seem to be deeply involved with that kind of questioning of the nature of the medium itself, so typical of late modernist concerns; Tillyer's painting in oil shows a characteristically self-critical doubt about the validity of illusion and representation, and a restless preoccupation with the nature of the picture plane, the support and the framing edge. Tillyer often seeks out 'radical' solutions, assaulting the surface, tearing, reconstituting, collaging."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Fuller goes on to outline the history of English watercolour painting, associating Tillyer's use of the medium especially with the examples of [[Alexander Cozens]] and [[Thomas Girtin]]. He also stresses how [[JMW Turner|Turner]] and others enlarged the effects achieved in it by "roughing and scraping the surface of the paper" and other such means, while [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] recommended the admixture of white to make watercolour opaque. Girtin, before Ruskin weighed in, had "sought to 'purify' the practice of watercolour" and made positive use of the whiteness of his chosen paper, together with delicate and also denser washes of colour.&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Fuller found this technique in Tillyer. He concludes: "that in watercolours, and perhaps only in watercolours, the great cry of the Romantic aesthetic (i.e. 'Truth to Nature') and that of emergent Modernism (i.e. 'Truth to Materials') were, in effect, one and the same. For, when used in a way which preserved the particular qualities of the medium (even at the price of loss of immediate resemblance to the appearance of things) watercolour painting seemed to come closest to embodying the fragility, and elusive spontaneity, of our perceptions of nature itself."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; This, he adds, is what "Tillyer seems to have understood so fully."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Thus Tillyer appeared to be extending the researches of [[Ivon Hitchens]] and of [[Patrick Heron]], [[Peter Lanyon]] and others associated with [[St Ives School|St Ives]], fusing their response to nature, inherited from Romanticism, with the modern call for independent, often abstract image-making, guided by the doctrine of 'Truth to Materials'. In this, Fuller argues, we should recognise "a quest for spiritual values"; indeed this is a function of the continuing vitality of English landscape painting. Here Fuller makes good use of a quotation from Ruskin: "The English tradition of landscape, culminating in Turner, is nothing other than a healthy effort to fill the void which the destruction of Gothic architecture has left."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; To this tradition belong, according to Fuller, "Tillyer's best watercolours" even as they declare their modernity: his response to nature is linked to "the search for 'spiritual values'."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Thus Tillyer is saved from what Fuller sees as late modern art's "greatest weakness": ending in "aesthetic failure" in pursuit of "an abstract 'art of the real'."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Tillyer's watercolours are beautiful in themselves. His gentle washes of colour tell us that our finest aesthetic feelings are intimately related to out experience of nature. Not to be aware of that which leads us "to injustice and to exploit the natural world (and, indeed, each other)."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Tillyer's watercolours invite us to share with him a tentative and tremulous sensation of ''physical'' and ''spiritual'' oneness with the natural world.

==The Westwood Paintings==
[[File:William Tillyer.jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Untitled, 1989]]
[[File:William Tillyer, Green Landscape (With Tree and Cloud) (1989).jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Green Landscape with Tree and Cloud, 1989]]
In 1987 Tillyer bought some farm buildings in an isolated spot in North Yorkshire and put much effort into developing them as a home and workplace. It was here that he painted the ''Westwood'' series, a group of large-scale acrylic and oil paintings on canvas. There is an epic gravity about the works. The artist painted them using a broom head to deposit large arcs and commas of paint, keen to explore and exploit "the physicality of the medium."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; These paintings overwhelm the viewer with their sheer visual presence, their muscular use of paint and the power of their formal and colour contrasts. Yet at the same time, according to Lynton, Tillyer seems to be stating something which "comes perilously close to the thoughts of that famous piece of versifying: 'Poems are made by fools like me / But only god can make a tree.' Or: beware, this is only art; admire it, but know what you are admiring; do not use my paintings as a pretext for adoring nature."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; The implication here seems to be that while Tillyer could, had he wished, have created paintings which cajoled the viewer to bask in the pleasures that convincing landscape images provide, he elected not to, instead utilising a marked economy of means to suggest form, using, for example, only a single brushstroke to articulate a cloud, or the canopy of a tree, as in ''Untitled'' (1989). The ''Westwood'' paintings, sparse, yet Herculean in their vigour, insist on being blatantly synthetic; they declare their own artifice emphatically. Colours seem to lie on the very threshold of the picture plane, recession is implied very rarely, and patches of unpainted canvas abound. These are not landscapes, they cannot even accurately be termed depictions of them. This is Tillyer's version of the [[Verfremdungseffekt]], [[Brecht]]'s way of "making strange" lest his audiences should settle down into passive receptivity.

Many forms and gesture recur. However, what Tillyer calls "gestures", a word redolent of the ostensibly intuitive actions of abstract expressionist painting, are in fact wholly deliberate. They need to be: their placing is exact and they can be huge. Their colour identifies their real-world referent, for example: (blue) sky, (white) cloud, (green) tree, (red) plant, (brown) earth and so on. Wide brushes are used to pick up more than one colour or tone. Thus in the same form might be found green, mingled with yellow or brown. In ''Green Landscape with Tree and Cloud'' (1989), a broad blue arc is partly covered by a black curve, and this in turn is overlaid with a shorter stroke in brilliant white, the topmost lateral edge of which is yellow, indicating a Tillyer cloud. In many places colours nestle within other colours, to suggest form, in this way.

==Living in Arcadia==
[[File:William Tillyer, Square Form, 1990.jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Square Form, 1990]]

[[File:Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version).jpg|thumb|Nicolas Poussin, Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version), 1637–38]]
The ''Living in Arcadia'' paintings were made in Yorkshire in 1990–91. In them, writes David Cohen, Tillyer "juxtaposes the organic and the geometric, the gestural and the rational, the empirical (felt, observed) and the ideal (thought, imposed)."&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, 'William Tillyer – Living in Arcadia', in Modern British Masters IV: William Tillyer, Bernard Jacobson Ltd, London 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; These dualities are certainly there, and patent once we look for them. But the way he explores them makes it dangerous to attribute standard qualities to them: nothing is ever quite what it seems. Certainly they are "organic" and "geometric": these adjectives are clear enough. "Gestural", however, implies that the forms are not planned and thought-out, which axiomatically they are. Tillyer deploys pictorial rhetoric masterfully, using forms that look spontaneous and emotive with the same deliberation as geometric forms. Tillyer observes nature, but he also observes mankind's work. The world of design is as much within his remit as the world of nature, and "design" here includes aspects of modern and old-master art that could well be labelled "ideal". His process is constructive as well as deconstructive. In paintings such as ''Square Form'' (1990), we see him assembling forms and marks in a considered way. The work's form betrays the artist's process, which involves clear thought before and during its creation. The canvas is square and white. In its lower left corner is a black square, its sides uneven, a blue parallelogram apparently rising from either behind or above it, the bottom edge of which seems to fade away. All the other forms are gestural, and yet their clear, crisp outlines would appear to belie the artist's ostensibly spontaneous mark-making. Organic yet geometric; gestural yet rational.

Tillyer's presentation of elements which speak of nature together with elements that speak of human manufacture and human logic has been in his art from the first: two sorts of reality, linked because nature too adheres to logical processes and by the fact that we live in an environment made up of both. His habit of interrupting our reception of his images was born out of his desire to stop us mistaking art's artificial procedures and results as reality—that is to say, as a persuasive representation of something real. Here we get to the point of the series. The title, ''Living in Arcadia'' refers to two pictures by the classical French Baroque painter [[Nicolas Poussin]]. Their original titles are uncertain now. They are often labeled ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'' (1627/1637–38), in itself an ambiguous phrase, that is perhaps best translated: "I too lived in Arcadia". In both versions, shepherds examine a sarcophagus. The implication is that they have just discovered the stone monument and, having read its portentous epitaph, are pictured in the process of comprehending its significance. Even in Arcadia, that idyllic pastoral land associated with perfect well-being, death rules. Poussin's humans and the sarcophagus make for an unambiguous contrast: they and their natural environment live, while ''it'' speaks of death. Tillyer's series engages broadly with the same idea. His coloured forms may refer to nature, but he shows us quite clearly that they are merely acrylic (and therefore artificial) pigments, applied to panel – not natural and not alive – while the nominal "square form" is perhaps his equivalent to Poussin's man-made tomb.

==Fearful Symmetries==
[[File:William Tillyer, Ayton (1993).jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Ayton, 1993]]
When Tillyer's ''Fearful Symmetries'' series was shown at the Bernard Jacobson Gallery in 1993, the catalogue reprinted an article Martin Gaylord had written a few weeks earlier. Gayford visited Tillyer in Yorkshire, and discussed with him his ideas about nature and landscape and his thoughts concerning watercolour painting, his own and his most important predecessors', [[Alexander Cozens|Alexander]] and [[John Robert Cozens]], [[JMW Turner|Turner]], [[John Sell Cotman|Cotman]] etc. The first months of 1993 saw a large exhibition of 'The Great Age of British Watercolours' at the Royal Academy, and it made good sense to get Tillyer's response to this on the way to focusing on his own use of the medium. Tillyer declared his interest in the founders of this 'great age', and distanced himself from the elaborately worked watercolours of the mid-Victorians, done, as he said, to compete with oil paintings but essentially unable to. "Each medium has its own nature. It's what you're saying with the medium that's important."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; He emphasised the originality, the modernity, of the past painters he admired, and also his personal aversion to making topographical portraits of selected landscapes. But he also stressed the affinity of watercolours to the British landscape, and vice versa: "Around here moisture appears actually to rise out of the ground, out of the earth. It almost feels as if the sky is being formed from the earth – a rising of moisture into the void of the sky. Watercolour is almost the very nature of landscape in itself, its own properties. Landscape is simply weather – air and water... To my mind, the pure use of watercolour involved starting from white paper, and then gradually working back – so that any light and air you want in the piece is the first mark you make."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; About the new series of paintings Gayford said very little. It was primarily Tillyer's watercolours he had gone to discuss, in the context both of 'the great age' and of Tillyer's thoughts about nature and about the Romantic/classical duality signalled so firmly in the ''Westwood'' and ''Living in Arcadia'' paintings. The new paintings were being prepared for their trip to London. Gayford mentioned the contrast each of them offered, the "rather jarring opposition" between the natural forms, usually on the right, and the geometrical forms, usually on the left, now made as cuts into the canvas-on-board front plane. He rightly emphasised both that contrast, which seemed to him like "a contest, even a battle", and the resolution of the two elements on the conceptual level, since nature's forms too are structured mathematically.&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; He also explained Tillyer's use of the series title, ''Fearful Symmetries''. The words echo William Blake's, in his poem ''The Tyger'', but Tillyer says he took them from the title of a piece of music by the American composer John Adams. In many respects the new series continues methods and images initiated in the ''Living in Arcadia'' series. However, the new series, produced in 1992–93 is more concentrated, in that all the paintings have the same format and dimensions (36 x 42 inches), and are all set into the characteristic Tillyer timber frame, painted in various blue-greys. ''Ayton'' (1993), for example, is painted on uninterrupted canvas, sans wire mesh and sans planar recession, in thinned acrylic over white and could almost be a watercolour, a suitably delicate response to light and air.

==The Kachina Paintings==
[[File:William Tillyer Blue Ogre 1994.jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Blue Ogre, 1994]]
[[File:William Tillyer, Heart of the Sky- Orange Haven (1994).jpg|thumb|William Tillyer, Heart of the Sky: Orange Haven, 1994]]
In the autumn of 1994 Tillyer showed his next series, the ''Kachina'' paintings, at André Emmerich's gallery in New York. The catalogue appends a Tillyer text, 'some Brief Notes'; the introduction is by Martin Gayford. In it, Tillyer writes about the Italian Renaissance as, for all its positive achievements, a deleterious episode in the long history of art: "The ''Kachina'' paintings... may also be seen as a visual essay on the relation of illusion to reality... of the Renaissance ideal of spatial illusionism to the Byzantine concept of the object. The failure in the 15th century to couple the new Renaissance concepts of perspective and illusionistic space with those of Byzantium made for a lost opportunity. It is only in the 20th century that this failure has begun to be redressed."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; For the art historian this raises all sorts of difficulties, but the underling truth in what Tillyer outlines was known to the great innovators of Modern art, to Gaugin and Cézanne especially, as is shown by their efforts to abandon not only academic illusionism but also the illusionism of tone and colour still purveyed by Impressionism, in favour of a new flatness and formal, as opposed to naturalistic, rightness; also known to [[Matisse]], [[Kandinsky]], [[Malevich]] etc., who gave priority to the demands of the pictorial object and of their media. The Cubism of Picasso and Braque was, among other things, a dialectical treatment of the opposition to which Tillyer refers. And surely by at the very latest 1950, roughly the time when Matisse made his great paper cut-out compositions, and [[Pollock]] his finest drip works, the [[Leon Battista Alberti|Albertian]] tradition of the tabula quadrata as a window on to reality had been set aside, countered by something equally powerful. Tilyer, however, takes this rejection further still. It is one thing for Pollock to substitute for perspective and tonal modelling the material reality of paint and colour and the brushstroke as visual fact. It is quite another to change the language of painting altogether, fracturing its traditional logic by introducing other, conventionally incongruous media, as in Tillyer's substitution of the canvas for a wire lattice in his earlier Mesh works.

The ''Kachina'' paintings likewise make reference to unconventional media: the [[kachina]] dolls made by the Native America [[Hopi]] tribe. The kachina doll, writes Tillyer in the catalogue, is "icon-like," and provided him "with a vehicle to explore the dialogue between nature seen romantically and the geometry of man-made forms" to which the series (and much of his earlier work) makes reference.&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt; Kachna dolls are at once figurative and geometrical; in them "gesture counters geometry."&lt;ref name=Lynton/&gt;  The forms of the paintings are themselves taken from the dolls, most obviously the blue ratchet-edged insectile biomorph that in ''Blue Ogre'' (1994) appears to devour the green and yellow comma-like gestures around which it curves. Though almost every painting in the series is vertical and many of them present dominant forms – "gestures" – of this sort, the artist has remarked: "They are all landscapes. All the paintings are kachinas, but most could just as well be given the title ''Landscape with Ruins''." This refers to Tillyer's use of the type of landscape inherited from, primarily, Poussin. In the ''Westwood'' and ''Living in Arcadia'' paintings, we saw him knotting and fusing his pictorial signs for nature into quite concise clusters, operating as emblems more than as glimpses of landscape. Now he uses parts and aspects of the dolls in addition to Poussin's geometric and stereometric forms in his internal debate on the nature of art. This becomes more assertive than before, more up-front, less implicit. It is partly that the images themselves are so insistent. Big forms, on the surface as paint, run swiftly from top to bottom, sometimes organic and gestural, or else hard and geometric, flat and voluminous, relief and planar. They attempt to deal with the artist's strongly felt ideas about landscape and the nature of painting: of the eternal struggle between artifice and reality implicit in the creation, consumption and ontology of all art.

The verticality of most of the ''Kachina'' paintings, together with their compositions, which are usually firmly centred, gives them an almost figurative presence: something stands there, emerging from the tenebrous canvas ground beneath. But there are exceptions. ''Heart of the Sky: Orange Heaven'' (1994) is the only horizontal canvas in the series. It presents a dark Tillyer landscape, sliced open in the middle in the shape of a slightly asymmetrical diabolo (a sharply waisted cylinder). The back plane is black, so deep as to be almost luminous, and set against it we see most of what we take to be a bright red rectangle. The black and the red are so positive that they seem to shine out from this carved recess, overwhelming the landscape to which they play background.

==Late career==
In 2010 a major monograph on his watercolours was published by 21 Publishing covering almost 40 years of his practise. In the extensive text American art critic and poet [[John Yau]] writes: "However beautiful they are, and many of them are extremely beautiful, almost painfully so, Tillyer's watercolours never lead us away in favour of an Edenic vision."&lt;ref&gt;John Yau, William Tillyer: Watercolours, 21 Publishing, London, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Mima Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art in Middlesbrough held the first major retrospective exhibition of Tillyer's work since 1996.

In late 2017, Bernard Jacobson announced in the Art Newspaper that he would be filling most of his 2018 exhibition schedule with shows dedicated to Tillyer, launching "five separate exhibitions incorporating new and historic works by the Middlesbrough-born artist."&lt;ref name=monograph/&gt; Jacobson, who has been Tillyer’s dealer since 1969, stated: "He was an unknown then, and I’ve stayed loyal to him since. I consider him the heir to [[John Constable|Constable]] through [[Cézanne]] and [[Matisse]]. He is an intensely private man who is completely outside the system, and I’m keen to set the record straight."&lt;ref name=monograph/&gt;

The '''World Forestry Center''' is a nonprofit educational institution in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].  Located near the [[Oregon Zoo]] in [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]], the organization was established in 1964{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} as the '''Western Forestry Center''', with the actual building opening in 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"&gt;"New forestry center opens" (June 6, 1971). ''The Sunday Oregonian'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wfchist"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:P15exhibw.jpg|thumb|Forestry Building in 1905]]
The  World Forestry Center has its roots in the 1905 [[Lewis &amp; Clark Centennial Exposition|Lewis and Clark Centennial American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair]] for which an enormous [[log cabin]] was built of huge native trees and advertised as the world's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public interest in the '''Forestry Building''', which was turned over to the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]], lasted long after the exposition ended, right up until it was destroyed by fire on August 17, 1964.&lt;ref name="wfchist"&gt;{{cite web

The day after the fire, a group of civic and industry leaders conceived The Western Forestry Center.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} A new, more fire-resistant forestry building designed by Oregon architect [[John Storrs (architect)|John Storrs]] was built in Washington Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} It opened to the public on June 5, 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"/&gt;  The name was changed to "World Forestry Center" in 1986 to reflect the center's revised focus on forestry on a global scale.&lt;ref name="wfchist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new name"&gt;Hill, Alma (January 4, 1986). "Forestry center gets new name". ''The Oregonian'', p. C2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2005, after a $7 million, 6-month renovation, the {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} museum reopened with new interactive exhibits about the sustainability of forests and trees of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Programs==
The World Forestry Center's mission is to "educate and inform people about the world's forests and trees, and their importance to all life, in order to promote a balanced and [[sustainability|sustainable]] future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.worldforestrycenter.org/organization/wfc_aboutus.php
 | title = About Us
 | publisher = World Forestry Center
 | accessdate = 2007-11-04

The center achieves its mission with three programs: the Discovery Museum, two donated working forests—the Magness Memorial Tree Farm and the Johnson-Swanson Tree Farm—and the World Forest Institute which was established in 1989. The primary program is the International Fellowship Program.

In 1989, the World Forestry Center established the World Forest Institute to meet a growing demand for forestry information.  As the forestry sector becomes increasingly complex, there is a greater need for international collaboration and exchange of information on forest trade, regulation, management, and forest resources. The World Forest Institute was created through the vision and support of [[Harry Merlo|Harry A. Merlo]], a pioneer of the forest products industry, and an early visionary of the globalization of the forestry sector.

[[File:World Forestry Center.jpg|thumb|left|The forestry center in 2016]]
The fellowship program brings young forestry and forest products professionals from around the world to work at the World Forest Institute for 6 to 12 months.  Fellows are commonly sponsored by their employer, government institutions, the forest industry, or an NGO, and carry out applied research projects of interest to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/03/world_forestry_program_sends_a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to completing a practical research project, the program works to get Fellows a broad exposure to natural resource management in the U.S. so that when they return to their home countries they have a basic understanding of the owners and managers of land and natural resources throughout the country.

The institute won the 2012 Portland Mayor's International Business Award from the Oregon Consular Corps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFAaHSSvLro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://portland4biz.com/portland-international-business-awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/05/in_downtown_portland_awards_an.html&lt;/ref&gt; This award recognizes businesses that contribute to a global environment in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/?c=51108&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Forestry Center campus also accommodates three other buildings: Julian N. Cheatham Hall, Harold A. Miller Hall and Harry A. Merlo Hall, which houses the administrative offices and the World Forest Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Leadership Hall of Fame===
The Leadership Hall of Fame commemorates people who have made important contributions to [[forestry]].  The photographs and biographies of nearly 200 forestry leaders are displayed in three chests constructed of select [[Black Walnut]] from the [[Eastern United States|eastern U.S.]]
