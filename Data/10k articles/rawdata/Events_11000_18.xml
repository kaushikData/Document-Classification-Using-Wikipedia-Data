'''''12 Paces Without a Head''''' ({{lang-de|Zwölf Meter ohne Kopf}}) is a 2009 film set in the [[North Sea]] in 1401.  The film centers on the [[Germany|German]] folk hero [[Klaus Störtebeker]], who was a pirate at the time.  The title comes from a legend which asserts that when he was captured by the [[Hanseatic League]], he struck a deal with his captors that every one of his men whom he could walk past after being decapitated, would be let go. Störtebeker's body allegedly managed to make twelve paces before collapsing.

The '''1942 [[Victorian Football Association]] season''' was not played owing to [[World War II]], which was at its peak at the time.

==Abandonment of the season==
[[World War II]] commenced in Europe in September 1939, but the Association continued with a full program of football in the [[1940 VFA season|1940]] and [[1941 VFA season|1941]] seasons – with the sole exception that [[Sandringham Football Club|Sandringham]] had competed as an amateur club in the latter season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Association teams – Preston’s haul|date=12 April 1941|page=16|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942, the state of war had increased, and was now being fought against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], as well as against the [[Axis powers]] in Europe. Enlistments had reduced the number of able-bodied men available to play football, the [[war effort]] had reduced the number of men able to commit time to running the football clubs in an administrative capacity, and the military had already [[commandeering|commandeered]] [[North Port Oval]] and [[Trevor Barker Beach Oval|Beach Oval]] and was potentially going to commandeer [[Williamstown Cricket Ground|Point Gellibrand]], the [[Coburg City Oval]] and Brunswick Oval.&lt;ref&gt;‘Football: League Clubs Prepare – Grounds Problem’; ''[[The Age]]'', 15 April 1942, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, [[Northcote Football Club|Northcote]], [[Coburg Football Club|Coburg]], [[Brunswick Football Club|Brunswick]], [[Yarraville Football Club|Yarraville]], [[Brighton Football Club|Brighton]] and [[Oakleigh Football Club|Oakleigh]] wanted to play the season at the VFA’s April meeting, but [[Preston Football Club (VFA)|Preston]], [[Williamstown Football Club|Williamstown]], [[Prahran Football Club|Prahran]], [[Camberwell Football Club|Camberwell]], [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] and Sandringham had doubts or were outright against playing.&lt;ref&gt;Fiddian, Marc; ''Gold Threads among the Green: A History of the Northcote Football Club''; pp. 103-104 {{ISBN|9780980289046}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April, the Association board of management decided to cancel the premiership season for 1942. It is believed that had the season been played, no more than six of the twelve clubs would have been able to field a team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Association against football|date=21 April 1942|page=6|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seconds premiership was also cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=VFA defers decision|date=14 April 1942|page=6|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association premiership was not staged again until [[1945 VFA season|1945]], although the seconds competition re-commenced in [[1944 VFA season|1944]].

With the Association in recess, two of its grounds were used by League clubs whose grounds had been commandeered: {{AFL Foo}} played its games at [[Yarraville Oval]], and {{AFL Stk}} played its games at [[Toorak Park]].

The '''1974 London–Sahara–Munich World Cup Rally''', known also under the commercial identity of '''1974 UDT World Cup Rally''', was the second and final of the [[World Cup Rally|World Cup Rallies]] to be held. Drawing inspiration from the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] which was held in [[Munich]], the rally began in London, Great Britain and travelled to Munich, Germany, via northern Africa. It was won by the privateer Australian crew of Jim Reddiex, Ken Tubman and André Welinski, driving a [[Citroen DS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.examiner.com.au/story/1400403/sherrard-rallies-to-help-in-devil-appeal/&lt;/ref&gt;

70 cars entered the race - 19 finished.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com%2Fgadgets%2Fproxy%253Furl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fsherrardcollection.files.wordpress.com%25252F2013%25252F05%25252Fjr30.jpg%2526container%253Dblogger%2526gadget%253Da%2526rewriteMime%253Dimage%25252F*&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fluiscezar.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F03%2Fudt-1974-london-sahara-munich-world-cup.html&amp;h=1024&amp;w=746&amp;tbnid=Q7BmNH_Qh_DcpM%3A&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=y2Izw47orQnaQM&amp;ei=V4BxVMjyCMmuogSx3IFo&amp;tbm=isch&amp;client=safari&amp;ved=0CDAQMygSMBI&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=2776&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=26&lt;/ref&gt; The number of cars entering was lower than the [[1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally]] as the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the resultant drop in global car sales had its effect on motorsport budgets. Many of the manufacturer teams of the 1970 event did not take part four years later. An error in the navigation notes of the event, caused by the end of a road in Algeria being extended several miles in between the compilation of the notes and the rally taking place saw the majority of competitors becoming lost in the Algerian Sahara Desert.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Evan |authorlink1=Evan Green (journalist) |title=A Bootful of Right Arms }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in combination with the most gruelling terrain ever traversed by an international rally to that point saw only seven cars travel the full distance south into Nigeria, with only five then completing the full competition distance to Germany. Of the remainder of the "Kano Seven". the [[Lancia Fulvia]] of [[Shekhar Mehta]] and Lofty Drews suffered engine problems on the return leg from Kano to Tamanresset, was towed to Tunis and air-freighted to [[Salzburg]] to take part in the final part of the event.  The V8 Jeep crewed by Americans Brian Chuchua, Douglas Fortin and Richard Clark made it through Africa, but crashed out of the event following a collision with a large dog in Turkey.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

The majority of the competition did not complete the southern-most leg of the rally, south of the Tamanrasset rally point. Aerial searches for lost competing vehicles were conducted and eventually all cars were accounted for with no casualties. Some competitors abandoned the route and found their own way out of Africa. Notably former Grand Prix racer [[Stirling Moss]] and his co-drivers [[Mike Taylor (racing driver)|Mike Taylor]] and Allan Sell in their Mercedes-Benz arrived at an Algerian military fort with no water to find it abandoned. Moss and his crew-mates were unable to continue until the arrival of a water convoy in the following days.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

Time penalties quickly climbed into large figures during the stages held in Africa with the majority of the field finishing with over a week's worth of time penalties at the finish. The gap between the winning Citroën DS over the first of the factory supported Peugeots that finished second, third and fourth was over 28 hours. The 19th and last classified finisher acquired over 450 hours of time penalties, approximately 18 days behind the winners.

Only 19 cars finished the event, with only five cars completing the full rally distance. The route included a 171&amp;nbsp;km loop in the [[Hoggar mountains]] on the southbound transition of Algeria; of the "Kano Seven" only the winning Citroën and the [[Lancia Fulvia]] of [[Shekhar Mehta]] and Lofty Drews completed this part of the course.  The Escort of Eric Jackson and Bob Bean also completed the loop, but although they started the leg to Kano, they turned back for Tamanrasset after incurring suspension damage in Niger.

'''''Atlántida''''' was a general [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] and [[women's magazine]] published in [[Argentina]] between 1918 and 1970.

==History==
[[File:Revista Atlántida.jpg|left|thumb|A 1958 issue of ''Atlántida'' illustrated by Spanish artist&lt;br&gt;Roberto Martínez Baldrich.]]

The magazine was launched by Uruguayan-Argentine publisher [[Constancio C. Vigil]], who established the [[Editorial Atlántida|Atlántida Publishing House]] in 1918. The company's homonymous weekly would also be its first publication. ''Atlántida'' was designed as a news and general interest weekly tailored primarily for women (the company would concurrently launch ''[[El Gráfico]]'', for sports readers, and the children's magazine ''[[Billiken (magazine)|Billiken]]'').&lt;ref name=monitor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.gov.ar/monitor/nro10/medios.htm |title=El largo camino de Billiken |publisher=''El Monitor'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526142634/http://www.me.gov.ar/monitor/nro10/medios.htm |archivedate=2009-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vigil named both the publishing house and its flagship magazine from a poem of the same name by [[Olegario Víctor Andrade]], who wrote it as an homage to [[Americas|Americanism]].&lt;ref name=lea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learevistas.com/notaHistoria.php?nota=7|title=Atlántida|publisher=''Lea Revistas''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Atlántida'' was an early success, with a circulation of 45,000 of its maiden issue (March 7, 1918), and of 56,000 by the end of the year. Its chief competition was ''El Hogar'', printed by [[Editorial Haynes]] since 1904; ''Atlántida'' generally appealed to a more [[bourgeoisie|upscale]] readership, however. Advertisers secured space in the magazine months in advance, and [[news agent]]s forfeited the right to return unsold copies. Adopting as one of its missions "the destruction of barbaric prejudices which purport women to be inferior," ''Atlántida'' featured [[watercolor]] images of debonair women on its covers, and featured a women's interest section, ''En rueda de damas'' (''Ladies' Round''). It also included sections on culture and the day's politics, notably ''El salón de los pasos perdidos'' (in reference to a pavilion in the [[Argentine Congress]]) and a special supplement printed following the [[1930 Argentine coup d'état]]: ''La Revolución del 6 de Septiembre''. The magazine's editorials, titled ''La vida que pasa'' (''Life as It Happens'') initially reflected Vigil's [[Humanism|humanist]] views. These editorials opposed [[World War I]], and advocated for the rights of [[child poverty|poor children]], the [[disabled]], and [[Argentine Amerindians]], among other traditionally disenfranchised groups.&lt;ref name=lea/&gt; 

The magazine was also notable for its regular contributors, which included [[Leopoldo Lugones]], [[Gabriela Mistral]] (from [[Chile]]), and [[Alfonsina Storni]].  A glossy insert, ''La Semana Gráfica'', was added to publish special reports, and the magazine was the first in Argentina to incorporate entry submission contests, whereby once a month readers were invited to submit witty captions for a given photograph; these contests attracted up to 15,000 entries monthly.&lt;ref name=lea/&gt;

''Atlántida'' was eclipsed by its longtime rival, ''El Hogar'', during the 1940s and '50s, and it became a monthly publication. The magazine's distinctive watercolor covers were created by [[Spain|Spanish]] illustrator [[Roberto Martínez Baldrich]] between 1953 and his death in 1959, after which its covers adopted a [[news magazine]] format. ''Atlántida'' was affected by competition from a growing number of news magazines in Argentina during the 1960s, notably ''Panorama'', ''Primera Plana'', and ''Siete Días Ilustrados'', among others. The 1965 launch of ''Gente'', a celebrity magazine, by its publishers further diffused its readership, and ''Atlántida'' became largely devoted to cultural and current events commentary.&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt; The magazine closed in 1970.&lt;ref name=lea/&gt;

}}

'''Bodhi Day''' is the Buddhist holiday that commemorates the day that the historical Buddha, [[Gautama|Siddhartha Gautama]] (Shakyamuni), experienced [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://familydharma.pulelehuadesign.com/bodhi.htm Buddhist Holidays]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''[[bodhi]]'' in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].  According to tradition, Siddhartha had recently forsaken years of extreme ascetic practices and resolved to sit under a [[peepal]] tree and simply meditate until he found the root of suffering, and how to liberate oneself from it.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[http://www.aboutbuddha.org/english/life-of-buddha-4.htm/ Life of Buddha]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakyamuni's awakening==
Traditions vary on what happened. Some say Siddhartha made a great vow to Nirvana and Earth to find the root of suffering, or die trying.  In other traditions, while meditating he was harassed and tempted by the god [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (literally, "Destroyer" in [[Sanskrit]]), [[demon]] of illusion.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/footsteps.htm Following the Buddha's Footsteps]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other traditions simply state that he entered deeper and deeper states of meditation, confronting the nature of the self.

In the [[Pali Canon]], there are several discourses said to be by Buddha himself, relating to this story.  In The Longer Discourse to Saccaka (MN 36),&lt;ref name="sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.036x.than.html Maha-Saccaka Sutta: The Longer Discourse to Saccaka]&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha describes his Enlightenment in three stages:

# During the first watch of the night,  the Buddha discovered all of his past lives in the [[Samsara|cycle of rebirth]], realizing that he had been born and reborn countless times before.
# During the second watch, the Buddha discovered the Law of [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]], and the importance of living by the [[Eightfold Path]].
# During the third watch, the Buddha discovered the [[Four Noble Truths]], finally reaching [[Nirvana]].

In his words:

{{cquote|My heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'&lt;ref name="sutta"/&gt;}}

All traditions agree that as the [[Venus|morning star]] rose in the sky in the early morning,&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://buddhism.about.com/od/lifeofthebuddha/a/buddhalife.htm The Life of the Buddha] at [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; the third watch of the night, Siddhartha finally found the answers he sought and became Enlightened, and experienced [[Nirvana]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;  Having done so, Siddhartha now became a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] or "Awakened One".&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==Festivals celebrating Buddha's enlightenment==
The enlightenment of the Buddha is yearly celebrated in many Buddhist countries.

===Bodhi Day===
Bodhi Day is observed in many mainstream [[Mahayana]] traditions including the traditional Zen and Pureland Buddhist schools of China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatify.com/japan/bodhi-day-buddhist-holiday.html Bodhi Day: Buddhist Holiday]&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese Zen, it is also known as ''Rohatsu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Holidays 2013|url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhistholidays/tp/buddhistholidays.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tendai]] and other Japanese sects, it is called either {{Nihongo|''Shaka-Jōdō-e''|釈迦成道会|||}} or simply {{Nihongo|''Jōdō-e''|成道会|||}}.

Services and traditions vary amongst Buddhist sects, but all such services commemorate the Buddha's achievement of Nirvana, and what this means for [[Buddhism]] today.&lt;ref name="howto"&gt;[http://www.doityourself.com/stry/bodhi-day How To Celebrate Bodhi Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="celebrate"&gt;[http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/Ryuei/BodhiDay.html Celebrating the Buddha's Awakening]&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals may choose to commemorate the event through additional meditation,&lt;ref name="celebrate"/&gt; study of the Dharma,&lt;ref name="celebrate"/&gt; chanting of Buddhist texts (sutras), or performing kind acts towards other beings. Some Buddhists celebrate with a traditional meal of tea, cake, and readings.&lt;ref name="howto"/&gt;

===Rohatsu===
The word ''Rōhatsu'' (臘八) is Japanese and literally means 8th Day of the 12th Month. It is typical for Zen monks and layman followers to stay up the entire night before Rohatsu practicing meditation, and the holiday is often preceded by an intensive [[sesshin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhismglossaryr/g/Rohatsu.htm Rohatsu] at [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is observed on the Gregorian date of December 8 as a result of the Westernization of Japan during the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1862–1869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lotustemple.us/meditationtimesevents.html Lotus Zen Temple]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laba===
The Chinese version of this festival is called ''[[Laba Festival|Laba]]'' (臘八) which means the Eighth Day of the La (or the Twelfth) Month of the [[Chinese Lunar Calendar]]. It is most often observed in the first half of January, but it may happen on a date between the [[Winter Solstice]] (December 22) and the [[Chinese New Year]] (between January 22 and February 21).

===Vesak Day===
Bodhi Day is not as popularly celebrated as [[Vesak|Vesak Day]], on which the birth, enlightenment ([[nirvana|Nirvāna]]), and passing away ([[Parinirvana|Parinirvāna]]) of [[Gautama Buddha]] are celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/visakha.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, ex-[[Deep Purple]] vocalist [[Rod Evans]] was contacted by a management team who offered him a chance to play under the Deep Purple name again, which he took. He fronted this band of unknown session musicians, which became known to Deep Purple fans as the '''Bogus Deep Purple'''. The band played across the US, Canada and Mexico, with many shows ending in riots. 

The management company behind the Bogus Deep Purple registered "Deep Purple" as an LLC in February 1980 and mentioned that an album was to be recorded.

On 18 August 1980, the real Deep Purple put an ad in a newspaper underneath an ad for a Bogus Deep Purple concert that was to take place at Long Beach Arena in California, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
The following STARS WILL NOT PERFORM at the
Deep Purple Concert at
Long Beach Arena Tomorrow, Aug. 19, 1980.

'''[[Ritchie Blackmore|RITCHIE BLACKMORE]]'''
'''[[David Coverdale|DAVID COVERDALE]]'''
'''[[Ian Gillan|IAN GILLAN]]'''
'''[[Roger Glover|ROGER GLOVER]]'''
'''[[Glenn Hughes|GLEN HUGHES]]''' (sic)
'''[[Jon Lord|JON LORD]]'''
'''[[Ian Paice|IAN PAICE]]'''
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real Deep Purple were contacted about the bogus Deep Purple, and their management sued Evans, given that he was the only member of the band who received booking [[royalties]] and who had any rights to the name "Deep Purple". Evans was sued for damages of $672,000 (USD) (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|672000|1980}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for using the band name without permission, which included $168,000 in actual damages (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|168000|1980}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and $504,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|504000|1980}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in punitive damages. Being unable to pay this amount, Evans was required to forfeit all future royalties from the albums and singles recorded by the Mark I lineup of Deep Purple. This effectively ended Evans' career as a performing musician, as any future earnings he made from performing would have to be paid toward the lawsuit and since then, he no longer receives royalties for his work with Deep Purple.

Both [[Ian Paice]] and [[Jon Lord]] remarked it was not about money, but about saving the good name of Deep Purple. Paice stated, "We didn't make that money, it all went to the lawyers involved. [But] the only chance to stop that band was to sue Rod." Lord acknowledged that he did not enjoy having to testify in court against Evans and blamed him for being silly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/aprilskies/65/dp1980.html |year=1998 |work=Captain Beyond website |title=ROD EVANS: The Dark Side of the Music Industry |author=Hartmut Kreckel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313204251/http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/aprilskies/65/dp1980.html |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrumentalists had previously played in a fake Steppenwolf band organised by the same management company a few years before - in fact, there is one gig report stating that the Bogus Steppenwolf opened for the Bogus Deep Purple, using exactly the same backing band.

'''Bubble Yum''' is a brand of [[bubble gum]] marketed by [[The Hershey Company]].  

Introduced in 1975 by [[Life Savers]], the bubble gum was the first soft bubble gum created. It was created by a homemaker in Fisk, Missouri, who named it "rubber bubblegum." She gave some to her son to pass out at school. She soon sold the recipe to the lifesavers candy Division in St Louis. &lt;ref name=ries&gt;{{citation|title=Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind|last=Ries|first=Al|last2=Trout|first2=Jack|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=135&amp;ndash;136|date=2001|isbn=0-07-135916-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1977, rumors began to spread that the gum's soft, chewable secret was the addition of [[spider]] eggs.&lt;ref name=brunvard&gt;{{citation|title=Too Good to Be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd6CeqJVuC4C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22bubble+yum%22+history|page=92&amp;ndash;93|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|date=1999|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0-393-04734-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Life Savers|Life Savers Company]] addressed the issue with an official full-page rebuttal printed in prominent U.S. newspapers (including ''[[The New York Times]]''), to dispel the rumor and restore public confidence.&lt;ref name=brunvard/&gt;  Sales of the gum soon surpassed sales of Life Savers candy, and it became the most popular bubble gum brand.&lt;ref name=ries/&gt;  [[Nabisco]] bought Life Savers in 1981, and [[The Hershey Company]] acquired the brand in 2000.

Bubble Yum's official [[mascot]] is '''Floyd D. Duck''', an [[anthropomorphic]] [[punk fashion|punk-style]] [[duck]] character.

The '''Burning of Dungannon''' took place in June 1602 when [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone]] abandoned and set fire to [[Dungannon]], the traditional capital of the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]].&lt;ref&gt;McCavitt p.44&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the beginning of the final stage of [[Tyrone's Rebellion]] when the Earl became a fugitive, before his sudden reprieve the following year.

Following the defeat of his army at the 1601 [[Battle of Kinsale]], Tyrone retreated into his heartland in [[County Tyrone]], [[Ulster]]. Courted by the Crown, many of his allied Gaelic lords now changed sides, which turned much of the local population against him. Tyrone was faced with a three-pronged [[pincer movement]] with separate forces under [[Henry Docwra]], [[Arthur Chichester]] and [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy|Lord Mountjoy]] advancing on him from [[Derry]], [[Carrickfergus]] and [[Dundalk]] respectively. A major tactic of Tyrone's had been to avoid fighting stand-up battles, preferring to retreat and [[ambush]]. He therefore decided to abandon the town and gave orders to torch it.

Soon after his cousin and enemy, [[Conn MacShane O'Neill]], the son of [[Séan Ó Néill|Shane O'Neill]], seized the castle and held it against the Earl&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Manuscripts of the Most Honorable Marquis of Salisbury, Volume 12, 1910, pg. 394-395&lt;/ref&gt;.  Mountjoy then occupied the ruins of Dungannon. Tyrone and what remained of his followers retreated into the [[Glenconkeyne|Glenconkeyne Woods]] where he continued to evade capture. Despite his military defeat, Tyrone was restored to royal favour following political developments in [[London]]. The resulting [[Treaty of Mellifont]] gave Tyrone a full [[pardon]] and restored his territories to him. Tyrone then travelled to London to submit to the new King [[James I of England|James I]]. Following the Treaty, the Earl repossessed his lands and began the rebuilding of Dungannon.

'''Carassauga''' is an annual multicultural festival in [[Mississauga|Mississauga, Ontario]], founded in 1985. It features culinary and artistic Pavilions representing various countries and cultures.&lt;ref name="TomUrbaniak2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=Tom Urbaniak | title=Her Worship: Hazel Mccallion and the Development of Mississauga | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zXCcOcNgbAC&amp;pg=PA206 | accessdate=31 March 2013 | date=3 April 2009 | publisher=University of Toronto Press | isbn=978-0-8020-9902-0 | pages=206–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Carassauga is an incorporated non-profit volunteer community organization. The Festival was developed in response to a challenge put out by the former Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]] to all ethno-cultural groups at a meeting she called in the old City Hall in the fall of 1985. This Festival of Cultures reflects the rich ethnic mosaic of the [[Mississauga]] community and promotes public awareness and appreciation of multiple cultures during the 3 day event occurring in the month of May.

== Pavilions ==

Each year, Carassauga hosts Cultural Pavilions that represent different countries. The Pavilions are located in various cultural and recreation centres throughout the City of Mississauga. Once inside a pavilion, visitors are surrounded by the sights, sounds and tastes of the country being represented. Each pavilion depicts their culture through food, entertainment, art, historical displays and vendors.

== Sponsorship ==

In its early years, the festival relied solely on the grants from the City Council. It became financially independent in 1995.&lt;ref name="Good2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristin Good|title=Municipalities and Multiclturalism: The Politics of Immigration in Toronto and Vancouver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngMCCV64WrkC&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=31 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-0993-8|pages=84–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, Carassauga is funded by the City of Mississauga, the Federal and Provincial Governments as well as several sponsors and business partners.

Also, as a result of loss of [[cerebral circulation|cerebral perfusion]] (blood flow to the [[human brain|brain]]), the victim will rapidly lose [[unconsciousness|consciousness]] and will stop breathing. The main criterion for diagnosing a cardiac arrest, as opposed to [[respiratory arrest]], which shares many of the same features, is lack of [[Circulatory system|circulation]]; however, there are a number of ways of determining this. [[Near-death experience]]s are reported by 10 to –20 percent of people who survived cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parnia|first=S|author2=Spearpoint, K|author3=Fenwick, PB|date=August 2007|title=Near death experiences, cognitive function and psychological outcomes of surviving cardiac arrest.|journal=Resuscitation|volume=74|issue=2|pages=215–21|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.01.020|pmid=17416449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) occur when the heart abruptly begins to beat in an abnormal or irregular rhythm ([[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]). Without organized electrical activity in the heart muscle, there is no consistent contraction of the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s, which results in the heart's inability to generate an adequate [[cardiac output]] (forward pumping of blood from heart to rest of the body).&lt;ref name=UTD2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest?source=see_link#H5|title=Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest|last=Podrid|first=Philip J|date=2016-08-22|website=www.uptodate.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of arrhythmias, but the ones most frequently recorded in SCA and SCD are [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT) or [[ventricular fibrillation]] (VF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zipes|first=Douglas P.|last2=Camm|first2=A.

Sudden cardiac arrest can result from cardiac and non-cardiac causes including the following:

=== Coronary artery disease ===
[[Coronary artery disease]] (CAD), also known as [[ischemic heart disease]], is responsible for 62 to 70 percent of all SCDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|date=2002-02-15|title=State-specific mortality from sudden cardiac death--United States, 1999|journal=MMWR.

Cases have shown that the most common finding at postmortem examination of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is chronic high-grade [[stenosis]] of at least one segment of a major coronary artery,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WifwPEsKQMC&amp;pg=PA460&amp;lpg=PA460|title=Atherothrombosis and Coronary Artery Disease|last=Fuster|first=Valentin|last2=Topol|first2=Eric J.|last3=Nabel|first3=Elizabeth G.|date=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781735834|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603002043/https://books.google.com/books?id=1WifwPEsKQMC&amp;pg=PA460&amp;lpg=PA460|archivedate=2016-06-03|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the arteries that supply the heart muscle with its blood supply.

===Structural heart disease not related to CAD===
Structural heart disease not related to CAD (i.e. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary artery anomalies, myocarditis) account for 10% of all SCDs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=UTD2016/&gt; Examples of these include: [[cardiomyopathy]], [[Cardiac arrhythmia|cardiac rhythm disturbances]], [[myocarditis]], [[hypertensive heart disease]],&lt;ref name="Circ012"&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2001|title=Sudden cardiac death in the United States, 1989 to 1998|url=|journal=Circulation|volume=104|issue=18|pages=2158–63|doi=10.1161/hc4301.098254|pmid=11684624|vauthors=Zheng ZJ, Croft JB, Giles WH, Mensah GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="AHJ982"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 1998|title=Sudden coronary death in women|url=|journal=Am.

Long QT syndrome, a condition often mentioned in young people's deaths, occurs in one of every 5000 to 7000 newborns and is estimated to be responsible for 3000 deaths each year compared to the approximately 300,000&lt;ref name="AHA2"&gt;[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4741 Sudden Cardiac Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325174959/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4741|date=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; cardiac arrests seen by emergency services. These conditions are a fraction of the overall deaths related to cardiac arrest, but represent conditions which may be detected prior to arrest and may be treatable.

The risk factors for SCD are similar to those of coronary artery disease and include age, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, lack of [[physical exercise]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], and [[family history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1998|title=Family history as a risk factor for primary cardiac arrest|url=|journal=Circulation|volume=97|issue=2|pages=155–60|doi=10.1161/01.cir.97.2.155|pmid=9445167|vauthors=Friedlander Y, Siscovick DS, Weinmann S, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest also increases the risk of future episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|last=Myerburg|first=Robert J|last2=Castellanos|first2=Agustin|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Kasper, Dennis L.,, Fauci, Anthony S., Hauser, Stephen L.,, Longo, Dan L.

Current cigarette smokers with coronary artery disease were found to have a two to threefold increase in the risk of sudden death between ages 30 and 59. Furthermore, it was found that former smokers’ risk was closer to that of those who had never smoked.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Ilan|last2=Jonas|first2=Michael|last3=Tenenbaum|first3=Alexander|last4=Boyko|first4=Valentina|last5=Matetzky|first5=Shlomi|last6=Shotan|first6=Avraham|last7=Behar|first7=Solomon|last8=Reicher-Reiss|first8=Henrietta|last9=Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Study Group|date=2003-10-27|title=Current smoking, smoking cessation, and the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|volume=163|issue=19|pages=2301–2305|doi=10.1001/archinte.163.19.2301|issn=0003-9926|pmid=14581249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Ventricular fibrillation.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Ventricular fibrillation]]
The mechanism of death in the majority of people dying sudden cardiac deaths is [[ventricular fibrillation]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Ca/&gt; Structural changes in the diseased heart as a result of inherited factors (mutations in ion-channel coding genes for example) cannot explain the suddenness of SCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms of sudden cardiac death|journal = Journal of Clinical Investigation|date = 2005|issn = 0021-9738|pmc = 1193893|pmid = 16138184|pages = 2305–2315|volume = 115|issue = 9|doi = 10.1172/JCI26381|first = Michael|last = Rubart|first2 = Douglas P.|last2 = Zipes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, sudden cardiac death could be the consequence of electric-mechanical disjunction and bradyarrhythmias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms of Sudden Cardiac Death in Myocardial Infarction Survivors Insights From the Randomized Trials of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators|url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/115/18/2451|journal = Circulation|date = 2007|issn = 0009-7322|pmid = 17485594|pages = 2451–2457|volume = 115|issue = 18|doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.683235|language = en|first = T.

==Diagnosis==
Cardiac arrest is synonymous with [[clinical death]].
A cardiac arrest is usually diagnosed clinically by the absence of a pulse.  In many cases lack of [[pulse|carotid pulse]] is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for diagnosing cardiac arrest, as lack of a pulse (particularly in the peripheral pulses) may result from other conditions (e.g. [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]), or simply an error on the part of the rescuer. Nonetheless, studies have shown that rescuers often make a mistake when checking the carotid pulse in an emergency, whether they are healthcare professionals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ochoa FJ, Ramalle-Gómara E, Carpintero JM, García A, Saralegui I |title=Competence of health professionals to check the carotid pulse |journal=Resuscitation |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=173–5 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9715777 |doi= 10.1016/S0300-9572(98)00055-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or lay persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bahr J, Klingler H, Panzer W, Rode H, Kettler D |title=Skills of lay people in checking the carotid pulse |journal=Resuscitation |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=23–6 |date=August 1997 |pmid=9259056 |doi= 10.1016/S0300-9572(96)01092-1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the inaccuracy in this method of diagnosis, some bodies such as the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) have de-emphasised its importance. The Resuscitation Council (UK), in line with the ERC's recommendations and those of the American Heart Association,&lt;ref name="AHA05"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=ECC Committee, Subcommittees and Task Forces of the American Heart Association|date=December 2005|title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care|url=|journal=Circulation|volume=112|issue=24 Suppl|pages=IV1–203|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166550|pmid=16314375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
have suggested that the technique should be used only by healthcare professionals with specific training and expertise, and even then that it should be viewed in conjunction with other indicators such as [[agonal respiration]].&lt;ref name="RCUK2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/guide.htm |title=Resuscitation Council (UK) Guidelines 2005 |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215230632/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/guide.htm |archivedate=2009-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other methods for detecting circulation have been proposed. Guidelines following the 2000 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recommendations were for rescuers to look for "signs of circulation", but not specifically the pulse.&lt;ref name=AHA05/&gt; These signs included coughing, gasping, colour, twitching and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=British Red Cross; St Andrew's Ambulance Association; St John Ambulance |title=First Aid Manual: The Authorised Manual of St. John Ambulance, St. Andrew's Ambulance Association, and the British Red Cross |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishers Ltd |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-4053-1573-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in face of evidence that these guidelines were ineffective, the current recommendation of ILCOR is that cardiac arrest should be diagnosed in all casualties who are unconscious and not breathing normally.&lt;ref name=AHA05/&gt; Another method is to use [[molecular autopsy]] or postmortem molecular testing which uses a set of molecular techniques to find the ion channels that are cardiac defective.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Classifications===
Clinicians classify cardiac arrest into "shockable" versus "non–shockable", as determined by the [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] rhythm.  This refers to whether a particular class of [[cardiac dysrhythmia]] is treatable using [[defibrillation]].&lt;ref name="RCUK2005"/&gt; The two "shockable" rhythms are [[ventricular fibrillation]] and [[pulseless ventricular tachycardia]] while the two "non–shockable" rhythms are [[asystole]] and [[pulseless electrical activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ABC of resuscitation|editors=Jasmeet Soar, Gavin D. Perkins, Jerry Nolan.|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=9781118474853|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNgrOsHjIKEC&amp;pg=PA43|edition=6th|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905133735/https://books.google.com/books?id=vNgrOsHjIKEC&amp;pg=PA43|archivedate=2017-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
With positive outcomes following cardiac arrest unlikely, an effort has been spent in finding effective strategies to prevent cardiac arrest.  With the prime causes of cardiac arrest being [[ischemic heart disease]], efforts to promote a [[healthy diet]], [[exercise]], and [[smoking cessation]] are important. For people at risk of heart disease, measures such as [[blood pressure]] control, [[cholesterol]] lowering, and other medico-therapeutic interventions are used.{{ref}} A [[Cochrane review]] published in 2016 found moderate-quality evidence to show that blood pressure-lowering drugs do not appear to reduce sudden cardiac death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taverny|first1=G|last2=Mimouni|first2=Y|last3=LeDigarcher|first3=A|last4=Chevalier|first4=P|last5=Thijs|first5=L|last6=Wright|first6=JM|last7=Gueyffier|first7=F|title=Antihypertensive pharmacotherapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death in hypertensive individuals.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 March 2016|volume=3|pages=CD011745|pmid=26961575|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011745.pub2|accessdate=19 March 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011745.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code teams===
In medical parlance, cardiac arrest is referred to as a "code" or a "crash". This typically refers to "code blue" on the [[hospital emergency codes]]. A dramatic drop in vital sign measurements is referred to as "coding" or "crashing", though coding is usually used when it results in cardiac arrest, while crashing might not. Treatment for cardiac arrest is sometimes referred to as "calling a code".

People in general wards often deteriorate for several hours or even days before a cardiac arrest occurs.&lt;ref name="RCUK2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kause et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kause J, Smith G, Prytherch D, Parr M, Flabouris A, Hillman K |title=A comparison of antecedents to cardiac arrests, deaths and emergency intensive care admissions in Australia and New Zealand, and the United Kingdom—the ACADEMIA study |journal=Resuscitation |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=275–82 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15325446 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2004.05.016 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to a lack of knowledge and skill amongst ward-based staff, in particular a failure to carry out measurement of the [[respiratory rate]], which is often the major predictor of a deterioration&lt;ref name="RCUK2005" /&gt; and can often change up to 48 hours prior to a cardiac arrest. In response to this, many hospitals now have increased training for ward-based staff. A number of "early warning" systems also exist which aim to quantify the person's risk of deterioration based on their [[vital signs]] and thus provide a guide to staff. In addition, specialist staff are being used more effectively in order to augment the work already being done at ward level. These include:
* Crash teams (or code teams) – These are designated staff members with particular expertise in resuscitation who are called to the scene of all arrests within the hospital. This usually involves a specialized cart of equipment (including [[defibrillation|defibrillator]]) and drugs called a "[[crash cart]]" or "crash trolley".
* [[Medical emergency team]]s – These teams respond to all emergencies, with the aim of treating the people in the acute phase of their illness in order to prevent a cardiac arrest. These teams have been found to decrease the rates of in hospital cardiac arrest and improve survival.&lt;ref name=AHA2015Part4/&gt;
* Critical care outreach – As well as providing the services of the other two types of team, these teams are also responsible for educating non-specialist staff. In addition, they help to facilitate transfers between [[Intensive care unit|intensive care/high dependency units]] and the general hospital wards. This is particularly important, as many studies have shown that a significant percentage of patients discharged from critical care environments quickly deteriorate and are re-admitted; the outreach team offers support to ward staff to prevent this from happening.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Implantable cardioverter defibrillator===
[[File:Blausen_0543_ImplantableCardioverterDefibrillator_InsideLeads.png|upright=1.3|thumb|Illustration of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)]]
An [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|implantable cardioverter defibrillator]] (ICD) is a battery powered device that monitors electrical activity in the heart and when an arrhythmia or asystole is detected is able to deliver an electrical shock to terminate the abnormal rhythm. ICDs are used to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those that have survived a prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia [[Secondary prevention|(secondary prevention]]).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Members|first=Writing Committee|last2=Epstein|first2=Andrew E.|last3=DiMarco|first3=John P.|last4=Ellenbogen|first4=Kenneth A.|last5=Estes|first5=N.

Numerous studies have been conducted on the use of ICDs for the secondary prevention of SCD. These studies have shown improved survival with ICDs compared to the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; ICD therapy is associated with a 50% [[relative risk reduction]] in death caused by an arrhythmia and a 25% relative risk reduction in all cause mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=S.

Primary prevention of SCD with ICD therapy for high risk patient populations has similarly shown improved survival rates in a number of large studies. The high risk patient populations in these studies were defined as those with severe [[ischemic cardiomyopathy]] (determined by a reduced [[Ejection fraction|left ventricular ejection fraction]] (LVEF)). The LVEF criteria used in these trials ranged from less than or equal to 30% in MADIT-II to less than or equal to 40% in MUSTT.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Diet===
Marine-derived [[Omega 3 fatty acid|omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFAs) has been promoted for the prevention of sudden cardiac death due to its postulated ability to lower [[triglyceride]] levels, prevent [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, decrease [[platelet aggregation]], and lower blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Omega-3 fatty acids |work=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |author=Neil K.

==Management==
Sudden cardiac arrest may be treated via attempts at [[resuscitation]].  This is usually carried out based upon [[basic life support]] (BLS)/[[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS),&lt;ref name="AHA05"/&gt; [[pediatric advanced life support]] (PALS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=2005 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) of pediatric and neonatal patients: pediatric advanced life support |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=e1005–28 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16651281 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0346 |url= |last1= American Heart |first1= Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[neonatal resuscitation program]] (NRP) guidelines.

===Cardiopulmonary resuscitation===
[[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is a key part of the management of cardiac arrest. It is recommended that it be started as soon as possible and interrupted as little as possible. The component of CPR that seems to make the greatest difference in most cases is the [[chest compressions]]. Correctly performed bystander CPR has been shown to increase survival; however, it is performed in less than 30% of out of hospital arrests {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Mutchner L 2007 60–9; quiz 69–70"/&gt; If high-quality CPR has not resulted in [[return of spontaneous circulation]] and the person's heart rhythm is in [[asystole]], discontinuing CPR and pronouncing the person's death is reasonable after 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=UK2010/&gt; Exceptions to this include those with [[hypothermia]] or who have [[drowning|drowned]].&lt;ref name=UK2010&gt;{{cite web|author1=Resuscitation Council (UK)|title=Pre-hospital cardiac arrest|url=https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/prehosca.pdf|website=www.resus.org.uk|accessdate=3 September 2014|page=41|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513032323/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/prehosca.pdf|archivedate=13 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer durations of CPR may be reasonable in those who have cardiac arrest while in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Resuscitation Council (UK)|title=Comments on the duration of CPR following the publication of 'Duration of resuscitation efforts and survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest: an observational study' Goldberger ZD et al.

Defibrillation is indicated if a shockable rhythm is present. The two shockable rhythms are [[ventricular fibrillation]] and [[pulseless ventricular tachycardia]]. In children 2 to 4 J/Kg is recommended.&lt;ref name="AHA2015Part12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Caen|first1=AR|last2=Berg|first2=MD|last3=Chameides|first3=L|last4=Gooden|first4=CK|last5=Hickey|first5=RW|last6=Scott|first6=HF|last7=Sutton|first7=RM|last8=Tijssen|first8=JA|last9=Topjian|first9=A|date=3 November 2015|title=Part 12: Pediatric Advanced Life Support: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|volume=132|issue=18 Suppl 2|pages=S526-42|doi=10.1161/cir.0000000000000266|pmid=26473000|last10=van der Jagt|first10=ÉW|last11=Schexnayder|first11=SM|last12=Samson|first12=RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there is increasing use of public access defibrillation. This involves placing an [[automated external defibrillator]] in public places, and training staff in these areas how to use them. This allows defibrillation to take place prior to the arrival of emergency services, and has been shown to lead to increased chances of survival. Some defibrillators even provide feedback on the quality of CPR compressions, encouraging the lay rescuer to press the person's chest hard enough to circulate blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeassisttraining.com/zollaedplus.html Zoll AED Plus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621004342/http://www.lifeassisttraining.com/zollaedplus.html|date=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been shown that those who have arrests in remote locations have worse outcomes following cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="Lyon ''et al.'' 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lyon R.M|author2=Cobbe S.M.|author3=Bradley J.M.|author4=Grubb N.R.|display-authors=etal|year=2004|title=Surviving out of hospital cardiac arrest at home: a postcode lottery?|url=|journal=Emergency Medical Journal|volume=21|issue=|pages=619–624|doi=10.1136/emj.2003.010363|pmc=1726412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent meta-analysis found that the use of therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with improved survival rates and better neurological outcomes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Do not resuscitate===
Some people choose to avoid aggressive measures at the end of life.  A [[do not resuscitate]] order (DNR) in the form of an [[advance health care directive]] makes it clear that in the event of cardiac arrest, the person does not wish to receive [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loertscher|first=L |author2=Reed, DA |author3=Bannon, MP |author4=Mueller, PS|title=Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and do-not-resuscitate orders: a guide for clinicians|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=January 2010|volume=123|issue=1|pages=4–9|pmid=20102982|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.05.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other directives may be made to stipulate the desire for [[intubation]] in the event of [[respiratory failure]] or, if comfort measures are all that are desired, by stipulating that healthcare providers should "allow natural death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knox|first=C|author2=Vereb, JA|title=Allow natural death: a more humane approach to discussing end-of-life directives|journal=Journal of Emergency Nursing|date=December 2005|volume=31|issue=6|pages=560–1|pmid=16308044|doi=10.1016/j.jen.2005.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chain of survival===
Several organizations promote the idea of a [[chain of survival]].  The chain consists of the following "links":
* Early recognition – If possible, recognition of illness before the person develops a cardiac arrest will allow the rescuer to prevent its occurrence. Early recognition that a cardiac arrest has occurred is key to survival – for every minute a patient stays in cardiac arrest, their chances of survival drop by roughly 10%.&lt;ref name="RCUK2005"/&gt;
* Early CPR – improves the flow of blood and of oxygen to vital organs, an essential component of treating a cardiac arrest. In particular, by keeping the brain supplied with oxygenated blood, chances of neurological damage are decreased.
* Early defibrillation – is effective for the management of [[ventricular fibrillation]] and pulseless [[ventricular tachycardia]]&lt;ref name = "RCUK2005"/&gt; 
* Early advanced care 
* Early post-resuscitation care which may include [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millin|first1=MG|last2=Comer|first2=AC|last3=Nable|first3=JV|last4=Johnston|first4=PV|last5=Lawner|first5=BJ|last6=Woltman|first6=N|last7=Levy|first7=MJ|last8=Seaman|first8=KG|last9=Hirshon|first9=JM|title=Patients without ST elevation after return of spontaneous circulation may benefit from emergent percutaneous intervention: A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Resuscitation|date=15 September 2016|volume=108|pages=54–60|pmid=27640933|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one or more links in the chain are missing or delayed, then the chances of survival drop significantly.

These protocols are often initiated by a [[Code Blue (emergency code)|code blue]], which usually denotes impending or acute onset of cardiac arrest or [[respiratory failure]], although in practice, code blue is often called in less life-threatening situations that require immediate attention from a physician.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

A study of survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest found that 14.6% of those who had received resuscitation by ambulance staff survived as far as admission to hospital. Of these, 59% died during admission, half of these within the first 24 hours, while 46% survived until discharge from hospital. This reflects an overall survival following cardiac arrest of 6.8%. Of these 89% had normal brain function or mild neurological disability, 8.5% had moderate impairment, and 2% had major neurological disability. Of those who were discharged from hospital, 70% were still alive four years later.&lt;ref name="Cobbe2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1996|title=Survival of 1476 patients initially resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest|url=|journal=BMJ|volume=312|issue=7047|pages=1633–7|doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7047.1633|pmc=2351362|pmid=8664715|vauthors=Cobbe SM, Dalziel K, Ford I, Marsden AK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Based on death certificates, sudden cardiac death accounts for about 15% of all deaths in Western countries.&lt;ref name=Circ01&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheng ZJ, Croft JB, Giles WH, Mensah GA |title=Sudden cardiac death in the United States, 1989 to 1998 |journal=Circulation |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=2158–63 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11684624 |doi= 10.1161/hc4301.098254|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States 326,000 cases of out of hospital and 209,000 cases of in hospital cardiac arrest occur among adults a year.&lt;ref name=AHA2015Part4/&gt; The lifetime risk is three times greater in men (12.3%) than women (4.2%) based on analysis of the [[Framingham Heart Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/120/18_MeetingAbstracts/S416-c?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=lloyd-jones&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=10&amp;sortspec=date&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608182635/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/120/18_MeetingAbstracts/S416-c?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=lloyd-jones&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=10&amp;sortspec=date&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-08 |title=Abstract 969: Lifetime Risk for Sudden Cardiac Death at Selected Index Ages and by Risk Factor Strata and Race: Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project – Lloyd-Jones et al. 120 (10018): S416 – Circulation |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this gender difference disappeared beyond 85 years of age.&lt;ref name=Circ01/&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Names===
In many publications the stated or implicit meaning of "sudden cardiac death" is sudden [[death]] from cardiac causes.&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sometimes physicians call cardiac arrest "sudden cardiac death" even if the person survives. Thus one can hear mentions of "prior episodes of sudden cardiac death" in a living person.&lt;ref name="pmid_18513397"&gt;{{Citation |last=Porter |first=I |last2=Vacek |first2=J |year=2008 |title=Single ventricle with persistent truncus arteriosus as two rare entities in an adult patient: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=2 |issue= |pages=184 |pmid=18513397 |pmc=2424060 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-184 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the American Heart Association presented the following definitions of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death: "Cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation. If corrective measures are not taken rapidly, this condition progresses to sudden death. Cardiac arrest should be used to signify an event as described above, that is reversed, usually by CPR and/or defibrillation or cardioversion, or cardiac pacing. Sudden cardiac death should not be used to describe events that are not fatal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buxton|first=Alfred E.|last2=Calkins|first2=Hugh|last3=Callans|first3=David J.|last4=DiMarco|first4=John P.|last5=Fisher|first5=John D.|last6=Greene|first6=H.

In some medical facilities, the resuscitation team may purposely respond slowly to a person in cardiac arrest, a practice known as "[[slow code]]", or may fake the response altogether for the sake of the person's family, a practice known as "show code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/22/opinion/slow-codes-show-codes-and-death.html|title=Slow Codes, Show Codes and Death|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Company|date=22 August 1987|accessdate=2013-04-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518042545/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/22/opinion/slow-codes-show-codes-and-death.html|archivedate=18 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally done for people for whom performing CPR will have no medical benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpso.on.ca/policies/policies/default.aspx?ID=1582|title=Decision-making for the End of Life|others=Physician Advisory Service|publisher=[[College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario]]|date=May 2006|accessdate=2013-04-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509161003/http://www.cpso.on.ca/policies/policies/default.aspx?ID=1582|archivedate=2013-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices are ethically controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/lnc/journalarticle?Article_ID=437848|title="Slow" Code: Perspectives of a Physician and Critical Care Nurse|last1=DePalma|first1=Judith A.|last2=Miller|first2=Scott|last3=Ozanich|first3=Evelyn|last4=Yancich|first4=Lynne M.|work=Critical Care Nursing Quarterly|volume=22|issue=3|pages=89–99|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams and Wilkins]]|date=November 1999|issn=1550-5111|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328192748/http://www.nursingcenter.com/lnc/journalarticle?Article_ID=437848|archivedate=2013-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are banned in some jurisdictions.

'''CPH:DOX''' is the official name for the '''Copenhagen International Documentary Festival''', an international [[documentary film]] festival established in 2003 and held annually in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. CPH:DOX has since grown to become one of the largest documentary film festivals in Europe with 110.500 admissions in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://cphdox.dk/en/cphdox-sets-a-new-record-with-110500-admissions-in-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

CPH:DOX is devoted to supporting independent and innovative film and to present contemporary non-fiction, art cinema and experimental film. The festival has been recognized for its sharp and daring programme profile with a special focus on exploring the hybrid field between documentary practice and various type of staging - sometimes to controversial effect, as when Harmony Korine won the CPH:DOX Award in 2009 for his film ''Trash Humpers''.

Besides its seven international competitions, the festival presents parallel curated and guest curated sections. In recent years, artists and filmmakers such as The xx, Anohni, Harmony Korine, Animal Collective, Nan Goldin, Douglas Gordon, Ben Rivers &amp; Ben Russell, [[Ai Weiwei]], The Yes Men, Olafur Eliasson and Naomi Klein &amp; Avi Lewis have curated film programmes exclusively for CPH:DOX. Parallel to this the festival has been presenting retrospective programmes with among others Phillippe Grandrieux, Nathalie Djurberg, Vincent Moon, Charles Atlas, and James Benning &amp; Sadie Benning, as well as installations and exhibitions film and video artists, among them Michelangelo Frammartino, Keren Cytter and Charles Atlas.

The festival hosts seminars, debates and events as well as the curated concert series AUDIO:VISUALS, where bands and artists such as Animal Collective, The Knife, John Maus, Nan Goldin &amp; Genesis P-Orridge, Patti Smith, Beach House have been performing to original work created for the occasion by visual artists.

CPH:DOX also presents a number of other initiatives parallel to the festival itself. The industry platform [https://cphdox.dk/en/cphforum/ CPH:FORUM], with the attached CPH:MARKET for buyers and programmers, is a financing and co-production forum as well as a networking facility which takes place for three days during the festival. In 2011, the related ART:FILM branch was launched with the aim to facilitate the development and actual production of artists' films in the feature length format. CPH:DOX runs the five-day [https://cphdox.dk/en/cphconference-2018/ CPH:Conference] as well as the experimental educational course [https://cphdox.dk/mere-end-film/doxacademy/ DOX:Academy] for students, both of which take place during the festival.

In 2009, the festival launched the international talent development and film production workshop [http://www.cphlab.dk/ CPH:LAB] (formerly known as DOX:LAB) where around 20 filmmakers are invited each year to develop and direct a film in teams of two. CPH:LAB has been a great success with films premiering and winning prizes at film festivals such as Venice, the Berlinale, Rotterdam, and elsewhere.

Following the 2015 edition of CPH:DOX, the festival announced that it would change its dates from November to March, and the first of the new spring editions of the festival was held from March 16–26, 2017, with the centrally located [https://kunsthalcharlottenborg.dk/en/ Kunsthal Charlottenborg] as the new festival center. The next edition of CPH:DOX is held from March 20–31, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://cphdox.dk/en/cphdox-moves-festival-dates-to-march/&lt;/ref&gt;

CPH: DOX is part of the [[Doc Alliance]] – a creative partnership between 7 key European documentary film festivals.

== History ==
Cyber Centurion was set up in 2014 after the success of its US counterpart [[CyberPatriot]] and its first final took place at [[The National Museum of Computing]] on 17 April 2015.&lt;ref name="tnmoc.org"/&gt; The main aim of Cyber Centurion is the same as its US counterpart; to excite, educate and motivate children towards careers in STEM subjects, with an emphasis on Cyber Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northropgrumman.com/MediaResources/MediaKits/CYBERUK/Documents/2017-CyberPatriotCenturion-UK.PDF|title=Cyber Patriot/Centurion Quick Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also due to the large deficit in Cyber Security professionals. Northrop Grumman, the sponsors of both [[CyberPatriot]] and CyberCenturion hope that it will inspire youths towards choosing Cyber Security as a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northropgrumman.com/CorporateResponsibility/Pages/CyberCenturion.aspx|title=Cyber Centurion - Northrop Grumman Corporate Responsibility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition format ==

=== Tracks &amp; Categories ===
CyberCenturion is split into two age categories, each with four 'tracks'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is done to encourage more diversity in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/competitions/cybercenturion/cybercenturion-encouraging-diversity|title=CyberCenturion: encouraging diversity - Cyber Security Challenge UK|work=Cyber Security Challenge UK|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger age category is for 12-14 year olds and the older category is for 15-18 year olds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within the age categories, the tracks split teams into four more groups, with a boys only track, a girls only track, a mixed team track and a cadet track.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Places for the final are awarded in the following number of ways:

* ''"12-14 category: one place for the top team of each category (girls, boys, mixed and cadets) and the highest scoring team from all tracks combined"'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* ''"15-18 category: one place for the top team of each category (girls, boys, mixed and cadets) and the highest six scoring teams from all tracks combined"'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rounds ===
There are four main rounds&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=CyberCentuion V - 2018/19 Calendar |url=https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/app/uploads/2018/08/Centurion-calendar-2018-19.pdf |website=Cyber Security Challenge UK |accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rounds 1, 2 and 3 being online qualifying rounds where "teams will be provided with a mixture of Windows and Linux virtual machines with the aim to find and fix the vulnerabilities along with answering forensics questions".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alphacharlie.org.uk/cybercenturion/|title=CyberCenturion - Alpha Charlie|work=Alpha Charlie|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Round 4 is the National Finals round, where qualifying teams compete face to face in London to win the top prize.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Prior to the four main rounds, there are four other 'introductory' rounds where teams play but do not score any points.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These are as follows:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Exhibition Round 1
* Exhibition Round 2
* Training Round
* Practice Technical Round

=== General rules ===
''"The competition is played by teams of between four and six people. Each team must include a responsible adult as the liaison between the organisers and the participants, and every team participant must be 18 years old or under when the game is played. The competition is open to anyone in Europe that meets the age requirements and has the correct team format (including leader).'' ''Each team must play a series of online qualifying rounds, which will challenge them to learn about networking, coding and cyber security. If the team scores higher than most of the other players and makes it to the leaderboard, then they will be invited to play in the National Final, a face-to-face competition which finds the ultimate champion for the year''."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*The Qualification Competition starts as soon as the virtual image is booted and ends 6 hours later. The score is logged regularly and a live scoreboard is released during the competition to competitors. Breaching the time limit will result in penalties.
* Only a single instance of the image may be opened at one time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9398">'''Delphic Games of the modern era''' involve [[presentation]]s, [[exhibition]]s, [[competition]]s and other activities in six different fields of [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delphic-games.com/downloads/flyeruk.pdf The Delphic Games of the modern era]&lt;/ref&gt; They are inspired by the [[Delphic Games]] of [[ancient Greece]].

==Historical reference==

One of the four [[Panhellenic Games]] were the [[Pythian Games]] in [[Delphi]]. Held every four years, they included competitions in athletics, theatre, music, poetry, and painting to praise the god [[Apollo]], the symbol of the [[Oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485272/Pythian-Games Pythian Games], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 394 A.D., [[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]] banned all Panhellenic Games as being pagan events.

Since 1912 till 1948, on the initiative of [[Pierre de Coubertin]], [[art competitions at the Summer Olympics]] were held in various countries. Medals were awarded for works related solely to [[sport]].&lt;ref&gt;''Richard Stanton.'' The forgotten Olympic art competitions — The story of the Olympic art competitions of the 20th century. Trafford Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|1-55212-606-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an attempt to revive Pythian Games at the archeological site of Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet [[Angelos Sikelianos]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamina-online.com/aggelos_sikelianos.htm Aggelos Sikelianos]&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Eva Palmer. In 1927, the first Delphic Festival was held in Greece, but the revival was then abandoned.

Nowadays there are so-called Delphi Festivals, which are the closest to their Panhellenic counterparts. They include religious rituals and activities like poetry competition, religious offerings, sports and of course feasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greeka.com/sterea/delphi/delphi-festivals.htm Information about the Festivals of Delphi Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:DF-1927 copy.jpg|150px|thumb|Poster of the Delphic Festival, 1927]]

In the second half of the 20th century, there was another attempt to restore Delphic Games. Since the 1990s, representatives from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, [[Germany]], Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States came together and organized First International Delphic Games, which took place in 2000 in Moscow, Russia (before that the concept was tested out in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], where First Junior Delphic Games took place.)

==Current revivials==
Currently, there are two organizations conducting Delphic Games.

The '''[[International Delphic Council]]''' (IDC) with headquarters in Berlin was founded in 1994 at the [[Schönhausen Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.392280880813927.79902.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the IDC| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995 the IDC actively supports the creation of the National Delphic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.386038754771473.78926.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the NDC Nigeria| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.384951174880231.78728.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the "Delphic Movement in Russia"| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997 the IDC has organized the International Youth Delphic Games in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Germany, Philippines, South Africa, as well as, since 2000, the International Delphic Games for adult participants in Russia, Malaysia, South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;''Lee Kyung-min''.[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/4908/top-artists-gather-3rd-jeju-delphic-games  Top Artists to Gather at 3rd Jeju Delphic Games] September 7th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |date= |url=http://delphic.org/english/03games/chronology.htm |title=Delphic Games |publisher=// delphic.org |accessdate=2014-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102191231/http://delphic.org/english/03games/chronology.htm |archivedate=2014-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDC held Delphic Games and Junior Delphic Games in the four-year cycle, two years offset from one another, such as the Olympic Games, held at different locations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=http://www.kulturserver.de/-/organisationen/detail/52021| title=International Delphic Council| publisher=// kulturserver.de| accessdate=2014-07-03|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=http://www.virtualmarket.itb-berlin.de/?Action=showCompany&amp;id=57634| title=International Delphic Council: ITB Berlin Virtual Market Place| publisher=// virtualmarket.itb-berlin.de| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Delphic  Games and Congresses receive greetings, patronage and support from various international organizations and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=392267214148627&amp;set=a.392265017482180.79897.369642239744458&amp;type=1&amp;theater| title=The letter with the greeting message from the Council of Europe| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.387774587931223.79201.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=2nd Delphic World Congress| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer organization, '''[[International Delphic Committee]]''' (IDC) with headquarters in Moscow, was registered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idcworld.ru/news.list?year=2006&amp;lang=en Opening of the website of the International Delphic Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes International Delphic Games, Youth Delphic Games of Russia and Youth Delphic Games of [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].

These Junior Delphic Games are dedicated to significant domestic events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=355094 The Ninth Junior Delphic Games Russia dedicated to the anniversary of the victory] // Вести.ру - 23 апреля 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://youth.minstm.gov.ru/102/104.shtml/xPages/entry.2963.html Welcoming words of the Minister V.L.

The ''FATF blacklist''  was the common shorthand description for the [[Financial Action Task Force]] list of "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" (NCCTs). &lt;ref name=Introduction-May1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/ | title=About FATF| accessdate=1 May 2018| publisher=FATF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''FATF blacklist''' or OECD blacklist has been issued by the [[Financial Action Task Force]] since 2000 and lists countries  which it judges to be non-cooperative in the global fight against [[money laundering]] and [[Terrorism financing|terrorist financing]], calling them "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" (NCCTs).&lt;ref name = fatfworks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/whatwedo/ | title= FATF Works| accessdate=1 May 2018| publisher=FATF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although non-appearance on the blacklist was perceived to be a mark of approbation for [[offshore financial centre]]s (or "tax havens") who are sufficiently well regulated to meet all of the FATF's criteria, in practice the list included countries that did not operate as offshore financial centres.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The FATF updates the blacklist regularly, adding or deleting entries. &lt;ref name = fatfworks/&gt;

==History==
FATF was established by the G-7 Summit that was held in Paris in 1989. Founding stakeholders include the G-7 Heads of State or Government, President of the European Commission and eight other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/historyofthefatf/| title=History of FATF|accessdate= 1 May 2018| publisher=FATF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "non-cooperative" was criticized by some analysts as misleading, as a number of countries on the list simply lacked the infrastructure or resources to cope with relatively sophisticated financial criminals who tried to operate there. Since 2008 the FATF has, at the behest of [[G20]] leaders, installed a more analytical process of identifying jurisdictions deficient in their anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regimes. &lt;ref name = fatfworks/&gt;
==Primary Works==
One of the main objectives of the FATF is to establish norms and standards of “legal, regulatory and operational measures” to fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the security and integrity of the international financial system. However, FATF “has no investigative authority.” FATF works with nation-states to bring legislative changes and regulatory reforms in aforementioned sectors.&lt;ref name = fatfworks/&gt;  In addition, FAFT also provides policy recommendations that meet international standards to countries for combating “money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. FATF has been providing policy recommendations since 1990 and their recommendations have revised four times since then. FATF also monitors the situations of its members in establishing adequate measures and institutions to fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. FATF also makes sure that it is aware of national-level vulnerabilities of its member states “with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/internationalstandardsoncombatingmoneylaunderingandthefinancingofterrorismproliferation-thefatfrecommendations.html| title= Policy Recommendations|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member States==
According to its official website, there are 37 member of FATF, representing most financial centres around the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Members|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/membersandobservers/|publisher=FATF|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation of the Cayman Islands as non-cooperative was thought to be harsh,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Hetherington-Gore (n.d.), [http://www.lowtax.net/lowtax/html/jcaspec.html The Cayman Islands – Paradise Regained?] lowtaxnet.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} particularly as the 2000 report itself acknowledged that "the Cayman Islands has been a leader in developing anti-money laundering programmes throughout the Caribbean region. It has served as president of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, and it has provided substantial assistance to neighbouring states in the region. It has demonstrated cooperation on criminal law enforcement matters, and uncovered several serious cases of fraud and money laundering otherwise unknown to authorities in FATF member states."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Regarding with North Korea, the FATF released the following concern: 

“The FATF remains concerned by the DPRK’s failure to address the significant deficiencies in its anti‑money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the serious threat this poses to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF urges the DPRK to immediately and meaningfully address its AML/CFT deficiencies. Further, FATF has serious concerns with the threat posed by DPRK’s illicit activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and its financing.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TATF Public Statement 2017|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-riskandnon-cooperativejurisdictions/documents/public-statement-february-2017.html|publisher=FATF|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OECD "gray list"==

Although its main focus is on tax crime, the OECD is also concerned with money laundering and has complemented the work carried out by the FATF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908203717/http://www.oecd.org/document/39/0,3343,en_2649_33767_2499879_1_1_1_37427,00.html Tax and crime - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] &lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD has maintained a 'blacklist' of countries it considers "uncooperative tax havens" in the drive for transparency of tax affairs and the effective exchange of information, officially called "The List of Uncooperative Tax Havens". Since May 2009, no countries were officially listed as uncooperative tax havens in the light of their commitments to implement the OECD standards.&lt;ref name=oecd2009&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/countries/monaco/listofunco-operativetaxhavens.htm List of Unco-operative Tax Havens] Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] n.d., retrieved 7 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 2008, at an OECD meeting in Paris, 17 countries led by France and Germany decided to draw up a new blacklist of tax havens. It had been asked to investigate around 40 new tax havens where undeclared revenue was hidden and which hosted many of the non-regulated hedge funds that came under fire during the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. Germany, France, and other countries called on the OECD to add Switzerland to a blacklist of countries which encourage tax fraud.&lt;ref name=glfo&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2008/10/21/calls-from-17-countries-for-new-tax-haven-blacklist/ Calls from 17 countries for new tax haven blacklist] euronews, world news, 21 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April 2009, the OECD published a list of countries, divided into three parts depending on whether they implemented an "internationally agreed tax standard", in select jurisdictions – [[tax haven]]s or other financial centers of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/42497950.pdf |title=A Progress Report on The Jurisdictions Surveyed by The OECD Global Forum in Implementing The Internationally Agreed Tax Standard |publisher=OECD|format=PDF |date=2 April 2009|page=10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fairgames.jpg|thumb|A boy at the fish pond, the Rockton World's Fair, harvest festival, Canada, 2010]]
A '''fair''' (archaic: '''faire''' or '''fayre'''), also known as a '''funfair''', is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks.

==Types==
[[File:Goose Fair Roundabout.jpg|thumb|right|Roundabouts (also known as a carousel or merry-go-round) are traditional attractions, often seen at fairs]]
Variations of fairs include:
* [[Street fair]], a fair that celebrates the character of a neighborhood and merchant oriented, (as the word 'fair' is historically defined; that being a marketplace). As its name suggests, it is usually held on the main street of a neighborhood.
* [[Fête]], an elaborate festival, party, or celebration.
* [[Festival]], an event ordinarily coordinated and/or celebrated by a community or group with a theme e.g. music, art, season and/or on some characteristic(s) or aspect(s) of a community, or the region i.e beach, snow, local harvest, etc. or state the community is in. This can include a tradition, history, an prevalent ethnicity, religion, or a national holiday, e.g. The Fourth of July. 
* [[County fair]] or [[agricultural show]], a public event exhibiting the equipment, animals, sports and recreation associated with agriculture and animal husbandry.
* [[State fair]], an annual competitive and recreational gathering of a U.S. state's population, usually held in late summer or early fall. It is a larger version of a county fair, often including only exhibits or competitors that have won in their categories at the more local county fairs.
* [[Trade fair]], an exhibition organized so that companies in a specific industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products and services, study activities of rivals, and examine recent market trends and opportunities.
* [[Traveling carnival]], usually simply called a carnival, an amusement show made up of amusement rides, food vendors, merchandise vendors, games of chance and skill, thrill acts, and animal acts.
* [[Traveling funfair]], a small to medium-sized traveling show primarily composed of stalls and other amusements.

==History==
[[File:1590 Mostaert Dorfkirmes anagoria.JPG|thumb|''Village fair'' by Flemish artist [[Gillis Mostaert]] 1590]]
[[File:Delaware State Fair 2009.jpg|thumb|Fairs can include exhibitions of animals, and before competitions, the animals will be groomed by their owners]]

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fairs were [[holiday]]s on which there was an intermission of labour and pleadings.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} In the Roman provinces of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] and [[Syria Palaestina]], Jewish rabbis prohibited Jews from participating in fairs in certain towns because the religious nature of the fairs contravened the prescribed practice of Judaism.&lt;ref name="Schäfer2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schäfer |first=Peter |title=The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_J5bdHyPprIC&amp;pg=PA448 |accessdate=8 June 2015 |year=2002 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |isbn=9783161478529 |pages=448–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], many fairs developed as temporary markets and were especially important for long-distance and international trade, as wholesale traders travelled, sometimes for many days, to fairs where they could be sure to meet those they needed to buy from or sell to. Fairs were usually tied to a special [[Christian]] religious occasions, such as the Saint's day of the local church. Stagshaw in England, is documented to have held annual fairs as early as 1293 consisting of the sales of animals. Along with the main fair held on 4 July, the city also hosted smaller fairs throughout the year where specific types of animals were sold, such as one for horses, one for lambs, and one for ewes.&lt;ref name="NorderhaugThompson2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norderhaug |first1=Jennifer |last2=Thompson |first2=Jennifer Norderhaug &amp; Barbara |title=Walking the Northumbria Dales: Un |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr8AZrod3O4C&amp;pg=PA63 |accessdate=8 June 2015 |date=2006-08-01 |publisher=Sigma Press |isbn=9781850588382 |pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kumbh Mela]], held every twelve years, at [[Allahabad]], [[Haridwar]], [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]] is one of the largest fairs in India, where more than 60 million people gathered in January 2001, making it the [[List of largest gatherings in history|largest gathering]] anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6226895.stm Millions bathe at Hindu festival] ''[[BBC News]]'', January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1137833.stm Kumbh Mela pictured from space - probably the largest human gathering in history] ''[[BBC News]]'', January 26, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/travel_images/article3597725.ece Kumbh Mela: the largest pilgrimage - Pictures: Kumbh Mela by Karoki Lewis] ''[[The Times]]'', March 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kumbha]]'' means a pitcher and ''Mela'' means ''fair'' in Sanskrit.

In the United States, fairs draw in as many as 150 million people each summer.&lt;ref name=VonDrehle&gt;{{cite journal |last=Von Drehle |first=David |others=Photographs by Greg Miller |date=2007-07-23 |title=A new Day at the Fair |journal=Time |volume=170 |issue=4 |pages=50 |issn=0040-781X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's competitions at an American fair range from breeding small animals to robotics, whilst the organization [[4-H]] has become a traditional association.&lt;ref name=VonDrehle/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Legal implications===
{{See also|Court of Piepowders}}
Because of the great numbers of people attracted by fairs they were often the scenes of riots and disturbances, so the privilege of holding a fair was granted by [[royal charter]]. At first, they were allowed only in towns and places of strength, or where there was a bishop, sheriff or governor who could keep order. In time various benefits became attached to certain fairs, such as granting people the protection of a holiday and allowing them freedom from arrest in certain circumstances. The officials were authorized to mete out justice to those who came to their fair; eventually even the smallest fair would have had a court to adjudicate on offences and disputes arising within the fairground, called a ''pye powder'' court (from [[Old French]] ''pieds pouldres'', literally "dusty feet", meaning an itinerant trader, from [[Medieval Latin]] ''pedes pulverosi'').

===In art and language===
The chaotic nature of the Stagshaw Bank Fair with masses of people and animals and stalls inspired the Newcastle colloquialism "like a Stagey Bank Fair" to describe a general mess.&lt;ref name="NorderhaugThompson2006"/&gt;

The American [[county fair]] is featured in [[E. B. White]]'s ''[[Charlotte's Web]]''.&lt;ref name=VonDrehle/&gt;

Flying glass resulting from an explosion poses a significant risk in the event; up to 85% of injuries from an explosion are due to flying glass.&lt;ref name="Mazzolani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazzolani|first1=Federico M.|title=Urban Habitat Constructions Under Catastrophic Events: Proceedings of the COST C26 Action Final Conference|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203833636|pages=133-139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9XKBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Flying+glass%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw3qayvsHWAhVHslQKHTkbD_c4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Flying%20glass%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Garrick Theatre''', also known as ''Garrick's Subscription'' was a small theatre located in Leman St, [[Whitechapel]]. The theatre opened in 1831, and closed in about 1881. The theatre was named for the actor, [[David Garrick]], who had made his début at the nearby [[Goodman's Fields Theatre]] on 9 October 1741, playing the role of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.

The performance on 11 May 1840 was ''Marie!'' and ''Virginius the Rum’un!'', from an existent playbill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.ex.ac.uk/special/guides/archives/141-150/149_01.html Collection of University of Exeter] accessed 4 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The plays were  probably [[melodramas]] and some indication of the fare available at the time.

The first theatre burned down in 1846, and was rebuilt to open as ''The Albert and Garrick Royal Amphitheatre''. During rebuilding from 1852-1854, the neighbour, a gun manufacturer, obtained an injunction against the proprietor, Lawrence Levy, to restrict the height of the adjacent wall so as not to impede light to his premises.&lt;ref&gt;The Times 30 July 1852 page 6 and 24 March 1854 page 11&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was managed by Lawrence Levy from 1854 until 1864. He returned to manage the theatre between 1867 and 1868. In 1856 E.B. Gaston was Stage Manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/icons/playbills/londonindex2.htm University of Kent - Playbill collection] accessed 4 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The second theatre had a capacity of 462, although when Lawrence Levy put the theatre up for sale in 1866-1868, he claimed it "will hold 1,600 persons" and "can be made to hold 2,500", and then in 1868 was claiming "Was built for a circus" and "Holds 1,700 persons; can be made for 8,000".&lt;ref&gt;Advertisements in The Era, e.g. 1 July 1866, 6 January 1867, 2 February 1868&lt;/ref&gt;

A young [[Barney Barnato]] is reputed to have begged pass outs from theatre leavers, to sell them on to others for a halfpenny&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=colvin&amp;book=rhodes&amp;story=barnato&amp;PHPSESSID=8675b0a125391c6bd735a4fa57971f8d Rhodes and Barnato - in ''Cecil Rhodes'' by Ian D. Colvin] accessed 4 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After actor-manager J. B. Howe's [[bankruptcy]] in 1875, the theatre remained empty until 1879. Actress-manageress May Bulmer then ran the theatre until it was demolished, having a personal success in the light opera ''A Cruise to China''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Victorian Web - Theatres in Victorian London] accessed 5 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lawrence Levy had died in 1873, the theatre was still part of his estate in 1882 when his trustee testified at the Old Bailey in the trial of two men called Culver and Jacobs. They had been claiming to hold the lease of the theatre, and had fraudulently been taking payments from actors on the promise of providing them with engagements.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Old Bailey 26-6-1882.&lt;/ref&gt;  The site of the theatre is today occupied by the old Leman Street Police Station, built in 1891.

'''High Sierra Music Festival''' is a multi-day [[music festival]] held in [[Quincy, California]], United States, a mountainous area about 80 miles northwest of [[Reno, Nevada]].

The festival is held each year the weekend of July 4.  The four-day festival features an eclectic mix of some of the most famous national and international names in [[jamband]], [[newgrass]] and [[funk]]. Other represented genres include [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[roots rock]], [[electronica]], [[reggae]], [[jazz]] and [[afrobeat]]. Away from the music stages, patrons can attend films and movement playshops - yoga, pilates, etc., shop for arts and crafts, or enjoy a wide variety of gourmet food and drink. It's a family friendly and community oriented event with an expanding Family Area full of activities and certified nannies available throughout the weekend.

The first High Sierra Music Festival was in 1991, and was the genesis of High Sierra Music, of Berkeley, California.  The organization has also produced festivals and concerts elsewhere in California, and in Maryland, Nevada, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Missouri.

The '''Konpira Grand Theatre''' (金毘羅大芝居 ''Konpira Ōshibai''), also known as the '''Kanamaru-za''' (金丸座) is a restored [[Kabuki]] theatre in [[Kotohira, Kagawa|Kotohira]], [[Kagawa Prefecture|Kagawa]], on the island of [[Shikoku]], [[Japan]]. It was originally constructed in 1835,&lt;ref name=bunka&gt;[http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shurui/juubun_ken_shoukai/036.html Agency for Cultural Affairs]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tsuboi&gt;[http://www.jsme.or.jp/tsd/ICBTT/conference02/UzuhikoTSUBOI.html Historical Development of Revolving Stages of Theaters Invented in Japan - Improvement by Adoption of European Culture] by Uzuhiko TSUBOI for the 1st International Conference on Business and Technology transfer (ICBTT200)&lt;/ref&gt; and is the oldest kabuki theatre in Japan.&lt;ref name=jiten&gt;"Kanamaruza."

[http://kabuki21.com/kanamaruza.php Kabuki21.com]. Accessed 5 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre was originally built in 1835 and 1836,&lt;ref name=Leiter60/&gt; and takes its name from the nearby [[Kompira Shrine]] which is in turn named after the Hindu/Buddhist deity [[Kumbhira]] to which the shrine is dedicated.&lt;ref name=Leiter57&gt;Leiter. p57.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its construction, small temporary theatres were frequently built on the site, and doubled as lottery halls.&lt;ref name=Leiter58&gt;Leiter. p58.&lt;/ref&gt; The design was based on that of the [[Ōnishi Theatre]] of [[Osaka]], and the construction costs, amounting to roughly 1000 ''[[ryō]]'', were raised by the local [[geisha]] community.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. p61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was originally controlled by the [[Kanemitsu-in]], a local Buddhist temple, but in 1877 came to be owned by a man by the name of Kyōhō, an ''[[otokodate]]'', wealthy merchant, gang leader, and head of the local fire brigade. He changed the name of the theatre to the Inari-za (named after the Shintō deity [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]]), and ran full-day programs as many other major theatres throughout the country began to cut down and only show selected scenes for a few hours a day. The theatre was purchased in 1897 by a man by the name of Kawazoe Sadaji, who changed its name to Chitose-za (One Thousand Years Theatre), and sold it three years later. Kanamaru Genjirō thus obtained the theater in 1900, for 4500 [[yen]], and renamed it once again, to the Kanamaru-za, a name which continues to be used today.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. pp62-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

After falling into disuse for many years, and being used as a movie theater for some time, the theatre was designated an [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]] by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] of the national government&lt;ref name=bunka /&gt; in 1970,&lt;ref name=jiten/&gt; after having been designated as such by the prefecture in 1953.&lt;ref name=Leiter60/&gt; Following a fund-raising drive which raised over US$2 million,&lt;ref name=Leiter60/&gt; the theatre was restored in 1976 to its [[Edo period]] appearance&lt;ref name=jiten/&gt; and moved some 200 meters to a new location.

In late June 1985, a troupe led by [[Nakamura Kichiemon II]] and [[Sawamura Sōjūrō IX]] performed the play ''[[Saikai Zakura Misome no Kiyomizu]]'' ("Reunion Amongst the Cherry Blossoms After the First Meeting at Kiyomizu") and dance drama ''[[Niwakajishi]]'' ("Spirited Lion"), at the Kanamaru-za, in a three-day stint following performances at the [[Naka-za]] in Osaka.&lt;ref name=Leiter8889&gt;Leiter. pp88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Kichiemon was impressed with the theatre's atmosphere and traditional design and amenities, and encouraged other actors to journey to Kotohira. A month-long program has been produced every spring since, featuring major Tokyo/Osaka actors.&lt;ref name=kabuki21/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leiter8889/&gt;

Much of the 1995 film ''[[Sharaku (film)|Sharaku]]'', set in 1790s [[Edo]] and revolving around the life of ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' artist [[Sharaku]], was filmed at the Konpira Theatre, which stood in for the no longer extant [[Nakamura-za]].&lt;ref name=Leiter56&gt;Leiter. p56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Former Konpira-ooshibai01n3999.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Konpira Grand theatre]]
The structure's frontage is about 80 feet long, or 13 ''ken'' and 2 ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' in the now no longer used [[Japanese units of measurement|traditional Japanese units of measurement]]. During the month when kabuki actors journey down from Tokyo or [[Kamigata]] (the Kyoto-Osaka area) and perform at the theatre, large banners bearing the crest of the [[Shōchiku]] company, and signboards with the stars' names are displayed. Fake bushels of rice, representing gifts from fans and sponsors, are also situated outside the theatre.

There are three entrances into the building. The ones on the left and right are of normal size, but the central entrance, called the {{nihongo|"mouse door"|ねずみ木戸|nezumi kido}}, is quite small and requires one to crouch in order to enter. This was an effective form of crowd control in the Edo period, and, along with armed guards, helped prevent anyone from entering without a ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. p64.&lt;/ref&gt; While the average commoner playgoer had to use this small ''nezumi kido'', those associated with the Kanemitsu-in used the ''goyō kido'' on the right. The large ''ōkido'' on the left was used by members of the samurai class, and others of importance.&lt;ref name=Leiter65&gt;Leiter. p65.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary features distinguishing the renovated Konpira Grand Theatre other kabuki theatres in Japan today, which are more modern in style, is the ''[[tatami]]'' floor in the main (orchestra section) seating section. Areas of seating for small parties are divided from one another by a grid of wooden planking, into box seats called ''[[masu (Japanese)|masu]]''; sitting this way allows greater range of motion for the viewer, and thus allows one to more easily turn to watch action on the ''[[hanamichi]]'', the long stage extension which runs from the stage to the back of the theater.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. p67,69.&lt;/ref&gt; A raised ''tatami'' platform called the ''sajiki'' runs along the left side of the theatre on both the ground and second floors; these were traditionally the most expensive seats, and still are today.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. pp67-8.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar section which runs along the right side of the theatre is called the ''demago'', though traditionally this would have been called the ''takadoma'' in Edo.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. pp72,77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinguishing feature is the ''karaido'', or "empty well", a space between the ''hanamichi'' and stage accessible from underneath by stairs; while most other theatres utilize an elevator trap called a ''suppon'' ("snapping turtle") to allow actors to enter directly onto the ''hanamichi'', the stairs allow an actor to better time his entrance, for better dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. p71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Konpira Grand Theatre has a ''suppon'' as well, but scholar [[Samuel Leiter]] writes that he is unaware of another active theatre which uses a ''karaido''.&lt;ref name=Leiter72/&gt; A second ''hanamichi'', called the ''kari hanamichi'' and about half the width of the main ''hanamichi'', runs through the theatre towards the right side; a connecting plank is sometimes used to allow actors to cross between the two ''hanamichi'' at some distance from the stage.&lt;ref name=Leiter77&gt;Leiter. p77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the left and right walls of the seating area are composed of ''[[shōji]]'' panels, which can be slid like sliding doors to provide access to corridors which run outside the seating area. The outermost side walls of the theatre building, forming the opposite side of these corridors, consist of rain shutters known as ''madobuta'' ("window lids") or ''akarimado'' ("lighting windows") which can be raised and lowered by stagehands to let the sunlight in and control the lighting of the theatre, in order to create atmospheric effects, such as a dark and spooky atmosphere for certain elements of ghost plays.&lt;ref name=Leiter77/&gt;

There are areas for musicians on both stage left and right, along with a second-story room above stage left, called the ''yuka'', used specifically by ''tayū'' (narrative chanters) and [[shamisen]] players heard in plays deriving from the ''[[jōruri (music)|jōruri]]'' puppet theatre. This is in contrast to the theatres of Tokyo and Kamigata, which traditionally have boxes for the musicians on only one side of the stage (stage right and left respectively).&lt;ref name=Leiter79&gt;Leiter. p79.&lt;/ref&gt; The stage itself is about half the width of that in the modern theatres; while the stage opening at [[Kabuki-za]] in Tokyo is nearly ninety feet wide, the space between the supporting pillars at the Kanamaru-za is eight ''ken'', or roughly 48 feet; Leiter calls the larger scale of the more modern theatres a loss and an artistic weakening, as theatres moved "away from the most effective means for expressing theatrical art."&lt;ref name=Leiter79/&gt;

The Kanamaru-za also boasts a manually operated rotating stage (''mawari butai'') and trap doors (''seri''),&lt;ref name=town&gt;[http://www.town.kotohira.kagawa.jp/english/kabuki/history/index.html www.town.kotohira.kagawa.jp] accessed 27 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; though the "hell" (''naraku'') area underneath the stage from which these were operated was considered by many actors so unpleasant that it would often be avoided in favor of the corridors outside the ''sajiki'' (along the sides of the theatre) as a means for traveling around the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter. p81.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Luna 2''''' (E-1A series) or '''Lunik 2''' was the second of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union's]] [[Luna programme]] spacecraft launched to the [[Moon]]. It was the first spacecraft [[Moon landing|to reach the surface of the Moon]], and the first man-made object to land on another celestial body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/space-missions/missions-to-the-moon.html|title=Missions to the Moon |publisher=''planetary.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 1959, it hit the Moon's surface east of [[Mare Imbrium]] near the craters Aristides, [[Archimedes (crater)|Archimedes]], and [[Autolycus (crater)|Autolycus]].&lt;ref name="nasa1"&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1959-014A | title = ''Luna 2'' | publisher = NASA - NSSDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission profile==

Launch was scheduled for September 9, but the Blok I core stage was shut down after it failed to reach full thrust at ignition. The booster was removed from the pad and replaced by a different vehicle, delaying the flight by three days. ''Luna 2'', like ''[[Luna 1]]'', took a [[direct ascent|direct path]] to the Moon, with a velocity high enough to result in a travel time of around 36 hours. ''Luna 2'' hit the Moon about {{convert|800|km|mi|sp=us}} from the centre of the visible disk on 1959 September 13 at 21:02:24 [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]].&lt;ref name="zarya.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/Luna/Luna02.php |title=USSR ''Luna 2'' |publisher=''zarya.info''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moon map Luna 17 Luna 2 Apollo 15 Surveyor 6 Surveyor 4 Luna 7 Luna 8 Luna 11.png|thumbnail|right |''Luna 2'' site is near the right of the image, close to the [[Apollo 15]] landing site]]

''Luna 2'' was similar in design to ''[[Luna 1]]'', a spherical spacecraft with protruding antennas and [[instrumentation]]. The instrumentation was also similar to Luna 1, including [[scintillation counters]], [[geiger counter]]s, a [[magnetometer]], [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detectors, and [[micrometeorite]] detectors. There were no propulsion systems on ''Luna 2'' itself.&lt;ref name="zarya.info"/&gt;

Once ''Luna 2'' was split from its upper stage it started transmitting information back to Earth using three different transmitters. These transmitters provided precise information on its course, allowing scientists to calculate that ''Luna 2'' would hit its mark on the Moon around 00:05 on September 14 ([[Moscow Time]]).&lt;ref name="Harvey, B. 2007"&gt;Harvey, B. (2007). Soviet and Russian lunar exploration. Berlin: Springer. Pg.- 31-33&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to be able to provide a visual from Earth on September 13, the spacecraft released a vapor cloud that would expand to {{convert|650|km|mi|sp=us|adj=on}} diameter that would be seen by observatories in [[Alma Ata]], [[Byurakan]], [[Abastumani]], [[Tbilisi]], and [[Stalinabad]].&lt;ref name="Harvey, B. 2007"/&gt; This vapor cloud also acted as an experiment to see how the sodium gas would act in a vacuum and zero gravity.&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"&gt;Luna 2- NASA.Gov. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1959-014A&lt;/ref&gt;

The last stage of the rocket that carried ''Luna 2'' did not carry any type of tracking device so there was uncertainty as to where it landed, but it did hit the [[Moon]] surface about 30 minutes after ''Luna 2'' hit.&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"/&gt;

==Impact==
For a time, [[United States|Americans]] were starting to believe that they were making progress in the space race and that although the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] might have had larger rockets, the [[United States]] had better guidance systems. This myth was busted after the Soviets were able to crash ''Luna 2'' onto the Moon.&lt;ref name="Cox, D. W. 1962 pg. 47, 118"&gt;Cox, D. W. (1962). The space race; from Sputnik to Apollo, and beyond. Philadelphia: Chilton Books. pg. 47, 118&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the closest Americans had come to the Moon was about {{convert|37000|mi|km}} with [[Pioneer 4]].&lt;ref&gt;The Soviet Union is first to the Moon. (2009). History Today, 59(9), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Khrushchev, on his only visit to the U.S., gave president Eisenhower a replica of the Soviet pennants that ''Luna 2'' had just placed onto the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Daniloff|Daniloff, N.]] (1972). The Kremlin and the cosmos. New York: Knopf. Pg.- 105&lt;/ref&gt;
''Luna 2'' and its predecessors all came to be used throughout the USSR and around the world as pro-communist propaganda. Donald W. Cox explains, in his book ''The Space Race'', “Although the [[Sputnik 1|Sputniks]] and [[Luna programme|Luniks]] did not themselves provide better cars, refrigerators, color TV sets, and homes for the peasants and laborers of the Soviet Union and her satellite states, they did evoke added inspiration for the earthbound followers of the [[Communism|communist]] way of life helping to take their minds off shortages of consumer goods. The people were spurred on to work just a little harder for the glorious motherland and to outstrip the west in the less dramatic and more basic things of life, like coal and steel production.”&lt;ref name="Cox, D. W. 1962 pg. 47, 118"/&gt;
Although ''Luna 2'' was a success for the Soviets, it also helped the U.S. by starting a trend of crash landing. It would eventually lead to the U.S.-made [[Ranger program|Rangers]] which would go on to also crash land on the Moon in exactly the same way. Crash landing proved useful even after soft landing was mastered. [[NASA]] used crash landings to test whether Moon craters contained ice by crashing space probes into craters and testing the debris that got thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, T. (n.d.). Crash Landing on the Moon - NASA Science. Retrieved April 20, 2016, from https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/28jul_crashlanding/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
''Luna 2'' carried 5 different instruments to conduct various tests while it was on its way to [[the Moon]]. The scintillation counters would be used to measure any ionizing radiation; the [[Cherenkov radiation]] detectors would be measuring for electromagnetic radiation caused by charged particles. “The Geiger Counter carried on ''Luna 2'' had the primary scientific objective of determining the electron spectrum of the outer radiation belt. The instrument consisted of three STS-5 gas-discharge counters mounted on the outside of the hermetically sealed container, and would be powered by a 360 V battery”.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger Counter- NASA.Gov. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1959-014A-02&lt;/ref&gt; The last instrument on Luna 2 was, “a three component fluxgate magnetometer similar to that used on Luna 1 but with the dynamic range reduced by a factor of 4 to -750 to +750 gammas so that the quantization uncertainty was -12 to +12 gammas.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometer- NASA.Gov. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1959-014A-01&lt;/ref&gt; Together the devices were searching for lunar magnetic and radiation fields similar to the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] around Earth, sending information about once every minute&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; until its last transmission which came about 55&amp;nbsp;km away from the lunar surface.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Harvey, B. (2007). Soviet and Russian lunar exploration. Berlin: Springer. Pg.- 31-33,&lt;/ref&gt; Although it did prove previous measurements of the Van Allen radiation belts that were taken from Luna 1 around the Earth, it was not able to detect any type of radiation belts around the Moon. Because of claims that information received from Luna 1 was fake, as soon as the scientists of ''Luna 2'' started receiving transmissions they sent out the intended time of impact, and the transmission and trajectory details.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Even though Soviet scientists gave all this information, the Americans were still skeptical until [[Bernard Lovell]] was able to prove that the radio signal was coming from ''Luna 2'' by showing the Doppler shift from its transmissions. After this no one seemed to question the veracity of the Soviets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Van Allen radiation belt==
''Luna 2'' showed time variations in the [[electric flux|electron flux]] and [[energy spectrum]] in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]].

==USSR pennants==

&lt;!--info from Russian sources starts--&gt;
The spacecraft also carried Soviet [[Pennant (commissioning)|pennant]]s. Two of them, located in the spacecraft, were sphere-shaped, with the surface covered by identical [[pentagon]]al elements. In the center was an explosive charge designed to shatter the sphere, sending the pentagonal shields in all directions.  This was a low-tech method that would blow back a few elements in the direction opposite of its velocity vector to greatly reduce the energy upon reaching the surface (in the way that [[lander (spacecraft)|landers]] are designed to reduce velocity) which would improve the chance that some part of the sphere might survive the impact.  Each pentagonal element was made of [[stainless steel]] and had the [[USSR Coat of Arms]] and the [[Cyrillic]] letters ''СССР'' ("USSR") engraved on one side, and the words ''СССР январь 1959'' ("USSR January 1959") on the other side. They most likely vaporized on impact, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentallandscape.com/V_Pennants.htm|title=Soviet Spacecraft Pennants|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third pennant was located in the last stage of the ''Luna 2'' rocket, which collided with the Moon's surface 30 minutes after the spacecraft did. It was a capsule filled with liquid, with [[aluminium]] strips placed into it. On each of these strips the USSR Coat of Arms, the words ''1959 январь'' ("1959 January"), and the words ''СОЮЗ СОВЕТСКИХ СОЦИАЛИСТИЧЕСКИХ РЕСПУБЛИК'' (English: "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics") were engraved.

On September 15, 1959, the premier of the Soviet Union, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], presented the American president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] with a copy of the spherical pennant as a gift. That sphere is kept at the [[Eisenhower Presidential Center|Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum]] in [[Abilene, Kansas]]. The only other known copy of the spherical pennant is located at the [[Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center|Kansas Cosmosphere]] in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]].

'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 1977''' was the selection for the 17th song to represent [[Sweden]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Sweden did not participate in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976]] due to demonstrations against commercial music. It was the 16th time that this system of picking a song had been used. 965 songs were submitted to [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] for the competition. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1|TV1]] but was not broadcast on radio.

The '''Moderate Party''' ({{lang-it|Partito Moderato}}), collectively called '''Moderates''' ({{lang-it|Moderati}}), was an Italian pre-Unification political rally, active during the [[Risorgimento]] (1815–1861). The Moderates were never a formal party, but only a movement of liberal-minded reformist patriots, usually secular, from politics, military, literature and philosophy.

==History==
Since the [[Congress of Vienna]], inside the [[Italian Peninsula]] was diffused a [[reformist]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] moment, inspired from [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobonism]] and [[Bonapartism]] and explosed in the [[revolutions of 1820]] against the [[reactionary]] [[Congress System]]. Many patriots, soldiers and intellectuals who took part to the revolutions were definited "moderates".{{clarify|date=February 2018}} 

The Moderates, with time, demarcated themselves from radical and republican organizations like [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]], ''[[Carboneria]]'' and others. The moderates and radicals disputed mainly for the methods to unified Italy: the Moderates supported secret pacts and strategic alliances between the patriotic movement and the other European powers, whereas the Mazzini's supporters called a popular revolution to establish a democratic Republic. 
After the failure of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|Italian Revolutions of 1848]], attempted by Mazzinians and republicans, the republican ideas declined for the Moderates' agenda.
During this time, several politicians of other Italian states are members of the group: in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the leaders were [[Massimo d'Azeglio]] and [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], representing the parliamentary [[Historical Right|Right]], and [[Urbano Rattazzi]], representing the [[Historical Left|Left]]; in the [[Papal States]] the reform movement was headed by [[Terenzio, Count Mamiani della Rovere|Terenzio della Rovere]] and [[Pellegrino Rossi]], the last murdered by a republican plot in 1848; in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] prominent moderates were brothers [[Bertrando Spaventa|Bertrando]] and [[Silvio Spaventa]].
When the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was founded in 1861, the moderates merged in the Historical Right and Left, the two Piedmontese parliamentary group that monopolized the politics of the new Italian state for almost half-century.

==Tendencies and members==
Differently by democrats and radical republicans, the Moderates were only circles of intellectuals, aristocrats, soldiers and businessmen with patriotic tendencies. However, the Moderate Party wasn't cohesive, because its members were of different political ideologies, from continental [[liberalism]] to soft [[conservatism]]. Initially, the party wasn't too nationalist, preferring a [[federation]] or coalition between the several Italian states, and support both [[reformist]] and [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] policies,&lt;ref name=Treccani/&gt; different by the republicans like Mazzini.
When the possibility of an unified Italian state became real, a new question of division was the form that the new Italian State would have. Someone, like [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], supported a [[confederation]] of states, led by the [[Pope]].&lt;ref name=Treccani&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/partito-moderato/|title=Partito Moderato|publisher=Encilopedia Treccani}}&lt;/ref&gt; other simply claimed for a [[centralized]] state headed by a [[monarch]], without differences if a [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] or other. There were three main tendencies inside the movement:

On 17 February the students were injured by the Pakistani police. On the same day local administration imposed [[section 144]] on  Natore-Rajshahi Highway near to Rajshahi University.  When the students violated the section, the Pakistani army was deployed to shoot the students, but Shamsuzzoha talked with them and urged them not to fire. When the tension grew, the army fired on Shamsuzzoha. He was taken to the hospital and died there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=10&amp;id=76588$date=2009-12-14&amp;dateCurrent=2009-12-22|title=Dr Zoha first martyred intellectual|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bssnews.net|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Oxford Town'''" is a song written by [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Bob Dylan]] in 1962. It was recorded in [[CBS 30th Street Studio|Columbia]]'s Studio A on December 6, 1962 for his second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]''.

The song  was composed in response to an open invitation from ''[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]'' magazine for songs about one of the top news events of 1962: the enrollment of a black student, [[James Meredith]], in the [[University of Mississippi]] on October 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle of Mississippi|publisher=[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]''|url=http://www.broadsidemagazine.com/All/14.pdf|date=October 1962|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other submissions was [[Phil Ochs]]' song "Ballad of Oxford, Mississippi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil|last=Ochs|title=Ballad of Oxford, Mississippi|publisher=[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]''|url=http://www.broadsidemagazine.com/All/14.pdf|date=November 1962|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics and music from Dylan's song were printed December 1962 in ''Broadside'''s issue #17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Dylan|title=Oxford Town|publisher=[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]''|url=http://www.broadsidemagazine.com/All/17.pdf|date=December 1962|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except that the University of Mississippi is located in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], "Oxford Town" does not mention either Meredith or the university by name. Later, in an interview with [[Studs Terkel]], Dylan said, "It deals with the Meredith case, but then again it doesn't... I wrote that when it happened, and I could have written that yesterday. It's still the same. 'Somebody better investigate soon' that's a verse in the song."

Besides the ''Freewheelin''' release, Dylan recorded a version of "Oxford Town" for Broadside Sessions in November 1962. He also recorded a [[demo recording|demo]] of the song for his [[music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]] [[M. Witmark &amp; Sons]] in March 1963. This version was released in October 2010 on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 – The Witmark Demos: 1962–1964]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.bobdylan.com/#/early-demos-and-mono-recordings | title=The Bootleg Series Volume 9—The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964 | publisher=bobdylan.com | accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Olof|last=Bjorner|title=Still on the Road: Recording sessions &amp; concerts, 1963|url=http://www.bjorner.com/still.htm#y63|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notable recordings==
[[Richie Havens]] recorded "Oxford Town" in 1966 for his second album, ''Electric Havens''. [[Tim O'Brien (musician)|Tim O'Brien]] featured the song on his 1996 release of Dylan covers, ''[[Red on Blonde]]''. 
The alternative bluegrass band [[Crooked Still]] recorded the song for their 2006 album ''Shaken by a Low Sound''. [[Hugues Aufray]] released a French version of this (and ten other Dylan songs) in 1965 on his LP ''Aufray chante Dylan''.
[[Pat Wictor]] recorded Oxford Town on his album ''Heaven is so High'' in 2006.

The '''Papua conflict''' is an ongoing conflict between the Indonesian government and portions of the indigenous populations of [[Western New Guinea]] (Papua) in the Indonesian provinces of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] on the island of [[New Guinea]] in which the Indonesian government has been accused{{By whom|date=August 2018}} of conducting a genocidal campaign against the indigenous inhabitants.

==Historical background== 

===Overview===
[[File:Indonesia army soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] has been accused of committing human rights abuses in Papua.]] 
{{main|West New Guinea dispute}}
In December 1949, at the end of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], the [[Netherlands]] [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference|agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty]] over the territories of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], with the exception of [[Western New Guinea]], which the Dutch continued to hold as [[Netherlands New Guinea]]. The nationalist Indonesian government argued that it was the [[successor state]] to the whole of the Dutch East Indies and wanted to end the Dutch colonial presence in the archipelago. The Netherlands argued that the Papuans were ethnically different&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Papua: Geopolitics and the Quest for Nationhood|first=Bilveer|last=Singh|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2008|pages=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Netherlands would continue to administer the territory until it was capable of self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The West New Guinea Debacle: Dutch Decolonization and Indonesia, 1945–1962|last1=Penders|first1=Christian Lambert Maria|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|location=Honolulu|year=2002|page=154|isbn=0824824709}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950 onwards, the Dutch and the Western powers agreed that the Papuans should be given an independent state, but due to global considerations, mainly the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]'s concern to keep Indonesia on their side of the [[Cold War]], the United States pressured the Dutch to sacrifice Papua's independence and transfer the territory to Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Bilveer Singh, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the Dutch agreed to relinquish the territory to [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority|temporary United Nations administration]], signing the  [[New York Agreement]], which included a provision that a [[plebiscite]] would be held before 1969. The Indonesian military organised this vote, called the [[Act of Free Choice]] in 1969 to determine the population's views on the territory's future; the result was in favor of integration into [[Indonesia]]. In violation of the Agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the vote was a show of hands in the presence of the Indonesian military, and only involved 1025 hand picked people who were forced at gunpoint to vote for integration, much less than 1% of those who should have been eligible to vote.

===Origins===
Prior to the arrival of the Dutch, two Indonesian principalities known as the [[Sultanate of Tidore]] and the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] claimed dominion over Western New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Indonesia Timur Tempo Doeloe 1544–1992|first=George |last= Miller |publisher= [[Depok: Komunitas Bambu]]|year=2012 |page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1660, the Dutch recognized the Sultan of Tidore's sovereignty over New Guinea. It thus became notionally Dutch as the Dutch held power over Tidore. A century later, in 1793, Britain attempted a failed settlement near Manokwari. After almost 30 years, in 1824 Britain and the Netherlands agreed to divide the land; rendering the eastern half of the island as being under British control and the western half would become part of the Dutch East Indies. 

In 1828, the Dutch established a settlement in Lobo (near Kaimana) which also failed. Almost 30 years later, the Germans established the first missionary settlement on an island near Manokwari. While in 1828 the Dutch claimed the south coast west of the 141st meridian and the north coast west of Humboldt Bay in 1848, Dutch activity in New Guinea was minimal until 1898 when the Dutch established an administrative center, which was subsequently followed by missionaries and traders. Under Dutch rule, commercial links were developed between West New Guinea and Eastern Indonesia. In 1883, New Guinea was divided between the Netherlands, Britain, and Germany; with Australia occupying the German territory in 1914. In 1901, the Netherlands formally purchased West New Guinea from the Sultanate of Tidore, incorporating it into the Dutch East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asia in the Pacific Islands|first=Ron|last=Crocombe|publisher=[[IPS Publication, University of South Pacific]]|year=2007|page=286-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the territory was occupied by Japan but was later recaptured by the Allies, who restored Dutch rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World War II Pacific Island Guide: A Geo Military Study|first=Rotman. L|last=Gordon|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years after the Indonesian National Revolution and Independence on 17 August 1945, the Netherlands formally transferred sovereignty to the [[United States of Indonesia]], the successor state to the Dutch East Indies, on 27 December 1949. However, the Dutch refused to include Netherlands New Guinea in the new Indonesian Republic and decided to assist and prepare it for independence as a separate country. In order to resolve the differences, both countries held the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in late 1949 but to no avail. It was decided that the present status quo of the territory would be maintained and then negotiated bilaterally one year after the date of the transfer of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=WSubversion as Foreign Policy: The Secret Eisenhower and Dulles Debacle|first=Audrey|last=Kahin|publisher=[[New York: The New Press]]|year=1995|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, both Indonesia and the Netherlands were still unable to resolve their differences, which led Indonesian President [[Sukarno]] to accuse the Dutch of reneging on their promises to negotiate the handover of the territory. The Dutch was persistent in their argument that the territory did not belong to Indonesia because the Melanesian Papuans were ethnically and geographically different from Indonesians, and that the territory had always been administrated separately. On top of that, the Papuans did not participate in the Indonesian Revolution, and that the Papuans did not want to be under Indonesian control.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Crocombe, Asia in the Pacific Islands, p. 282 &lt;/ref&gt; 

While at face-value, the Dutch seems to be having the Papuans’ interest at heart, Arend Lijphart, a Dutch political scientist disagreed. He argued that other underlying Dutch motives to prevent West New Guinea from joining Indonesia included the territory's lucrative economic resources, its strategic importance as a Dutch naval base, and its potential role for housing the Netherlands' surplus population including Eurasians who had become displaced by the Indonesian National Revolution. The Dutch also wanted to maintain a regional presence and to secure their economic interests in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Arend Lijphart, Trauma of Decolonization, pp. 25–35, 39–66&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Indonesia regarded West New Guinea as an intrinsic part of the country on the basis that Indonesia was the successor state to the Dutch East Indies. These sentiments were reflected in the popular Indonesian revolutionary slogan “Indonesia Merdeka- dari Sabang sampai Merauke” "Indonesia Free—from [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]] to [[Merauke]].&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Kahim, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  The slogan indicates the stretch of Indonesian territory from the most western part in Sumatra, Sabang, and the most eastern part in Merauke, a small city in West New Guinea. Indonesian irredentist sentiments were also inflamed by the fact that several Indonesian political prisoners had been interned at a remote prison camp north of Merauke called Boven-Digoel prior to World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Anderson, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;  Sukarno also contended that the continuing Dutch presence in West New Guinea was an obstacle to the process of nation-building in Indonesia and that it would also encourage secessionist movements.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Catley, p. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bilateral negotiations (1950–1953)===
The Netherlands and Indonesia tried to resolve the West New Guinea dispute through several bilateral negotiations between 1950 and 1953. These negotiations ended up to become unsuccessful and led the two governments to harden their stance and position. On 15 February 1952, the Dutch Parliament voted to incorporate New Guinea into the realm of the Netherlands and shortly after, the Netherlands refused further discussion on the question of sovereignty and considered the issue to be closed.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Kahin, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, President Sukarno adopted a more forceful stance towards the Dutch. Initially, he unsuccessfully tried to force the Indonesian government to abrogate the Round Table agreements and to adopt economic sanctions but was rebuffed by the [[Natsir Cabinet]]. Undeterred by this setback, Sukarno made recovering the territory a top priority of his presidency and sought to harness popular support from the Indonesian public for this goal throughout many of his speeches between 1951 and 1952.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Legge, pp. 277–78&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1953, the dispute had become the central issue in Indonesian domestic politics. All political parties across the political spectrum, particularly the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), supported Sukarno's efforts to integrate the territory into Indonesia. According to historians Audrey and [[George McTurnan Kahin]], the PKI's pro-integration stance helped the party to rebuild its political base and to further its credentials as a nationalist Communist Party that supported Sukarno.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Kahin, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations (1954–1957)===
In 1954, Indonesia decided to take the dispute to the United Nations and succeeded in having it placed on the agenda for the upcoming ninth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA). In response, the Dutch Ambassador to the United Nations, [[Herman van Roijen]], warned that the Netherlands would ignore any recommendations which might be made by the UN regarding the dispute.&lt;ref name = Djiwandono38&gt;{{Citation | first = Soedjati | last = Djiwandono | title = Konfrontasi Revisited | page = 38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Bandung Conference]] in April 1955, Indonesia succeeded in securing a resolution supporting its claim to West New Guinea from African and Asian countries. In addition,&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Mackie, Bandung, p. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia was also supported by the Soviet Union and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies.&lt;ref name=Djiwandono38 /&gt;

In terms of international support, the Netherlands was supported by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and several [[Western Europe]]an and Latin American countries. However, these countries were unwilling to commit to providing military support in the event of a conflict with Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt; Wies Platje, p. 297-98&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] were open to non-violent territorial changes but rejected the use of any military means to resolve the dispute. Until 1961, the United States pursued a policy of strict neutrality and abstained on every vote on the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Kahin, p. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian [[Nicholas Tarling]], the United Kingdom took the position that it was "strategically undesirable" for control of the territory to pass to Indonesia because it created a precedent for encouraging territorial changes based on political prestige and geographical proximity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Britain and the West New Guinea Dispute|first=Nicholas|last=Tarling|publisher=[[UNSW Press]]|year=2004|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian [[Menzies Government (1949–66)|Menzies government]] welcomed the Dutch presence in the region as an "essential link" in its national defense since it also administrated a trust territory in the eastern half of New Guinea. Unlike the Labor Party which had supported the Indonesian nationalists, the Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] viewed Indonesia as a potential threat to its national security and distrusted the Indonesian leadership for supporting Japan during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt; Bob Catley, p. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, New Zealand and South Africa also opposed Indonesia's claim to the territory. New Zealand accepted the Dutch argument that the Papuans were culturally different from the Indonesians and thus supported maintaining Dutch sovereignty over the territory until the Papuans were ready for self-rule. By contrast, newly independent [[India]], another [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member supported Indonesia's position.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Taling, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
		
Between 1954 and 1957, Indonesia and their Afro-Asian allies made three attempts to get the United Nations to intervene. All these three resolutions, however, failed to gain a two–thirds majority in the UNGA. On 30 November 1954, the Indian representative Krishna Menon initiated a resolution calling for Indonesia and the Netherlands to resume negotiations and to report to the 10th UNGA Session. This resolution was sponsored by eight countries ([[Argentina]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[India]], [[Syria]], and [[Yugoslavia]]) but failed to secure a two-thirds majority (34-23-3).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Tarling, p. 59-60 &lt;/ref&gt; In response to growing tensions between Jakarta and the Hague, Indonesia unilaterally dissolved the Netherlands-Indonesian Union on 13 February 1956, and also rescinded compensation claims to the Dutch. Undeterred by this setback, Indonesia resubmitted the dispute to the UNGA agenda in November 1965.&lt;ref&gt; Nicholas Tarling, p. 104-105, p. 114-115 &lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 1957, a 13 country–sponsored resolution ([[Bolivia]], [[Burma]], [[Ceylon]], Costa Rica, Ecuador, India, [[Iraq]], Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], Syria, and Yugoslavia) calling for the United Nations to appoint a "good offices commission" for West New Guinea was submitted to the UNGA. Despite receiving a plural majority (40-25-13), this second resolution failed to gain a two-thirds majority. Undeterred, the Afro-Asian caucus in the United Nations lobbied for the dispute to be included on the UNGA agenda. On 4 October 1957, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Subandrio warned that Indonesia would embark on "another cause" if the United Nations failed to bring about a solution to the dispute that favoured Indonesia. That month, the PKI and affiliated trade unions lobbied for retaliatory economic measures against the Dutch. On 26 November 1957, a third Indonesian resolution on the West New Guinea dispute was put to the vote but failed to gain a two-thirds majority (41-29-11).

===West Papua's national identity===
Following the recent defeat at the UN, Indonesia embarked on a national campaign targeting Dutch interests in Indonesia&lt;ref&gt; Nicholas Tarling, pp. 114–19 &lt;/ref&gt;; leading to the withdrawal of the Dutch flag carrier KLM's landing rights, mass demonstrations, and the seizure of the Dutch shipping line [[Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij]] (KPM), Dutch-owned banks, and other estates. By January 1958, 10,000 Dutch nationals had left Indonesia, many returning to the Netherlands. This spontaneous nationalisation had adverse repercussions on Indonesia's economy, disrupting communications and affecting the production of exports. President Sukarno also abandoned efforts to raise the dispute at the 1958 UNGA, claiming that reason and persuasion had failed.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Legge, p. 330-33&lt;/ref&gt; Following a sustained period of harassment against Dutch diplomatic representatives in Jakarta, Indonesia formally severed relations with the Netherlands in August 1960.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Legge, p. 402-03&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to Indonesian aggression, the Netherlands stepped up its efforts to prepare the Papuans for self-determination in 1959. These efforts culminated in the establishment of a hospital in Hollandia (modern–day Jayapura), a shipyard in Manokwari, agricultural research sites, plantations, and a military force known as the Papuan Volunteer Corps. By 1960, a legislative New Guinea Council had been established with a mixture of legislative, advisory and policy functions had been established. Half of its members were to be elected and elections for this council were held the following year.&lt;ref&gt; Wies Platje, p. 298 &lt;/ref&gt;  Most importantly, the Dutch also sought to create a sense of West Papuan national identity and these efforts led to the creation of a national flag (the Morning Star flag), a national anthem, and a coat of arms. The Dutch had planned to transfer independence to West New Guinea in 1970.&lt;ref&gt; Ron Crocombe, p. 286 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Preparation of independence====
By 1960, other countries in the Asia-Pacific had taken notice of the dispute and began proposing initiatives to end it. During a visit to the Netherlands, the New Zealand Prime Minister Walter Nash suggested the idea of a united New Guinea state, consisting of both Dutch and Australian territories. This idea received little support from both Indonesia and other Western governments. Later that year, the Malayan Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] proposed a three-step initiative, which involved West New Guinea coming under United Nations trusteeship. The joint administrators would be three non-aligned nations Ceylon, India, and Malaya, which supported Indonesia's position. This solution involved the two belligerents, Indonesia and the Netherlands, re-establishing bilateral relations and the return of Dutch assets and investments to their owners. However, this initiative was scuttled in April 1961 due to opposition from Indonesia's Foreign Minister Subandrio, who publicly attacked Tunku's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Green, p. 159-60&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1961, the Netherlands was struggling to find adequate international support for its policy to prepare West New Guinea for independent status under Dutch guidance. While the Netherlands' traditional Western allies—the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and [[New Zealand]]—were sympathetic to Dutch policy, they were unwilling to provide any military support in the event of conflict with Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt; Wies Platje, p. 298-99&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 1961, the Dutch Foreign Minister [[Joseph Luns]] offered to hand over the territory to a United Nations trusteeship. This proposal was firmly rejected by his Indonesian counterpart [[Subandrio]], who likened the dispute to Katanga's attempted secession from the Republic of Congo during the Congo Crisis. By October 1961, Britain was open to transferring West New Guinea to Indonesia while the United States floated the idea of a jointly-administered trusteeship over the territory.&lt;ref&gt; Nicholas Tarling, p. 359-374 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Call for resumption of Dutch–Indonesian talks====
On 23 November 1961, the Indian delegation at the United Nations presented a draft resolution calling for the resumption of Dutch–Indonesian talks on terms which favoured Indonesia. Two days later, several Francophone countries in Africa tabled a rival resolution which favoured an independent West New Guinea. Indonesia favoured India's resolution while the Dutch, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand supported the Francophone African one. On 27 November 1961, both the Francophone African (52-41-9) and Indian (41-40-21) resolutions were put to the vote failed to gain a two–thirds majority at the UNGA. The failure of this final round of diplomacy in the UN convinced Indonesia to prepare for a military invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Tarling, p. 400-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Agreement, UN administration and Act of Free Choice===
{{main|New York Agreement}}
By 1961, the United States had become concerned about the Indonesian military's purchase of Soviet weapons and equipment for a planned invasion of West New Guinea. The Kennedy administration feared an Indonesian drift towards Communism and wanted to court Sukarno away from the Soviet bloc and Communist China. The United States also wanted to repair relations with Jakarta, which had deteriorated due to the Eisenhower administration's covert support for [[Permesta|regional uprisings]] in Sumatra and Sulawesi. These factors convinced the Kennedy administration to intervene diplomatically to bring about a peaceful solution to the dispute, which favored Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt; Audrey Kahin, p. 217-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1962, US diplomat [[Ellsworth Bunker]] facilitated top–secret high–level negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. This produced a peace settlement known as the New York Agreement on 15 August 1962. As a face-saving measure, the Dutch would hand over West New Guinea to a provisional [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] (UNTEA) on 1 October 1962, which then ceded the territory to Indonesia on 1 May 1963; formally ending the dispute. As part of the agreement, it was stipulated that a popular plebiscite would be held in 1969 to determine whether the Papuans would choose to remain in Indonesia or seek self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sukarno: A Political Biography|first= John D. |last=Legge|publisher=[[Singapore: Archipelago Press]]|year=2003|page=403-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of Indonesian governance was followed by sporadic fighting between Indonesian and pro-Papuan forces until 1969.

Following the [[Act of Free Choice|referendum]] in 1969, the territory was formally integrated into Indonesia. Instead of 816,000 Papuans, only 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives were allowed to vote and all of these were coerced into voting in favour of integration. While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticised the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia support Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. That same year, 84-member states voted in favour for the UN to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining.&lt;ref name = Crocombe286-91&gt;{{Citation | first = Ron | last = Crocombe | title = Asia in the Pacific Islands | pages = 286–91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Dutch efforts to promote a national identity, a significant number of Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia. These formed the separatist [[Free Papua Movement]] (OPM) and have waged an insurgency against Indonesia, which still continues to this day.&lt;ref name = Crocombe286-91 /&gt;

'''Quinni-Con''' was an annual two-day [[anime]] [[fan convention]] held during March or April at the Rocky Top Student Center on the [[Quinnipiac University#Campuses|Quinnipiac University York Hill Campus]] in [[Hamden, Connecticut]].

{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}
'''Regime change''' is the replacement of one government [[regime]] with another. Use of the term dates to at least 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Regime change effort denied|date=1 Aug 1925|page=8|postscript=. Cited in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''regime''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regime change may replace all or part of the state's most critical leadership system, administrative apparatus, or bureaucracy.

It can be the deliberate product of outside force, as in warfare.  [[Rollback]] is the military strategy to impose a regime change by defeating an enemy and removing its regime by force.  Regime change can occur through inside change caused by [[revolution]], [[coup d'état]] or reconstruction following the [[Failed state|failure of a state]].

==Popular use==
The transition from one political regime to another, especially through concerted political or military action, as was done in [[World War II]] to Italy, Germany, and Japan. (also known as the [[Axis Powers]])

The term has been popularized by recent US presidents. [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]] regularly used the term in reference to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime in [[Iraq]].  [[Ronald Reagan]] had previously called for regime change in [[Libya]], directing the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to work towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post 20 Feb. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term regime change is sometimes erroneously used to describe a change in the [[Executive (government)|government of the day]].

The term regime change can also be applied to bodies other than [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2006/03/09/dealing_with_regime_change_at_the_office.html |title=Dealing with Regime Change at the Office |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |author=Margaret Heffernan |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=2015-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306133746/http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2006/03/09/dealing_with_regime_change_at_the_office.html |archivedate=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal regime change==
Regime change can be precipitated by revolution or a [[coup d'état]].  The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|1962 Burmese coup]] and the 1990 collapse of [[communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]] (→ [[Eastern Bloc#Dissolution|#Dissolution of the Eastern Bloc]]) are consummate examples.

Examples of internally driven regime change are the establishment of the [[French Fifth Republic]] (1958) and the [[Federation of Australia]].

== In academic use ==

In addition to the above uses, the term 'regime change' can also be used in a more general sense, particularly in academic work, to refer to a change in political institutions or laws that affect the nature of the system as a whole.  For example, the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] was a regime change in the international system, as was the repeal of the [[speed limits#United States|National Mandatory Speed Limit]] in the United States.  Regime changes are often viewed as ideal opportunities for [[natural experiment]]s by [[social science|social scientists]].{{fact|date=February 2018}}

== Role of the United States ==
{{main article|United States involvement in regime change}}

The [[United States]] has been involved in and assisted in the overthrow of foreign governments (more recently termed "regime change") without the overt use of U.S. military force. Often, such operations are tasked to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).

The '''Ruta del Sol''' ({{lang-en|Route of the Sun}}) is an [[amateur]] [[Auto racing|motor race]] for [[Charitable organization|charity]] using a [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] to race from [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]] to [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]], [[Brazil]], a distance of some 7000 km.

In 2009 the event is changing its name and format. The details have not yet been released by the organisers.

The Ruta Del Sol, organised by the Adventurists, took place in February 2008. It took the teams into the wilds of [[Latin America]] through thousands of miles of hardcore [[jungle]]s and [[rainforest]], the [[Andes]], awful roads, complete absence of roads and [[Tropics|tropical]] weather. Each team taking part has to provide their own [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] and to raise a minimum amount for charity.  

[[Fundecruz]] was the official charity of the February 2008 Ruta del Sol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ruta.theadventurists.com/index.php?page=charities | title=Official charity for the Ruta | publisher=ruta.theadventurists.com | accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2007-12-20 | url=http://www.readingfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~1193203,00.html | title=Help Ulises with his charity work | publisher=readingfc.co.uk | accessdate=2008-01-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103071234/http://www.readingfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10306~1193203,00.html | archivedate=2008-01-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''St. George Opera House''', also known as the '''St. George Social Hall''', is a historic building in [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], [[Utah]]. It was originally built by the St. George Gardeners' Club as a [[wine cellar]]. As wine demand decreased, the building was expanded to host theatrical productions. It operated in this capacity until sold to the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]] in 1936. It was restored to an opera house in 1988 and is again open to the public.

==History==
In 1861, [[Brigham Young]] sent three hundred [[Mormonism|Mormon]] families to the south reaches of [[Utah Territory]] to establish a new settlement. Young envisioned a Mormon state that was completely self-sufficient, and one important goal in this regard was the production of [[cotton]]. The region settled was much warmer than the northern [[Salt Lake City]], and it was thought that this would be good weather for cotton. Unfortunately for the settlers, this was not the case. The climate was too hot during the summer, producing only small harvests of cotton.

The original function of the St. George Opera House was a wine cellar. [[Grape]] production was an important secondary source of income for the settlers. The St. George Gardeners' Club formed in the mid-1860s to provide community support for farmers. In 1864, as one of their first projects, they built the cellar as a cool place to store surplus wine and to process grapes. It was mostly constructed below-ground along a hillside.

As wine demand diminished due to closing mines and pressure from the church, new plans were made for the cellar building. The Gardener's Club sold it to the Social Hall Company in the late 1870s. Extensions were added on the top and to the west of the main cellar to create a stage and seating for up to four hundred patrons. The performing arts were an important part of Mormon culture, and Young always ensured that artisans were among the families sent when organizing new settlements. [[Pratt–Romney family|Miles P. Romney]] was president of the Social Hall Company and the St. George Dramatic Association, occasionally performing in some of the plays. Shortly after it opened, Mormon missionaries shipped materials from a bankrupt [[opera house]] in [[New York City]] to the St. George Social Hall. The hall hosted its first [[opera]] 1886.

The hall was deeded to the local LDS church in 1900, as it was hopelessly in debt to it. However, the church continued to run productions in it. [[The Great Depression]] forced the church to sell the property to the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]] in 1936. They used the building to process [[sugar beet]] seeds, an important source of income for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. They sold the property to the St. George Neighborhood Redevelopment Agency in 1988, who restored the building to again function as an opera house.

'''''T.T.

== Plot ==

In 1958 a disheveled young woman named Margita stumbles into a [[Turkish bath]], gives birth in one of the restrooms, and flushes the baby (the result of a rape) down a toilet. Twenty-two years later, a [[Punk subculture|punk]] couple having sex in the same bathhouse are killed and dismembered by someone, who flushes the victims' remains down a toilet before meticulously cleaning the crime scene.

Nineteen years later, Teodora, her boyfriend Vaki, and their friends Tina and Sale visit the bathhouse (where what sounds like an infant's cries and laughter frequently emanate from the plumbing) to buy drugs from a pair of dealers named Cane and Sleš. Aside from those two, the only other people in the building are an attendant, a wino, and a gay [[Magister degree|magistar]] named Djordjevic. While Vaki and Sale are purchasing the narcotics from Cane, someone murders both Sleš and Tina, the latter in front of a hiding Teodora. After finding Tina's body and the traumatized Teodora, everyone attempts to flee the bathhouse, the exits to which have all been sealed. Convinced that the drunk is the murderer, Cane impulsively shoots him to death; the man is afterward revealed to have been innocent when Sale discovers that his dropped [[camcorder]] had briefly recorded the real killer, who is wearing boots similar to Djordjevic's.

The men lock Djordjevic in a washroom stall and explore the bathhouse with Teodora, uncovering the attendant's body (which later vanishes) and a tunnel to the sewers in her living quarters. Vaki and Djordjevic are both murdered by the killer, who is revealed to be the attendant, who is also Margita. Convinced that the baby (called "Cloaca") that she had flushed down a toilet decades ago is somehow still alive and living in the sewers, Margita has spent years murdering visitors to the bathhouse so that she can feed her offspring their body parts by flushing them down the building's toilets. Assisting Margita are a deranged former professor named Dragi HadžiTošić (who has filled the sewers with traps for catching both people and crocodiles) and Cane, who she had abducted as a toddler and raised as her son.

As the psychotic family prepares to butcher their captives, they begin succumbing to infighting; Margita slits HadžiTošić's throat because Cane had been accidentally injured by one of his traps, and because he appeared to be attracted to Teodora, who manages to break free of her restraints and stab Margita. Teodora then releases Sale and together the two enter the sewers, pursued by Cane, who Teodora shoves into a pit where he is seemingly eaten by an entity implied to be Cloaca. Upon reaching the surface, Teodora and Sale are confronted by the wounded Margita, but are saved by a passing vagrant, who dies killing Margita (who, with her dying breath, reveals that Teodora is pregnant). The film ends with a scene of Teodora giving birth to a child who is implied to have the same disorder ("T.T. Syndrome") as Cloaca.

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
Frank Lafond of Kinoeye opined that ''T.T. Syndrome'' was "a very effective, gruesome and rather gory" film that was one of the "best surprises" of the 20th [[Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.kinoeye.org/02/10/lafond10.php|title = Don't go in there!|last = Lafond|first = Frank|publisher = Kinoeye|date = 21 March 2002|website = kinoeye.org|accessdate = 25 April 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; ''T.T. Syndrome'' was similarly praised by [[Ain't It Cool News]], which called it "a landmark film" and "an outstanding establishing of a potentially great author" with a directorial-style that was comparable to both [[Dario Argento]]'s and [[Lars von Trier]]'s.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/12075|title = Euro-AICN: David Fincher Speaks Out; ''24 Hour Party People; Stranded; Billy Liar; Senso 45; Unfaithful; TT Syndrome''|publisher = [[Ain't It Cool News]]|date = 22 April 2002|website = aintitcool.com|accessdate = 12 April 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; The entertainingly "screwed up" film's style was also compared to Argento's classics by [[Film Threat]], which wrote, "Yes, ''T.T. Syndrome'' is loud and obnoxious, and the characters are beyond dumb, but this is what makes the genre work. This feels like a period correct [[Giallo]] film in almost every single significant way."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/t-t-syndrome/|title = ''T.T. Syndrome''|publisher = [[Film Threat]]|date = 28 July 2010|website = filmthreat.com|accessdate = 12 April 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Taensa language''' was the [[Natchez language]]-variant spoken by the '''[[Taensa]]''' people originally of northeastern [[Louisiana]], and later with historical importance in [[Alabama]]. The language is also well known in linguistic and historical circles for the fact that two young co-conspirators published purported studies of the Taensa language in 1880-1882 that was later proven fraudulent, unequivocally in 1908-1910 by [[John R. Swanton]].

Some French missionary priests reported that they learned [[Natchez language|Natchez]] in order to speak to the Taensa;{{citation needed lead|date=March 2017}} Mooney's summary of the people and missionary efforts describes the Taensa language as a variant of the [[Natchez language|Natchez]].{{sfn|Mooney|1912}}

The language has received academic attention in largest part for the fact that two young men, one a clerical student named Parisot, published purported "material of the Taensa language, including papers, songs, a grammar and vocabulary" in Paris in 1880-1882, reports which led to considerable interest on the part of [[philology|philologists]] and linguists of the time. The work proved to be a "fraudulent invention... of some one... from whom the manuscripts had originally come" or perhaps of the student Parisot.{{sfn|Mooney|1912}} The fraudulently invented language was unrelated to the actual language variant spoken by the Taensa people; the invention was unique enough in its grammar to arouse the interest referred to above. Several eminent scholars were taken in by the materials, but by 1885, [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] and [[Julien Vinson]] had reported the work to be fraudulent. Later, [[John R. Swanton|Swanton]] exposed the work as a clear hoax, and the matter of the Parisot fraud continues to receive modern historical and linguistic attention to modern times.

==Background of actual people and language==
The native Americans originally of northeastern [[Louisiana]] known as the Taensa were related to, but had separated themselves from the peoples of the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] nation, following a series of conflicts with them and others{{sfn|Mooney|1912}}—e.g., the Taensa had been subject to slave raids by the [[Chickasaw]], [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]], and Natchez. By the time of the [[Natchez revolt|Natchez Massacre]] under the governor of French Louisiana, [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville|Bienville]],{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} the Taensa had moved from Louisiana to Alabama.{{sfn|Mooney|1912}} Also referred to as the Tensas, Tensaw, and ''grands Taensas'' (in French{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}), and by many other near variants (see the article on the [[Taensa]] people),&lt;ref name=TSH_Taensas&gt;{{cite journal | author = Campbell, Thomas N.| date=15 June 2010 | title = Taensa Indians | journal = Handbook of Texas Online | location = Austin, TX | publisher = Texas State Historical Association | via = tshaonline.org |  url = https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmt04 | access-date=March 7, 2017}}{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the people so named were village-dwelling native Americans originally from lands near present day [[Tensas Parish, Louisiana]]. Relocating several times in response to inter-tribal hostilities, the Taensa ultimately migrated, ''ca.'' 1740, under French protection to lands along the current Tensas river near Mobile, Alabama,{{sfn|Mooney|1912}} only to return to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] in [[Louisiana]] after land cessions by the French to the English in 1763, then moving southward to [[Bayou Boeuf]] and [[Grand Lake (Louisiana)|Grand Lake]] before their disappearance as a community.{{sfn|Mooney|1912}}

While French missionary priests François de Montigny&lt;ref name = biographiCa_deMontigny&gt;{{cite book | author = Baillargeon, Noël | year = 1974 | editor =  | chapter = Montigny, François de | title = Dictionary of Canadian Biography | volume = Vol. 3 | location = Toronto, CAN | publisher = University of Toronto/Université Laval | url = http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/montigny_francois_de_3E.html | access-date = March 7, 2017 }} Via Biographi.ca.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jean-François Buisson de Saint-Cosme&lt;ref name = biographiCa_BuissonDSC&gt;{{cite book | author = Provost, Honorius | year = 1982 | orig-year = 1969 | editor =  | chapter = Buisson de Saint-Cosme, Jean-François (d. 1712) | title = Dictionary of Canadian Biography | volume = Vol. 2 | location = Toronto, CAN | publisher = University of Toronto/Université Laval | url = http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/buisson_de_saint_cosme_jean_francois_1712_2E.html | access-date = March 7, 2017 }} Via Biographi.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=March 2017}} stated that the Taensa spoke [[Natchez language|Natchez]], a language that both missionaries were learning,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} others, such as Mooney describe the Taensa language as a variant of the [[Natchez language|Natchez]].{{sfn|Mooney|1912}}

The Taensa spoken by these people was a form of the [[Natchez language|Natchez]], a [[language isolate]] that may be related to the [[Muskogean languages]]. Over time small differences in pronunciation emerged, but the two languages appear, based on the available data, and from this historical vantage point, to have been largely the same.{{dubious|date=March 2017}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL STATEMENT OF THE ARTICLE, AND MUST HAVE NUMEROUS MODERN SCHOLARLY (PEER-REVIEWED) SOURCES.--&gt; Beginning in the early nineteenth century, the Taensa people became intermixed with other groups, particularly the [[Chitimacha]].

==The fraudulent invention==
===Document===
[[File:Daniel Garrison Brinton.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] was taken in at first, but then exposed the hoax.]]
In the 1880s two French students published a grammar and other material of what they claimed to be the hitherto undocumented language of the Taensa people of Louisiana.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=13}} Jean Parisot, who submitted the documents for publication in Paris, was a nineteen-year-old student at a seminary in [[Plombières-les-Bains|Plombières]], France.{{sfn|Sturtevant|2005|pp=42f}} The ''Grammaire et vocabulaire de la langue Taensa, avec textes traduits et commentés par J.-D. Haumonté, Parisot, L. Adam'' was published in 1882 in Paris and caused a stir among linguists.{{sfn|Boas|1911|p=172}}

The material included an outline of the grammar, vocabulary and fragments of text in the Taensa language.{{sfn|Sturtevant|2005|pp=42f}} Parisot claimed that it was from Spanish sources written in Louisiana. When the material was published, two eminent French Americanists, [[Lucien Adam]] and [[Julien Vinson]], supported the work.{{sfn|Sturtevant|2005|pp=42f}}

===Controversy===
[[Albert Samuel Gatschet]] defended the work at first.{{sfn|Sturtevant|2005|pp=42f}} Gatschet stated that the language was unrelated to any other.{{sfn|Boas|1911|p=172}}  In 1885 he started studies in Indiana, and thereafter became silent on the subject.  The eminent ethnologist [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] was also taken in at first. 
Writing of native American literature in 1883, Brinton quoted a complete song from the grammar, praising the songs as "[[Ossian]]ic in style."{{sfn|Bendix|2009|p=132}} Later Brinton reversed his position and declared that the material was fake, publishing his reasons in 1885.{{sfn|Sturtevant|2005|pp=42f}} Vinson also came to believe it was a hoax.{{sfn|Boas|1911|p=172}} Adam continued to defend the work for a while, but in 1885 he and Brinton co-authored ''Le Taensa a-t-il été forgé de toutes pièces'', which discussed whether the entire work was a forgery.{{sfn|Adam|Brinton|1885}} [[John R. Swanton]] published definitive works in 1908 and 1910 that removed all doubt based on primarily historical rather than linguistic grounds.{{sfn|Sturtevant|2005|pp=42f}} The text showed "palpable and gross" evidences of fraud.{{sfn|Boas|1911|p=172}} Swanton presented evidence that the Taensa people spoke either the [[Natchez language]] or a close variant of it.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=13}}

The fraud could have been the work of the unknown individual that created the manuscripts and gave them to Parisot, or it could have been the work of Parisot,{{sfn|Mooney|1912}} although Adam and Parisot jointly stated that the documents had not been Parisot's work when the scandal broke in 1885.{{sfn|Adam|Parisot|1885}} Parisot later spent time in Turkey and in 1898 and 1902 published further works on linguistics based on his experience there.{{sfn|Sturtevant|2005|pp=42f}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">'''The Best in Heritage''' is an international, annual survey of award-winning [[museum]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] projects. The survey was launched in 2003 by the European Heritage Association from [[Zagreb]] under leadership from professor [[Tomislav S. Šola]]. The event is being held every year in the city of [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]] at the end of September. The aim of the conference is to give prize winning projects from the preceding year further professional and media attention. The event serves to identify and promote the best museum, heritage and conservation projects in the world. 

== The event ==
''The Best in Heritage'' is an annual presentation of awarded museum, heritage, and conservation projects. Over 40 hand-picked projects and institutions which have received national or international awards in the previous year are presented by their authors or institution directors, followed by discussions, exhibitions and receptions. Presenters explain why their achievements were proclaimed the best in the previous year and received an award. The aim is to present quality projects in anything concerning the care and communication of heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/international-conference-best-heritage-2018_en |title=The "Best in Heritage" |publisher=europa.eu |date=2018-03-15 |accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''IMAGINES'' ==
At the ''IMAGINES'' event New technologies and Multimedia projects are being presented in a one-day programme. 

== Patronage ==
The conference is organised in partnership with [[Europa Nostra]]. The main patron is the [[ICOM Fund]] of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.ne-mo.org/reading-corner/cultural-tourism.html|title=The Best in Heritage: Projects of Influence (14th Edition)|publisher=''Ne-Mo.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;, other patrons are: [[ICOMOS]], [[ICCROM]], [[International Federation of Library Associations]], the City of [[Dubrovnik]] and the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]]. The Museums of Dubrovnik are local partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebestinheritage.com/event/sponsors/ |title=Sponsors, Patrons, Supporters |publisher=The Best in Heritage |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects of Influence ==
From 2015 onward, the conference audience, together with moderators and last year's winners, votes for the "Project of influence" award for each of the two events, winners of which are announced at the closing ceremony.

:[[Tjurunga (spider)|Tjurunga]]'' is also a [[genus]] of spiders ([[family (biology)|family]] [[Stiphidiidae]])
:'''''Churinga''' and '''Tjuringa''' redirect here. For the [[moth]] [[genus]], see ''[[Churinga (moth)|Churinga]].
A '''Tjurunga''' or as it is sometimes spelled, '''Churinga''', is an object considered to be of religious significance by Central Australian [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] people of the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] (Aranda, Arunta) groups. Tjurunga often had a wide and indeterminate native significance. They may be used variously in sacred ceremonies, as bullroarers, in sacred ground paintings, in ceremonial poles, in ceremonial headgear, in sacred chants and in sacred earth mounds.&lt;ref name=Strehlow&gt;{{cite book|last=Strehlow|first=T.G.H.|title=Aranda Traditions|year=1947|publisher=Melbourne University Press|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Generally speaking, tjurunga denote [[sacred]] stone or wooden objects possessed by private or group owners together with the legends, chants, and ceremonies associated with them.  They were present among the Arrernte, the Luritja, the Kaitish, the Unmatjera, and the Illpirra.  These items are most commonly oblong pieces of polished stone or wood.  Some of these items have hair or string strung through them and were named "[[Bullroarer (music)|bull roarer]]s" by Europeans.  Upon each tjurunga is a [[totem]] of the group to which it belongs.  Tjurunga are highly sacred, in fact, they are considered so sacred that only a few are able to see them and likewise it is considered sacrilegious to publish a picture of them.  [[Durkheim]] suggests that the name "churinga" is normally a noun, but can also be used as an adjective meaning "sacred".

The term Tjurunga was translated by Strehlow to mean something similar to secret and personal.  ''Tju'' means "hidden" or "secret", and ''runga'' means "that which is personal to me".  Kempe argued against this translation and suggested that ''Tju'' means "great", "powerful", or "sacred" and that ''runga'' did not translate into personal ownership.

==Ownership==
The ownership of sacred tjurunga amongst the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] groups was determined largely by "the conception site" of every individual member of a [[patrilineal]] totemic [[clan]].  Because these relics are considered sacred, their availability is limited to a small number of people.  During the early 20th century and before, only initiated males were able to see or touch these sacred objects.  Women and uninitiated males were not allowed to touch them or see them, except from a far distance.  The tjurunga were kept separately from the rest of the clan in a sacred location that was also unavailable to the uninitiated and women.

While some theorists, such as Strehlow, have suggested these relics are amongst the very few forms of property which may be owned legitimately by individual persons in Central Australia, Durkheim and Kempe contend that the tjurunga cannot be owned by an individual.  For example, Durkheim writes, "As concerns the meaning of the word ''runga'', that seems very doubtful.  The ceremonies of the Emu belong to all the members of the Emu clan; all can participate in them; they are not the personal property of any member."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Emile|title=The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, trans. Karen Fields|year=1995 (Originally Published in 1912)|publisher=The Free Press|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious aspects==
In many [[Mythology|myths]] the [[ancestors]] themselves are said to have used them and stored them away as their most treasured possessions. Such myths emphasise the life-holding [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] properties of these tjurungas. The ancestor regarded his tjurunga as portions of his own being; and is always worried that strangers might come and rob him of the very essence of his life. Accordingly, legends abound with stories of theft and robbery, and the very fierce vengeance exacted.  Tjuringa were thought to have magical properties.  They would be rubbed on the body to confer sacredness onto the subject and to do things such as heal wounds.  While tjuringa was useful to the individual, the clan's collective fate was also considered to be tied up with the items.  After all, it was the totemic image that provided representation for the group on the tjuringa.

The acquisition of sufficient knowledge leading to possession of personal tjurunga was long, difficult and sometimes extremely painful. Practices differed amongst the various groups. [[Ted Strehlow]] describes how the men from the Northern, Southern and Western [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] groups were put on probation for several years after their last [[initiation]]s.

==Ceremonial significance==
The tjurunga were visible embodiments of some part of the [[fertility]] of the great ancestor of the totem in question. The body of the ancestor merely undergoes a transmutation into something that will weather all the assaults of time, change and decay. Stone tjurunga were thought to have been made by the ancestors themselves. The wooden tjurunga made by the old men are symbolical of the actual tjurunga which "cannot be found". These "man-made" tjurunga were accepted without reservation as sacred objects.

At the time of receiving his tjurunga-body a young man may be twenty-five years of age. He will often be thirty-five or forty years of age before the most sacred chants and ceremonies that are linked with it have passed into his possession. As he grows older and continues to demonstrate his worthiness, he receives an ever-increasing share in the tjurunga owned by his own [[totemic]] clan. Eventually he may become a member of the assembly of senior Lawmen who are honoured trustees for the ancient traditions of the whole clan.

In 1933, Strehlow noted that after the advent of white men to Central Australia, the young men employed by the foreign intruders were watched very closely by the old men of their group. In many cases, unless the young men were outstandingly generous in their gifts towards their elders, no ceremonies or chants of power and importance were handed on to this unworthy younger generation. With the death of the old men such chants and ceremonies passed into oblivion.

==Acquisition of knowledge==
The old men would carefully note a young man's conduct. He had to be respectful towards his elders; he had to be attentive to their advice in all things. He would know the value of silence in [[ceremonial]] matters; no account of his past experiences could be spoken within the hearing of women and children. His own marriage had to conform to the laws of the group. One day the old men, sitting in a circle, would call him in to sit down in their midst. They began to chant. One man told Strehlow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The old men seized my hand. They all struck up the chant-verse:

:''With fierce eyes, with glowing eyes, they seize the thumb;&lt;br&gt;'' 
:''With fierce eyes, with glowing eyes, they rip off the nail.''

An old man produced a sharp kangaroo bone (ntjala). He stabbed my thumb with it, pushed the bone deeply underneath the nail. He drew the point out; the rest kept up the chant. He thrust it under the nail in a different place. He gradually loosened the thumbnail. It was slippery with blood. I almost shrieked with pain; the torment was unbearable. I have not forgotten it: the pain was not slight; it was exceedingly great. When the nail had been loosened, he took a sharp opossum tooth, forced it into the living flesh through the base of the thumb-nail, and tore the nail off from behind. Blood spurted over his hand. The man chanted:

:''They rip off the nail, they tear off the nail;&lt;br&gt; ''
:''Blood flows like a river, rushes along like a river.''

Then they seized my left hand and removed the thumb-nail in like manner.

Nowadays we make a great concession to the young men in our group. We no longer tear off their finger-nails. The price is too high; we give the tjurunga to them at a much lower cost. Besides, the young men of the present generation are no longer hardy enough to endure such pain.&lt;ref name=Strehlow/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relationship to historical research==
These sacred relics were of high interest to early European anthropologists and sociologists, who were studying the nature of totemic religion and the sacred.  Scholars such as Spencer, Gillen, Strehlow, Kempe and Durkheim all studied tjurunga. Durkheim discusses the nature of tjurunga throughout his seminal work ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life''.  He considered the tjurunga to be an archetype of the sacred item.

Tonye Princewill started his early education in the United Kingdom, before returning with his parents to Nigeria. In Nigeria, he was enrolled at Hillcrest High School in [[Jos]] from 1976–1980. He then attended Federal Government College ([[Port Harcourt]]) where he obtained his West African Senior Certificate/ General Certificate of Education O'Level in 1985.

Tonye Princewill started off his career with [[Royal Dutch Shell]] as a Reservoir and Well-site Petroleum Engineer. He also worked briefly with the UK's Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. He later moved into private business and established the Riverdrill Group of Companies (Nigeria) where he is chairman.

===Entertainment===
Prince Tonye Princewill is a film producer. He premiered the film [[Kajola]], a film which explored the implications of the continuous neglect of the poor as well as the widening gulf between the rich and poor and the ensuing catastrophic outcomes stemming from such neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/movie/8271/3/kajola-the-most-expensive-film-ever-made-in-nigeri.html//|title=Kajola The Most Expensive Film Ever Made In Nigeria Premiered At The Silver Bird Cinema Abuja On 3oth July, 2010 – Princewill Begs Government, Corporate Nigeria To Invest In Nollywood As A Panacea For Arresting The Malaise Of Unemployment|publisher=Modern Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tonye Princewill also sponsored the premiere of the film [[Nnenda]] which was geared towards creating awareness for the less-privileged in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/252413/nollywood-a-list-stars-grace-red-carpet-as-tonye-princewill.html//|title=Nollywood A-List Stars Grace Red Carpet as Tonye Princewill Hosts Nneda in Lagos and Continues to Spread His Orphanage Awareness Campaign|publisher=Modern Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also premiered other movies such as [[The Figurine]] and [[Valour]], a movie that deals with the [[Niger Delta]] and [[Boko Haram]] issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.akwaibomnewsonline.com/commentary/2013/44-garlands-for-prince-tonye-princewill-at-44.php//|title=44 Garlands for the Indefatigable T.J.T. Princewill @ 44 | publisher=Akwa Ibom News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, he is one of the [[executive producers]] of the first movie in Nigeria on celluloid camera titled [['76 (film)]] hinged and anchored on the coup of 1976 in Nigeria aimed at preserving a remarkable part of Nigeria's history for the incoming generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newafricanpress.com/2013/04/21/the-alluring-narrative-of-tonye-princewill-part2//|title=The Alluring Narrative of Tonye Princewill (Part2)|publisher=The New African Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/why-it-took-seven-years-to-shoot-murtala-muhammed-film-76-tonye-princewill///|title=Why it took seven years to shoot Murtala Muhammed film, ’76 |publisher=The Sun News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Princewill's political career started when he was nominated as the gubernatorial candidate of the [[Action Congress]] for the governorship of [[Rivers State]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2009/09/29/why-i-contested-2007-polls-%E2%80%93princewill/|title=Why I Contested 2007 Polls|publisher=The Tide News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported by the then former Vice-President of Nigeria and the AC Presidential candidate in 2007 elections, [[Atiku Abubakar]] and former Governor of Lagos and National Leader of ACN, Asiwaju [[Bola Tinubu]]. Tonye Princewill's campaign attracted significant grassroots support. He lost the election under contested circumstances to the [[Rivers State People's Democratic Party|People's Democratic Party]]'s candidate, [[Celestine Omehia]].

[[File:TP and Blair2.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Tonye Princewill and Former Britain's Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]] ]]

Tonye Princewill launched a legal challenge against the newly elected governor shortly after the election results were released. He offered evidence to prove to the electoral tribunal that the election was rigged. In a newspaper interview, he alleged that [[Celestine Omehia]] offered him a Naira 1.5 billion (approximately USD 10 million) bribe to withdraw the case before the tribunal, which he rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalmirroronline.net/index.php/politics/35524.html         
|title=Why I rejected N1.5bn bribe from Omehia – Tonye Princewill
|publisher=National Mirror }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a Supreme Court decision to replace [[Celestine Omehia]] with another [[Rivers State People's Democratic Party|People's Democratic Party]] candidate [[Rotimi Amaechi]], he withdrew his case at the tribunal following a local party decision of the [[Action Congress]] in [[Rivers State]], a move which drew criticism from his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Vanguard 
|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tonye Princewill said in a report that "we took the decision at the time that the enemy of your enemy is your friend," noting that he was in battle with [[Celestine Omehia]] and his 'godfather', Dr. [[Peter Odili]], the former governor of [[Rivers State]], when [[Rotimi Amaechi]] was installed by the court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tonye Princewill later led members of the opposition parties in [[Rivers State]] under the banner of the Forum of Organized Opposition Political Parties to form a unity government with Amechi's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tonye Princewill's support of the Amaechi's government received mixed reviews.  Some viewed it with scepticism, while others saw it as necessary for the development and stability of [[Rivers State]]. His announcement in 2010 that he was returning to the People's Democratic Party was controversial and weakened opposition in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Prince Tonye Princewill -Exploratory Comm.ogv|right|thumb|Statement on Political Plans]]

In first months of 2014, after several months of speculation on his political future, Tonye Princewill indicated his interest to succeed [[Rotimi Amaechi]], the current governor of [[Rivers State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Then in April 2014, he announced the formation of an Exploratory Committee to explore the viability of his candidacy of running for governor of [[Rivers State]]. Tonye Princewill was a governorship aspirant candidate for the [[Rivers State People's Democratic Party|People's Democratic Party]], but in November 2014 announced that he had been disqualified on the instruction of Nyesom Wike, former minister of State for Education and fellow Governorship aspirant on the grounds of "not being a PDP member".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tonye Princewill sponsored several baseline studies in 2013, covering the state of education, environment, and health in [[Rivers State]]. In education, research showed that a large number of Model Secondary and Primary Schools were not finished and had been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The management of oil spillages in [[Rivers State]], a catalyst for youth restiveness, was seen as ineffective across local governments in the State. Survey respondents reported that funds which ought to have gone into cleaning and sanitisation of their communities were diverted by local officials. These findings also support press reports about corruption in government allocations to oil producing areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the area of health, there is widespread disenchantment about the lack of improvement within the sector. Weak health service delivery in [[Rivers State]] is forcing many patients to seek medical attention at unregulated traditional medicine shops. Challenges associated to HIV/AIDS, the lack of qualified health professionals, and unfinished health projects, are serious concerns among respondents. These findings substantiate reports in the press that raise questions about the efficacy of funds injected into the sector by the [[Rivers State]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==2015==
[[File:Dublin Web Summit 2015.jpg|thumb|Web Summit, 2015]]
Web Summit 2015 was held over three days from 3 November until the 5 November at the RDS in Dublin. Over 42,000 people attended the event over the three days. Speakers included [[Ed Catmull]] of [[Pixar]], [[Michael Dell]], [[Bill Ford]] and [[Chris Froome]].

In September 2015 Web Summit announced that they would be moving the event from Dublin to Lisbon. Following the announcement organisers released email correspondence between the Irish Government and Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave about hotel costs, traffic and other issues around infrastructure in Dublin. This led to a debate in the Irish media about the support the Government had provided to the event since it began and what future promises they could make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criticism over Government handling of Web Summit grows|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/criticism-over-government-handling-of-web-summit-grows-1.2394418|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems arose with the Wi-Fi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old problems surface one last time at Web Summit|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/old-problems-surface-one-last-time-at-web-summit-1.2416018|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on a lesser scale than in 2014.

==2014==
[[File:Sportsfile (Web Summit) (15711830185) (2).jpg|thumb|Paddy Cosgrave and Taoiseach [[Enda Kenny]] at the 2014 Web Summit]]
Web Summit 2014 was held over three days and consisted of nine stages or Summits as they are known; Centre, Machine, Enterprise, Marketing, Builders, Society, Sport, Film and Music. [[Eva Longoria]], [[Peter Thiel]] and [[Bono]] were among the speakers that spoke over the three-day event, with attendance of 22,000 people from 109 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/web-summit/live-blog-web-summit-2014-30714271.html|title= Live Blog: Web Summit 2014|date=4 November 2014 |work=Irish Independent|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.herald.ie/news/web-summit-guests-to-spend-100m-in-city-30714966.html|title= Web Summit guests to spend €100m in city|date=4 November 2014 |work=Herald|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day 1 there were problems with the [[WiFi]] network and Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave took to the stage on two occasions to apologise for the connectivity problems. The RDS defended their technical set-up with CEO Michael Duffy saying, "The WiFi has successfully responded to the exceptional demands placed on it. This is an unprecedented WiFi density compared to similar European tech events." Attendees were mostly disparaging in their remarks, with some deriding it on social media as "the most Irish thing ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-web-summit-wifi-1762398-Nov2014/|title = 'The most Irish thing ever': WiFi trouble at Dublin's Web Summit|date=4 November 2014|work=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International broadcasters including [[CNBC]], [[CNN]], Fox Business News, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], [[Sky News]]. Al Jazeera and the BBC all covered the event.

After the announcement of the decision to move the 2016 Web Summit to Lisbon, several Irish technology correspondents cited the WiFi debacle as one major push factor behind the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/2015/09/23/web-summit-lisbon-2016|title=Web Summit to move to Lisbon in 2016, cites infrastructure reasons|date=23 Sep 2015|work=Silicon Republic|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/smallbusiness/harsh-reality-for-irish-technology-scene-356186.html|title=Harsh reality for Irish technology scene|work=Irish Examiner|date=28 September 2015|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 4,200 people attended Web Summit, approximately 40% of these came from companies based in Ireland (which provides a European HQ for several major tech companies) and 60% came from companies based elsewhere in Europe. Speakers included [[Tim Armstrong]], [[Wael Ghonim]], and [[Arkady Volozh]].

A number of companies from across the world also launched their new products or made announcements as part of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/20/dublin-web-summit-picks-smartthings-out-of-100-strong-startup-competition/

{{NSA surveillance}}

'''XKeyscore''' ('''XKEYSCORE''' or '''XKS''') is a formerly secret computer system first used by the United States [[National Security Agency]] for searching and analyzing global Internet data, which it collects on a daily basis. The program has been shared with other spy agencies including the [[Australian Signals Directorate]], Canada's [[Communications Security Establishment]], New Zealand's [[Government Communications Security Bureau]], Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters]], Japan's [[Defense Intelligence Headquarters]] and the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]].&lt;ref name="Snowden Interview Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden Interview Transcript |url=http://www.ndr.de/ratgeber/netzwelt/snowden277_page-3.html |publisher=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 |date=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128224439/http://www.ndr.de/ratgeber/netzwelt/snowden277_page-3.html |archivedate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program's purpose was publicly revealed in July 2013, by [[Edward Snowden]] in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[O Globo]]'' newspapers. The code name was already public knowledge because it is mentioned in earlier articles, and like many other code names can also be seen in job postings, and in the online resumes of employees.&lt;ref name =Guardian3&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/nsa-online-metadata-collection|author=[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]]; [[Spencer Ackerman|Ackerman, Spencer]] |date=June 27, 2013|accessdate= August 5, 2013|title = How the NSA Is Still Harvesting Your Online Data – Files Show Vast Scale of Current NSA Metadata Programs, with One Stream Alone Celebrating 'One Trillion Records Processed' | work = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrangeCreatures&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/job-networking-site-linkedin-filled-with-secret-nsa-pro-514057863|title=Job Networking Site LinkedIn Filled With Secret NSA Program Names|author=Layne, Ken|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2014, excerpts of XKeyscore's source code were first published by German [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]], a member of [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]].&lt;ref name=ARD&gt;{{cite news|title=xkeyscorerules100|url=http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/xkeyscorerules100.txt|accessdate=4 July 2014|work=Panorama|publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)]]|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of experts analyzed the source code.&lt;ref name=NDR/&gt;

== Scope and functioning ==
{{Global surveillance}}
XKeyscore is a complicated system, and various authors have different interpretations of its actual capabilities. [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Glenn Greenwald]] explained XKeyscore as being a system which enables almost unlimited [[surveillance]] of anyone anywhere in the world, while the NSA has said that usage of the system is limited and restricted.

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and national security reporter [[Marc Ambinder]], XKeyscore is an NSA data-retrieval system which consists of a series of user interfaces, [[backend database]]s, servers and software that selects certain types of data and metadata that the NSA has already collected using other methods.&lt;ref name=WaPo1&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|title=Newly Declassified Documents on Phone Records Program Released|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/governments-secret-order-to-verizon-to-be-unveiled-at-senate-hearing/2013/07/31/233fdd3a-f9cf-11e2-a369-d1954abcb7e3_story.html|accessdate= August 6, 2013|newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |date= July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =WaPo2&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Is XKeyscore Still Active?

=== According to Snowden and Greenwald ===
On January 26, 2014, the German broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] asked Edward Snowden in its TV interview: "What could you do if you would use XKeyscore?" and he answered:&lt;ref name="Snowden Interview Transcript"/&gt;

{{quote|You could read anyone's email in the world, anybody you've got an email address for. Any website: You can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at: You can watch it. Any laptop that you're tracking: you can follow it as it moves from place to place throughout the world. It's a one-stop-shop for access to the NSA's information.

…You can tag individuals… Let's say you work at a major German corporation and I want access to that network, I can track your username on a website on a form somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends and I can build what's called a fingerprint, which is network activity unique to you, which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, your identity.}}

According to ''The Guardian''{{-'}}s [[Glenn Greenwald]], low-level NSA analysts can, via systems like XKeyscore, "listen to whatever emails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, Microsoft Word documents. And it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst."&lt;ref name="ABCNews20130728" /&gt;

He added that the NSA's databank of collected communications allows its analysts to listen "to the calls or read the emails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing histories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP address do in the future".&lt;ref name="ABCNews20130728"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rea |first=Kari |title=Glenn Greenwald: Low-Level NSA Analysts Have 'Powerful and Invasive' Search Tool |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/glenn-greenwald-low-level-nsa-analysts-have-powerful-and-invasive-search-tool/ |accessdate= August 4, 2013 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date= July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== According to the NSA ===
{{further|SIGINT}}
In an official statement from July 30, 2013, the NSA said "XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign [[signals intelligence]] collection system. [...]" to legally obtain information about "legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests. [...] to collect the information, that enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to protect U.S. and allied troops abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wills|first=Amanda|title=New Snowden Leak: NSA Program Taps All You Do Online|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/31/tech/web/snowden-leak-xkeyscore/|publisher= [[Mashable]] (via [[CNN]]) |accessdate= August 4, 2013|date= August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of access, an NSA press statement reads that there is no "unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks." and that there are "[...]stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. One feature is the system's ability to limit what an analyst can do with a tool, based on the source of the collection and each analyst's defined responsibilities."&lt;ref&gt;NSA [http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2013/30_July_2013.shtml Press Statement on 30 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xkeyscore-hierarchy.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Slide from a 2008 NSA presentation about XKeyscore, showing the query hierarchy.]]

According to an NSA slide presentation about XKeyscore from 2013, it is a "[[Digital Network Intelligence|DNI]] Exploitation System/Analytic Framework". DNI stands for Digital Network Intelligence, which means intelligence derived from internet traffic.&lt;ref name = Guardian2&gt;{{cite news| author = Staff | title=XKeyscore Presentation from 2008 – Read in Full|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/31/nsa-xkeyscore-program-full-presentation|accessdate= August 6, 2013|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Snowden said about XKeyscore: "It’s a front end search engine" in an interview with the German [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden Interview Transcript |url=http://www.ndr.de/ratgeber/netzwelt/snowden277_page-3.html |publisher=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 |date=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128224439/http://www.ndr.de/ratgeber/netzwelt/snowden277_page-3.html |archivedate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

XKeyscore is considered a "passive" program, in that it listens, but does not transmit anything on the networks that it targets.&lt;ref name=NDR&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Jacob Appelbaum]], A. Gibson, J. Goetz, V. Kabisch, L. Kampf, L. Ryge|title=NSA targets the privacy-conscious|url=http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_page-1.html|accessdate=4 July 2014|work=Panorama|publisher=Norddeutscher Rundfunk|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it can trigger other systems, which perform "active" attacks through [[Tailored Access Operations]] which are "tipping", for example, the QUANTUM family of programs, including QUANTUMINSERT, QUANTUMHAND, QUANTUMTHEORY, QUANTUMBOT and QUANTUMCOPPER and [[Turbulence (NSA)|Turbulence]]. These run at so-called "defensive sites" including the [[Ramstein Air Force base]] in Germany, [[Yokota Air Base]] in Japan, and numerous military and non-military locations within the US.

XKeyscore consists of over 700 servers at approximately 150 sites where the NSA collects data, like "US and allied military and other facilities as well as US embassies and consulates" in many countries around the world.&lt;ref name="Infographic"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|date=c. 2013|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/infograficos/big-brother-am-latina/|title=No alvo dos EUA – O big-brother na América Latina e no mundo|trans-title=The U.S. Targets – Big Brother in Latin America and in the World| language = Portuguese | newspaper=[[O Globo]]|accessdate = August 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712225535/http://oglobo.globo.com/infograficos/big-brother-am-latina/| archive-date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Philip Dorling|Dorling, Philip]]|date=July 8, 2013|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/snowden-reveals-australias-links-to-us-spy-web-20130708-2plyg.html|title=Snowden Reveals Australia's Links to US Spy Web|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Globo"&gt;{{cite news|author= [[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]]; Casado, Roberto Kaz e José|date=July 6, 2013|url=  http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/eua-expandem-aparato-de-vigilancia-continuamente-8941149|title=EUA expandem o aparato de vigilância continuamente – Software de vigilância usa mais de 700 servidores espalhados pelo mundo|language= Portuguese |newspaper=''[[O Globo]]''|accessdate= August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the facilities involved in the program are four bases in [[Australia]] and one in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="SMH" /&gt;

According to an NSA presentation from 2008, these XKeyscore servers are fed with data from the following collection systems:&lt;ref name =theweek1&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Marc Ambinder|Ambinder, Marc]]|date=July 31, 2013|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/247684/whats-xkeyscore|title=What's XKEYSCORE? |newspaper=''The Compass'' (blog of ''[[The Week]]'')|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a single, undated slide published by Swedish media in December 2013, the following additional data sources for XKeyscore are mentioned:&lt;ref name="gunnarnsa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunnar Rensfeldt|title=Read the Snowden Documents From the NSA|url=http://www.svt.se/ug/read-the-snowden-documents-from-the-nsa|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''[[Global surveillance#International cooperation|Third party]]''{{snd}} foreign partners of the NSA such as the (signals) intelligence agencies of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, etc.

From these sources, XKeyscore stores "full-take data", which are indexed by plug-ins that extract certain types of metadata (like phone numbers, e-mail addresses, log-ins, and user activity) and index them in metadata tables, which can be queried by analysts. XKeyscore has been integrated with [[MARINA]], which is NSA's database for internet metadata.&lt;ref name = Guardian2/&gt;

However, the system continuously gets so much Internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content data remain on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for up to thirty days.&lt;ref name="documentcloud.org"&gt;See also: [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/894406-nsa-slides-xkeyscore.html 3 slides about the XKeyscore program]&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed commentary on an NSA presentation published in ''The Guardian'' in July 2013 cites a document published in 2008 declaring that "At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours."&lt;ref name =Guardian1&gt;[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]] (July 31, 2013).[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data "XKeyscore: NSA tool collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'{{spaced ndash}} XKeyscore Gives 'Widest-Reaching' Collection of Online Data{{spaced ndash}} NSA Analysts Require No Prior Authorization for Searches{{spaced ndash}} Sweeps Up Emails, Social Media Activity and Browsing History"].

=== Types of XKeyscore ===

According to a document from an internal GCHQ website which was disclosed by the German magazine ''Der Spiegel'' in June 2014, there are three different types of the Xkeyscore system:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-34105.pdf XKeyscoreTabs XKS Development], published by Der Spiegel on June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Traditional''': The initial version of XKeyscore is fed with data from low-rate data signals, after being processed by the WEALTHYCLUSTER system. This traditional version is not only used by NSA but also at many intercept sites of GCHQ.
* '''Stage 2''': This version of XKeyscore is used for higher data rates. The data are first processed by the TURMOIL system, which sends 5% of the internet data packets to XKeyscore. GCHQ only uses this version for its collection under the [[MUSCULAR]] program.
* '''Deep Dive''': This latest version can process internet traffic at data rates of 10 gigabits per second. Data that could be useful for intelligence purposes are then selected and forwarded by using the "GENESIS selection language". GCHQ also operates a number of Deep Dive versions of XKeyscore at three locations under the codename [[TEMPORA]].&lt;ref&gt;Der Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-34103.pdf GCHQ report on the technical abilities of the powerful spying program TEMPORA, which allows for a "full take"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capabilities ===
[[File:KS10-001.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Slide from a 2008 NSA presentation about XKeyscore, showing the differences between the various NSA database systems]]
For analysts, XKeyscore provides a "series of viewers for common data types", which allows them to query terabytes of raw data gathered at the aforementioned collection sites. This enables them to find targets that cannot be found by searching only the metadata, and also to do this against data sets that otherwise would have been dropped by the front-end data processing systems. According to a slide from an XKeyscore presentation, NSA collection sites select and forward less than 5% of the internet traffic to the [[PINWALE]] database for internet content.&lt;ref name="documentcloud.org"/&gt;

Because XKeyscore holds raw and unselected communications traffic, analysts can not only perform queries using "strong selectors" like e-mail addresses, but also using "soft selectors", like keywords, against the body texts of e-mail and chat messages and digital documents and spreadsheets in English, Arabic and Chinese.&lt;ref name = Guardian2/&gt;

This is useful because "a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous" and therefore those activities can't be found by just looking for e-mail addresses of a target. When content has been found, the analyst might be able to find new intelligence or a strong selector, which can then be used for starting a traditional search.&lt;ref name = Guardian2/&gt;

Besides using soft selectors, analysts can also use the following other XKeyscore capabilities:&lt;ref name = Guardian2/&gt;&lt;ref name =ars1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/nsas-internet-taps-can-find-systems-to-hack-track-vpns-and-word-docs/|title=NSA's Internet Taps Can Find Systems to Hack, Track VPNs and Word Docs – X-Keyscore Gives NSA the Ability to Find and Exploit Vulnerable Systems|author=Gallagher, Sean|date=August 1, 2013| publisher = Ars Technica | accessdate= August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Look for the usage of [[Google Maps]] and terms entered into a search engine by known targets looking for suspicious things or places.
* Look for "anomalies" without any specific person attached, like detecting the nationality of foreigners by analyzing the language used within intercepted emails. An example would be a German speaker in Pakistan. The Brazilian paper ''O Globo'' claims that this has been applied to Latin America and specifically to Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Infographic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O Globo"&gt;{{cite web| author = [[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]]; Casado, Roberto Kaz e José |url=http://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/espionagem-dos-eua-se-espalhou-pela-america-latina-8966619|title= Espionagem dos EUA se espalhou pela América Latina – Depois do Brasil, Colômbia foi o país mais vigiado – Venezuela também entrou na mira de programas americanos | trans-title = U.S. Spying Spread Through Latin America – After Brazil, Colombia Was the Country's Most Watched – Venezuela Also Came in the Crosshairs of U.S. Programs| language = Portuguese| work=[[O Globo]]|date=July 13, 2013|accessdate= August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Detect people who use encryption by doing searches like "all [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] usage in Iran". The caveat given is that very broad queries can result in too much data to transmit back to the analyst.
* Showing the usage of [[virtual private network]]s (VPNs) and machines that can potentially be [[hacker (computer security)|hacked]] via [[Tailored Access Operations|TAO]].
* Track the source and authorship of a document that has passed through many hands.
* On July 3, 2014 [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] revealed that XKeyscore is used to closely monitor users of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]],&lt;ref name=NDR /&gt; people who search for privacy-enhancing software on the web,&lt;ref name=NDR /&gt; and readers of ''[[Linux Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/nsa-linux-journal-extremist-forum-and-its-readers-get-flagged-extra-surveillance|date=3 July 2014| title=NSA: Linux Journal is an "extremist forum" and its readers get flagged for extra surveillance|author=Kyle Rankin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' opined in 2013 that most of these things cannot be detected by other NSA tools, because they operate with strong selectors (like e-mail and IP addresses and phone numbers) and the raw data volumes are too high to be forwarded to other NSA databases.&lt;ref name = Guardian2/&gt;

In 2008, NSA planned to add a number of new capabilities in the future, like [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], {{cl-span|more networking protocols|date=May 2014}}, [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] tags, which often include [[geolocation]] ([[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) data.&lt;ref name = Guardian2/&gt;

== Contribution to U.S. security ==
The NSA slides published in ''The Guardian'' during 2013 claimed that XKeyscore had played a role in capturing 300 terrorists by 2008,&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt; which could not be substantiated as the redacted documents do not cite instances of terrorist interventions.

A 2011 report from the NSA unit in the [[Dagger Complex]] (close to [[Griesheim (Hesse)|Griesheim]] in Germany) said that XKeyscore made it easier and more efficient to target surveillance. Previously, analysis often accessed data NSA was not interested in. XKeyscore allowed them to focus on the intended topics, while ignoring unrelated data. XKeyscore also proved to be outstanding for tracking active groups associated with the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] movement in Germany, because it allows for searching on patterns, rather than particular individuals. An analyst is able to determine when targets research new topics, or develop new behaviors.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach and Holger Stark, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/germany-is-a-both-a-partner-to-and-a-target-of-nsa-surveillance-a-916029.html Ally and Target: US Intelligence Watches Germany Closely], August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

To create additional motivation, the NSA incorporated various [[gamification]] features. For instance, analysts who were especially good at using XKeyscore could acquire "skilz" points and "unlock achievements." The training units in Griesheim were apparently successful and analysts there had achieved the "highest average of skilz points" compared with all other NSA departments participating in the training program.&lt;ref name=spiegel1 /&gt;

== Usage by foreign partners of the NSA ==

=== Germany ===
[[File:BND XKeyscore.jpg|thumb|Excerpt of an NSA document leaked by [[Edward Snowden]] that reveals the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]]'s usage of the NSA's '''XKeyscore''' to wiretap a German domestic target.]]

According to documents ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' acquired from Snowden, the German intelligence agencies [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] (foreign intelligence) and [[Bundesverfassungsschutz|BfV]] (domestic intelligence) were also allowed to use the XKeyscore system. In those documents the BND agency was described as the NSA's most prolific partner in information gathering.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;Staff (July 20, 2013). [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agencies-used-nsa-spying-program-a-912173.html "'Prolific Partner': German Intelligence Used NSA Spy Program"]. ''[[Der Spiegel]]''. Retrieved August 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to political confrontations, after which the directors of the German intelligence agencies briefed members of the German parliamentary intelligence oversight committee on July 25, 2013. They declared that XKeyscore has been used by the BND since 2007 and that the BfV has been using a test version since 2012. The directors also explained that the program is not for collecting data, but rather only for the analysis of collected data.&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/07/new-slides-about-nsa-collection-programs.html#xkeyscore New slides about NSA collection programs], July 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===

As part of the [[UKUSA Agreement]], a secret treaty was signed in 1954 by Sweden with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand (called the [[Five Eyes]]) for the purpose of intelligence collaboration and data sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold War treaty confirms Sweden was not neutral|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20131209/secret-cold-war-treaty-confirms-sweden-was-never-neutral|publisher=''[[The Local]]''|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to documents leaked by Snowden, the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|National Defence Radio Establishment]] (FRA) has been granted access to XKeyscore.&lt;ref name=svtsnowd1&gt;{{cite web|author= Gunnar Rensfeldt |title=Read the Snowden Documents From the NSA|url=http://www.svt.se/ug/read-the-snowden-documents-from-the-nsa|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
The classified documents leaked by Snowden also indicate that in April 2013, NSA had secretly provided the XKeyscore system to the [[Japanese government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Ryan Gallagher |title=Japan made secret deals with the NSA that expanded global surveillance|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/04/24/japans-secret-deals-with-the-nsa-that-expand-global-surveillance/|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Y Lle Celf''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] for ''The Art Place'', {{IPA-cy|ə ɬɛ kɛlv}}) is an annual art, craft and architecture exhibition held during the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], claimed to be the biggest temporary art exhibition in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cymrufyw/44522560 |title=The Eisteddfod in English |publisher=BBC Cymru Fyw |date=3 August 2018 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Y Lle Celf is created every year for the duration of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], the country's celebration of Welsh language and culture. The exhibition is organised by the National Eisteddfod and supported by the [[Arts Council of Wales]].&lt;ref name=BBCArts2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesarts/2010/07/y_lle_celf_basement_art_gallery_national_eisteddfod.html |title=Y Lle Celf goes underground for 2010 Eisteddfod |publisher=BBC Wales Arts |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To exhibit in the exhibition, artists and designers must be either born in Wales, have Welsh parents, or have lived or worked in Wales for at least three years prior to the submission deadline, or have the ability to speak, read or write Welsh. In 2010 exhibitors were chosen from 2,500 entries.&lt;ref name=artistsinvited2009&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/artists-invited-submit-work-eisteddfod-2069366 |title=Artists invited to submit work for Eisteddfod open exhibition |work=Wales Online |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty finalists were chosen to exhibit.&lt;ref name=murderportraits2010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-eisteddfod-issues-apology-displaying-2057341 |title=National Eisteddfod issues apology for displaying murder victim portraits |work=Wales Online |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final selection is chosen by a panel of experts.

==Controversies==
In 2012 the Eisteddfod were forced to issue an apology and withdraw four portrait paintings, by artist David Rees Davies, which showed imagery related to a nearby murder of a schoolgirl. One of the paintings appeared to portray the bleeding victim, another showed her killer.&lt;ref name=murderportraits2010 /&gt;

In 2013 the Gold Medal for Fine Art was won by video artist Josephine Sowden, despite her work using English language based gibberish and seemingly flouting a language rule dating back to 1950. The 2013 Ivor Davies Award winner, [[Iwan Bala]], had included English and Spanish text in his paintings, in addition to Welsh. For 2014 entries, application forms drew attention to the language rule, which says any original words in art works must be in Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Huw Thomas |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25628182 | title=Eisteddfod's Welsh language rule could deter artist Josephine Sowden |date=7 January 2014 |work=BBC News |accessdate=7 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It operated into 2012, when it was closed after investigations by the New York State Attorney General over financial issues. The title was coined by Jean, meaning "cry for freedom." It publicized its fundraising to aid victims of the devastating [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], but by February of that year, the ''New York Times'' reported that questions were raised over its finances, and that funds had been used to benefit Jean personally and members of his circle.&lt;ref name="strom"/&gt; The charity is subject to suits in Haiti attempting to recover unpaid debts.&lt;ref name=spendsmuch/&gt;

==History==
Yéle Haiti was founded as a charitable organization by Haitian musician and rapper [[Wyclef Jean]]. Born in Haiti and immigrating with his family to the United States at age nine, he grew up in northern New Jersey. Becoming a [[Grammy Award]]-winning musician and [[rapper]], he has kept family and other ties in Haiti.

The charity was known legally as the Wyclef Jean Foundation and was incorporated in 2001 in the state of [[Illinois]]. After the island suffered damage in 2004's [[Hurricane Jeanne]], the foundation provided scholarships to 3,600 children in [[Gonaïves, Haiti]], with funding from [[Comcel Haiti|Comcel]] telephone service company. Yéle continued to provide scholarships, school funding, meals, and other charitable benefits to citizens of Haiti in the following years.&lt;ref name="strom"/&gt;

The [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] devastated the island and its capital Port-au-Prince. According to Jean, Yéle raised more than $1 million in 24 hours using a plea on Twitter.&lt;ref name="nytTwit"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Burst of Mobile Giving via Cellphone Text Messages Adds Millions in Relief Funds|date=January 15, 2010|author=Jenna Wortham}}&lt;/ref&gt; His foundation raised additional funds after Jean took part in an [[MTV]] donation drive and other publicity efforts to benefit survivors of the earthquake.&lt;ref name="telethon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/details-of-hope-for-haiti-telethon-are-announced|author=David Itzikoff|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 15, 2010|title=Details of "Hope for Haiti" telethon are announced}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with actor and producer [[George Clooney]], Jean organized the "Hope for Haiti Now" telethon. The most watched telethon to date in history, it aired on almost every network and many cable channels.&lt;ref name="mcalister"/&gt; Jean appeared as the last performer on the telethon, singing a medley that ended with Haiti's traditional Rara music.&lt;ref name="mcalister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/elizabeth_mcalister/39|author=Elizabeth McAlister|work=Small Axe |pages =22–38|date=2012|title=Soundscapes of Disaster and Humanitarianism: Survival Singing, Relief Telethons, and the Haiti Earthquake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the earthquake, the Yéle organization donated funds to orphanages, street cleaning crews, hospitals, and medical clinics. It also organized food service to provide hot meals to refugees and victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Beyonce and Madonna Join Hope for Haiti Telethon |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/beyonce-and-madonna-join-hope-for-haiti-telethon/ |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 21, 2010 |first=Ben |last=Sisario}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://3threatmedia.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/wyclef-jean-appeal-following-haiti-earthquake/|title=Wyclef Jean Haiti Earthquake Appeal|date=January 13, 2010|work=3threat Media|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spendsmuch&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/world/americas/quake-hit-haiti-gains-little-as-wyclef-jean-charity-spends-much.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |author=Deborah Sontag |date=October 11, 2012 |title=In Haiti, Little Can Be Found of a Hip-Hop Artists Charity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after Yéle's heavily publicized efforts to raise money for disaster relief, questions were raised beginning in February 2010 about the history and management of the charity. Referring to materials posted during an investigation by [[the Smoking Gun]] website, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the Wyclef Jean Foundation had failed to file required tax returns for 2005, 2006 and 2007 until 2009. It said that by early 2010, returns and records for 2008 had still not been filed with the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. The article, which included allegations by the Smoking Gun of mismanagement of funds, also reported criticism of the foundation by its former executive director, [[Sanjay Rawal]]. He questioned the foundation's ability to handle large projects and criticized its lack of financial controls.&lt;ref name=strom&gt;{{cite news|title=Haitian Quake Brings More Money and Scrutiny to a Charity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/us/05charity.html?pagewanted=all |author=Stephanie Strom |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2012, Yéle Haiti was managed by Rawal, co-founder and former chief executive Hugh Locke, Wyclef Jean (until he resigned after he announced his candidacy in August 2010 for the presidency of Haiti), and former chief executive Derek Q. Johnson. In August 2012, Johnson resigned and announced the closure of the charity. He said in a statement, "As the foundation’s sole remaining employee, my decision implies the closure of the organization as a whole."&lt;ref name=spendsmuch/&gt; Johnson's resignation followed an investigation of the charity by the New York state attorney general, [[Eric T. Schneiderman]]. His office had been conducting settlement talks with Yéle officers over allegations of mismanagement - including improper payments by the charity to Jean, members of his family, and others connected to Jean. A [[forensic audit]] conducted by Schneiderman's office disclosed that in 2010, the year of the earthquake in Haiti, the organization had spent more than $9 million, with half of it for travel by Jean and other representatives, as well as salaries and consultants’ fees, and expenses related to the charity's offices and warehouse. The charity, which remains closed, is the subject of lawsuits in Haiti for unpaid debts.&lt;ref name=spendsmuch/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">'''İbrahim Parlak''' is a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] man who has been accused by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] of being a former member of the [[Kurdistan Workers Party|PKK]]. 

After coming to the U.S. in 1992 and disclosing his past PKK dealings, he was admitted and granted political asylum. However, under pressure on the Clinton Administration from Turkey to support American anti-terrorism efforts, [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] [[Retroactive nomenclature|retroactively]] labeled the PKK a "terrorist organization" in 1997. The charges against him were for lying about not being affiliated with a terrorist group on his asylum application. Despite applying 5 years prior when the PKK was not declared a terrorist organization. Post 9/11, he was taken into custody by the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]] on July 29, 2004. He served 10 months in a Michigan County jail. Parlak subsequently won a writ of [[habeas corpus]] and was released from prison on June 3, 2005. The court had originally decided to deport him based on the government's case; he is currently free pending an appeal of that decision.

On July 17, 2018, an immigration judge ruled that Parlak could retain his American residency per the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Wittkowski|title=Parlak Wins Deportation Case|url=https://www.heraldpalladium.com/news/local/parlak-wins-deportation-case/article_4a3565a3-ea18-5e04-93a0-6d8a9dc6b829.html|work=[[The Herald-Palladium]]|date=2018-07-18|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
