The '''Anti-Racist Action Network''' ('''ARA''') was a [[decentralized]] network of [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascists]] and [[Anti-racism|anti-racists]] in [[North America]] which existed from 1987 until 2013.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} ARA activists [[Community organizing|organize]] actions, including the self-defense &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/better-way|title=A Better Way|publisher=www.splcenter.org|date= |accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to disrupt [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups, and help organize activities against [[Fascism|fascist]] and [[racism|racist]] ideologies. ARA groups also oppose [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], [[heterosexism]], [[anti-immigration]], [[nativism (politics)|Nativism]],  [[anti-Semitism]], and the [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion]] movement. ARA originated from the [[skinhead]] and [[Punk subculture|punk]] [[subculture]]s with influence from [[anarchist]] politics.

==History==

Anti-Racist Action was founded in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], in the late 1980s by members of the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] [[skinhead]] group Minneapolis Baldies, left-wing [[punk rock]] fans, and other activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinheads at Forty |url=http://www.citypages.com/2008-02-20/feature/skinheads-at-forty/ |work=City Pages |publisher=City Pages, LLC |accessdate=29 July 2012 |author=Matt Snyders |date=20 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803021740/http://www.citypages.com/2008-02-20/feature/skinheads-at-forty/ |archivedate=3 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BeinartViolentLeft&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beinhart|first1=Peter|title=The Rise of the Violent Left|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/the-rise-of-the-violent-left/534192/|accessdate=7 August 2017|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARA then expanded to several communities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Members of [[Love &amp; Rage (organization)|Love and Rage]], a [[revolutionary]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organization, played a major role in building ARA groups and the ARA Network in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071227061909/http://www.loveandrage.org/?q=taxonomy%2Fterm%2F27%2F9 Love and Rage Archive, Minneapolis Anti-Racist Action](archive), ''[[Love &amp; Rage (organization)|Love and Rage]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the group's structure was formalized in 1994 at the first Midwest Anti-Fascist Network conference, in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of "Anti-Racist Action"|url=http://antiracistaction.org/history|work=Anti-Racist Action|publisher=The Anti-Racist Action Network|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Racist Action is cited as a precursor to the American movement later known as [[Antifa (U.S.)|Antifa]].&lt;ref name="Bray intro"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Melville House| isbn = 978-1-61219-703-6| last = Bray| first = Mark| title = Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook| date = 2017 |chapter=Introduction |quote=In the United States, most [[antifa groups]] have been anarchist or antiauthoritarian since the emergence of modern antifa under the name Anti-Racist Action (ARA) in the late eighties.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions===

On August 24, 2002, a neo-Nazi demonstration was held in [[Washington, D.C.]], and several ARA affiliates held a counter-demonstration. A melee resulted and 28 ARA activists were arrested. Within about 36 hours, most had been released from jail, and many claimed that they were not [[Miranda rights|properly informed]] about any crime they had allegedly committed until their release, if informed at all. The group became known as the ''Baltimore Anti-Racist 28.'' The charges were eventually dropped, and one of the 28 was not charged with any crime due to her status as a [[Minor (law)|minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support the Baltimore Anti-racist 28 |url=http://baltimore.indymedia.org/newswire/display/1581/index.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310092230/http://baltimore.indymedia.org/newswire/display/1581/index.php |archivedate=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support the Baltimore Anti Racist 28!|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2002/08/29/1440251.php?show_comments=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2005, ARA members participated in a protest in [[Toledo, Ohio]] against the [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] (NSM), in an incident that became known as the [[2005 Toledo Riot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleveland.indymedia.org/news/2005/10/17406_comment.php |title=Call to Action Against Neo-Nazis in Toledo! : Cleveland IMC (((i))) |publisher=Cleveland.indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2010, ARA members scouted downtown Chicago waiting for the "White Pride World Wide" march that was advertised months prior by the Illinois National Socialist Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Alexander |url=http://solidarityanddefense.blogspot.com/2010/03/callout-to-confront-insf-white-pride.html |title=Solidarity &amp; Defense: Callout to Confront INSF 'White Pride World Wide' March in Chicago |publisher=Solidarityanddefense.blogspot.com |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, the INSF had backed out of the march several weeks prior, but four Neo-Nazis were spotted and confronted by anti-fascists. Two members of racist groups were arrested, and a pro-diversity rally was held nearby.

On April 15, 2011, ARA members confronted the National Socialist Movement's annual conference in Pemberton, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle of Pemberton: ARA vs. NSM |url=http://antiracistaction.org/Battle-of-Pemberton |work=Anti-Racist Action |publisher=The Anti-Racist Action Network |accessdate=29 July 2012 |author=Anonymous |date=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310122356/http://antiracistaction.org/Battle-of-Pemberton |archivedate=10 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A melee ensued with reports indicating that four members of the NSM being hospitalized and the conference being shut down. The following day in [[Trenton, NJ]], the NSM Held a 90-minute rally at the Statehouse, which was outnumbered fourfold by anti-racist counter-protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/local/burlington_county_times_news/neo-nazis-opponents-brawl/article_e6d4a41d-5036-5140-bffd-a9ed115bcf11.html |title=Neo-Nazis, opponents brawl |publisher=Burlington County Times www.phillyburbs.com |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525045538/http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/local/burlington_county_times_news/neo-nazis-opponents-brawl/article_e6d4a41d-5036-5140-bffd-a9ed115bcf11.html |archivedate=2012-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2012, up to 20 people wearing masks and black clothes entered the Ashford House Restaurant in Tinley Park (a suburb of Chicago) and attacked white supremacists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police: Mob Attacked Specific Group of People Inside Tinley Park Restaurant |url=http://oaklawn.patch.com/articles/black-hooded-group-attacks-patrons-with-bats-at-tinely-park-restaurant |work=OakLawn Patch |publisher=OakLawn Patch |accessdate=29 July 2012 |author1=Ben Feldheim |author2=Nick Swedberg |author3=Carrie Frillman |author4=Lorraine Swanson |date=19 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190617/http://oaklawn.patch.com/articles/black-hooded-group-attacks-patrons-with-bats-at-tinely-park-restaurant |archivedate=23 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  who were attending the "fifth annual White Nationalist Economic Summit and Illinois White Nationalist Meet-and-Greet", organized by the Wood River-based Illinois European Heritage Association, which claims associations with White News Now and [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]], an Internet forum for white nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bail set for five charged in attack at Tinley Park restaurant|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/crime/12685047-418/bail-set-for-five-charged-in-attack-at-tinley-park-restaurant.html|work=Sun-Times Media|publisher=Sun-Times Media, LLC|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=STEVE METSCH|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five members of Hoosier Anti-Racist Movement, which is part of the Anti-Racist Action Network, were subsequently charged with felony counts of mob action, aggravated battery and criminal damage to property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five charged in mob attack at Tinley Park restaurant|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-five-charged-in-mob-attack-at-tinley-park-restaurant-20120521,0,6533031.story|accessdate=21 May 2012 | work=Chicago Tribune|first=Ashley|last=Rueff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  pleading guilty in 2013 and sentenced to terms ranging from 3 ½ to 6 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=5 plead guilty in anti-racist attack at Tinley Park restaurant |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/tinley-park/chi-5-plead-guilty-in-antiracist-attack-at-tinley-park-restaurant-20130104-story.html|accessdate=27 March 2018 | work=Chicago Tribune| date= 4 January 2013| first=Andy|last=Grimm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4809">The '''Asociación para la Enseñanza de la Mujer''' (Association for the Education of Women) or AEM, was a women's rights organisation active in [[Spain]] from 1870.

It was founded by the progressive educator [[Fernando de Castro (educator)|Fernando de Castro]], professor at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]], in 1870. The purpose of the association was to make higher education available to women. The period between the deposition of queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] in 1868 and the Restoration of 1875 was a time of intense debate over the reformation of society, which also included the issue of women's rights, which was to become the starting point of the Spanish women's movement. In 1869, Fernando de Castro gave a series of lectures on education of women, in which he argued that education should be made available for women so that they too could fulfill their individual potential and help to bring forward the development of Spain in line with more developed Western nations. A popular argument was also that the perceived maternal instincts of women made them better educators. In 1869, he founded the ''Ateneo Artistico Literario y Senoras'', which was split in the ''Escuela de Institutrices'' and the Asociación Nacional de Mujeres Españolas in 1870. [[Concepción Arenal]], often referred to as the first women's rights activist in Spain, and [[Faustina Sáez de Melgar]] was engaged in the AEM from the start, having served in the advisory board of the ''Ateneo Artistico Literario y Senoras''.

The AEM provided lectures to women in various subjects. As the public educational system did not offer women much education, the AM received funds from its sympathizers to create private educational institutions for women. It founded primary and secondary schools for girls as well as professional training schools for women. It founded the ''School of Business for Young Women'' in 1878, and the ''Postal and Telegraph School'' in 1883. It established itself in many different parts of Spain: it was set up in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]] in 1879, [[Málaga]] in 1886, and [[Valencia]] in 1888. From 1880, it was given some government support.

It also agitated through lectures, congresses and publications in favor of access of higher education for women, which was the main focus of the women's rights movement in Spain until the struggle for women suffrage begun around 1920, when [[Asociación Nacional de Mujeres Españolas]] and other suffrage organisations were founded. The AEM had impact on the pedagogic teacher's conferences, and, eventually, on educational reforms. Though individual female students were accepted before, the universities of Spain did not formally open to women until 1910.

'''Barkul''' (Bo-Rukul) is a [[Plateau language]] of [[Nigeria]]. The two dialects, Bo and Rukul, are notably distinct. The classification of Barkul is unclear, but it appears to be closest to [[Fyam language|Fyam]] and [[Horom language|Horom]].

'''Black Canadians''' is a designation used for people of [[Black people|Black African]] descent, who are citizens or permanent residents of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Harrison |first = Faye Venetia|year =2005 |title =Resisting racism and xenophobia : global perspectives on race, gender, and human rights |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-mHGl5HnEBIC&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;ots=4QssZWqzcr&amp;dq=Resisting%20racism%20and%20xenophobia%3A%20global%20perspectives%20on%20race&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0482-4|page=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples"&gt;{{cite book |last = Magocsi |first = Paul Robert |year =1999 |title =Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples  |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Encyclopedia%20of%20Canada%27s%20Peoples&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division |isbn=0-8020-2938-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Black Canadians are of [[Caribbean]] origin, though the population also consists of [[African American]] immigrants and their descendants (including [[Black Nova Scotians]]), as well as many [[Africa]]n immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/tbt/Rp-eng.cfm?A=R&amp;APATH=3&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=01&amp;GID=837928&amp;GK=1&amp;GRP=1&amp;LANG=E&amp;O=D&amp;PID=92333&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=88971%2C97154&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;TABID=1&amp;THEME=80&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|title=2006 Census of Canada – Ethnic Origin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Canadians often draw a distinction between those of [[Afro-Caribbean]] ancestry and those of other African roots. The term '''African Canadian''' is occasionally used by some Black Canadians who trace their heritage to the first slaves brought by British and French colonists to the North American mainland.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples"/&gt; Promised freedom by the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands of [[Black Loyalists]] were resettled by the Crown in Canada afterward, such as [[Thomas Peters (revolutionary)|Thomas Peters]]. In addition, an estimated ten to thirty thousand [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] reached freedom in Canada from the [[Southern United States]] during the antebellum years, aided by people along the [[Underground Railroad]].

Many Black people of Caribbean origin in Canada reject the term African Canadian as an elision of the uniquely Caribbean aspects of their heritage,&lt;ref name=walcott&gt;[[Rinaldo Walcott]], ''Black Like Who?: Writing Black Canada''. 2003, [[Insomniac Press]]. {{ISBN|1-894663-40-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead identify as '''Caribbean Canadian''' ({{lang-fr|Canadien des Caraïbes}}).&lt;ref name=walcott/&gt; Unlike in the United States, where African American has become a widely used term, in Canada controversies associated with distinguishing African or Caribbean heritage have resulted in the term "Black Canadian" being widely accepted there.&lt;ref name=pruegger&gt;"As for terminology, in Canada, it is still appropriate to say Black Canadians." Valerie Pruegger, "Black History Month". ''Culture and Community Spirit'', Government of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Canadians have contributed to many areas of [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosemary Sadlier |url=http://blackhistorycanada.ca/theme.php?id=7 |title=Black History Canada – Black Contributions |publisher=Blackhistorycanada.ca |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the first [[visible minority|visible minorities]] to hold high public offices have been Black, including [[Michaëlle Jean]], [[Donald Oliver]], [[Stanley G.

At times, it has been claimed that Black Canadians have been significantly undercounted in census data. Writer [[George Elliott Clarke]] has cited a [[McGill University]] study which found that fully 43% of all Black Canadians were not counted as black in the 1991 Canadian census, because they had identified on census forms as British, French or other cultural identities which were not included in the census group of Black cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-archive.mcgill.ca/w97/black.htm "The Complex Face of Black Canada"], [[George Elliott Clarke]], ''[[McGill News]]'', Winter 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although subsequent censuses have reported the population of Black Canadians to be much more consistent with the McGill study's revised 1991 estimate than with the official 1991 census data, no recent study has been conducted to determine whether some Black Canadians are still substantially missed by the self-identification method.

==Terminology==
One of the ongoing controversies in the Black Canadian community revolves around appropriate terminologies. Many Canadians of [[Afro-Caribbean]] origin strongly object to the term "African Canadian", as it obscures their own culture and history, and this partially accounts for the term's less prevalent use in Canada, compared to the consensus "African American" south of the border.

[[Black Nova Scotians]], a more distinct cultural group, of whom some can trace their Canadian ancestry back to the 1700s, use both terms, African Canadian and Black Canadian. For example, there is an Office of African Nova Scotian Affairs and a [[Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia]].

"[[Caribbean Canadian]]" is often used to refer to Black Canadians of Caribbean heritage, although this usage can also be controversial because the Caribbean is not populated only by people of African origin, but also includes large groups of [[Indo-Caribbean]]s, [[Chinese Caribbean]]s, European Caribbeans, Syrian or Lebanese Caribbeans, Latinos and [[Amerindians]]. The term "[[West Indian]]" is often used by those of Caribbean ancestry, although the term is more of a cultural description than a racial one, and can equally be applied to groups of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The term "Afro-Caribbean-Canadian" is occasionally used in response to this controversy, although as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}, this term is still not widely seen in common usage.

More specific national terms such as "[[Jamaican Canadian]]", "[[Haitian Canadians|Haitian Canadian]]" or "[[Ghanaian Canadian]]" are also used. As of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}, however, there is no widely used alternative to "Black Canadian" that is accepted by the Afro-Caribbean population, those of more recent African extraction, and descendants of immigrants from the United States as an umbrella term for the whole group.&lt;ref name=pruegger /&gt;

One increasingly common practice, seen in academic usage and in the names and mission statements of some Black Canadian cultural and social organizations but not yet in universal nationwide usage, is to always make reference to both the African and Caribbean communities.&lt;ref&gt;"Black History Month Celebrations in Markham". ''Markham Guiding Star'', 12 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one key health organization dedicated to HIV/AIDS education and prevention in the Black Canadian community is now named the ''African and Caribbean Council on HIV/AIDS in Ontario'', the Toronto publication ''Pride'' bills itself as an "African-Canadian and Caribbean-Canadian news magazine", and [[CKFG-FM|G98.7]], a Black-oriented community radio station in Toronto, was initially branded as Caribbean African Radio Network.&lt;ref name=carnset&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/932525--caribbean-radio-station-set-for-toronto-at-98-7-fm "Caribbean radio station set for Toronto at 98.7 FM"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 2 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[French language|French]], the terms ''noirs canadiens'' or ''afro-canadiens'' are used. ''Nègre'' ("[[Negro]]") is considered derogatory; Quebec film director [[Robert Morin]] faced controversy in 2002 when he chose the title ''[[The Negro (film)|Le Neg']]'' for a film about anti-Black racism,&lt;ref&gt;"Montreal film, Le Neg, stirs up controversy about racism, bigots". [[Canadian Press]], October 21, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in 2015 five placenames containing ''Nègre'' (as well as six that contained the English term "nigger") were changed after the [[Commission de toponymie du Québec]] ruled the terms no longer acceptable for use in geographic names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/11-quebec-sites-that-contain-the-n-word-to-be-renamed-1.3245106 "11 Quebec sites that contain the N-word to be renamed"]. [[CBC News]] Montreal, September 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the more noted aspects of Black Canadian history is that while the majority of African Americans trace their presence in the United States through the history of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], the Black presence in Canada is rooted almost entirely in voluntary immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Pabst. [http://se1.isn.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/47045/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/0173402B-F444-4D5E-9CA6-9F81EA6C23D5/en/AS07.pdf ''"Mama, I'm Walking to Canada": Black Geopolitics and Invisible Empires''].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the various dynamics that may complicate the personal and cultural interrelationships between descendants of the [[Black Loyalist]]s in Nova Scotia, descendants of former American slaves who viewed Canada as the promise of freedom at the end of the [[Underground Railroad]], and more recent immigrants from the Caribbean or Africa, one common element that unites all of these groups is that they are in Canada because they or their ancestors actively chose of their own free will to settle there.&lt;ref name=walcott /&gt;

===First black people in Canada===
[[File:Mathieu da costa.jpg|thumb|[[Mathieu da Costa]], the first recorded free black person to arrive in Canada.]]
The first recorded black person to set foot on land now known as Canada was a free man named [[Mathieu de Costa]]. Travelling with navigator [[Samuel de Champlain]], de Costa arrived in [[Nova Scotia]] some time between 1603 and 1608 as a translator for the French explorer [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts]]. The first known black person to live in what would become Canada was a slave from [[Madagascar]] named [[Olivier Le Jeune]], who may have been of partial [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] ancestry. As a group, black people arrived in Canada in several waves. The first of these came as free persons serving in the [[French Army]] and [[French Navy|Navy]], though some were enslaved or [[indentured servant]]s. About 1,000 slaves were brought to New France in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the British conquest of New France in 1759-1760, there were about 3, 604 slaves of all races in New France, of whom 1, 132 were black.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The majority of the slaves lived in Montreal, the largest city in New France and the center of the lucrative fur trade.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; [[Marie-Joseph Angélique]], a black slave from Portugal who arrived in New France in 1725, was accused of setting the fire that burned down most of Montreal on 10 April 1734, for which she was executed.

===African Americans during the American Revolution===
{{Main|Black Loyalists}}
[[File:Anderson-Ruffin-Abbott.jpg|thumb|[[Anderson Ruffin Abbott]], the first Black Canadian to be a licensed physician, participated in the [[American Civil War]] and attended the deathbed of [[Abraham Lincoln]].]]
At the time of the [[American Revolution]], inhabitants of the United States had to decide where their future lay. Those loyal to the [[British Crown]] were called [[United Empire Loyalists]] and came north. Many [[White American]] Loyalists brought their African-American slaves with them, numbering approximately 2,500 individuals. During the war, the British had promised freedom to slaves who left rebel masters and worked for them; this was announced in Virginia through [[Lord Dunmore's Proclamation]]. Slaves also escaped to British lines in New York City and Charleston, and their forces evacuated thousands after the war. They transported 3,000 to Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/wellington.htm Black History in Guelph and Wellington County] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304140826/http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/wellington.htm |date=4 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bccns.com/ |title=Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia |publisher=Bccns.com |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This latter group was largely made up of merchants and labourers, and many set up home in [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]] near [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]]. Some settled in [[New Brunswick]]. Both groups suffered from discriminatory treatment by white settlers and prominent landowners who still held slaves. Some of the refugees had been free black people prior to the war and fled with the other refugees to Nova Scotia, relying on British promises of equality.  Under pressure of the new refugees, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude black people from practising a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbour, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870, although by then they were largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |title=Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community: Heritage Resources Saint John |publisher=Saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782, the first [[race riot]] in North America took place in [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]]; white veterans attacked African-American settlers who were getting work that the former soldiers thought they should have. Due to the failure of the British government to support the settlement, the harsh weather, and discrimination on the part of white colonists, 1,192 Black Loyalist men, women and children left Nova Scotia for West Africa on 15 January 1792. They settled in what is now [[Sierra Leone]], where they became [[Original Settlers (Freetown)|the original settlers]] of [[Freetown]]. They, along with other groups of free transplanted people such as the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor|Black Poor]] from England, became what is now the [[Sierra Leone Creole people]], also known as the ''Krio''.

Although difficult to estimate due to the failure to differentiate slave and free Black populations, it is estimated that by 1784 there were around 40 Black slaves within Montreal, compared to around 304 slaves within the [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Province of Quebec]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Done with Slavery: the Black fact in Montreal, 1760-1840|last = Mackey|first = Frank|publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 0773535780|location = Montreal|pages = |page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1799, vital records note 75 entries regarding Black Canadians, a number that doubled by 1809.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Maroons from the Caribbean===
On 26 June 1796, [[Jamaican Maroons]], numbering 543 men, women and children, were deported on board the three ships ''Dover'', ''Mary'' and ''Anne'' from Jamaica, after being defeated in an uprising against the British colonial government. Their initial destination was Lower Canada, but on 21 and 23 July, the ships arrived in Nova Scotia. At this time Halifax was undergoing a major construction boom initiated by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]'s efforts to modernize the city's defences. The many building projects had created a labour shortage. Edward was impressed by the Maroons and immediately put them to work at the [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel in Halifax]], Government House, and other defence works throughout the city.

Funds had been provided by the Government of Jamaica to aid in the resettlement of the Maroons in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Grant. ''The Maroons in Nova Scotia''. Halifax: Format Publishing Company Limited, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Five thousand acres were purchased at [[Preston, Nova Scotia]], at a cost of £3000. Small farm lots were provided to the Maroons and they attempted to farm the infertile land. Like the former tenants, they found the land at Preston to be unproductive; as a result they had little success. The Maroons also found farming in Nova Scotia difficult because the climate would not allow cultivation of familiar food crops, such as [[bananas]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[pineapples]] or [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]].  Small numbers of Maroons relocated from Preston to Boydville for better farming land. The British Lieutenant Governor [[John Wentworth (governor)|Sir John Wentworth]] made an effort to change the Maroons' culture and beliefs by introducing them to [[Christianity]]. From the monies provided by the Jamaican Government, Wentworth procured an annual stipend of £240 for the support of a school and religious education.&lt;ref name="Grant_1973"&gt;John N. Grant. "Black Immigrants into Nova Scotia, 1776–1815", ''The Journal of Negro History''. Vol. 58, No. 3 (Jul, 1973). pp. 253–270.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maroons were not interested in converting from their own religion to Christianity. Strong-willed and opinionated people, they refused to work for less money than was paid to white workers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

After suffering through the harsh winter of 1796–97, Wentworth reported the Maroons expressed a desire that "they wish to be sent to [[India]] or somewhere in the east, to be landed with arms in some country with a climate like that they left, where they may take possession with a strong hand".&lt;ref name="Grant_1973"/&gt;{{rp|260}} The British Government and Wentworth opened discussions with the Sierra Leone Company in 1799 to send the Maroons to [[Sierra Leone]]. The Jamaican Government had in 1796 initially planned to send the Maroons to Sierra Leone but the Sierra Leone Company rejected the idea.  The initial reaction in 1799 was the same, but the Company was eventually persuaded to accept the Maroon settlers.  On 6 August 1800 the Maroons departed Halifax, arriving on 1 October at Freetown, Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name="Grant_1973"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/africanns/ch3.asp?Language=English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430151529/http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/africanns/ch3.asp?Language=English|date=30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon their arrival in West Africa in 1800, they were used to quell an uprising among the black settlers from Nova Scotia and London. After eight years, they were unhappy with their treatment by the [[Sierra Reynolds Company]].

===Abolition of slavery===
{{Main|Act Against Slavery}}
[[File:RevJamesMacgregorMonumentPictouNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|Monument in [[Pictou]], [[Nova Scotia]] dedicated to abolitionist [[James Drummond MacGregor]], who helped free [[Black Nova Scotians|Black Nova Scotian]] slaves]]
The Canadian climate made it uneconomic to keep slaves year-round,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osblackhistory.com/underground.php |title=The Underground Rail Road |publisher=Osblackhistory.com |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310115154/http://www.osblackhistory.com/underground.php |archivedate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] agriculture practised in the southern United States and [[Caribbean]]. Slavery within the colonial economy became increasingly rare. Not all owners were white. Some were half-white. For example, the powerful [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] leader [[Joseph Brant]] bought an African American named Sophia Burthen Pooley, whom he kept for about 12 years before selling her for $100.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/queens.htm Black History in Guelph and Wellington County] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206102835/http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/queens.htm |date=6 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drew, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1772, prior to the American Revolution, Britain [[Somerset v Stewart|outlawed the slave trade in the British Isles]] followed by the ''[[Joseph Knight (slave)|Knight v. Wedderburn]]'' decision in Scotland in 1778. This decision, in turn, influenced the colony of Nova Scotia.  In 1788, abolitionist [[James Drummond MacGregor]] from Pictou published the first anti-slavery literature in Canada and began purchasing slaves' freedom and chastising his colleagues in the Presbyterian church who owned slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/macgregor_james_drummond_6E.html "James Drummond MacGregor"], ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790 [[John Burbidge]] freed his slaves.  Led by [[Richard John Uniacke]], in 1787, 1789 and again on January 11, 1808, the Nova Scotian legislature refused to legalize slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Bridglal Pachai &amp; Henry Bishop. ''Historic Black Nova Scotia.'' 2006. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Grant. ''Black Refugees''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Two chief justices, [[Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange]] (1790–1796) and [[Sampson Salter Blowers]] (1797–1832) were instrumental in freeing slaves from their owners in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=3679 Biography.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courts.ns.ca/History_of_Courts/history_noframes/milestones.htm|title=Celebrating the 250th Anniversary of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.|website=courts.ns.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These justices were held in high regard in the colony.

In 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe]], the first [[Lieutenant-Governor]] of [[Upper Canada]], attempted to abolish slavery. That same year, the new Legislative Assembly became the first entity in the [[British Empire]] to restrict slavery, confirming existing ownership but allowing for anyone born to a female slave after that date to be freed at the age of 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/slavery.htm Black History in Guelph and Wellington County] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206102816/http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/slavery.htm |date=6 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was all but abolished throughout the other [[British North America]]n colonies by 1800. The [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807 and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] of 1833 outlawed slave-holding altogether in the colonies (except for India).  This made Canada an attractive destination for many refugees fleeing slavery in the United States, such as minister [[Boston King]].

===War of 1812===
The next major migration of black people occurred between 1813 and 1815. Refugees from the [[War of 1812]], primarily from the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and Georgia [[Sea Islands]], fled the United States to settle in Hammonds Plains, Beechville, [[Lucasville, Nova Scotia|Lucasville]], [[North Preston, Nova Scotia|North Preston]], [[East Preston, Nova Scotia|East Preston]], [[Africville]] and [[Elm Hill, New Brunswick]]. An April 1814 proclamation of Black freedom and settlement by British Vice-Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] led to an exodus of around 3,500 Black Americans by 1818.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10708/11414|title = "We Can Do As We Like Here": An Analysis of Self Assertion and Agency Among Black Refugees in Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1813-1821|last = Whitfield|first = Harvey|date = 2002|journal = Acadiensis|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement of the refugees was initially seen as a means of creating prosperous agricultural communities; however, poor economic conditions following the war coupled with the granting of infertile farmland to refugees caused economic hardship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Social integration proved difficult in the early years, as the prevalence of enslaved Africans in the Maritimes caused the newly freed Black Canadians to be viewed on the same level of the enslaved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Politically, the black Loyalist communities in both Nova Scotia and Upper Canada were characterized by what the historian James Walker called "a tradition of intense loyalty to Britain" for granting them freedom and Canadian blacks tended to be active in the militia, especially in Upper Canada during the War of 1812 as the possibility of an American victory would also mean the possibility of their re-enslavement.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Militarily, a [[Black Loyalist]] named Richard Pierpoint, who was born about 1744 in Senegal and who had settled near present-day [[St. Catharines]], Ontario, offered to organize a Corps of Men of Colour to support the British war effort. This was refused but a white officer raised a small black corps.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; This "Coloured Corps" fought at [[Queenston Heights]] and the siege of [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], defending what would become Canada from the invading American army.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Many of the refugees from America would later serve with distinction during the war in matters both strictly military, along with the use of freed slaves in assisting in the further liberation of African Americans slaves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a sizable community of [[Black Nova Scotians|Black Canadians in Nova Scotia]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and [[Southern Ontario]] who trace their ancestry to African-American slaves who used the [[Underground Railroad]] to flee from the United States, seeking refuge and freedom in Canada. From the late 1820s, through the time that [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the United Kingdom itself forbade slavery in 1833]], until the [[American Civil War]] began in 1861, the Underground Railroad brought tens of thousands of [[fugitive slave]]s to Canada. In 1819, [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|Sir John Robinson]], the Attorney-General of Upper Canada, ruled: "Since freedom of the person is the most important civil right protected by the law of England...the negroes are entitled to personal freedom through residence in Upper Canada and any attempt to infringe their rights will be resisted in the courts".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 93.&lt;/ref&gt; After Robinson's ruling in 1819, judges in Upper Canada refused American requests to extradite run-away slaves who reached Upper Canada under the grounds "every man is free who reaches British ground".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; One song popular with African-Americans called the ''[[Song of the Free]]'' had the lyrics: "I'm on my way to Canada, That cold and distant land, The dire effects of slavery, I can no longer stand, Farewell, old master, Don't come after me, I'm on my way to Canada, Where colored men are free!".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, the United States Congress passed the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], which gave bounty hunters the right to recapture run-away slaves anywhere in the United States and ordered all federal, state and municipal law enforcement to co-operate with the bounty hunters in seizing run-away slaves.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 32"&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Fugitive Slave Act stripped accused fugitive slaves of any legal rights such as the right to testify in court that they were not run-away slaves, cases of freemen and freewomen being kidnapped off the streets to be sold into slavery become common.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 32"/&gt; The U.S justice system in the 1850s was hostile to black people, and little inclined to champion their rights. In 1857, in the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that black Americans were not and never could be U.S. citizens under any conditions, a ruling that appeared to suggest that laws prohibiting slavery in the northern states were unconstitutional. As a result of the Fugitive Slave Act and legal rulings to expand slavery in the United States, many free blacks living in the United States chose to seek sanctuary in Canada with one newspaper in 1850 mentioning that a group of blacks working for a Pittsburgh hotel had armed themselves with handguns before heading for Canada saying they were "...determined to die rather be captured".&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 32"/&gt; The ''Toronto Colonist'' newspaper on 17 June 1852 noted that almost every ship or boat coming into Toronto harbor from the American side of Lake Ontario seemed to be carrying a run-away slave.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 32"/&gt; One of the more active "conductors" on the Underground Railroad was [[Harriet Tubman]], the "Black Moses" who made 11 trips to bring about 300 run-away slaves to Canada, most of whom settled in St. Catherines.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Tubman guided her "passengers" on nocturnal journeys (travelling via day was too risky) through the forests and swamps, using as her compass the north-star and on cloudy nights seeing what side the moss was growing on trees, to find the best way to Canada.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 38"&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Such trips on the Underground Railroad involved much privation and suffering as Tubman and her "passengers" had to avoid both the bounty-hunters and law enforcement and could go for days without food as they travelled through the wilderness, always following the north-star.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 38"/&gt; Tubman usually went to Rochester, New York, where Frederick Douglass would shelter the run-aways and crossed over to Canada at Niagara Falls.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the U.S. customs, which under the Fugitive Slave Act had to co-operate with the bounty hunters, the customs authorities on the Canadian side of the border were far more helpful and "looked the other way" when Tubman entered Canada with her "passengers".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Samuel Ward.jpg|thumb|200px|Rev. Samuel Ringgold Ward, c.1855. Ward had been forced to flee to Canada West in 1851 to escape charges of violating the Fugitive Slave Act by helping a run-away slave escape to Canada.]]
During the course of one week in June 1854, 23 run-away slaves evaded the U.S border patrols to cross the Detroit river to freedom in Windsor while 43 free people also crossed over to Windsor out of the fear of the bounty hunters.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 32"/&gt; The American-born Canadian historian [[Daniel G. Hill]] wrote this week in June 1854 appeared to be typical of the black exodus to Canada.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 32"/&gt; Public opinion tended to be on the side of run-away slaves and against the slavers. On 26 February 1851, the Toronto chapter of the Anti-Slavery Society was founded with what was described by the ''Globe'' newspaper as "the largest and most enthusiastic meeting we have ever seen in Toronto" that issued the resolution: "slavery is an outrage on the laws of humanity and its continued practice demands the best exertions for its extinction".&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 20"&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The same meeting committed its members to help the many "houseless and homeless victims of slavery flying to our soil".&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 20"/&gt; The Congregationalist minister, the Reverend [[Samuel Ringgold Ward]] of New York, who had been born into slavery in Maryland, wrote about Canada West (modern Ontario) that: "Toronto is somewhat peculiar in many ways, anti-slavery is more popular there than in any city I know save Syracuse...I had good audiences in the towns of Vaughan, Markham, Pickering and in the village of Newmarket. Anti-slavery feeling is spreading and increasing in all these places. The public mind literally thirsts for the truth, and honest listeners and anxious inquirers will travel many miles, crowd our country chapels, and remain for hours eagerly and patiently seeking the light".&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 20"/&gt; Ward himself had been forced to flee to Canada West in 1851 for his role in the [[Jerry Rescue]], leading to his indictment for violating the Fugitive Slave Act. Despite the support to run-away slaves, blacks in Canada West, which become Ontario in 1867, were confided to segregated schools.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

American bounty-hunters who crossed into Canada to kidnap black people to sell into slavery were prosecuted for kidnapping if apprehended by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, an attempt by two American bounty hunters, T.G. James and John Wells, to kidnap Joseph Alexander, a 20-year old run-away slave from New Orleans living in Chatham, was foiled when a large crowd of black people surrounded the bounty hunters as they were leaving the Royal Exchange Hotel in Chatham with Alexander who had gone there to confront them.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 43"&gt;Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Found on one of the bounty hunters was a letter from Alexander's former master describing him as a slave of "saucy" disposition who had smashed the master's carriage and freed a span of his horses before running away, adding that he was keen to get Alexander back so he could castrate him.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 43"/&gt; Castration was the normal punishment for a male run-away slave. Alexander gave a speech to the assembled by-standers watching the confrontation denouncing life in the "slave pens" of New Orleans as extremely dehumanizing and stated he would rather die than return to living as a slave.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 43"/&gt; Alexander described life in the "slave pens" as a regime of daily whippings, beatings and rapes designed to cow the slaves into a state of utter submission. The confrontation ended with Alexander being freed and the crowd marching Wells and James to the railroad station, warning them to never return to Chatham.&lt;ref name="Hill, Daniel page 43"/&gt;     
[[Image: William Hall VC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|William Hall of Nova Scotia was the first black man to win the Victoria Cross]]
The refugee slaves who settled in Canada did so primarily in South Western Ontario, with significant concentrations being found in Amherstburg, Colchester, Chatham, Windsor, and Sandwich. Run-away slaves tended to concentrate, partly to provide mutual support, party because of prejudices, and partly out of the fear of American bounty hunters crossing the border.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The run-away slaves usually arrived destitute and without any assets, had to work as laborers for others until they could save up enough money to buy their own farms.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; These settlements acted as centres of abolitionist thought, with Chatham being the location of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] constitutional convention which preceded the later raid on [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals2.scholarsportal.info/pdf/14788810/v08i0002/165_oocaotcf.xml|title = Out of Chatham: Abolitionism on the Canadian frontier|last = Heike|first = Paul|date = 2011|journal = Atlantic Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the first newspaper published by a black woman was founded in North Buxton by the free Black [[Mary Ann Shadd]] which pressed for Black emigration to Canada as the best option for fleeing African Americans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The settlement of [[North Buxton|Elgin]] was formed in 1849 with the royal assent of Governor-General of the time [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|James Bruce]] as a settlement for Black Canadians and escaped slaves based upon social welfare and the prevention of moral decay among the Black community there. Led by the Elgin Association and preacher William King, the settlement flourished as a model of a successful predominantly African settlement which held close to 200 families by 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 'Whatever you Raise in the ground you can sell it in Chatham': Black Women in Buxton and Chatham, 1850-1865|last = Bristow|first = Peggy|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 1994|isbn = 0802068812|location = Toronto|pages = 75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Slavery Society of Canada estimated in its first report in 1852 that the "coloured population of Upper Canada" was about 30,000, of whom almost all adults were "fugitive slaves" from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the author's preface to ''The Refugee'', Drew, 1856, available here [https://books.google.com/books?id=BEo-x8q9hKEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:A+intitle:North-side+intitle:View+intitle:of+intitle:Slavery&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPR1,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Catharines]], Ontario had a population of 6,000 at that time; 800 of its residents were "of African descent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BEo-x8q9hKEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:A+intitle:North-side+intitle:View+intitle:of+intitle:Slavery&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPR1,M1 |title=p17 of '&amp;#39;The Refugee'&amp;#39;, Drew, 1856, available here |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many slaves sought refuge in Toronto which was known as a tolerant city.  Black Canadians integrated in many areas of society, but the influence of slavery in the south still impacted these citizens.  James Mink, an African Canadian who married his daughter to a white man, had his daughter sold into slavery during their honeymoon in the Southern States.  She was freed after a large sum of money was paid and this behaviour was characterized as "a villainy that we are pleased to say characterizes few white [Toronto] men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 26: Robert Beard's Hotel |url= http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/robert-beards-hotel/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Coast===
In 1858, [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]], the governor of the British colony of [[Vancouver Island]], replied to an inquiry from a group of black people in San Francisco about the possibilities of settling in his jurisdiction. They were angered that the California legislature had passed discriminatory laws to restrict black people  in the state, preventing them from owning property and requiring them to wear badges. Governor Douglas, whose mother was a "free coloured" person of mixed black and white ancestry from the Caribbean,&lt;ref name=adams&gt;[[John Adams]], ''Old Square-Toes and His Lady: The Life of James and Amelia Douglas.''. 2001, [[Horsdal and Schubert]]. {{ISBN|192697171X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; replied favourably. Later that year, an estimated 600 to 800 black Americans migrated to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], settling on Vancouver Island and Salt Spring Island. At least two became successful merchants there: Peter Lester and [[Mifflin Wistar Gibbs]]. The latter also entered politics, being elected to the newly established City Council in the 1860s.

Gibbs returned to the United States with his family in the late 1860s after slavery had been abolished following the war; he settled in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], the capital of the state. He became an attorney and was elected as the first black judge in the US. He became a wealthy businessman who was involved with the Republican Party; in 1897 he was appointed by the President of the US as consul to Madagascar.

===Immigration restrictions===
In the early twentieth century, the Canadian government had an unofficial policy of restricting immigration by black people. The huge influx of immigrants from Europe and the United States in the period before World War I included few black people, as most immigrants were coming from Eastern and Southern Europe.

[[Clifford Sifton]]'s 1910 immigration campaign had not anticipated that black Oklahomans and other black farmers from the Southern United States would apply to homestead in [[Amber Valley, Alberta]] and other parts of Canada.

However, Canada acted to restrict immigration by black persons, a policy that was formalised in 1911 by Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;His excellency in Council, in virtue of the provisions of Sub-section (c) of Section 38 of the Immigration Act, is pleased to Order and it is hereby Ordered as follows: For a period of one year from and after the date hereof the landing in Canada shall be and the same is prohibited of any immigrants belonging to the Negro race, which race is deemed unsuitable to the climate and requirements of Canada.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(Compare with the [[White Australia policy]].)&lt;br /&gt;

The flow between the United States and Canada continued in the twentieth century. Some Black Canadians trace their ancestry to people who fled racism in [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and other southern states in the early 1900s as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the rural South, building new homesteads and communities &amp;ndash; often [[block settlements]] &amp;ndash; in [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] just after they became provinces in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abheritage.ca/pasttopresent/settlement/black_settlers.html Settlement – New Communities – Black Settlers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227052353/http://www.abheritage.ca/pasttopresent/settlement/black_settlers.html |date=27 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Amber Valley, Alberta|Amber Valley]],  [[Campsie, Alberta|Campsie]], [[Wildwood, Alberta#History|Junkins (now Wildwood)]] and [[Breton, Alberta|Keystone (now Breton)]] in Alberta, as well as a former community in the [[Rural Municipality of Eldon No. 471|Rural Municipality of Eldon]], north of [[Maidstone, Saskatchewan]] (see, for example, Saskatchewan Municipal Heritage Property No. 439: the original log-style Shiloh (Charlow) Baptist Church and associated cemetery, 30&amp;nbsp;km north of Maidstone.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=4207 |title=Charlow (Shiloh) Baptist Church and Cemetery |work=[[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] |publisher=[[Parks Canada]]|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lloydminstersource.com/articles/article/2016-09-15-shiloh-church-still-calls-em-in-after-more-than-100-years |title=Shiloh church still calls 'em in after more than 100 years |author=Submitted |work=[[Lloydminster#Media|Lloydminster Source]] |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~dsucha/shiloh.html |title=Shiloh Baptist Church Cemetery |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them were disappointed to encounter racism when they arrived in Canada, which they had regarded as a kind of [[Promised Land]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/stopracism/alberta's%20Black%20Pioneers.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120214607/http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/stopracism/alberta%27s%20Black%20Pioneers.htm|date=20 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, black Canadians, being descended from either black Loyalists or American run-away slaves, had supported the Conservative Party as the party most inclined to maintain ties with Britain, which was seen as the nation that had given them freedom.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The Liberals were historically the party of continentalism (i.e moving Canada closer to the United States), which was not an appealing position for most black Canadians. In the first half of the 20th century, black Canadians usually voted solidly for the Conservatives as the party seen as the most pro-British.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Until the 1930s-1940s, the majority of black Canadians lived in rural areas, mostly in Ontario and Nova Scotia, which provided a certain degree of insulation from the effects of racism.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The self-contained nature of the rural black communities in Ontario and Nova Scotia with black farmers clustered together in certain rural counties meant that racism was not experienced on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The center of social life in the rural black communities were the churches, usually Methodist or Baptist, and ministers were generally the most important community leaders.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Through anti-black racism did exist in Canada, as the black population in Canada was extremely small, there was nothing comparable to the massive campaign directed against Asian immigration, the so-called "[[Yellow Peril]]", which was a major political issue in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Peter "Black Horror on the Rhine": Idealism, Pacifism, and Racism in Feminism and the Left in the Aftermath of the First World War" pages 471-493 from ''Social History'', Volume 47, Number 94, June 2014 pages 482-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in April 1920 with a series of articles by the left-wing British journalist E.D. Morel detailing alleged sexual crimes committed by the Senegalese serving in the French Army in the Rhineland, various left-wing groups in Britain, the United States and Canada started publicizing the so-called "[[Black Horror on the Rhine]]".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Peter "Black Horror on the Rhine": Idealism, Pacifism, and Racism in Feminism and the Left in the Aftermath of the First World War" pages 471-493 from ''Social History'', Volume 47, Number 94, June 2014 pages 477-482.&lt;/ref&gt; Morel's campaign was carried into Canada with the feminist [[Rose Henderson]] for instance warning in a 1925 article in ''The BC Federalist'' about the possibility of blacks being raised  "to subdue and enslave the white peoples"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Peter "Black Horror on the Rhine": Idealism, Pacifism, and Racism in Feminism and the Left in the Aftermath of the First World War" pages 471-493 from ''Social History'', Volume 47, Number 94, June 2014 page 492.&lt;/ref&gt; The willingness of various left-wing groups in Canada to promote the "Black Horror on the Rhine" campaign as part of the critique of the Treaty of Versailles as too harsh on Germany-which appealed to the worse racial fears by promoting the image of the Senegalese as brutes with superhuman strength and an insatiable need to rape white women-estranged black Canadians from the left in Canada during the interwar period. Another source of estrangement was the work of one of Canada's leading progressives, the feminist [[Emily Murphy]]. In a series of articles for ''Maclean's'' in the early 1920s, which were later turned into the 1922 book ''The Black Candle'', Murphy blamed all of the problems on drug addiction amongst white Canadians on "Negro drug dealers" and Chinese opium dealers "of fishy blood", accusing black Canadians and Chinese Canadians of trying to destroy white supremacy by getting white Canadians addicted to drugs.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Black Candle'' was written in a sensationalist and lurid style meant to appeal to the racial fears of white Canadians, and in this Murphy was completely successful.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"/&gt; Due to the popularity of ''The Black Candle'', Chinese immigration to Canada was stopped via the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923.  Marijuana was also banned in 1923 out of the fear prompted by Murphy that marijuana was a drug used by black Canadians to "corrupt" white Canadians.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"/&gt; A report by the Senate in 2002 noted: "Early drug legislation was largely based on a moral panic, racist sentiment and a notorious absence of debate."&lt;ref name="MacQueen"/&gt; Perhaps even more importantly, Murphy established a perceived connection between black Canadians, drugs, and crime in the minds of white Canadians that continues to this day.

Montreal was the largest and most wealthiest city in Canada in the 1920s and also the most cosmopolitan, having a French-Canadian majority with substantial English, Scots, Irish, Italian, and Jewish communities. The multi-cultural atmosphere in Montreal allowed a black community to be established in the 1920s. The black community that emerged in Montreal in the 1920s was largely American in origin, centering around the "sporting district" between St. Antoine and Bonaventure streets, which had a reputation as a "cool" neighborhood, known for its lively and often riotous nightclubs that opened at 11:00 pm and closed at 5:00 am, where the latest in Afro-American jazz was played, alcohol was consumed in conspicuous quantities, and illegal gambling was usually tolerated.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 333-334"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 333-334.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nemderloc Club  (nemderloc being "colored men" spelled backwards), which opened in 1922, was the most famous black club in Montreal, being very popular with both locals and Americans seeking to escape Prohibition by coming to Canada, where alcohol was still legal, hence the saying that American tourists wanted to "drink Canada dry".&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 333"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Afro-Americans who settled in the "sporting district" of Montreal came from Harlem to seek a place where it was legal to drink alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 333&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the police and the black community in Montreal were unfriendly with the St. Antoine district being regularly raided by the police looking for illegal drugs and gambling establishments.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 333-334"/&gt; Despite its reputation as the "coolest" neighborhood in Montreal, the St. Antoine neighborhood was a center of poverty with the water being unsafe to drink and a death rate that was twice the norm in Montreal.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 333"/&gt;

As the Afro-Americans who came to work as railroad porters in Canada were all men, about 40% of the black men living in Montreal in the 1920s were married to white women.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 333"/&gt; This statistic excluded those in common-law relationships, which were also common, and which estranged the black community of Montreal from the conservative and deeply Christian rural black communities in Ontario and Nova Scotia, who were offended by the prevalence of casual sex and common-law relationships in the black community in Montreal.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 334"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The Afro-American community in Montreal was seen, perhaps not entirely fairly, as a center of debauchery and licentiousness by the other black communities in Canada, who made a point of insisting that Montreal was not all representative of their communities.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 334"/&gt;  The West Indian communities in the Maritime provinces, with the largest number working in the Cape Breton steel mills and in the Halifax shipyards always referred pejoratively to the older black community in Nova Scotia as the "Canadians" and the black communities in Quebec and Ontario as the "Americans".&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 334"/&gt; The West Indian communities in Nova Scotia in the 1920s were Anglican, fond of playing cricket, and unlike the other black communities in Canada were often involved in Back-to-Africa movements.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 334"/&gt;

The historian Robin Winks described the various black Canadian communities in the 1920s as being very diverse, which he described as being made up of "...rural blacks from small towns in Nova Scotia, prosperous farmers from Ontario, long-time residents of Vancouver Island, sophisticated New York newcomers to Montreal, activist West Indians who were not, they insisted, Negroes at all"-indeed so diverse that unity was difficult.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 335"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 335.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Winks wrote that racism in Canada lacked a "consistent pattern" as "racial borders shifted, gave way, and stood firm without consistency, predictability or even credibility".&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 335"/&gt; Inspired by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the United States, in 1924 J.W. Montgomery of Toronto and James Jenkins of London founded the Canadian League for the Advancement of Colored People as an umbrella group for all of the Canadian black communities.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 335"/&gt; Another attempt to provide unity for the black communities in Canada was made by the followers of [[Marcus Garvey]]'s United Negro Improvement Association, which opened its first Canadian branch in Montreal in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; After his deportation from the United States in 1927, Garvey settled in Montreal in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 415.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Garvey urged his American followers not to vote for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election, the American consul in Montreal complained about this "interference" in American politics and Garvey was expelled from Canada at the urging of the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 415-416.&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey was allowed to return to Canada in 1936 and 1937 where he held rallies in Toronto preaching his Back-to-Africa message.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 416"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey, an extremely charismatic man who inspired intense devotion in his followers, proved to be a divisive and controversial figure with his Back-to-Africa message and his insistence that black people embrace segregation as the best way forward.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 416"/&gt; Most black Canadian community leaders rejected Garvey's message, arguing that Canada, not Africa, was their home and that embracing segregation was a retrogressive and self-defeating move.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 416"/&gt;

The Great Depression hit rural Canada very hard and black Canadian farmers especially hard.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; One consequence was that many of the black Canadian villages and hamlets in Ontario and Nova Scotia, some which were founded in the 18th century as Loyalist settlements, became abandoned as their inhabitants moved to the cities in search of work.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In turn, the movement of black Canadians to the cities brought them brutally face to face with racism as a series of informal "Jim Crow" restrictions governed restaurants, bars, hotels, and theaters while many landlords refused to rent to black tenants.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 pages 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1937, when a black man purchased a house in [[Trenton, Nova Scotia]], hundreds of white people stormed the house, beat up its owner and destroyed the house under the grounds that a black man moving into the neighborhood would depress property values.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the unwillingness of the police to protect a black man, the mob then destroyed two other homes owned by black men, an action praised by the mayor for raising property values in Trenton, and the only person charged by the police was a black man who punched out a white trying to destroy his home.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 419-420.&lt;/ref&gt; Many black Nova Scotians moved into a neighborhood of Halifax that came to be known as Africville, which the white population of Halifax called "Nigger Town".&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 420"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 420.&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation in Truro, Nova Scotia was practiced so fiercely that its black residents took to calling it "Little Mississippi".&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 420"/&gt; The 1930s saw a dramatic increase in the number and activities of black self-help groups to deal with the impact of racism and the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 411-414.&lt;/ref&gt; Another change wrought by the Depression was a change in black families as most married black women had to work in order to provide for their families, marking the end of an era when only the husband worked.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Second World War, black volunteers to the armed forces were initially refused, but the Canadian Army starting in 1940 agreed to take black volunteers, and by 1942 were willing to give blacks officers' commissions.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 421"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in World War I, there were no segregated units in the Army and Canadian blacks always served in integrated units.&lt;ref name="veterans.gc.ca"/&gt; The Army was rather more open to black Canadians rather than the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which both refused for some time to accept black volunteers.&lt;ref name="veterans.gc.ca"/&gt; By 1942, the RCN had accepted Canadian blacks as sailors while the RCAF had accepted blacks as ground crews and even as airmen, which meant giving them an officer's commission as in the RCAF airmen were always officers.&lt;ref name="veterans.gc.ca"/&gt; In 1942, newspapers gave national coverage when the five Carty brothers of Saint John, New Brunswick all enlisted in the RCAF on the same day with the general subtext being that Canada was more tolerant than the United States in allowing the black Carty brothers to serve in the RCAF.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 421"/&gt; The youngest of the Carty brothers, Gerald Carty, served as a tail gunner on a Halifax bomber, flying 35 missions to bomb Germany and was wounded in action.&lt;ref name="Profiles in Courage"/&gt; The mobilization of the Canadian economy for "total war" gave increased economic opportunities for both black men and even more so for black women, many of whom for the first time in their lives found well-paying jobs in war industries.&lt;ref name="veterans.gc.ca"/&gt;

In general racism became less fashionable during World War II with two incidents in 1940 illustrating a tendency towards increased tolerance as feelings of wartime national solidarity made display of prejudice less acceptable.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 420"/&gt; A Vancouver bar that refused to serve a black man was fined by a judge when the said man complained while in Toronto a skating rink that turned away blacks found itself the object of a boycott and demonstrations by students from the University of Toronto until the owners of the rink finally agreed to accept black patrons.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 420"/&gt; The incidents in Toronto and Vancouver, as small as they were, would have been inconceivable ten or even five years before.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 420"/&gt; Winks wrote that if the Second World War was not the end of racism in Canada, but it was the beginning of the end as for the first time that many practices that been considered normal were subject to increasing vocal criticism as many black Canadians started to become more assertive.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 420"/&gt;

In 1942, following complaints from black university graduates that the National Selective Service board assigned them inferior work, a campaign waged by the ''Globe &amp; Mail'' newspaper, the Canadian Jewish Congress, and the ''Winnipeg Free Press'' won a promise from the National Selective Service board to stop using race when assigning potential employees to employers.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 423"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 423.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, unions became more open to accepting black members and Winks wrote the "most important change" to black Canadian community caused by World War II was "the new militancy in the organized black labor unions".&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 423"/&gt; The most militant black unions was the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which during the war won major wage increases for black porters working on the railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 424-425.&lt;/ref&gt; In Winnipeg, a Joint Labor Committee to Combat Racial Intolerance was formed to end discrimination against Jews and Ukrainian-Canadians, but soon agreed to take cases concerning black Canadians.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 423"/&gt; In 1944, Ontario passed the Racial Discrimination Act, which banned the use of any symbol or sign by any businesses with the aim of racial discrimination, which was the first law in Canada intended to address the practice of many businesses of refusing to take black customers.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 427"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Viola Desmond.jpg|thumb|left|Viola Desmond. In 1946, her decision to sit in the whites only section of a theater in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia led to her convicted in a controversial case, for which was pardoned for in 2010.]]

In 1946, a black woman from Halifax, [[Viola Desmond]], watched a film in a segregated cinema in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, which to her being dragged out of the theater by the manager and a policeman and to her being fined for not paying the one cent difference in sales tax between buying a ticket in the white section, where she sat, and the black section, where she was supposed to sit.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Desmond case attracted much publicity as various civil rights groups rallied in her defense. Desmond fought the fine in the appeals court, where she lost, but the incident led the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Colored People to pressure the Nova Scotia government to pass the Fair Employment Act of 1955 and Fair Accommodations Act of 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Following more pressure from black Canadian groups, in 1951 Ontario the Fair Employment Practices Act outlawing racial discrimination in employment and the Fair Accommodation Practices Act of 1955.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 427"/&gt; In 1958, Ontario established the Anti-Discrimination Commission, which was renamed the Human Rights Commission in 1961.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 427"/&gt; Led by the American-born black sociologist [[Daniel G. Hill]], the Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission investigated 2, 000 cases of racial discrimination in first two years, and was described as having a beneficial effect on the ability of Canadian blacks to obtain employment.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 428"&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 428.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Manitoba passed the Fair Employment Act, which was modeled after the Ontario law, and New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and British Columbia passed similar laws in 1956, followed by Quebec in 1964.&lt;ref name="Winks, Robin page 428"/&gt; 

In March 1960, in the Sharpeville massacre, the South African police gunned 67 black South Africans protesting ''apartheid'', which in sign of changing racial attitudes, caused much controversy in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 446.&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable public pressure on the Prime Minister John Diefenbaker to ask for South Africa to be expelled from the Commonwealth following the Sharpeville massacre with many noting that the South African prime minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] was an admirer of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 446-447.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conference of Commonwealth prime ministers in London in 1960, Diefenbaker tried to avoid discussing the subject of expelling South Africa, but at the next conference in London in 1961, he played a leading role in passing a resolution declaring racial discrimination incompatible with Commonwealth membership, which led to Verwoerd storming of the conference and quitting the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 447-448.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of condemning South Africa for ''apartheid'' benefited the black Canadians since it suggested that racism was not longer acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 20th century and early 21st century===
Canada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial rules were eliminated from the immigration laws. This coincided with the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] in the Caribbean. By the mid-1960s, approximately 15,000 Caribbean immigrants had settled in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/15385/16525#re1no2 "Confederation’s Casualties: The "Maritimer" as a Problem in 1960s Toronto"], ''Acadiensis.'' Retrieved 2014-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbeans arrived, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Between 1950 and 1995, about 300,000 people from the West Indies settled in Canada.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Outside of the Maritime provinces, where the majority of the black population are the descendants of black Loyalists and American runaway slaves, the majority of black Canadians are descended from immigrants from the West Indies.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada;&lt;ref name=canada/&gt; they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. About 150,000 people from Africa immigrated to Canada between 1950 and 1995.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

However, a sizable number of Black Canadians who descend from freed American slaves can still be found in Nova Scotia and parts of [[Southwestern Ontario]]. Some descendants of the freed American slaves, many of whom were of mixed race descent, have mixed into the white Canadian community and have mostly lost their ethnic identity. Some descendants returned to the United States. [[Bangor, Maine]], for example, received many Black Canadians from the Maritime provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?dest=9999999997&amp;product_id=4029034 |title=Black Bangor: African Americans in a Maine Community, 1880–1950 – Wal-Mart |publisher=Walmart.com |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Like other recent immigrants to Canada, Black Canadian immigrants have settled preferentially in provinces matching the language of their country of origin. Thus, in 2001, 90% of Canadians of Haitian origin lived in Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007011-eng.htm |title=The Haitian Community in Canada |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 85% of Canadians of Jamaican origin lived in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007012-eng.htm |title=The Jamaican Community in Canada |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major change in the settlement patterns of black Canadians occurred in the second half of the 20th century as the mostly rural black Canadian communities had become mostly urban communities, a process starting in the 1930s that was complete by the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Immigrants from the West Indies almost always settled in the cities, and the Canadian historian James Walker called the black Canadian community one of the "most urbanized of all Canada's ethnic groups".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

On 29 January 1969, at Sir George Williams University in Montreal, the [[Sir George Williams affair]] began with a group of about 200 students, many of whom were black, occupied the Henry Hall computer building in protest against allegations that a white biology professor, Perry Anderson, was biased in grading black students, which the university had dismissed.&lt;ref name="Lambeth"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student occupation ended in violence on 11 February 1969 when the riot squad of the ''Service de police de la Ville de Montréal'' stormed the Hall building, a fire was started causing $2 million worth of damage (it is disputed whatever the police or the students started the fire), and many of the protesting students were beaten and arrested.&lt;ref name="Lambeth"/&gt; The entire event received much media attention; it was recorded live for television by the news crews present. As the Hall building burned and the policemen beat the students, onlookers in the crowds outside chanted "Burn, niggers, burn!" and "Let the niggers burn!".&lt;ref name="Lambeth"/&gt; Afterwards, the protesting students were divided by race by the police with charges laid against the 97 black students present in the Hall building. The two leaders of the protest, [[Rosie Douglas|Roosevelt "Rosie" Douglas]] and [[Anne Cools]], were convicted and imprisoned with Douglas being deported back to Dominica after completing his sentence, where he later became Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Lambeth"/&gt; Cools received a royal pardon and was appointed to the Senate in 1984 by Pierre Trudeau, becoming the first black senator. The riot at Sir George Williams University spurred-through it did not start-a wave of "black power" activism in Canada with many blacks taking the view that the police response was disproportionate and unjustifiably violent while many white Canadians who had believed that their country had no racism were shocked by a race riot in Canada.&lt;ref name="Lambeth"/&gt;

In July 1967, the [[Caribana]] festival was started in Toronto by immigrants from the West Indies to celebrate West Indian culture that has become one of the largest celebrations of Caribbean culture in North America. In 1975, a museum telling the stories of African Canadians and their journeys and contributions was established in [[Amherstburg, Ontario]], entitled the [[Amherstburg Freedom Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackhistoricalmuseum.org|title=Freedom Museum - Black History… Universal Inspiration|website=www.blackhistoricalmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Atlantic Canada, the [[Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia]] was established in [[Cherrybrook, Nova Scotia|Cherrybrook]].

Starting in the 1960s with the weakening of ties to Britain together the changes caused by immigration from the West Indies, black Canadians have become active in the Liberal and New Democratic parties as well as the Conservatives.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1963, the Liberal [[Leonard Braithwaite]] became the first black person elected to a provincial legislature when he was elected as a MPP in Ontario.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In the 1968 election, [[Lincoln Alexander]] was elected as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Hamilton West, becoming the first black person elected to the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1979, Alexander become the first black federal Cabinet minister when he was appointed minister of labor in the government of Joe Clark. In 1972, [[Emery Barnes]] and [[Rosemary Brown (politician)|Rosemary Brown]] were elected to the British Columbia legislation as New Democrats.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1984, the New Democrat [[Howard McCurdy]] was elected to the House of Commons as the second black MP while [[Anne Cools]] became the first black Senator.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1985, the Liberal [[Alvin Curling]] became the second black man elected to the Ontario legislation, and the first black person to serve as a member of the Ontario cabinet.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1990, the New Democrat [[Zanana Akande]] became the first black female MPP in Ontario and the first black woman to join a provincial cabinet as the minister of community services in the government of Bob Rae.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1990, the Conservative [[Donald Oliver]] became the first black man appointed to the Senate.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1993, Liberal [[Wayne Adams]] became the first black person elected to the Nova Scotia legislation and the first black Nova Scotia cabinet minister.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In the 1993 election, [[Jean Augustine]] and [[Hedy Fry]] were elected to the House of Commons as Liberals, becoming the first female black MPs.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; In 1996, Fry was promoted up from the backbenches to become the minister for multiculturalism and status of women, making her the first black female federal cabinet minister.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

A recurring point of tension in the Toronto region since the 1980s has concerned allegations of police harassment and violence against the black population in the Toronto area. After the killing of Lester Donaldson by the Toronto police in August 1988, the [[Black Action Defence Committee]] (BADC) was founded in October 1988 to protest allegations of police brutality against black Canadians in Toronto. The founder of BADC, the Jamaican immigrant [[Dudley Laws]] became one of the most recognized figures in Toronto in the 1990s, noted for his willingness to confront the police.&lt;ref name="Coyne"&gt;{{cite web

With the secularization of society in late 20th century, the churches have ceased to play the traditionally dominant role in black Canadian communities.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Increased educational and job opportunities have led to many black women to seek full-time careers.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; According to the census of 1991, black Canadians on average received lower wages than white Canadians.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; However, immigrants from the West Indies and Africa have usually arrived with high level of skills and education, finding work in numerous occupational categories.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Efforts have been made to address the long-standing educational gap between black and white Canadians, and in the recent decades, black Canadians have been making economic gains.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

==Settlements==
[[File:Black_Neighbourhoods_in_Toronto.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of Toronto Census Tracts by percent of population who identify as Black in 2016.]]

Although many Black Canadians live in integrated communities, a number of notable Black communities have been known, both as unique settlements and as Black-dominated neighbourhoods in urban centres.

The most historically documented Black settlement in Canadian history is the defunct community of [[Africville]], a district located at the [[North End, Halifax|North End]] of peninsular [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. Its population was relocated and it was demolished in the 1960s to facilitate the urban expansion of the city. Similarly, the [[Hogan's Alley, Vancouver|Hogan's Alley]] neighbourhood in [[Vancouver]] was largely demolished in 1970, with only a single small laneway in [[Strathcona, Vancouver|Strathcona]] remaining.

The [[Wilberforce Colony]] in Ontario was also a historically Black settlement. It evolved demographically as Black settlers moved away. It became dominated by ethnic Irish settlers, who renamed the village [[Lucan, Ontario|Lucan]]. A small group of Black American settlers from San Francisco were the original inhabitants of [[Saltspring Island]] in the mid-19th century.

Other notable Black settlements include [[North Preston, Nova Scotia|North Preston]] in Nova Scotia, [[Priceville, Ontario|Priceville]], [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]], [[South Buxton, Ontario|South Buxton]] and [[Dresden, Ontario|Dresden]] in Ontario, the [[Maidstone, Saskatchewan|Maidstone]]/[[Eldon No. 471, Saskatchewan|Eldon]] area in Saskatchewan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~dsucha/shiloh.html |title=Shiloh Baptist Church Cemetery |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amber Valley, Alberta|Amber Valley]] in Alberta. North Preston currently has the highest concentration of Black Canadians in Canada, many of whom are descendants of Africville residents. [[Elm Hill, New Brunswick|Elm Hill]] in [[Hampstead Parish, New Brunswick|Hampstead Parish]] is the last remaining black community in [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spray|first1=William |title=The Blacks in New Brunswick|date=1972|publisher=Brunswick Press|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Blacks_in_New_Brunswick.html?id=pCQVAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous Black-dominated urban neighbourhoods in Canada is [[Montreal]]'s [[Little Burgundy]], regarded as the spiritual home of Canadian [[jazz]] due to its association with many of Canada's most influential early jazz musicians. In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of [[Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]], [[LaSalle, Quebec|LaSalle]], [[Pierrefonds-Roxboro]], [[Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension]], and [[Montréal-Nord]] have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population. Several cities in [[Greater Montreal]] such as [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], [[Terrebonne, Quebec|Terrebonne]], [[Repentigny, Quebec|Repentigny]] and [[Châteauguay]] also have large Black populations.

In [[Winnipeg]], the [[Central Park (Winnipeg)|Central Park]] neighborhood has the largest concentration of Black Canadians in [[Manitoba]]. Nearly 25% of area residents are black, as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://winnipegharvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-ALL-report-African-July-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Queen Mary Park, Edmonton|Queen Mary Park]] and [[Central McDougall, Edmonton|Central McDougall]] neighbourhoods form the center of the black community in [[Edmonton]]. Queen Mary Park has been home to a long-standing African American population since the early 1900s, centered around Shiloh Baptist Church, although today the neighbourhood is composed mostly of recent migrants from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avenueedmonton.com/August-2014/The-Hoods-Arent-That-Rough/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eshilohbc.ca/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2012/02/09/102-year-old-church-a-unique-piece-of-edmontons-history&lt;/ref&gt;

In Toronto, many Blacks settled in [[The Ward, Toronto|St. John's Ward]], a district which was located in the city's core.&lt;ref name=toronto&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/canada/proj/cfc-ugrr/itm1-ex/plan01a_e.asp |title=Underground Railroad Exhibit: Teacher Resources – Backgrounder to UGRR – Lesson Plan One |publisher=Pc.gc.ca |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527203254/http://www.pc.gc.ca/canada/proj/cfc-ugrr/itm1-ex/plan01a_e.asp |archivedate=27 May 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/180492 |title=Escaped slaves helped build T.O |work=Toronto Star |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2011-01-22 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others preferred to live in [[York, Toronto|York Township]], on the outskirts of the city. By 1850, there were more than a dozen Black businesses along [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]];&lt;ref name=toronto/&gt; the modern-day equivalent is [[Eglinton West|Little Jamaica]] along [[Eglinton Avenue]], which contains one of the largest concentrations of Black businesses in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;"Little Jamaica Competition is stiff in the shopping area that has sprung up along Eglinton Ave. to cater to the tastes of a growing West Indian community."

Several urban neighbourhoods in Toronto, including [[Jane and Finch]], [[Rexdale]], [[Downsview]], [[Malvern, Toronto|Malvern]], [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]], [[St. James Town]], and [[Lawrence Heights]] have large Black Canadian communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2012/07/15/are-torontos-13-priority-neighbourhoods-no-longer-a-priority.html Are Toronto's 13 priority neighbourhoods no longer a priority?] ''[[Metro International|Metro]]''. Accessed on January 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The Toronto suburbs of [[Brampton]] and [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]] also have sizable Black populations, many of whom are middle income professionals and small business owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3521010&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Brampton&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=Visible%20minority&amp;TABID=1 Census Profile, 2016 Census - Brampton] [[Statistics Canada]].

Accessed on January 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greater Toronto Area]] is home to a highly educated middle to upper middle class Black population who continue to migrate out of the city limits, into surrounding suburbs.

==Culture==
Media representation of Blacks in Canada has increased significantly in recent years, with television series such as ''[[Drop the Beat]]'', ''[[Lord Have Mercy!]]'', ''[[Diggstown (TV series)|Diggstown]]'' and ''[[Da Kink in My Hair (TV series)|Da Kink in My Hair]]'' focusing principally on Black characters and communities.

The films of [[Clement Virgo]], [[Sudz Sutherland]] and [[Charles Officer]] have been among the most prominent depictions of Black Canadians on the big screen. Notable films have included Sutherland's ''[[Love, Sex and Eating the Bones]]'', Officer's ''[[Nurse.Fighter.Boy]]'' and Virgo's ''[[Rude (film)|Rude]]'' and ''[[Love Come Down (film)|Love Come Down]]''.

In literature, the most prominent and famous Black Canadian writers have been [[Josiah Henson]], [[George Elliott Clarke]], [[Lawrence Hill]], [[Dionne Brand]], [[Esi Edugyan]] and [[Dany Laferrière]], although numerous emerging writers have gained attention in the 1990s and 2000s.

Since the late 19th century, Black Canadians have made significant contributions to the culture of [[sport]]s, starting with the founding of the [[Coloured Hockey League]] in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/08/25/hockey-black.html Black hockey hall of fame proposed for Dartmouth], CBC Sports, 26 August 2006. Accessed on 14 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In North America's [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]], several Black Canadians have had successful careers, including [[Ferguson Jenkins]] ([[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] member), [[Grant Fuhr]] ([[Hockey Hall of Fame]] member), [[Jarome Iginla]], [[Russell Martin]], and [[Jamaal Magloire]]; most recently, [[Andrew Wiggins]] and [[P. K. Subban]] have achieved a high level of success. In athletics, [[Harry Jerome]], [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], and [[Donovan Bailey]] were Canada's most prominent Black [[sprint (running)|sprinters]] in recent decades; the current generation is led by [[Andre De Grasse]]. 
 
The largest and most famous Black Canadian cultural event is the [[Caribana|Scotiabank Toronto Caribbean Carnival]] (also known as Caribana), an annual festival of Caribbean Canadian culture in Toronto which typically attracts at least a million participants each year.&lt;ref name=caribanaroots&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/caribana/article/471603--strengthening-caribana-s-roots "Strengthening Caribana's roots"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 2 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent.

Black Canadians have had a major influence on [[Music of Canada|Canadian music]], helping pioneer many genres including [[Canadian hip hop]], [[Canadian blues]], [[Canadian jazz]], [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[Caribbean music in Canada|Caribbean music]], pop music and classical music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monique Desroches|author2=Marie-Thérèse Lefebvre |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/black-music-emc/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |title=Black Music |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest musical influences include [[Robert Nathaniel Dett]], [[Portia White]], [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Charlie Biddle]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Some Black Canadian musicians have enjoyed mainstream worldwide appeal in various genres, such as [[Dan Hill]], [[Glenn Lewis]], [[Tamia]], [[Deborah Cox]], and [[Kardinal Offishall]].

While African American culture is a significant influence on its Canadian counterpart, many African and Caribbean Canadians reject the suggestion that their own culture is not distinctive.&lt;ref name=walcott /&gt; In his first major hit single "[[BaKardi Slang]]", rapper [[Kardinal Offishall]] performed a lyric about Toronto's distinctive Black Canadian slang: 

{{quote|We don't say 'you know what I'm sayin', T dot says 'ya dun know'&lt;br&gt;We don't say 'hey that's the breaks', we say 'yo, a so it go'&lt;br&gt;We don't say 'you get one chance', We say 'you better rip the show'...&lt;br&gt;Y'all talking about 'cuttin and hittin skins', We talkin bout 'beat dat face'...&lt;br&gt;You cats is steady saying 'word', My cats is steady yellin 'zeen'...&lt;br&gt;So when we singin about the girls we singin about the 'gyal dem'&lt;br&gt;Y'all talkin about 'say that one more time', We talkin about 'yo, come again'&lt;br&gt;Y'all talkin about 'that nigga's a punk', We talkin about 'that yout's a fosse'...&lt;br&gt;A shoe is called a 'crep', A big party is a 'fete'&lt;br&gt;Ya'll takin about 'watch where you goin!', We talkin about 'mind where you step!'}}

Because the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of ''creating'' a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture.&lt;ref name=walcott /&gt; For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been [[ensemble cast]] comedy or drama series centred on the creation and/or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution.&lt;ref name=walcott /&gt;

''[[The Book of Negroes (miniseries)|The Book of Negroes]]'', a [[CBC Television]] miniseries about [[slavery]] based on Lawrence Hill's award-winning novel, was a significant ratings success in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://playbackonline.ca/2015/01/08/book-of-negroes-debuts-to-1-7m-viewers/ "The Book of Negroes debuts to 1.7M viewers"]. ''[[Playback (website)|Playback]]'', 8 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism==
In a 2013 survey of 80 countries by the [[World Values Survey]], Canada ranked among the most racially tolerant societies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/|title=Map shows world's 'most racist' countries|publisher= Washington Post|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to [[Statistics Canada]]'s "Ethnic Diversity Survey", released in September 2003, when asked about the five-year period from 1998 to 2002 nearly one-third (32%) of respondents who identified as black reported that they had been subjected to some form of [[racial discrimination]] or unfair treatment "sometimes" or "often".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=4508&amp;lang=en&amp;db=IMDB&amp;dbg=f&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2 |title=Statistics Canada |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=2003-09-26 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, many unarmed black Canadian men in Toronto were shot or killed by [[Toronto Police Service|Toronto Police]] officers.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mascoll, "[https://www.thestar.com/article/169133 Sherona Hall, 59: Fighter for justice]", ''Toronto Star'', January 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="badc"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/03/25/james_dudley_laws_stung_and_inspired_a_generation.html James: Dudley Laws stung and inspired a generation] ''Toronto Star''.

BADC's executive director, [[Dudley Laws]], claimed that Toronto had the "most murderous" police force in North America, and that police bias against blacks in Toronto was worse than in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="badc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.K.

Throughout the years, high-profile cases of racism against black Canadians have occurred in [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/burning-cross-ignites-racial-tension-in-nova-scotia/article1480350/ |title=This page is available to GlobePlus subscribers |work=The Globe and Mail |date= 2010-02-24|accessdate=2010-07-26 |location=Toronto |first=Oliver |last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowe |first=Lezlie |url=http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/hidden-racism/Content?oid=1072189 |title=Halifax's hidden racism &amp;#124; Lowefiles &amp;#124; Halifax, Nova Scotia &amp;#124; THE COAST |publisher=Thecoast.ca |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination against blacks in Nova Scotia: the criminal justice system, by Wilson A Head;

Additionally, Black Canadians have historically faced incarceration rates disproportionate to their population. In 1911, black Canadians constituted 0.22% of the population of Canada but 0.321% in prison. White Canadians were incarcerated at a rate of 0.018%. By 1931, 0.385% of black Canadians were in prison, compared to 0.035 of white Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021652020393|title = The Reaction to Black Violent Offenders in Ontario- 1892-1961: A Test of the Threat Hypothesis|last = Mosher|first = Clayton|date = 1999|journal = Sociological Forum|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary rates of incarceration of black Canadians have continued to be disproportionate to their percentage of the general population, with 1 in 10 federal prisoners being black but being 2.9% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/blacks-fare-worse-behind-bars-than-other-inmates-report-says/article15615344/|title = Black inmates face second-class status in Canadian prisons, ombudsman warns|last = Fine|first = Sean|date = November 26, 2013|work = The Globe and Mail|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4772">'''Commercial location development''' (CLD) is a method used by the [[public sector]] to position its territory and create a good frame condition for the development of its economy. After having made a thorough diagnosis of the actual situation the public entities design a [[Marketing]] strategy of the location, which includes, as in any [[marketing mix]], the target groups definition (type of enterprises they want to conserve or attract), the offer, the pricing, the promotion and the sale's strategy. The topic includes the recruitment and retention of the appropriate human capital.

The design of a CLD strategy allows [[local government]]s to manage their territorial and economic development accorded to fixed and legitimized goals instead of having to react to single cases and demands in a short time. The concerned territory can be municipal, inter-municipal or larger.

The aim of this article is to present the methodology and tools used for designing a Commercial Location Development [[strategy]].

==Methodology and tools==

===Territorial diagnosis===
The first step consists of assessing the CLD situation at the level of the considered [[Sales operations#Sales territory|territory]]. This can be done using both statistical data and interviews of local stakeholders. The collected information is then summarized using i.e. a  [[balanced scorecard|balanced scorecard (BSC)]] or [[SWOT analysis]].

===Competition analysis===
After having identified the main territorial competitors, these ones are then assessed using as far as possible the same tools as for the territorial diagnosis. The results are then compared in order to determine in which topics and frame conditions the concerned commercial location has to improve to enhance its competitiveness versus its competitors.

===Benchmarking===
Ideas for the new strategy are then developed taking inspiration out of a [[benchmarking]] analysis and/or a [[best practice]]s or worst practices inventory.

=== Designing of a commercial location development [[strategy]]===
The strategy is then designed, democratically validated and implemented.

Crime in [[South Korea]] is among the lowest compared to other [[Developed country|developed nations]].

==Overview==
Violent crimes (such as homicide, assault and arson) and property crimes (such as theft, fraud and vandalism) make up around four-fifths of all Criminal Code Offences

Although South Korea has a lower crime rate than other [[Developed country|industrialized countries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Peerenboom| first = Randall| title = Human Rights in Asia| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2j6GNiMMc1oC&amp;pg=PA16| year = 2013| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-134-23881-1| page = 16| chapter = An empirical overview of rights performance in Asia, France, and the USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; the crime rate in 2007 was around 2.9 times higher than in 1978, with the total number of crimes committed rising from 513,165 to 1,965,577.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book| last = Joo| first = Hee-Jong| editor-last = Newman| editor-first = Graeme R.| title = Crime and Punishment Around the World| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yA6olAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA212| year = 2010| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-0-313-35134-1| page = 212| chapter = South Korea (Republic of Korea) }}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, sudden changes in circumstance have led to cause short-term fluctuations in the crime rate – for example, the crime rate rose by 15% following the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mishkin| first = Frederic S.| title = The Next Great Globalization| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zm2Pdw7jbNEC&amp;pg=PA97| year = 2009| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-1-4008-2944-6| page = 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and dropped by 21% during the first ten days of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20020613/world-cup-special/snippets-from-asia.173439 |title=Crime rate tumbles in S.

==History of Organized Crime==
{{One source|section|date=September 2017}}
South Korea has undergone dramatic social, economic and political upheaval since the end of the Korean War in 1953. With these changes crime has increased in recent years and has become a major issue in South Korea. Most of the increase has come in the form of violence and illegal activities connected to organized groups (Lee,2006).
 
Due to the large police and military presence after the Korean War, the expansion of home-grown organized crime was slowed, almost giving South Korea immunity against international criminal organizations. With no outside conflicts South Korean organized crime has had an advantage to grow, yet because of the location of the Korean peninsula many outside groups from Russia, Japan and China have started to engage in more illegal activities in South Korea (Lee, 2006).
   
Amid the political confusion of the 1950s, a number of organized gangs emerged and became an influential force in the entertainment districts. Soon these groups began associating with politicians, guarding them from danger and disrupting the political rallies of competing politicians by using organized violence. These particular groups were the so-called “political gangs” or “henchmen” (Lee, 2006)

Organized crime after the War started mainly in the city of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. Two main gangs formed, the first was known as the “Chong-ro Faction” which was made up of members from southern Korea, and the second was known as the “Myung-dong Faction” whose members where from Pyonyando province. These two gangs claimed dominance over northern Seoul. With the military in control, in the years from 1961 to 1963 13,000 members of these gangs were arrested causing organized gangs to almost completely disappear (Lee, 2006). The 1970s brought an easing of public discipline and control, and opportunities for organized crime emerged again. This saw the emergence of two new groups known as the “Master Sergeant Shin Faction” which was located in the Seoul area and the “Ho-nam Faction” found in the Mugyo-dong area of Seoul. In 1975 there was a violent battle over territories among the two groups which ended with the Ho-nam Faction becoming victorious. The Ho-nam Fraction soon divided into three sub-factions due to internal conflicts. These three factions are now considered the largest organized crime groups in South Korea. They are known as the “Seo-bang Faction,” the “Yang-eun Faction” and the “OB Faction” (Lee, 2006).

Traditional South Korean criminal groups fights rarely resulted in deaths as they fought with their hands, feet and heads. Knives and metal bars only began to show up as weapons in the 1970s. In today’s South Korean society, a person is not to be in possession of guns, swords or knives  which may explain why traditional crime groups did not use weapons (Lee, 2006).

Upon the assassination of President Park in 1979 “special measures to uproot social evils” were initiated under the proclaimed martial law which led to a decline in organized criminal violence. But with the relaxed atmosphere these criminal organizations remerged and flourished yet again (Lee, 2006). With the 1985 Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics global expansion became a possibility and criminal groups took advantage of this opportunity for rapid economic development. Taking advantage of the Korean government's open-door and globalization policies, these crime groups began to form coalitions with their counterparts in Japan, China, Hong Kong, and the United States (Lee, 2006).

In 1990 the Korean Government declared a “war on crime” in an effort to crack down on violent and non-violent acts by criminally organized groups. The raids in the fall of 1990 crippled most of the existing criminal groups, but did not destroy them. As one way of better controlling the number of criminal groups, the Korean Government made it illegal to form or join any criminal organization. Statistics from the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office showed that in 1999 there were 11,500 members from 404 organized crimes groups ranging from 10 to 88 members in South Korea (Lee, 2006).

With the trend of economic growth and globalization, organized crime groups in South Korea have become larger in scale and broader in their fields of operations. These international linkages have started to include drug trafficking, financial fraud, weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. Organized transnational crime has become a major concern facing not only Korean government, but also the international community (Lee, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Seungmug | year = 2006 | title = Organized Crime In South Korea | url = | journal = Trends in Organized Crime | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 61–76 | doi=10.1007/s12117-006-1003-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drugs==
The use of drugs in South Korea is a lesser offense; however, there are still drug related offenses in South Korea. Most of the drug related offenses occur in the Gangnam and Yongsan Districts. In 2013, there were 129 drug related crimes reported in the Gangnam area and 48 drug related crimes reported in the Yongsan area.

A Gangnam District representative said, “drugs are usually distributed through the club network, in Gangnam, foreign students and club operators tend to be involved in the drug trade, a relatively easy way to make money.” &lt;ref name="koreabang.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreabang.com/2013/stories/2013-seoul-crime-rates-rape-in-gwanak-drugs-in-gangnam.html|title=2013 Seoul Crime Rates: Rape in Gwanak, Drugs in Gangnam - koreaBANG|website=www.koreabang.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office, there were 7,011 arrests for drug offenses in 2011 which was a 7 percent drop from the previous year. The U.S., by way of comparison, in 2010 made more than 1.6 million drug arrests, more than 36 times Korea’s figure, even after differences in population are accounted for.&lt;ref name="koreabang.com"/&gt; The drug that is most common is Crystalline Methamphetamine also known as Crystal Meth.

Crystal Meth remains the most commonly used drug,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaic.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=135&amp;Itemid=143|title=APAIC|first=Super|last=User|website=www.apaic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; accounting for most drug related arrests. Other drugs that are well known are club drugs such as ecstasy. These continue to grow in popularity among college students. However, methamphetamine continues to be the drug of choice for Koreans.

==Murder==

In South Korea, murder is an uncommon, but serious, crime. Gangseo District and Yeongdeungpo Districts are the two most well-known areas where murders happen most often. In 2013, there were 21 murder cases in the Gangseo District and 11 murder cases in the Yeongdeungpo District.   These two districts are found on the southwest part of the city where it houses many low income citizens and foreign workers.

A Dongguk University Police Administration professor, Kwak Dae-gyung said, “there are many foreign residents that have yet to adapt to Korean society and citizens lower in the economic strata in these areas, there’s trouble in terms of economic competition and a lengthy period of cultural assimilation that leads to people committing violent crimes out of frustration and the need for frequent police action.&lt;ref name="koreabang.com"/&gt;

==Corruption==
{{main|Corruption in South Korea}}
South Korea dropped one notch in an international corruption awareness ranking to 46th place among 177 nations in 2013. According to the 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) issued by [[Transparency International]] (TI), South Korea scored 55 out of 100. [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Yahoo!]] |url=http://my.news.yahoo.com/south-koreas-corruption-index-falls-082003113.html |title=South Korea's corruption index falls |date=December 7, 2012 |last=Choi |first=He-suk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The index shows qualitative assessments of a country's level of corruption in the administrative and public sectors giving a yearly view of the relative degree of corruption by ranking countries from all over the globe. It uses data taken from opinion surveys of experts from each country. The reputation of the country's law enforcement agency has recently been tarnished after a number of ranking government officials, including the head of the state intelligence agency, were indicted for alleged bribery.
  
Some 86.5 percent of respondents in a Korea Institute of Public Administration survey of small and large companies described corruption among high-ranking public officials as “serious” in 2010, the highest result since the poll began in 2000. Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, gave South Korea a rating of 5.4 in its 2010 corruption perceptions index — midway between highly corrupt and very clean. That ranks South Korea alongside countries and territories such as Botswana, Puerto Rico and Poland but far below many of the developed nations it has sought to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/12/03/51/0301000000AEN20131203002700315F.html|title=S.

The sex trade involved some 94 million transactions in 2007, down from 170 million in 2002. The number of prostitutes dropped by 18 percent to 269,000 during the same period. The amount of money traded for prostitution was over 14 trillion won, compared to than 24 trillion won in 2002.&lt;ref name=kwdi/&gt; Despite legal sanctions and police crackdowns, prostitution continues to flourish in the country, while sex workers continue to actively resist the state's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/54649/skorean-sex-workers-rally-against-police-crackdown-2/ |title=S Korean sex workers rally against police crackdown |publisher=AP News |date=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/south-korea-thriving-sex-industry-powerful-wealthy-super-state-1222647# |title=South Korea: A Thriving Sex Industry In A Powerful, Wealthy Super-State |date=April 29, 2013 |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |last=Ghosh |first=Palash |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GwxP5eGQ?url=http://www.ibtimes.com/south-korea-thriving-sex-industry-powerful-wealthy-super-state-1222647 |archivedate=2013-05-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Carter "Uncle Dan" Beard''' (June 21, 1850 – June 11, 1941) was an American illustrator, author, youth leader, and social reformer who founded the [[Sons of Daniel Boone]] in 1905, which Beard later merged with the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).

==Early life==
Beard was born in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, into a family of artists.&lt;ref name=rowan&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowan |first=Edward L. |year =2005 |title=To Do My Best: James E. West and the History of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher=Las Vegas International Scouting Museum |isbn=0-9746479-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth, he explored the woods and made sketches of nature. His father was the artist [[James Henry Beard]] and his mother was Mary Caroline (Carter) Beard. His uncle was the artist [[William Holbrook Beard]]. He lived at [[Daniel Carter Beard Boyhood Home|322 East Third Street]] in [[Covington, Kentucky]] near the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]], where he learned the stories of [[Kentucky]] pioneer life.

He started an early career as an engineer and surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=56 |title=Daniel C. Beard|publisher=Ohio History Central |accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended art school in New York City. He wrote a series of articles for [[St. Nicholas Magazine]] that later formed the basis for ''[[The American Boy's Handy Book]]''. He was a member of the Student Art League, where he met and befriended [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] in 1883. He illustrated a number of books for [[Mark Twain]], and for other authors such as [[Ernest Howard Crosby|Ernest Crosby]].

In 1908 while living in [[Redding, Connecticut]], Beard was among those on hand to welcome [[Mark Twain]] upon his arrival to the author's new villa [[Stormfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beard |first=Dan |title=Mark Twain as a Neighbor |work=Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine |date=January–June 1910 |volume=41 |pages=705–708  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-o06AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA707&amp;lpg=PA707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beard became the editor of ''Recreation'' magazine and wrote a monthly column for youth. He founded the [[Sons of Daniel Boone]] in 1905, basing it on American frontier traditions. He later moved his column to ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]''. After conflicts with a new editor, he moved to the ''[[Pictorial Review]]''. Since Women's Home Companion retained the rights to the name, he simply renamed the organization to ''Boy Pioneers of America''.&lt;ref name="ISCAjournal"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Scott| first=David C.| title=Ernest Thompson Seton and BSA - The Partnership Collapse of 1915| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association| volume=6| issue=2|date=June 2006| pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scouting==
[[File:Scouting pioneers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beard (right) with Scouting founder [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] (seated) and [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] (left)]]
Beard merged his organization into the [[Boy Scouts of America]] when it was founded in 1910. Beard became one of the first National Scout Commissioners of the Boy Scouts and served it for 30&amp;nbsp;years. He later became the editor of ''[[Boys' Life]]'' magazine, the BSA official magazine, and wrote a monthly column for youth. The work of both Beard and [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] are in large part the basis of the [[Traditional Scouting]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traditional Scouting |publisher=American Traditional Scouting |url=http://www.inquiry.net/traditional/index.htm |accessdate=July 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISCAjournal2"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rowan| first=Edward L.| title=Dan Beard, Founder of the First Boy Scout Society| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association| volume=6| issue=4|date=December 2006| pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beard also helped his sister organize the [[Camp Fire (organization)|Camp Fire Girls]]. Beard was a [[List of Freemasons#Educators, religious leaders, and others|Freemason]], initiated in the Mariners Lodge No. 67 ([[New York City]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | title = List of famous freemasons | website = freemasonry.bcy.ca | access-date = Sep 30, 2018 | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20011004153632/http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | quotation = East Nashville No. 560, TN [19]| archive-date = Oct 4, 2001 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="stjohnslodgedc.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons | title = Famous Freemasons in the course of history | language = en | website = stjohnslodgedc.org | access-date = Sep 30, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151116030150/http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons | archive-date = Nov 15, 2015 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was also an award for Masonic Scouters has been named in his honor.

Beard founded Boy Scouts Troop 1 in [[Flushing, New York]], which is believed to be one of the [[Oldest Scout Groups|oldest continuously chartered Boy Scout Troops]] in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Beard became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] at the age of 64 on February 15, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Eagle Directory: Beard, Daniel Carter |work=National Eagle Scout Association |url=https://www.memberconnections.com/olc/membersonly/NESA/old/old.cgi?FNC=todetailspage__Asearch_results_html___NESA___2231467 |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daniel Carter Beard 1937.jpg|thumb|Daniel Beard in later life, with Boy Scouts]]

Prior to the establishment of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]], Dan Beard was recipient of the only "gold Eagle badge" awarded at the Second National Training Conference of Scout Executives held in 1922 in Blue Ridge, North Carolina.&lt;ref name=rowan /&gt;

Dan Beard was also involved with the [[Culver Academies]]' summer camp program for many years, which used his "Sons of Daniel Boone" program. This program still exists as the Academy's Culver Woodcraft Camp.

Beard died on June 11, 1941, shortly before his 91st birthday at his home Brooklands in [[Suffern, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;June 12, 1941, New York Herald Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried near his home at the Brick Church Cemetery in [[Spring Valley, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Brick Church Cemetery aka Reformed Church Cemetery, Beard Family Plot - (Section D, Division 1, Plot 1, Grave 6),221 Brick Church Rd (Brick Church Rd and Hwy 306), Spring Valley NY 10977, 845-354-6785&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|3804}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Program Director of the Boy Scouts of America, [[E. Urner Goodman]], was selected to be in charge of the beloved youth leader's funeral in Suffern.

{{Violence against women}}
'''[[Domestic violence]] in Iran''' is a form of  expressed by one partner or partners against another partner or partners in the content of an [[intimate relationship]] in [[Iran]]. 

==National and political culture==
In Iran, domestic relations in a couple are regulated by the Civil Code, which constructs [[marriage]] as a hierarchic  institution where the [[husband]] has authority over his [[wife]].  Article 1105 reads: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref name="alaviandassociates"&gt;http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf#&lt;/ref&gt; The husband is obligated to maintain his wife, but this obligation ceases to exist if the wife does not perform her duties: Article 1108 states: "''If the wife refuses to fulfil duties of a wife without legitimate excuse, she will not be entitled to the cost of maintenance''".&lt;ref name="alaviandassociates"/&gt;

The nature of domestic violence is complicated by both a national culture and authoritative state that support control, oppression and violence against women. "The government does so by promoting [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] ideas of women as properties of men. It does so by setting up an unequal legal system and not punishing [[assault]] even when it has resulted in [[Trauma (medicine)|severe injury]] or at times even death. The conversation of domestic violence then cannot be simply domestic but begins to take the shape of a systematic violence, fueled by tradition, ignited by religion, encouraged by the dominant [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] state, and empowered by [[poverty]] and [[Literacy|illiteracy]]."&lt;ref name=Moradian&gt;Moradian, Azad.
[http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176:2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43:events-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 ''Domestic Violence against Single and Married Women in Iranian Society.''] Tolerancy International. September 2009. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the heart of the issue is the belief, rooted in [[common law]], that men are responsible for their household affairs, especially treatment of family members, and should not be subject to intervention by the government.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;  

Iranian feminists believe that women's issues must be further investigated since so many women are facing domestic violence in Iran.&lt;ref name=Farhi&gt;Farhi, Farideh. [http://www.drsoroush.com/PDF/E-CMO-20011200-Religious_Intellectuals_and_the_Woman_Question.pdf ''Religious Intellectuals, the 'Woman Question', and the Struggle for the Creation of a Democratic Public Sphere in Iran.''] International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society 15 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  "Religious intellectuals have responded by engaging in reluctant analysis of the way the ''woman question'' poses itself in the Iranian context. So far, their analyses fail to take into account the gender implications of the struggle against [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]] and traditional authority. However, the dynamic interaction of the reform project with demands and aspirations of various sectors of Iranian public life will not allow the issue to rest here. Religious intellectuals, in their attempt to recreate essential religious truth in the form of new intellectual concepts and systems, will increasingly have to deal with systemic gender inequalities in a more systematic manner."&lt;ref name=Farhi/&gt;  

Although the Iranian society is starting to recognize the issues surrounding beating women in Islamic household, many Muslims are reluctant to admit such issues exist.  An argument is that [[hadith]]s are not the word of God, but rather statements that historical Muslim figures, like [[Muhammad]], made. Iranian women argue that these hadiths could be misinterpreted and therefore should not be taken as orders or truth.&lt;ref name=Farhi/&gt;  A news article in the [[Washington Post]] by Pamela K. Taylor admits that "we must acknowledge that there are problematical verses in the Qur'an and there are certain hadith which must be countered."&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Pamela K. [http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/pamela_k_taylor/2009/02/aasiya_hassan_domestic_violenc.html ''On Faith Panelists Blog: Aasiya Zubair Hassan, Domestic Violence and Islam - Pamela K. Taylor.''] The Washington Post. 27 Feb. 2009. Retrieved 26 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some pushback to feminist efforts to reduce domestic violence in Iran by some more conservative elements of Iranian society.  For example, the women's Basij leader, Minu Aslani, opposed efforts to fight domestic abuse in Iran, because she felt that it threatened Iran's traditional values.  Many people in positions of power hold similar opinions, viewing feminist efforts to achieve gender equality as a threat to Islamic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-conservative-antifeminist-backlash-basij/28159783.html|title=In Iran, Women's Basij Leader Demands Persecution Of Gender-Rights Activism|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence of domestic abuse in Iran==
In his article "'''Domestic Violence against Single and Married Women in Iranian Society''' ", '''[https://www.academia.edu/2435646/Domestic_Violence_against_Single_and_Married_Women_in_Iranian_Society Azad Moradian']'' quoted a [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] statement regarding the nature of domestic violence: 

:"The Census Bauru in Iran, an official government agency, has precluded international organizations from performing studies of domestic violence in Iran and has never conducted their own study of violence against women".&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;  

The prevalence of domestic violence has been cited as a cause of high rates of [[suicide]], mostly through [[self-immolation]], among [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] women in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Esfandiari, Golnaz. [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/2/C43C681F-0AD1-49B6-AADB-3784CA430536.html ''Iran: Self-Immolation Of Kurdish Women Brings Concern.''] [[Radio Free Europe]] (February 8, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Health Organization study===
A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) study in [[Babol]] found that within the previous year 15.0% of wives had been physically abused, 42.4% had been sexually abused and 81.5% had been psychologically abused (to various degrees) by their husbands, blaming low income, young age, unemployment and low education.&lt;ref&gt;Faramarzi, M. et al. [http://www.emro.who.int/Publications/EMHJ/1105_6/Artical2.htm Prevalence and determinants of [[intimate partner violence]] in Babol city, Islamic Republic of Iran.] ''[[Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal]]'' 11 Nos 5 &amp; 6 (September 2005) ([[World Health Organization]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 domestic violence study===
In 2004 Dr. Ghazi Tabatabaei, a renowned Iranian [[Sociology|sociologist]], led a study of domestic violence for a joint project undertaken by the Women's Center for Presidential Advisory,  [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)|Ministry of Higher Education]] and  [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|The Interior Ministry]]. Other noted scholars, professionals, psychologists and socialists participated in the study of the capital cities in Iran's 28 provinces that resulted after several years in 32 volumes of results.  The findings from questionnaires included the following areas of focus: violence towards women and children,  marriages and remarriages, divorce, the effect of education and work on violence and family issues.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt; 

The 32 volume findings are available only to scholars and researchers at the [[List of Iranian research centers|Center for Research in Tehran]] and have been shared with governmental lawmakers and agencies. The study of Iran, a diverse country of many ethnical and cultural communities, resulted in varied results by province, and particularly different the further that women lived from [[Tehran]], the capital of Iran.  This could be attributed to the lack of higher education, economics, and dominance of religion.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

From the study:
* 66% married women in Iran are subjected to some kind of domestic violence in the first year of their marriage, either by their husbands or by their in-laws.
* All married women who were participants in this study in Iran have experienced 7.4% of the 9 categories of abuse.
* The more children in a family, the more likely domestic violence will occur towards women.
* 9.63% of women in the study reported wishing their husbands would die, as a result of the abuse they have experienced.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

==Education and activism==
Since about 1994 there have been an overwhelming number of [[Master's degree|Masters']] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PH.D]] [[thesis]] written about women's issues due by women in higher education, including [[Higher education in Iran|universities in Iran]].  Because the papers have been unable to result in change or improvements, many universities are now discouraging thesis based upon Iranian women's issues.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

Moradian wrote in 2009 that "[[Human rights]] organizations, [[Political faction|political]]/[[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Opposition (politics)|oppositional groups]] and [[advocacy group]]s for women were the only voices that acknowledged the existence of this widespread phenomenal in Iran and fought for changes in law and education within communities."&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

Ramezan Shojaei Kiyasari, Fatema Alia, members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian parliament]], represented Iran at the "Regional Seminar for Asian Parliaments" seminar on 'Preventing and responding to violence against women and girls: From legislation to effective enforcement' held in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] in 2011.  Mrs. Fatemeh Alia announced that new laws related to violence against women were placed on Iran's parliament agenda.&lt;ref name=JIRI/&gt;

==Laws==
Existing laws (Iranian Code of Criminal Procedure articles 42, 43, 66) intend to prohibit violence in the form of kidnapping, gender-based harassment, abuse of pregnant women and "crimes against rights and responsibilities within the family structure," but due to cultural and political culture do not protect women, prosecute their abusers and provide services to victims.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;&lt;ref name=JIRI&gt;[http://en.humanrights-iran.ir/news-18220.aspx ''Iran enforces laws on prevention of violence against women: Iranian MP''] Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, High Council For Human Rights. 16 Sep. 2011. Retrieve 15 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed laws===
Laws to better enforce existing laws and protect women against violence were placed on the agenda before the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian parliament]] the week ending 16 September 2011, focusing on both protection and prevention of violence against women, including focus on [[human trafficking]], better protection and services for abuse victims, [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] (especially concerning domestic abuse) and better processes to manage questioning of female offenders.  One of the keys to ultimate success is altering community cultural views regarding the use of violence against women.&lt;ref name=JIRI/&gt;

The '''effects of long-term benzodiazepine use''' include [[benzodiazepine dependence|drug dependence and neurotoxicity]] as well as the possibility of adverse effects on cognitive function, physical health, and mental health.&lt;ref name=chopham&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ayers |first1=Susan |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Baum |editor2-first=Chris |editor2-last=McManus |editor3-first=Stanton |editor3-last=Newman |editor4-first=Kenneth |editor4-last=Wallston |editor5-first=John |editor5-last=Weinman |title=Cambridge Handbook of Psychology, Health and Medicine |edition=2nd |date=23 August 2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87997-2 |page=677 |editor2-link=West }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines are generally effective when used therapeutically in the short term, but even then the risk of dependency can be significantly high. Most of the problems associated with benzodiazepines result from their long-term use. There are significant physical, mental and social risks associated with the long-term use of [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://smmgp.org.uk/media/11962/guidance025.pdf | format = PDF | title = Guidance for the use and reduction of misuse of benzodiazepines and other hypnotics and anxiolytics in general practice | last1 = Ford | first1 = Chris | last2 = Law | first2 = Fergus | name-list-format = vanc | date = July 2014 | website =smmgp.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although anxiety can temporarily increase as a withdrawal symptom, there is evidence that a reduction or [[withdrawal from benzodiazepines]] can lead in the long run to a reduction in anxiety symptoms.&lt;ref name="the_american_psychiatric_publishing_textbook_of_sustance_abu"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Galanter | first1 = Marc | title = The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment (American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment) | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6wdJgejlQzYC&amp;pg=PA197 | date = 1 July 2008 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. | isbn = 978-1-58562-276-4 | page = 197 |edition= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA173 |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these increasing physical and mental symptoms from long-term use of benzodiazepines, slowly withdrawing from benzodiazepines is recommended for many long-term users.&lt;ref name=asapdacg /&gt; Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Palmer S, Dainow S, Milner P |title=Counselling: The BACP Counselling Reader |volume=1 |year=1996 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-8039-7477-7 |pages=211–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnIBEQKQi7IC |vauthors=Hammersley D, Beeley L |chapter=The effects of medication on counselling }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the symptoms that could possibly occur as a result of a withdrawal from benzodiazepines after long-term use include emotional clouding,&lt;ref name=chopham /&gt; flu-like symptoms,&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; [[suicide]],&lt;ref name="pmid28257172"/&gt; [[nausea]], [[headaches]], [[dizziness]], [[irritability]], [[lethargy]], sleep problems, [[memory impairment]], personality changes, [[aggression]], [[clinical depression|depression]], social deterioration as well as employment difficulties, while others never have any side effects from long-term benzodiazepine use.  One should never abruptly stop using this medicine and should wean themself down to a lower dose under doctor supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Onyett SR | title = The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and its management | journal = The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners | volume = 39 | issue = 321 | pages = 160–3 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2576073 | pmc = 1711840 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ndlerf.gov.au/pub/Monograph_21.pdf |format=PDF | title = Benzodiazepine and pharmaceutical opioid misuse and their relationship to crime - An examination of illicit prescription drug markets in Melbourne, Hobart and Darwin |access-date=27 December 2008 | author1 = National Drug Strategy | author2= National Drug Law Enforcement Research Fund | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid3258735&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Juergens SM, Morse RM | title = Alprazolam dependence in seven patients | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 145 | issue = 5 | pages = 625–7 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 3258735 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.145.5.625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While benzodiazepines are highly effective in the short term, adverse effects in some people associated with long-term use including impaired cognitive abilities, memory problems, mood swings, and overdoses when combined with other drugs may make the risk-benefit ratio unfavourable, while others experience no ill effects. In addition, benzodiazepines have reinforcing properties in some individuals and thus are considered to be addictive drugs, especially in individuals that have a "drug-seeking" behavior; further, a [[physical dependence]] can develop after a few weeks or months of use.&lt;ref name=pmid16856084&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Denis C, Fatséas M, Lavie E, Auriacombe M | title = Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine mono-dependence management in outpatient settings | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD005194 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16856084 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005194.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these adverse effects of long-term use of benzodiazepines begin to show improvements three to six months after withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rickels K, Lucki I, Schweizer E, García-España F, Case WG | title = Psychomotor performance of long-term benzodiazepine users before, during, and after benzodiazepine discontinuation | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–13 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10211911 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199904000-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18377143" /&gt;

Other concerns about the effects of long-term benzodiazepine use, in some, include dose escalation, [[benzodiazepine abuse]], [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[benzodiazepine dependence]] and benzodiazepine withdrawal problems. Both physiological tolerance and dependence can lead to a worsening of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Increased risk of death has been associated with long-term use of benzodiazepines in several studies; however, other studies have not found increased mortality. Due to conflicting findings in studies regarding benzodiazepines and increased risks of death including from cancer, further research in long-term use of benzodiazepines and mortality risk has been recommended. Most of the research has been conducted in prescribed users of benzodiazepines; but regarding the mortality, its been proven by a study to have an increase in prescribed users in the past decade{{when|date=June 2018}} and a half and 75% of the deaths associated with it happened in the last four years.&lt;ref name=pmid24629629&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Darke S, Torok M, Duflou J | title = Circumstances and toxicology of sudden or unnatural deaths involving alprazolam | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 138 | pages = 61–6 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24629629 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.01.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19125401&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlson F, Degenhardt L, McLaren J, Hall W, Lynskey M | title = A systematic review of research examining benzodiazepine-related mortality | journal = Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–103 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19125401 | doi = 10.1002/pds.1694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term use of benzodiazepines is controversial and has generated significant controversy within the medical profession. Views on the nature and severity of problems with long-term use of benzodiazepines differ from expert to expert and even from country to country; some experts even question whether there is any problem with the long-term use of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name="Uzun-2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uzun S, Kozumplik O, Jakovljević M, Sedić B | title = Side effects of treatment with benzodiazepines | journal = Psychiatria Danubina | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 90–3 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20305598 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Effects of long-term benzodiazepine use may include [[disinhibition]], impaired concentration and memory, [[Clinical depression|depression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Semple|first=David|author2=Roger Smyth |author3=Jonathan Burns |author4=Rajan Darjee |author5=Andrew McIntosh |title=Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry|origyear=2005|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-19-852783-1|page=540|chapter=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collier |first1=Judith |last2=Longmore |first2=Murray |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Scally | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties |edition=6 |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-852518-9 |page=366 |chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[sexual dysfunction]].&lt;ref name=asapdacg&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Haddad |editor2-first=Bill |editor2-last=Deakin |editor3-first=Serdar |editor3-last=Dursun |title=Adverse Syndromes and Psychiatric Drugs: A clinical guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV1rE_hOvJ8C |date=27 May 2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-852748-0 |pages=240–252 |chapter=Benzodiazepine dependence |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV1rE_hOvJ8C&amp;pg=PA240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LS, Rosenbaum JF | title = Clonazepam: new uses and potential problems | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 48 Suppl | issue =  | pages = 50–6 | date = October 1987 | pmid = 2889724 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term effects of benzodiazepines may differ from the adverse effects seen after acute administration of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLeod DR, Hoehn-Saric R, Labib AS, Greenblatt DJ | title = Six weeks of diazepam treatment in normal women: effects on psychomotor performance and psychophysiology | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–99 | date = April 1988 | pmid = 3372718 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-198804000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of cancer patients found that those who took [[tranquillisers]] or [[sleeping tablets]] had a substantially poorer quality of life on all measurements conducted, as well as a worse clinical picture of symptomatology.

===Cognitive status===
Long-term benzodiazepine use can lead to a generalised impairment of [[cognition]], including sustained attention, verbal learning and [[memory]] and [[psychomotor learning|psychomotor]], [[visuo-motor]] and [[visuo-conceptual]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker MJ, Greenwood KM, Jackson M, Crowe SF | title = Cognitive effects of long-term benzodiazepine use: a meta-analysis | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–48 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14731058 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418010-00004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Golombok S, Moodley P, Lader M | title = Cognitive impairment in long-term benzodiazepine users | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 365–74 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 2899898 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700007911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects on cognition exist, although their impact on a patient's daily functioning is, in most (but not all cases), insignificant.

===Effect on sleep===
[[Sleep architecture]] can be adversely affected by benzodiazepine dependence. Possible adverse effects on sleep include induction or worsening of sleep disordered breathing.

Long-term benzodiazepine use may lead to the creation or exacerbation of physical and mental health conditions, which improve after 6 or more months of abstinence. After a period of about 3 to 6 months of abstinence after completion of a gradual-reduction regimen, marked improvements in mental and physical wellbeing become apparent. For example, one study of hypnotic users gradually withdrawn from their hypnotic medication reported after 6 months of abstinence that they had less severe sleep and anxiety problems, were less distressed, and had a general feeling of improved health. Those having remained on [[hypnotic]] medication had no improvements in their insomnia, anxiety, or general health ratings.&lt;ref name="pmid18377143" /&gt; A study found that individuals having withdrawn from benzodiazepines showed a marked reduction in use of medical and mental health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burke KC, Meek WJ, Krych R, Nisbet R, Burke JD | title = Medical services use by patients before and after detoxification from benzodiazepine dependence | journal = Psychiatric Services | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–60 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7712252 | doi = 10.1176/ps.46.2.157 | url = http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7712252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including [[anxiety disorders]] such as [[panic disorder]] or [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] may be the result of alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence.&lt;ref name="pmid7769598"/&gt; Sometimes anxiety disorders precede [[ethanol|alcohol]] or benzodiazepine dependence but the alcohol or [[benzodiazepine dependence]] often acts to keep the anxiety disorders going and often progressively makes them worse.&lt;ref name="pmid7769598"/&gt;{{mcn|date=October 2015}} Many people who are addicted to alcohol or prescribed benzodiazepines decide to quit when it is explained to them they have a choice between ongoing ill mental health or quitting and recovering from their symptoms. It was noted that because every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs, what one person can tolerate without ill health will cause another to suffer very ill health, and that even moderate drinking in sensitive individuals can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol or benzodiazepines will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Recovery from benzodiazepine dependence tends to take a lot longer than recovery from alcohol but people can regain their previous good health.&lt;ref name="pmid7769598"&gt;primary research citation --&gt; {{mcn|date=October 2015}}{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen SI | title = Alcohol and benzodiazepines generate anxiety, panic and phobias | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–7 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7769598 | pmc = 1295099 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the literature regarding benzodiazepine [[hypnotic]] drugs concluded that these drugs cause an unjustifiable risk to the individual and to public health.

A study of 50 patients who attended a benzodiazepine withdrawal clinic found that long-term use of benzodiazepines causes a wide range of psychological and physiological disorders. It was found that, after several years of chronic benzodiazepine use, a large portion of patients developed various mental and physical health problems including [[agoraphobia]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[paraesthesiae]], increasing anxiety, and [[panic attacks]], which were not preexisting. The mental health and physical health symptoms induced by long-term benzodiazepine use gradually improved significantly over a period of a year following completion of a slow withdrawal. Three of the 50 patients had wrongly been given a preliminary diagnosis of [[multiple sclerosis]] when the symptoms were actually due to chronic benzodiazepine use. Ten of the patients had taken [[drug overdoses]] whilst on benzodiazepines, despite the fact that only two of the patients had any prior history of depressive symptomatology. After withdrawal, no patients took any further overdoses after 1 year post-withdrawal. The cause of the deteriorating mental and physical health in a significant proportion of patients was hypothesised to be caused by increasing tolerance where withdrawal-type symptoms emerged, despite the administration of stable prescribed doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Ashton CH | url =http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzoc.htm | year =1987 | title =Benzodiazepine Withdrawal: Outcome in 50 Patients | journal =British Journal of Addiction | volume =82 | pages =655–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that chronic benzodiazepine use causes subtle increasing toxicity, which in turn leads to increasing psychopathology in long-term users of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michelini S, Cassano GB, Frare F, Perugi G | title = Long-term use of benzodiazepines: tolerance, dependence and clinical problems in anxiety and mood disorders | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 127–34 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8858711 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-979558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term use of benzodiazepines can induce [[perceptual]] disturbances and [[depersonalisation]] in some people, even in those taking a stable daily dosage, and it can also become a [[protracted withdrawal]] feature of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashton H | title = Protracted withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines | journal = Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment | volume = 8 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 19–28 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1675688 | doi = 10.1016/0740-5472(91)90023-4 | url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashpws.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, chronic use of benzodiazepines is a risk factor for [[blepharospasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakakura M, Tsubouchi T, Inouye J | title = Etizolam and benzodiazepine induced blepharospasm | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–7 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14966178 | pmc = 1738986 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2003.019869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug-induced symptoms that resemble withdrawal-like effects can occur on a set dosage as a result of prolonged use, also documented with [[barbiturate]]-like substances, as well as alcohol and [[benzodiazepines]]. This demonstrates that the effects from chronic use of benzodiazepine drugs is not unique but occurs with other GABAergic sedative hypnotic drugs, i.e., alcohol and barbiturates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cookson JC | title = Rebound exacerbation of anxiety during prolonged tranquilizer ingestion | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 88 | issue = 9 | pages = 544 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 7562864 | pmc = 1295346 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immune system===
Chronic use of benzodiazepines seemed to cause significant immunological disorders in a study of selected outpatients attending a psychopharmacology department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lechin F, van der Dijs B, Vitelli-Flores G, Báez S, Lechin ME, Lechin AE, Orozco B, Rada I, León G, Jiménez V | title = Peripheral blood immunological parameters in long-term benzodiazepine users | journal = Clinical Neuropharmacology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 7908607 | doi = 10.1097/00002826-199402000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diazepam and clonazepam have been found to have long-lasting, but not permanent, immunotoxic effects in the fetus of pregnant rats. However, single very high doses of diazepam have been found to cause lifelong immunosuppression in neonatal rats. No studies have been done to assess the immunotoxic effects of diazepam in humans; however, high prescribed doses of diazepam, in humans, has been found to be a major risk of pneumonia, based on a study of people with tetanus. It has been proposed that diazepam may cause long-lasting changes to the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors with resultant long-lasting disturbances to behaviour, [[endocrine]] function and immune function.&lt;ref name="Luebke-"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luebke RW, Chen DH, Dietert R, Yang Y, King M, Luster MI | title = The comparative immunotoxicity of five selected compounds following developmental or adult exposure | journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health.

===Suicide and self-harm===
Use of prescribed benzodiazepines is associated with an increased rate of attempted and completed [[suicide]].

===Carcinogenicity===
There has been some controversy around the possible link between benzodiazepine use and development of cancer; early cohort studies in the 1980s suggested a possible link, but follow-up case-control studies have found no link between benzodiazepines and cancer. In the second U.S. national cancer study in 1982, the [[American Cancer Society]] conducted a survey of over 1.1 million participants. A marked increased risk of cancer was found in the users of sleeping pills, mainly benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=eurekah.section.28844| title = Mortality Associated with Prescription Hypnotics| author = Daniel F. Kripke| publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information| location = USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been 15 [[epidemiologic]] studies that have suggested that [[benzodiazepine]] or [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drug use is associated with increased [[Mortality rate|mortality]], mainly due to increased [[cancer]] deaths in [[humans]]. The cancers included cancer of the [[brain]], [[lung]], [[bowel]], [[breast]], and [[bladder]], and other [[neoplasms]]. It has been hypothesised that either depressed immune function or the viral infections themselves were the cause of the increased rates of cancer.

A publication has asked in 1981 if [[lorazepam]] is more toxic than [[diazepam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Hiele LJ | title = [Can lorazepam be distinguished from other short-acting benzodiazepines in regard to brain damage and withdrawal symptoms?] | language = Dutch, Flemish | journal = Nederlands Tijdschrift Voor Geneeskunde | volume = 125 | issue = 4 | pages = 156 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 6111030 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study in 1984, 20 patients having taken long-term benzodiazepines were submitted to brain CT scan examinations. Some scans appeared abnormal. The mean [[ventricular-brain ratio]] measured by planimetry was increased over mean values in an age- and sex-matched group of control subjects but was less than that in a group of alcoholics. There was no significant relationship between CT scan appearances and the duration of benzodiazepine therapy. The clinical significance of the findings was unclear.&lt;ref name=pmid6143338&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lader MH, Ron M, Petursson H | title = Computed axial brain tomography in long-term benzodiazepine users | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 203–6 | date = February 1984 | pmid = 6143338 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700003214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, it was presumed that permanent brain damage may result from chronic use of benzodiazepines similar to [[alcohol-related brain damage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lennane KJ | title = Treatment of benzodiazepine dependence | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 144 | issue = 11 | pages = 594–7 | date = May 1986 | pmid = 2872582 | url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/lennane.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, 17 high-dose inpatient abusers of benzodiazepines have anecdotally shown enlarged [[cerebrospinal fluid]] spaces with associated brain shrinkage.
Brain shrinkage reportedly appeared to be dose dependent with low-dose users having less brain shrinkage than higher-dose users.&lt;ref name=pmid2893406&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmauss C, Krieg JC | title = Enlargement of cerebrospinal fluid spaces in long-term benzodiazepine abusers | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 869–73 | date = November 1987 | pmid = 2893406 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700000660 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a CT study in 1987 found no evidence of brain shrinkage in prescribed benzodiazepine users.&lt;ref name=pmid2888147&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perera KM, Powell T, Jenner FA | title = Computerized axial tomographic studies following long-term use of benzodiazepines | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 775–7 | date = August 1987 | pmid = 2888147 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700026003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, in a 4- to 6-year follow-up study of 30 inpatient benzodiazepine abusers, [[Neuropsychological]] function was found to be permanently affected in some chronic high-dose abusers of benzodiazepines. [[Brain damage]] similar to [[alcoholic]] brain damage was observed. The [[CT scan]] abnormalities showed dilatation of the [[ventricular system]]. However, unlike alcoholics, sedative hypnotic abusers showed no evidence of widened [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]]. The study concluded that, when [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] disorder is diagnosed in sedative hypnotic benzodiazepine abusers, it is often permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergman H, Borg S, Engelbrektson K, Vikander B | title = Dependence on sedative-hypnotics: neuropsychological impairment, field dependence and clinical course in a 5-year follow-up study | journal = British Journal of Addiction | volume = 84 | issue = 5 | pages = 547–53 | date = May 1989 | pmid = 2743035 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00612.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CT study in 1993 investigated brain damage in benzodiazepine users and found no overall differences to a healthy control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moodley P, Golombok S, Shine P, Lader M | title = Computed axial brain tomograms in long-term benzodiazepine users | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–44 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 8105500 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1781(93)90037-H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2000 found that long-term benzodiazepine therapy does not result in brain abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Busto UE, Bremner KE, Knight K, terBrugge K, Sellers EM | title = Long-term benzodiazepine therapy does not result in brain abnormalities | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–6 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10653201 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-200002000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Withdrawal from high-dose abuse of [[nitrazepam]] anecdotally was alleged in 2001 to have caused severe [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] of the whole brain with diffuse slow activity on [[EEG]] in one patient after 25 years of abuse. After withdrawal, abnormalities in hypofrontal brain wave patterns persisted beyond the withdrawal syndrome, which suggested to the authors that organic brain damage occurred from chronic high-dose abuse of nitrazepam.&lt;ref name="pmid11900604"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitabayashi Y, Ueda H, Narumoto J, Iizumi H, Tsuchida H, Murata N, Nakajima S, Fukui K | title = Chronic high-dose nitrazepam dependence 123I-IMP SPECT and EEG studies | journal = Addiction Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–261 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11900604 | doi = 10.1080/13556210120056507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Heather Ashton, a leading expert on benzodiazepines from [[Newcastle University]] Institute of Neuroscience, has stated that there is no structural damage from benzodiazepines, and advocates for further research into long-lasting or possibly permanent symptoms of long-term use of benzodiazepines as of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashprop.htm | title = Long-Term Effects of Benzodiazepine Usage: Research Proposals, 1995–96 |access-date=10 December 2008 | author = Ashton CH | publisher = benzo.org.uk | location = University of Newcastle – School of Neurosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has stated that she believes that the most likely explanation for lasting symptoms is persisting but slowly resolving functional changes at the [[GABAA|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[benzodiazepine receptor]] level. Newer and more detailed brain scanning technologies such as PET scans and MRI scans had as of 2002 to her knowledge never been used to investigate the question of whether benzodiazepines cause functional or structural brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashanswer.htm |title=NO EVIDENCE THAT BENZODIAZEPINES ARE "LOCKED UP" IN TISSUES FOR YEARS |access-date=10 December 2008 | author = Ashton CH | date = 29 August 2002 | publisher = benzo.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 studies have found an association between the use of benzodiazepines and an increased risk of dementia but the exact nature of the relationship is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Janna|title=Benzodiazepine use is associated with Alzheimer's disease, study finds|journal=The Pharmaceutical Journal|date=27 September 2014|volume=293|issue=7829|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news/benzodiazepine-use-is-associated-with-alzheimers-disease-finds-study/20066461.article|access-date=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study found no such effects.&lt;ref name=pmid26837813/&gt;

==History==
Benzodiazepines when introduced in 1961 were widely believed to be safe drugs but as the decades went by increased awareness of [[adverse effects]] connected to their long-term use became known. There was initially widespread public approval but this was followed by widespread public disapproval, and recommendations for more restrictive medical guidelines followed.&lt;ref name=pmid19524858&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall KP, Georgievskava Z, Georgievsky I | title = Social reactions to Valium and Prozac: a cultural lag perspective of drug diffusion and adoption | journal = Research in Social &amp; Administrative Pharmacy | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–107 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19524858 | doi = 10.1016/j.sapharm.2008.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid9780123&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Use and abuse of benzodiazepines | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 551–62 | year = 1998 | pmid = 6605211 | pmc = 2536139 | doi = 10.1097/00007691-199810000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns regarding the long-term effects of benzodiazepines have been raised since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edwards RA, Medlicott RW | title = Advantages and disadvantages of benzodiazepine prescription | journal = The New Zealand Medical Journal | volume = 92 | issue = 671 | pages = 357–9 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 6109269 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are still not fully answered. A review in 2006 of the literature on use of benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of hypnotic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bain KT | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Pharmacotherapy | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–92 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the problems of benzodiazepines are related to their long-term use rather than their short-term use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashton H | title = Guidelines for the rational use of benzodiazepines.

In 2007, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] recommended that individuals on long-term benzodiazepines be monitored at least every 3 months and also recommended against long-term substitution therapy in benzodiazepine drug misusers due to a lack of [[evidence base]] for effectiveness and due to the risks of long-term use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nta.nhs.uk/publications/documents/clinical_guidelines_2007.pdf |title=Drug misuse and dependence – UK guidelines on clinical management |author=National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse |authorlink=National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse |year=2007 |publisher=Department of Health |location=United Kingdom |page= |pages= |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term effects of benzodiazepines are very similar to the [[long-term effects of alcohol]] (apart from organ toxicity) and other sedative-hypnotics. Withdrawal effects and dependence are almost identical. A report in 1987 by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Great Britain reported that any benefits of long-term use of benzodiazepines are likely to be far outweighed by the risks of long-term use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gitlow |first1=Stuart |title=Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbrSdWVerBUC |edition=2nd |date=1 October 2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-6998-3 |pages=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this benzodiazepines are still widely prescribed.

===Political controversy===
In 1980, the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)]] recommended that research be conducted into the effects of long-term use of benzodiazepines&lt;ref name=bdmrch2005/&gt; A 2009 [[British Government]] [[parliamentary inquiry]] recommended that research into the long-term effects of benzodiazepines must be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Appgotcreport.pdf |title=All-Party Parliamentary Drugs Misuse Group – An Inquiry into Physical Dependence and Addiction to Prescription and Over-the-Counter Medication |access-date=21 January 2009 |author=DrugScope |author2=Gemma Reay |author3=Dr Brian Iddon MP  |authorlink=DrugScope |quote=2007–2008 |format=PDF |publisher=DrugScope.org.uk |location=UK |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of the Department of Health is that they have made every effort to make doctors aware of the problems associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/18/benzodiazepines#S6CV0157P0_19890718_CWA_298 |title=Benzodiazepines |author=Dawn Primarolo |authorlink=Dawn Primarolo |author2=[[David Mellor]]  |date=18 July 1989 |publisher=Hansard, UK Parliament |location=United Kingdom }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the dangers of benzodiazepine drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1998/may/06/benzodiazepines-1#S6CV0311P0_19980506_CWA_243 |title=Benzodiazepines |author=Audrey Wise |authorlink=Audrey Wise |author2=[[Alan Milburn]]  |date=6 May 1998 |publisher=Handsard, UK Parliament |location=United Kingdom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]]'s [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] issued guidance restricting the use of benzodiazepines to short-term use and updated and strengthened these warnings in 1988. When asked by [[Phil Woolas]] in 1999 whether the Department of Health had any plans to conduct research into the long-term effects of benzodiazepines, the Department replied, saying they have no plans to do so, as benzodiazepines are already restricted to short-term use and monitored by regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1999/nov/11/benzodiazepine#S6CV0337P0_19991111_CWA_817 |title=Benzodiazepine |author=Yvette Cooper |authorlink=Yvette Cooper |author2=[[Phil Woolas]]  |date=11 November 1999 |publisher=Handsard, UK Parliament |location=United Kingdom }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate, Phil Woolas has claimed that there has been a cover-up with regard to the problems associated with benzodiazepines because they are of too large of a scale for governments, regulatory bodies, and the pharmaceutical industry to deal with. [[John Hutton (Labour MP)|John Hutton]] stated in response that the Department of Health take the problems of benzodiazepines extremely seriously and are not sweeping the issue under the carpet.&lt;ref name=bparl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991207/halltext/91207h02.htm |title=Benzodiazepines |author=Mr. Phil Woolas |authorlink=Phil Woolas |author2=Mr. John Hutton |authorlink2=John Hutton (Labour MP)  |date=7 Dec 1999 |publisher=www.parliament.uk |location=England |quote=The story of benzodiazepines is of awesome proportions and has been described as a national scandal.

Additionally the APPGITA complaint alleged that there is a "virtual prohibition" on the collection of statistical information on benzodiazepines across government departments, whereas with other controlled drugs there are enormous volumes of statistical data. The complaint alleged that the discrimination is deliberate, large scale and that government departments are aware of what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.addictiontoday.org/files/appg-ita-submission-to-ehrc.pdf |title=ALL-PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP ON INVOLUNTARY TRANQUILLISER ADDICTION, SUBMISSION TO EQUALITIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION |author=Michael Behan |author2=[[Jim Dobbin]]  |date=20 July 2009 |publisher=AddictionToday.org |quote=The discrimination is large scale, long-standing and deliberate.

====Declassified Medical Research Council meeting====
The [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] held a closed meeting among top UK medical doctors and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry between the dates of 30 October 1980 and 3 April 1981. The meeting was classified under the [[Public Records Act 1958]] until 2014 but became available in 2005 as a result of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]]. The meeting was called due to concerns that 10–100,000 people could be dependent; meeting chairman Professor Malcolm Lader later revised this estimate to include approximately half a million members of the British public suspected of being dependent on therapeutic dose levels of benzodiazepines, with about half of those on long-term benzodiazepines. It was reported that benzodiazepines may be the third- or fourth-largest drug problem in the UK (the largest being alcohol and tobacco). The Chairman of the meeting followed up after the meeting with additional information, which was forwarded to the Medical Research Council neuroscience board, raising concerns regarding tests that showed definite cortical atrophy in 2 of 14 individuals tested and borderline abnormality in five others. He felt that, due to the methodology used in assessing the scans, the abnormalities were likely an underestimate, and more refined techniques would be more accurate. Also discussed were findings that tolerance to benzodiazepines can be demonstrated by injecting diazepam into long-term users; in normal subjects, increases in [[growth hormone]] occurs, whereas in benzodiazepine-tolerant individuals this effect is blunted. Also raised were findings in animal studies that showed the development of tolerance in the form of a 15 percent reduction in binding capacity of benzodiazepines after seven days administration of high doses of the partial agonist benzodiazepine drug [[flurazepam]] and a 50 percent reduction in binding capacity after 30 days of a low dose of diazepam. The Chairman was concerned that papers soon to be published would "stir the whole matter up" and wanted to be able to say that the Medical Research Council "had matters under consideration if questions were asked in parliament". The Chairman felt that it "was very important, politically that the MRC should be 'one step ahead'" and recommended epidemiological studies be funded and carried out by Roche Pharmaceuticals and MRC sponsored research conducted into the biochemical effects of long-term use of benzodiazepines. The meeting aimed to identify issues that were likely to arise, alert the Department of Health to the scale of the problem and identify the pharmacology and nature of benzodiazepine dependence and the volume of benzodiazepines being prescribed. The [[World Health Organization]] was also interested in the problem and it was felt the meeting would demonstrate to the WHO that the MRC was taking the issue seriously. Among the psychological effects of long-term use of benzodiazepines discussed was a reduced ability to cope with stress. The Chairman stated that the "withdrawal symptoms from valium were much worse than many other drugs including, e.g., heroin". It was stated that the likelihood of withdrawing from benzodiazepines was "reduced enormously" if benzodiazepines were prescribed for longer than four months. It was concluded that benzodiazepines are often prescribed inappropriately, for a wide range of conditions and situations. Dr Mason ([[Department of Health (UK)|DHSS]]) and Dr Moir ([[SHHD]]) felt that, due to the large numbers of people using benzodiazepines for long periods of time, it was important to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of benzodiazepines before deciding what regulatory action to take.&lt;ref name=bdmrch2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lader |last2=Morgan |last3=Shepherd |first4=Paul |last4=Williams |last5=Skegg |last6=Parish |first7=Peter |last7=Tyrer |last8=Inman |first9=John |last9=Marks |first10=Peter |last10=Harris |first11=Tom |last11=Hurry |date=1980 |title=Benzodiazepine dependence : papers, notes and correspondence; report of an ad-hoc meeting held on 23rd September 1981 submitted to Neuro Board in January 1982 and subsequent correspondence |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |location=England |url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=7798554&amp;j=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy resulted in 2010 when the previously secret files came to light over the fact that the Medical Research Council was warned that benzodiazepines prescribed to millions of patients appeared to cause brain shrinkage similar to alcohol abuse in some patients and failed to carry out larger and more rigorous studies. ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' reported allegations that "scores" of the 1.5 million members of the UK public who use benzodiazepines long-term have symptoms that are consistent with brain damage. It has been described as a "huge scandal" by [[Jim Dobbin]], and legal experts and MPs have predicted a class action lawsuit. A solicitor said she was aware of the past failed litigation against the drug companies and the relevance the documents had to that court case and said it was strange that the documents were kept 'hidden' by the MRC.&lt;ref name=dltbd30ya&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html |title=Drugs linked to brain damage 30 years ago |author=Nina Lakhani |date=7 November 2010 |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |location=United Kingdom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Lader, who chaired the MRC meeting, declined to speculate as to why the MRC declined to support his request to set up a unit to further research benzodiazepines and why they did not set up a special safety committee to look into these concerns. Professor Lader stated that he regrets not being more proactive on pursuing the issue, stating that he did not want to be labeled as the guy who pushed only issues with benzos. Professor Ashton also submitted proposals for grant-funded research using MRI, EEG, and cognitive testing in a randomized controlled trial to assess whether benzodiazepines cause permanent damage to the brain, but similarly to Professor Lader was turned down by the MRC.&lt;ref name=dltbd30ya/&gt;

The MRC spokesperson said they accept the conclusions of Professor Lader's research and said that they fund only research that meets required quality standards of scientific research, and stated that they were and continue to remain receptive to applications for research in this area. No explanation was reported for why the documents were sealed by the Public Records Act.&lt;ref name=dltbd30ya/&gt;

Jim Dobbin, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, stated that:
{{quote|text=Many victims have lasting physical, cognitive and psychological problems even after they have withdrawn. We are seeking legal advice because we believe these documents are the bombshell they have been waiting for. The MRC must justify why there was no proper follow-up to Professor Lader's research, no safety committee, no study, nothing to further explore the results. We are talking about a huge scandal here.&lt;ref name=dltbd30ya/&gt;}}

The legal director of [[Action Against Medical Accidents]] said urgent research must be carried out and said that, if the results of larger studies confirm Professor Lader's research, the government and MRC could be faced with one of the biggest group actions for damages the courts have ever seen, given the large number of people potentially affected. People who report enduring symptoms post-withdrawal such as neurological pain, headaches, cognitive impairment, and memory loss have been left in the dark as to whether these symptoms are drug-induced damage or not due to the MRC's inaction, it was reported. Professor Lader reported that the results of his research did not surprise his research group given that it was already known that alcohol could cause permanent brain changes.&lt;ref name=dltbd30ya/&gt;

====Class-action lawsuit====
Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they were responsible for the largest-ever [[class-action lawsuit]] against [[drugs manufacturers|drug manufacturers]] in the United Kingdom, in the 1980s and early 1990s, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 [[law firms]] that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of [[benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]] and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name="King-1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = King MB | title = Is there still a role for benzodiazepines in general practice? | journal = The British Journal of General Practice | volume = 42 | issue = 358 | pages = 202–5 | date = May 1992 | pmid = 1389432 | pmc = 1372025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; [[legal aid]] had been withdrawn, leading to the collapse of the trial, and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the [[British law]], making class-action lawsuits more difficult.&lt;ref name="urlHouse of Commons"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmhealth/549/99072723.htm |title=Memorandum by Dr Reg Peart |author=Peart R |date=1999-06-01 |website=Minutes of Evidence |publisher=Select Committee on Health, House of Commons, UK Parliament |access-date=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicting findings have been found in babies exposed to benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=pmid10082073&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00002018-199920020-00006 |title=Treatment of Anxiety During Pregnancy |journal=Drug Safety |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=171–186 |year=1999 |last1=McGrath |first1=Caroline |last2=Buist |first2=Anne |last3=Norman |first3=Trevor R | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent analysis of the Swedish Medical Birth Register found an association with preterm births, low birth weight and a moderate increased risk for congental malformations. An increase in pylorostenosis or [[alimentary tract]] [[atresia]] was seen. An increase in orofacial clefts was not demonstrated, however, and it was concluded that benzodiazepines are not major teratogens.&lt;ref name=pmid17894421&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wikner BN, Stiller CO, Bergman U, Asker C, Källén B | title = Use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists during pregnancy: neonatal outcome and congenital malformations | journal = Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 1203–10 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17894421 | doi = 10.1002/pds.1457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurodevelopmental disorders]] and clinical symptoms are commonly found in babies exposed to benzodiazepines [[in utero]]. Benzodiazepine-exposed babies have a [[low birth weight]] but catch up to normal babies at an early age, but smaller head circumferences found in benzo babies persists. Other adverse effects of benzodiazepines taken during pregnancy are deviating [[neurodevelopmental]] and clinical symptoms including [[craniofacial]] anomalies, delayed development of pincer grasp, deviations in [[muscle tone]] and pattern of movements. Motor impairments in the babies are impeded for up to 1 year after birth. Gross [[motor development]] impairments take 18 months to return to normal but fine motor function impairments persist.&lt;ref name=pmid1351263&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laegreid L, Hagberg G, Lundberg A | title = Neurodevelopment in late infancy after prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines--a prospective study | journal = Neuropediatrics | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 60–7 | date = April 1992 | pmid = 1351263 | doi = 10.1055/s-2008-1071314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the smaller head circumference found in benzodiazepine-exposed babies [[mental retardation]], functional deficits, long-lasting behavioural anomalies, and [[lower intelligence]] occurs.&lt;ref name=pmid1983095&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000457644 |title=Clinical Observations in Children after Prenatal Benzodiazepine Exposure |journal=Developmental Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=15 |issue=3–4 |pages=186–188 |year=1990 |last1=Laegreid |first1=Liv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid1685467&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karkos J | title = [The neurotoxicity of benzodiazepines] | journal = Fortschritte Der Neurologie-Psychiatrie | volume = 59 | issue = 12 | pages = 498–520 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1685467 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-1000726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzodiazepines, like many other sedative hypnotic drugs, cause [[apoptotic]] [[neuronal]] cell death.

There was a smaller subset of benzodiazepine-exposed children who were slower to develop, but by four years of age most of this subgroup of children had normalised. There was a small number of benzodiazepine-exposed children who had continuing developmental abnormalities at 4-year follow-up, but it was not possible to conclude whether these deficits were the result of benzodiazepines or whether social and environmental factors explained the continuing deficits.&lt;ref name=pmid7881198&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McElhatton PR | title = The effects of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and lactation | journal = Reproductive Toxicology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–75 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7881198 | doi = 10.1016/0890-6238(94)90029-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns regarding whether benzodiazepines during pregnancy cause major malformations, in particular cleft palate, have been hotly debated in the literature. A [[meta analysis]] of the data from [[cohort studies]] found no link but [[meta analysis]] of [[case–control studies]] did find a significant increase in major malformations. (However, the cohort studies were homogenous and the case–control studies were heterogeneous, thus reducing the strength of the case–control results). There have also been several reports that suggest that benzodiazepines have the potential to cause a syndrome similar to [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], but this has been disputed by a number of studies. As a result of conflicting findings, use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is controversial. The best available evidence suggests that benzodiazepines are not a major cause of [[birth defects]], i.e. major malformations or [[cleft lip]] or [[cleft palate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolovich LR, Addis A, Vaillancourt JM, Power JD, Koren G, Einarson TR | title = Benzodiazepine use in pregnancy and major malformations or oral cleft: meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies | journal = BMJ | volume = 317 | issue = 7162 | pages = 839–43 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9748174 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7162.839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Half-caste''' is a term for a category of people of [[Multiracial|mixed]] race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memidex.com/half-caste] Memidex/WordNet&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the term ''[[caste]]'', which comes from the Latin ''castus'', meaning pure, and the derivative Portuguese and Spanish ''casta'', meaning race. It can sometimes be used or seen as an offensive term (particularly in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands and parts of Asia), but this is not universal.{{Citation needed|reason=Ambiguous and perhaps not even fully verifiable statement. Needs some back-up at the very least, especially on the where.|date=August 2017}}

The terms ''half-caste'',  ''caste'', ''quarter-caste'', "mix-breed" etc. were widely used by ethnographers in British colonies to try to classify natives. In Latin America, the equivalent term for half-castes was ''[[Cholo]]'' and ''Zambo''.&lt;ref name=dodson&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Wentworth Lecture: The end in the beginning|author= Michael Dodson|journal=Australian Aboriginal Studies|year=1994|number=3|url=http://www.columbiauniversity.org/itc/polisci/juviler/pdfs/dodson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Race, Color, and Class in Central America and the Andes|author=Julian Pitt-Rivers|journal=Daedalus|volume= 96|number=2|date=Spring 1967|pages=542–559|publisher=The MIT Press|jstor=20027052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In Australia, the term ''half-caste'' was widely used in the 19th- and early-20th-century British commonwealth laws to refer to the offspring of white colonists and the Aboriginal natives of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.O. Neville|title=The Half-Caste in Australia. By A. O . Ncville, Esy., Former Commissioner of Native Affairs for Western Australia1|journal=Mankind|volume=4|number=7|date=September 1951|pages=274–290|doi=10.1111/j.1835-9310.1951.tb00251.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Aborigines Protection Act of 1886 mentioned half-castes habitually associating with or living with an Aboriginal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aborigines Protection Act of 1886|publisher=Museum Victoria, Australia|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/encounters/coranderrk/legislation/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Aborigines Amendments between 1934 and 1937 refer to it in various terms, including as a person with less than [[quadroon]] blood.&lt;ref name=cs1&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal timeline (1900 - 1969)|publisher=Creative Spirits NGO|url=http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/history/aboriginal-history-timeline-early-20th.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later literature, such as by Tindale, refers to it in terms of half, quadroon, octoroon, and other hybrids.

The term ''half-caste'' was not merely a term of legal convenience. It became a term of common cultural discourse and appeared even in religious records. For example, John Harper notes, from records of Woolmington Christian mission, that half-castes and anyone with any aborigine connection were considered "degraded as to divine things, almost on a level with a brute, in a state of moral unfitness for heaven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Harper|title=Notes on a mission station at Batemans Bay, Woolmington|number=18|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Marginal Men: A Study of Two Half Caste Aborigines|author=Jeremy Beckett|journal=Oceania|volume=29|number=2|date=December 1958|pages=91–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was immortalized in the [[Half-Caste Act]] in which the Australian government could seize such children and forcibly remove them from their parents, theoretically to provide them with better homes than those afforded by typical Aborigines, where they could grow up to work as domestic servants and for social engineering.&lt;ref name=cs1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The barbarism of civilization: cultural genocide and the 'stolen generations'|author=Robert van Krieken|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|volume=50|number=2|pages=297–315|date=June 1999|doi=10.1080/000713199358752|pmid=15260027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutnyk/&gt; The removed children are known as [[Stolen Generations]]. Other British commonwealth Acts on half-castes and Aborigines enacted between 1909 and 1943 were also, in theory, called Welfare Acts, in statutes passed deprived these people of basic civil, political, and economic rights and made it illegal to enter public places such as pubs and government institutions, marry, or meet relatives.&lt;ref name=dodson/&gt;

==New Zealand==
The term ''half-caste'' to classify people based on their birth and ancestry became popular in New Zealand from the early 19th century. Terms such as ''Anglo-New Zealander'' suggested by John Polack in 1838, ''Utu Pihikete'' and ''Huipaiana'' were alternatively but less used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Meredith|title=A Half-Caste on the Half-Caste in the Cultural Politics of New Zealand|year=2001|url=http://lianz.waikato.ac.nz/PAPERS/paul/Paul%20Meredith%20Mana%20Verlag%20Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burma==
In Burma, a half-caste (or ''Kabya''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burmese Language Dictionary &amp; Translation (search for caste)|url=http://www.burmese-dictionary.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was anyone with mixed ethnicity from Burmese and British, or Burmese and Indian. During the British colonial rule, half-caste people were ostracized and criticized in literary and political media.  For example, a local publication in 1938 published the following:

{{quotation|"You Burmese women who fail to safeguard your own race, after you have married an Indian, your daughter whom you have begotten by such a tie takes an Indian as her husband.  As for your son, he becomes a '''half-caste''' and tries to get a pure Burmese woman. Not only you but your future generation also is those who are responsible for the ruination of the race."|An editorial in Burmese Press, 27 November 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burmese women who took Indians|publisher=Seq-than Journal|newspaper=Burma Press Abstract|date=5 December 1940 (IOR L/R/5/207)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, Pu Gale in 1939 wrote ''Kabya Pyatthana'' (literally: The Half-Caste Problem), censured Burmese women for enabling half-caste phenomenon, with the claim, "a Burmese woman’s degenerative intercourse with an Indian threatened a spiraling destruction of Burmese society." Such criticism was not limited to a few isolated instances, or just against Burmese girls (''thet khit thami''), Indians and British husbands. Starting in early 1930s through 1950s, there was an explosion of publications, newspaper articles and cartoons with such social censorship. Included in the criticism were Chinese-Burmese half-castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=GENDER, HISTORY AND MODERNITY: REPRESENTING WOMEN IN TWENTIETH CENTURY COLONIAL BURMA| author=Chie Ikeya|year=2006|publisher=Cornell University|url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/2537/1/CIdissertationpartone.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the explosion in censorship of half-castes in early-20th-century Burma, Thant claims inter-cultural couples such as Burmese-Indian marriages were encouraged by the local population. The situation began to change as colonial developments, allocation of land, rice mills and socio-economic privileges were given to European colonial officials and to Indians brought in Burma by the British with economic incentives. In the late 19th century, the British colonial administration viewed intermarriage as a socio-cultural problem. The colonial administration issued circulars prohibiting European officials from conjugal liaisons with indigenous women. In Burma, as in other colonies in Southeast Asia, intimate relations between colonized women and colonizing men, and the half-caste progeny of such unions were considered harmful to white minority rule founded upon carefully maintained racial hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Stoler|title=Carnal knowledge and imperial power: Race and the intimate in colonial rule. |publisher=University of California Press, Berkeley| year=1983|isbn=978-0520231115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The social world of Batavia: European and Eurasian in Dutch Asia|author= Jean Taylor|year=1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Penny Edwards|year=2002|title=Half Caste - staging race in British Burma|journal=Postcolonial Studies|volume=5|number=3|pages=279–295|doi=10.1080/1368879022000032793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Malaysia experiencing a wave of immigrations from China, the Middle East, India, and southeast Asia, and a wave of different colonial powers (Portuguese, Dutch, English), many other terms have been used for half-castes. Some of these include ''cap-ceng'', ''half-breed'', ''mesticos''. These terms are considered pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE PORTUGUESE COMMUNITY AT THE PERIPHERY: A MINORITY REPORT ON THE PORTUGUESE QUEST FOR BUMIPUTERA STATUS|author=Gerard Fernandis|journal=Kajian Malaysia|volume=XXI|number= 1&amp;2|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The White Man's Burden and Brown Humanity: Colonialism and Ethnicity in British Malaya|author=A.J.

Half-castes of Malaya and other British colonies in Asia have been part of non-fiction and fictional works. Brigitte Glaser notes that the half-caste characters in literary works of the 18th through 20th century were predominantly structured with prejudice, as degenerate, low, inferior, deviant or barbaric. Ashcroft in his review considers the literary work structure as consistent with morals and values of colonial era where the colonial powers considered people from different ethnic groups as unequal by birth in their abilities, character and potential, where laws were enacted that made sexual relations and marriage between ethnic groups as illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Racism, Slavery, and Literature (Editor: Wolfgang Zach, Ulrich Pallua)|author=Brigitte Glaser|pages=209–232|isbn=978-3631590454|publisher=Peter Lang GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Post-Colonial Studies: The Key Concepts|author=Ashcroft, Griffiths, Tiffin|year=2007|isbn=978-0415428552 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiji==

Fijian people of mixed descent were called half-caste, ''kailoma'' or ''vasu''. This started with British colonialism, and over time developed into a race conscious, segregated system of society. The colonial government viewed this as a “race problem.” It created a privileged underclass of semi-Europeans who lived on the social fringes in the colonial ordering of Fiji. This legacy continues to affect the ethnic and racial discourse in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Histories of Diversity: Kailoma Testimonies and ‘Part-European’ Tales from Colonial Fiji|author=Lucy Bruce|journal=Journal of Intercultural Studies|volume=28|issue=1|year=2007| pages=113–127|doi=10.1080/07256860601082970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kailomas'' or ''vasus'' were children born to a [[Fiji|Fijian native]] and European or [[Indians in Fiji|indentured laborers]] brought in by the colonial government to work on sugarcane plantations over a century ago. Over the generations, these half-caste people experienced a harsh, shunned and a bizarre social treatment from the colonial obsession with herding citizens into separate, tidy, racial boxes, which led to the separation of Fijian mixed-bloods from their natural families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Telling Pacific Lives (see: Section 2 of Chapter 7.

==South Africa==
[[File:Mestizo.jpg|thumb|In the 19th century, paintings of half-caste people were in demand and eagerly traded in Europe. Above painting shows [[Mestizo]] with caption.]]
Sociological literature on South Africa, in pre-British, British colonial and Apartheid era refers to half-caste as anyone born from admixing of White and people of color. An alternate, less common term, for half-caste was ''Mestizzo'' (conceptually similar to [[Mestizo]] in Latin American colonies).&lt;ref name=berghe&gt;{{cite book|title=South Africa: A Study in Conflict|author=Pierre van den Berghe|publisher=University of California Press|year=1967|pages=13–25|isbn=978-0520012943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Griqua people|Griqua]]'' (Afrikaans: ''Griekwa'') is another term for half-caste people from intermixing in South Africa and Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The imperial factor in South Africa in the nineteenth century: Towards a reassessment|journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History (Special Issue: the Partition of Africa)|volume=3| issue=1|year=1974|doi=10.1080/03086537408582423| author=Atmore &amp; Marks| pages=105–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People of mixed descent, the half-caste, were considered inferior and slaves by birth in the 19th-century hierarchically arranged, closed colonial social stratification system of South Africa. This was the case even if the father or mother of half-caste person was a European.&lt;ref name=berghe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Percival|title=An account of the Cape of Good Hope|publisher=Baldwin|year=1804|isbn=978-0217773904|url=https://archive.org/stream/anaccountcapego00percgoog#page/n4/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O.F.

==British Central Africa==
[[British Central Africa Protectorate|British Central Africa]], now part Malawi and part Zimbabwe, referred to people of mixed descent as half-castes. These unions were considered improper, mixed couples segregated and shunned, and the colonial courts ruled against mixed marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Half Caste|date=February 17, 1904|publisher=Boston News|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19040217&amp;id=F-M0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3eAIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4141,2297933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE 'NATIVE' UNDEFINED: COLONIAL CATEGORIES, ANGLO-AFRICAN STATUS AND THE POLITICS OF KINSHIP IN BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA|author=C.

==United Kingdom==
In today's United Kingdom, the term primarily applies to those of mixed Black and White parentage,&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-Caste, Bi-racial, Mixed-Race or Black?| author=J. Hill|year=2010|url=http://www.colorfultimes.com/2010/03/society/race-society/ethnicity-identity/halfcaste-biracial-mixedrace-black/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such was not always the case. In just about any area that fell under the crown's dominion, the term was made use of, and anyone of mixed Caucasian and conquered races could be properly described as being half-caste.

In the UK the term ''half-caste'' is generally considered more offensive than mixed-race because it implies being ‘half pure’ (the connotation being that the white half is the pure half). The term denies the mixed race person a section of their heritage by reducing them to half of a race. &lt;ref name="Hill2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Philanthropic racism in Britain: The Liverpool university settlement, the anti‐slavery society and the issue of 'half‐caste' children|author=Paul Rich|journal=Immigrants &amp; Minorities|volume=3|issue=1|pages=69|year=1984|doi=10.1080/02619288.1984.9974570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Landes notes that half-castes born in Britain of colonial fathers felt rootless in the society in which they lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biracialism in American Society: A Comparative View|author=RUTH LANDES|journal=American Anthropologist | volume=57| issue=6 |pages=1253–1263|date=December 1955|doi=10.1525/aa.1955.57.6.02a00150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Peter J. Aspinall]] argues that the term's origins lie in 19th-century British colonial administrations, with it evolving into a descriptor of people of mixed race or ethnicity, "usually encompassing 'White'", in the 20th century. From the 1920s to 1960s, he argues it was "used in Britain as a derogatory racial category associated with the moral condemnation of '[[miscegenation]]'".&lt;ref name=Aspinall&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Social Evolution of the Term 'Half-Caste' in Britain: The Paradox of its Use as Both Derogatory Racial Category and Self-Descriptor|first=Peter J.|last=Aspinall|journal=Journal of Historical Sociology|volume=26|issue=4|pages=503–526|year=2013|doi=10.1111/johs.12033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term half-caste is considered offensive today. The National Union of Journalists ratified guidelines for race reporting instructs journalists to 'avoid words that, although common in the past, are now considered offensive, e.g. half-caste and coloured. Ask people how they define themselves. Check if a person identifies as mixed-race or Black'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/updated-nuj-race-reporting-guidelines-and-efj-manifesto/|title=Updated NUJ race reporting guidelines and EFJ manifesto|website=National Union of Journalists|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; NHS Editorial guidance states documents should 'Avoid offensive and stereotyping words such as coloured, half-caste and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/aboutnhschoices/documents/nhs_choiceseditorial_style_guide_v2.1.pdf|title=NHS Choices, Editorial Style Guide V2.1|last=NHS|first=NHS Choices|date=|website=NHS Choices|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
While the term ''half-caste'' tends to evoke the understanding of it referring to the offspring of two persons of two different pure bloods or near pure bloods, in other languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, the words ''half-caste'' and ''mixed ethnicity'' or ''multi-ethnic'' are the same word, ''hun-xue'' (混血).

==Half-caste in other languages==
[[File:Zambo.jpg|thumb|The term ''half-caste'' was widely used by colonial administrators in the 19th- and 20th-century British empire. In Spanish colonies, other terms were in use for half-caste people; above painting, for example, shows a Zamba. The caption India in the painting refers to native Indian American woman.]]
The term ''half-caste'' was common in British colonies, however not exclusive. Other colonial governments such as Spain devised terms for the mixed-race children. The Spanish colonies devised a complex system of [[casta]]s, consisting of [[Mulattoes]], [[Mestizos]], and many others. The French colonies used terms such as [[Métis]], while the Portuguese used the term ''[[Mestiço]]''. French colonies in the [[Caribbean]] referred to half-caste people as ''Chabine'' (female) and ''Chabin'' (male). Before the American Civil War, the term [[Métis people (United States)|''mestee'']] was common for certain people of mixed descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wallace Gesner|title=Habitants, Half-Breeds and Homeless Children: Transformations in Metis and Yankee-Yorker Relations in Early Michigan|journal=Michigan Historical Review'|volume=24|issue=1|date=Jan 1998|pages=23–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race, Gender, &amp; Comparative Black Modernism|author=Jennifer M. Wilks|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=978-0-8071-3364-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms in use in colonial era for half-castes included - creole, casco, cafuso, caburet, cattalo, citrange, griffe, half blood, half-bred, half-breed, high yellow, hinny, hybrid, ladino, liger, mamaluco, mixblood, mixed-blood, mongrel, mule, mustee, octoroon, plumcot, quadroon, quintroon, sambo, tangelo, xibaro. The difference between these terms of various European colonies usually was the [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] or [[casta|caste]] of the father and the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English people overseas|author=Aubrey Wyatt Tilby|authorlink=A.

[[Ann Laura Stoler]] has published a series of reviews of half-caste people and ethnic intermixing during the colonial era of human history. She states that colonial control was predicated on identifying who was white and who was native, which children could become citizens of the empire while who remained the subjects of the empire, who had hereditary rights of a progeny and who did not. This was debated by colonial administrators, then triggered regulations by the authorities. At the start of colonial empires, mostly males from Europe and then males of indentured laborers from India, China and southeast Asia went on these distant trips; in these early times, intermixing was accepted, approved and encouraged. Over time, differences were emphasized, and the colonial authorities proceeded to restrict, then disapprove and finally forbid sexual relationships between groups of people to maintain so-called purity of blood and limit inheritable rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ann Stoler|year=1989|title=Rethinking colonial categories: European communities and the boundaries of rule|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=31|number=1|pages=134–61|doi=10.1017/s0010417500015693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ann Stoler|year=1989|title=Making Empire respectable: The politics of race and morality in 20th century colonial cultures|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=16|number=4|pages=634–660|doi=10.1525/ae.1989.16.4.02a00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=INTERETHNIC UNIONS AND THE REGULATION OF SEX IN COLONIAL SAMOA, 1830-1945|author=PAUL SHANKMAN|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|volume=110|number= 2|date=June 2001|pages= 119–147|jstor=20706988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ann Stoler|year=1992|title=Sexual affronts and racial frontiers: European identities and the cultural politics of exclusion in colonial Southeast Asia|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume= 34|number=3|pages=514–551|doi=10.1017/s001041750001793x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Gold''' (December 11, 1910 – August 28, 1972) was a laboratory chemist and spy for a number of Soviet spy rings operating in the United States during the [[Manhattan Project]].

==Early life==
Harry Gold was born on December 11, 1910, in Bern, Switzerland to Samson and Celia Gold. When he was 4, his family immigrated to the United States. During that process, the family’s surname was changed from Golodnitsky to Gold. The Golds lived in Chicago for a year before moving, Samson going to Virginia and Celia taking Harry to Philadelphia. Soon, Samson moved to Philadelphia as well, and took up a job as a cabinetmaker at the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in Camden, New Jersey. In 1917, Gold’s mother gave birth to another son, and the family was described by many as quiet and stand-offish. Gold later described his childhood as happy and secure, and his intellectual appetite was insatiable. However, the injustices that both Gold and the members of his family faced due to their race and status left Gold with a tremendous resentment and an overwhelming desire to fight prejudice. Unfortunately, during these formative years in which he developed many insecurities, Gold developed an almost puppy-like eagerness to please, and would “literally do anything for his friends”. He developed a pronounced interest in chemistry and graduated from [[South Philadelphia High School]] in 1929.

==Early career==
After his high school graduation, Gold was offered a job by one of his father’s acquaintances at Giftcrafters, a woodworking firm in the Kensington section of the city. He did not want the life that his father lived, with the hard physical labor and blatant anti-Semitism that came along with it. While looking for new job opportunities, Gold applied for the Pennsylvania Sugar Company on the banks of the Delaware River, with the economic security and the exposure to college-educated chemists and state of the art labs were the most important qualities of this position. He saved enough money to attend the University of Pennsylvania and left the company. However, towards the beginning of Gold’s sophomore year, the Great Depression began across America, and due to his family’s continuing financial struggles, Gold voluntarily withdrew himself from university and managed to regain a job at the Pennsylvania Sugar Company, now the sole breadwinner for his family.

==Espionage==
Gold had expressed interest in the Socialist Party early in life, but by the Great Depression, he considered politics a luxury that he had little time for. However, Gold appeared to exhibit revulsion and incredulity when confronted with the Communist Party. Ten days before the Christmas of 1932, Gold was laid off by the sugar company. Both Harry and his father, Sam, looked for work each morning, always coming back with the same depressing results. With both of the primary breadwinners out of work, the Gold family was staring economic ruin in the face. Gold was offered a job by Tom Black, a former classmate, at the Holbrook Manufacturing Company in New Jersey who could arrange for Gold to take his place. Black immediately struck up a friendship with Gold, and began to insistently try to recruit him to the Communist Party. Due to his eager to please nature and the immense gratitude to Black for the friendship and funds he provided, Gold relented. He was in no way impressed, and continued to hold his views against the Party. When Gold found that the Pennsylvania Sugar Company was hiring at the same salary that he was currently getting paid, he immediately decided to move back to Philadelphia to the company and his family. Black, however, did not relent, coming to visit Gold and his family, all the while encouraging him to attend meetings and join. During this time, Gold managed to attend Drexel Institute of Technology, where he took night courses in chemistry. 
In 1940, [[Jacob Golos]] activated Harry Gold for Soviet espionage, but he was not a recruited agent of the [[rezidentura]]. This changed in the late 1940s, when [[NKVD|Soviet Case Officer]] [[Semyon Semenov]] appropriated Gold from Golos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Robert Chadwell|title=Klaus Fuchs: Atom Spy|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|ISBN=0-674-50507-7|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold became a formally recruited Soviet agent at this time, and was assigned the codename GUS, GOS, or GOOSE. Semenov remained Gold's control officer until March 1944.

In 1950, [[Klaus Fuchs]] was arrested in England and charged with espionage. Fuchs confessed that while working in the United States during World War II he had passed information about the [[atom bomb]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. Fuchs denied working with other spies, except for a courier who collected information from him. When initially shown photographs of suspects, including Gold, he failed to identify him as the courier, but did so after subsequent prompting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/redfiles/kgb/deep/interv/k_int_robert_lamphere.htm|title=Interview with Robert Lamphere|publisher=PBS.org|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under interrogation, Gold admitted that he had been involved in espionage since 1934 and had helped Fuchs pass information about the [[Manhattan Project]] to the Soviet Union by way of Soviet General Consul [[Anatoli Yakovlev]]. Gold's confession led to the arrest of [[David Greenglass]]. His testimony resulted in the arrest, trial, and execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Hornblum, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Gold was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. In May 1965, he was paroled after serving just under half of his sentence. In 1972, he died in Philadelphia, age 62;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alden|last=Whitman|title=1972 Death of Harry Gold Revealed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/14/archives/1972-death-of-harry-gold-revealed.html|quote=Harry Gold, who served 15 years in Federal prison as a confessed atomic spy courier, for Klaus Fuchs, a Soviet agent, and who was a key Government witness in the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg espionage case in 1951, died 18 months ago in Philadelphia.|work=[[New York Times]]|date=February 14, 1974|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was interred in [[Har Nebo Cemetery]] in [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania]].

'''Harvard Model Congress''' ('''HMC''') is the largest congressional simulation conference in the world, providing high school students from across the [[United States]] and abroad with an opportunity to experience American government firsthand. Although HMC is run entirely by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] undergraduates, it is a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] that is operated independently of the [[university]].

==Domestic Conferences==

Harvard Model Congress [[Boston]], founded in 1986, is the oldest of the HMC conferences and is held annually in downtown Boston. Each February, nearly 1,500 delegates descend into [[Boston]] to tackle the most pressing and important issues facing the nation as they assume roles in each of the three branches of the [[United States]] government and beyond. Exciting and diverse programs, ranging from committees in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], [[United States Senate|Senate]], and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], to special programs such as [[Mass media|press]], [[lobbyists]], and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], help bring American government to life and have established Harvard Model Congress Boston as one of the nation's premier American government simulation programs.

Founded in 2001, Harvard Model Congress [[San Francisco]] is an American government simulation program based on the successful Boston model and the first conference of its type on the West Coast. Over 300 delegates from across the country travel to HMCSF to learn about American government. The four-day conference, held in the San Francisco Financial District, is more intimate than the Boston conference and features a lower student-staff ratio and more individual attention from Harvard undergraduates. The conference was originally located in San Diego and subsequently moved to San Francisco, where it continues today.

==International Conferences==

[http://www.hmcdubai.org Harvard Model Congress Dubai] was founded in 2013.  This conference has a strong focus on presenting Congressional and international committees for a diverse set of international students.  Harvard Model Congress Dubai 2013 took place at the American University in Dubai, UAE from January 24–26.  It had the pleasure of hosting over 300 students from 11 different countries in its inaugural conference.

[http://www.hmcasia.org/ Harvard Model Congress Asia] was founded in 2004, holding an annual conference in mid-January (second weekend of January). HMC Asia 2014 took place in Hong Kong for the first time in its history, and has become the largest international conference, attracting nearly 600 students from 19 countries and 4 continents. Despite its size, HMC Asia boasts the lowest student-to-staff ratio of any of the model congress conferences. HMC Asia focuses on America's political system and international governmental institutions. The 2008 conference, supposed to held from September 4–6, was cancelled due to rebellion in Thailand. As the substitution for the cancelled 2008 HMCA, the 2009 session of Harvard Model Congress Asia was held in Seoul, Republic of Korea from January 22–24.

[http://www.hmceurope.org/ Harvard Model Congress Europe] was founded in 1987 and holds an annual conference in mid-March. Although it maintains a strong tradition of American government simulation with six congressional committees and several US government special programs like the Supreme Court, HMC Europe also has a strong focus on institutions of international governance, including (among others) the [[World Health Organization]], [[Group of 24]], and [[European Commission]]. HMC Europe 2017 hosted over 500 delegates from countries across Europe and the world, and the conference is looking forward to returning to Madrid in 2018.

[http://hmcla.org/ Harvard Model Congress Latin America] was founded in 2014, holding an annual conference near the end of August. The first HMC Latin America will take place in São Paulo, Brazil from August 21–24 at Centro Universitário Belas Artes de São Paulo. Although it maintains a strong tradition of American government simulation, HMC Latin America also includes committees specifically relevant to Latin America such as the [[Organization of American States]] and the Presidential Cabinet of Brazil.

In all international conferences, students discuss and debate international issues from a more global perspective, formulating policy firsthand. The structured committee settings expose them to the realities of the democratic process, challenging them to forge compromise while advancing the interests of their constituency. The conferences seek to provide an unparalleled educational experience for talented secondary school students from around the world, offering hundreds of students each year an exciting opportunity to practice public speaking and policy writing. The conferences accommodate students with varying degrees of English ability, and the global diversity of participants and staff offers delegates the unique opportunity to approach challenging issues from numerous different perspectives.

==Logistics==

Harvard Model Congress strives to prepare the next generation of democratic leaders and global citizens. Because of their sheer size, the Harvard Model Congress conferences require a large amount of planning by the students hosting the events. Harvard Model Congress is one of the largest Harvard [[student organizations]], and each year around 200 Harvard undergraduates assist with planning and running the conferences.

As soon as one Harvard Model Congress conference ends, planning for the subsequent such conference begins. For the Boston conference, topics for debate must be chosen by May so that briefing books can be prepared over the summer and distributed by early fall, in time to allow delegates to begin intensively researching each committee's topics for debate. Updates to briefings are written and distributed to schools by winter, and issue summaries are also provided to the delegates. HMC 2009 was HMC's first-ever [[paperless office|paperless]] conference. For the duration of the event each year, Harvard Model Congress uses essentially all of the conference space available at the Boston [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]]. Although most of the written work during the actual weekend of the event is done by the delegates, the staff continues to provide programmatic direction and manages all operations throughout the duration of the conference.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations". [[Emma Goldman]]. "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows: "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg".

There are many philosophical differences among anarchists concerning questions of ideology, values and strategy. Ideas about how anarchist societies should work vary considerably, especially with respect to [[Anarchist economics|economics]]. There are also disagreements about how such a society might be brought about—with some anarchists being committed to a strategy of nonviolence, while others advocate armed struggle.

==Definitional concerns==
Anarchist schools of thought encompass not only a range of individual schools, but also a considerable divergence in the use of some key [[terminology|terms]]. Some terms, such as "[[socialism]]", have been subject to multiple definitions and ideological struggle throughout the period of the development of anarchism. Others, such as "[[capitalism]]", are used in divergent and often contradictory ways by different schools within the tradition. In addition, the meanings of terms such as "[[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]" have changed over time, sometimes without spawning new schools. All of these terminological difficulties contribute to misunderstandings within and about anarchism.

A central concern is whether the term "anarchism" is defined in opposition to hierarchy, authority, the state or state and capitalism. Debates over the meaning of the term emerge from the fact that it refers to both an abstract philosophical position and to intellectual, political and institutional traditions, all of which have been fraught with conflict. Some minimal, abstract definitions encourage the inclusion of figures, movements and philosophical positions which have historically positioned themselves outside, or even in opposition to, individuals and traditions that have identified themselves as "anarchist".

[[Anti-capitalism]] is considered a necessary element of anarchism by most anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;anarchist survey highlighting a general opposition to capitalism {{cite web|url=http://www.anarchistsurvey.com/results/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314184800/http://www.anarchistsurvey.com/results/ |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky |first=Noam |title=On Capitalism |url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1991----02.htm |work=Chomsky.info |accessdate=26 November 2013 |year=1991 |quote=catastrophe of capitalism |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928043924/http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1991----02.htm |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is "anarcho-capitalism" a form of capitalism?|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionF|accessdate=26 November 2013|author=Anarchist FAQ collective}}&lt;/ref&gt;q Usages in political circles have varied considerably. In 1894, [[Richard T. Ely]] noted that the term had "already acquired a variety of meanings". In its most general sense, these included the view that society is "a living, growing organism, the laws of which are something different from the laws of individual action".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Theodore Ely, ''Socialism: An Examination of Its Nature, Its Strength and Its Weakness'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1894), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Several years earlier (1888), the [[individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] included the full text of a "Socialistic Letter" by [[Ernest Lesigne]] in his essay on "State Socialism and Anarchism". According to Lesigne, there are two socialisms: "One is [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]], the other [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, ''State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree and Wherein They Differ''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ends and means==
{{main|Propaganda of the deed|Direct action}}
Among anarchists, there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence in revolutionary struggle. For example, [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]] wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in [[revolution]]ary settings. At the same time, they denounced acts of individual terrorism, see Bakunin's "The Program of the International Brotherhood" (1869)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1869/program.htm|title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1869|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|date=|website=marxists.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malatesta's "Violence as a Social Factor" (1895). Other anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/snow.htm] "The Message of Gandhi", Edgar Snow&lt;/ref&gt; have been advocates of [[pacifism]].

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, possibly due to a number of high-profile violent actions, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[Rebellion|insurrections]] and [[terrorism]] committed by some anarchists as well as persistently negative media portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael [http://www.zmag.org/anarchism.htm Anarchism?!], Z Communications ''retrieved 6 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Late 19th-century [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]] encouraged acts of political violence, called "[[propaganda of the deed]]", such as [[bomb]]ings and the assassinations of [[Head of state|heads of state]] to further anarchism. However, the term originally referred to exemplary forms of direct action meant to inspire the masses to revolution. Propaganda of the deed may be violent or nonviolent.

While all anarchists consider [[antimilitarism]] (opposition to [[war]]) to be inherent to their [[Philosophical anarchism|philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that "war is the health of the state."[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] take this further, following Tolstoy's belief in pacifism. Although numerous anarchist-related initiatives have been based on the [[Tactic (method)|tactic]] of [[nonviolence]] (see [[Earth First!]] and [[Food Not Bombs]]), many anarchists reject pacifism as an ideology, instead supporting a "[[Diversity of Tactics|diversity of tactics]]". Authors [[Ward Churchill]] (''[[Pacifism as Pathology]]'', 1986) and [[Peter Gelderloos]] (''How Nonviolence Protects the State'', 2005;  "The Failure of Nonviolence",&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Failurepreview3 "The Failure of Nonviolence"]&lt;/ref&gt; 2013) have published influential books critical of pacifist doctrine, which they view as ineffectual and hypocritical. In a 2010 article, author [[Randall Amster]] argued for the development of a "complementarity of tactics" to bridge the pacifist and more militant aspects of anarchism.

As a result of anarchism's critical view of certain types of [[private property]], many anarchists see the destruction of property as an acceptable form of violence or argue that it is not in fact violence at all. In her widely cited 1912 essay ''Direct Action'', [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] drew on American historical events, including the destroying of revenue stamps and the [[Boston Tea Party]] as a defense of such activities.&lt;ref&gt;de Cleyre, Voltairine. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/cleyre/direct.html ''Direct Action''], 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anarchists participate in subversive organizations as a means to undermine the [[The Establishment|establishment]], such as Food Not Bombs, [[Industrial Workers of the World|radical labor unions]], [[Independent Media Center|alternative media]] and [[Infoshop|radical social centers]]. This is in accordance with the anarchist ideal that governments are intrinsically evil: only by destroying the power of governments can individual freedoms and liberties be preserved. However, some anarchist schools in theory adopt the concept of [[Dual power (Russian Revolution)|dual power]]: creating the structures for a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] society in the shell of the old, [[Social stratification|hierarchical]] one.

While most anarchists firmly oppose voting, or otherwise participating in the state institution, there are a few that disagree. The prominent anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] stood for election to the French Constituent Assembly twice in [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|1848]]. [[Paul Brousse]] developed the concept of [[libertarian municipalism]] in [[Switzerland]] in the 1890s which involved participating in local elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuckthevote.org/TheEthicsofVoting The Ethics of Voting] by George H.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]], the anarchist [[collective]] [[CrimethInc.]] launched "[[Don't Just Vote, Get Active]]", a campaign promoting the importance of [[direct action]] rather than electoral change. Anarchists in other countries often engage in similar anti-voting campaigns. Others advocate a more pragmatic approach, including voting in referenda,&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws/2002/ws69/referendum.html Thinking about anarchism - Referendums] Workers Solidarity No 69, published in March 2002 ''retrieved 7 September 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; while other prominent anarchists like [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] have pledged their support for [[Progressivism|progressive]] candidates such as [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/20040526.htm|title=chomsky.info : The Noam Chomsky Website|website=chomsky.info|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to merely voting, some anarchists such as Proudhon and more recently Icelandic activist [[Smari McCarthy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/iceland-elections-ruling-centre-right-party-pirate-party|title=Iceland elections leave ruling centre-right party in driving seat|first=Jon|last=Henley|date=30 October 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have stood for and won elections to national legislative bodies.

The [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] [[Lysander Spooner]] argued that voting was a legitimate means of self-defense against the state and noted that many supporters of the state consider both voting and abstention to be acknowledgments of the state's legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Lysander Spooner, ''No Treason'', no. 2, part 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner's essay "No Treason"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/notreason.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021004072643/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/notreason.htm |archivedate=2002-10-04 |df= }} No Treason, Lysander Spooner, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; offers an individualist anarchist rebuttal to the argument that existing democratic governments are justified by majority consent.

In 2016 within the United Kingdom, there was considerable debate around the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit vote]].

===Democracy in anarchism===
For individualist anarchists, "the system of democracy, of majority decision, is held null and void. Any impingement upon the natural rights of the person is unjust and a symbol of majority tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Louis Horowitz|Horowitz, Irving Louis]]. The Anarchists. Aldine Transaction 2005, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian municipalist [[Murray Bookchin]] criticized individualist anarchists for opposing [[Direct democracy|democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/CMMNL2.MCW.html The Democratic Dimensions of Anarchism]&lt;/ref&gt; and said "majority rule" is consistent with anarchism,&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]&lt;/ref&gt; but he also preferred the term [[Popular assembly|assembly]] rather than democracy. Bookchin has in turn been accused of "municipal statism", i.e. non-anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;http://lemming.mahost.org/library/municipalstatist.htm Anarchy after Leftism (chapter 5), Bob Black&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Bookchin renounced anarchism to identify himself as an advocate of [[Communalism (political philosophy)|Communalism]].

===Violence and non-violence===
{{main|Anarchism and violence}}
Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts including riots, assassinations and insurrections involving anarchists. However, the use of terrorism and assassination is condemned by most anarchist ideology, though there remains no [[consensus]] on the legitimacy or utility of violence. Some anarchists have opposed [[coercion]] while others have supported it, particularly in the form of violent revolution on the path to anarchy or utopia.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R.B. The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 4. (Dec., 1972), pp. 743-744&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anarchists share [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] belief in nonviolence. These anarcho-pacifists advocate [[nonviolent resistance]] as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution. They often see violence as the basis of government and coercion and argue that as such violence is illegitimate, no matter who is the target. Some of Proudhon's French followers even saw [[strike action]] as coercive and refused to take part in such traditional socialist tactics.

Other anarchists advocate [[Marshall Rosenberg]]'s [[Nonviolent Communication]] that relates to peoples fundamental needs and feelings using strategies of requests, observations and empathy yet providing for the use of protective force while rejecting pacifism as a compromising strategy of the left that just perpetuates violence.

Other anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin and Errico Malatesta, saw violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force. Malatesta took the view that it is "necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies [the means of life and for development] to the workers" (''[[Umanità Nova]]'', number 125, 6 September 1921).&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchists/malatesta/rev_haste.html The Revolutionary "Haste"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030210201006/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchists/malatesta/rev_haste.html |date=2003-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1894 and 1901, individual anarchists assassinated numerous heads of state, including:
* [[President of France|French President]] [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (1894)
* Empress consort [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] (1898)
* King [[Umberto I of Italy]] (1900)
* [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[William McKinley]] (1901)

Such "[[propaganda of the deed]]" was not popular among anarchists and many in the movement condemned the tactic. President William McKinley's assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to be a disciple of Emma Goldman.  Goldman disavowed the act, although she did not condemn Czolgosz's motivations in doing it.

Goldman included in her definition of anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself did not oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on, she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, but Goldman still supported most other forms of revolutionary violence throughout her life. In a debate with a pacifist five years before her death, she countered that "the organized force used against the followers of Gandhi has finally forced them to use violence, much to the distress of Gandhi" and concluded that "as a method of combating the complex social injustices and inequalities, non-resistance cannot be a decisive factor" ("non-resistance" was the term for nonviolence used by Tolstoy and other early 20th century pacifists). Goldman at this time was an information officer for the anarchist militias of the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], which were committed to armed struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zinelibrary.info/files/Goldman%20-%20Vision%20on%20Fire%20-%20Emma%20Goldman%20on%20the%20Spanish%20Revolution.pdf David Porter, editor, ''Vision on Fire: Emma Goldman on the Spanish Revolution'' (AK Press, 2006) p226-228]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions in the press and popular fiction (for example, a malevolent bomb-throwing anarchist in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[The Secret Agent]]'') helped create a lasting public impression that anarchists are violent terrorists. This perception was enhanced by events such as the [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket riot]], where anarchists were blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]].

More recently, anarchists have been involved in protests against [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) meetings across the globe, which the media has described as violent or riots. Traditionally, [[May Day]] in [[London]] has also been a day of marching, but in recent years the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] have warned that a "hardcore of anarchists" are intent on causing violence. Anarchists often respond that it is the police who initiate violence at these demonstrations, with anarchists who are otherwise peaceful sometimes forced to defend themselves. The anarchists involved in such protests often formed [[black bloc]]s at these protests and some engaged in [[Property damage|property destruction]], [[vandalism]], or in violent conflicts with [[police]], though others stuck to non-violent principles.

Those participating in black blocs distinguish between "violence" and "property destruction": they claim that violence is when a person inflicts harm to another person while property destruction or property damage is not violence, although it can have indirect harm such as financial harm. Most anarchists do not consider the destruction of property to be violent as do most activists who believe in non-violence.

====Pacifism====
[[File:Fight the state, not wars.jpg|thumb|Anarchist protesters in [[Boston]] opposing state-waged war]]
Most anarchists consider opposition to [[militarism]] to be inherent in their philosophy. Some anarchists take it further and follow Leo Tolstoy's belief in non-violence (note that these anarcho-pacifists are not necessarily Christian anarchists as Tolstoy was), advocating non-violent resistance as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution.

Anarchist literature often portrays war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands. Many anarchists subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that "war is the health of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html|title=War Is the Health of the State by Randolph Bourne|website=struggle.ws|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists believe that if they were to support a war they would be strengthening the state—indeed, [[Peter Kropotkin]] was alienated from other anarchists when he expressed support for the British in [[World War I]].

===Individualism vs. collectivism===
While some anarchists favour [[Common ownership|collective property]] or [[Unowned property|no property]], others such as some individualist anarchists of historical note (e.g. Benjamin Tucker and [[Lysander Spooner]]) support [[private property]]. Tucker argues that collectivism in property is absurd: "That there is an entity known as the [[community]] which is the rightful owner of all land, Anarchists deny...I...maintain that 'the community' is a non-entity, that it has no existence" and he was particularly adamant in his opposition to "[[communism]]", even to the point of asserting that those who opposed private property were not anarchists: "Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market– that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist". However, some of these individuals opposed property titles to unused land.

==Identity politics==
===Gender===
{{main|Anarcha-feminism|Ecofeminism}}
[[File:Portrait Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Emma Goldman]]]]
Early [[Feminism in France|French feminists]] such as [[Jenny d'Héricourt]] and [[Juliette Adam]] criticised the [[misogyny]] in the anarchism of Proudhon during the 1850s.

[[Anarcha-feminism]] is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society. However, it was not explicitly formulated as anarcha-feminism until the early 1970s during the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave]] [[feminist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011013823/http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early first-wave feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] held proto-anarchist views and [[William Godwin]] is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor. While most anarchists of the period did not take these ideas seriously, others such as [[Florence Finch Kelly]] and [[Moses Harman]] held [[gender equality]] as a topic of significant importance.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Margaret S. ''Anarchist Women, 1870-1920''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminism garnered further attention through the work of early 20th-century authors and theorists including Emma Goldman and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, [[Mujeres Libres]] ({{lang-en|Free Women}}), organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

===Ethnicity===
[[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism and subjugation and domination of people of color and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]] and [[Sam Mbah]]. Some of these theorists have had past experiences with the [[Black Panther Party]] and came to anarchism after they became critical of the Black Panther Party's brand of [[Marxist–Leninism]]. [[Anarchist People of Color]] (APOC) was created as a forum for non-Caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States. [[Anti-Racist Action]] is not an anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved. It focuses on publicly confronting [[Antisemitism|antisemites]], [[Racism|racists]], [[Supremacism|supremacists]] and others, such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups and the like.

Most modern and historical anarchists describe themselves as [[Anti-racism|anti-racists]]. Many early anarchists, notably [[Lucy Parsons]] (a person of color and formerly an [[slavery|enslaved]] [[United States|American]]) viewed racism as one of many negative side-effects of capitalism and expected that it would vanish in a [[Post-capitalism|post-capitalist]] world. However, among modern anarchists anti-racism plays a more prominent role and racism is typically viewed as one of several forms of social hierarchy and stratification which must be destroyed. No anarchist organizations has ever included racism as part of its platform and many—particularly modern formations—include explicit anti-racism. For instance, [[Anarchism in the United States|American anarchists]] were alone in opposing racism against [[Anarchism in China#Anarchism as a mass movement|Chinese]] and [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexican]] workers in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Since the late 1970s, anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of neo-fascist groups. In Germany and the United Kingdom, some anarchists worked within [[Anti-fascism|militant anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state. Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within anarchism in the United States.

[[Anti-Racist Action]] is one of the largest grassroots anti-fascist and anti-racist organizations in North America today and counts many anarchists among its members. Their tactics, centered around directly confronting [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] and [[White supremacy|white-supremacist]] groups, are considered controversial both within the anarchist movement (where they are sometimes portrayed as well-intentioned but ineffective) and in mainstream society (where they are often portrayed as violent and disruptive).

Many anarchists also oppose the concept of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] itself, arguing that it has no biological basis in science and is a social construction designed to divide the working class and preserve capitalism.

Black anarchism opposes the existence of a state, capitalism and subjugation and domination of people of African descent and favours a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include Ashanti Alston, Lorenzo Komboa Ervin, Sam Mbah, [[Aragorn!]] and [[Martin Sostre]]. APOC emerged in the United States as a tendency which theorized anarchism in the broader context of race. Founded by writer and organizer [[Ernesto Aguilar]], an APOC email list became the basis for collectives composed of people of colour to form in several American cities. APOC held a conference in Detroit, Michigan in 2003. In 2005, the first APOC journal (''Wildfire'') was launched, but folded a few months later. In 2007, Roger White and the [[Oakland]], [[California]] APOC group founded the Jailbreak Press blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jailbreakpress.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of historically prominent anarchists have been accused of racism, e.g. Proudhon&lt;ref name="Schapiro"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[J. Salwyn Schapiro|Schapiro, J. Salwyn]] |year=1945 |title=Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Harbinger of Fascism |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=714–737 |doi=10.2307/1842699|publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 50, No. 4|jstor=1842699}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bakunin.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin, quoted by [[Shlomo Avineri]], in ''Radical Theology, the New Left, and Israel'', p. 245-246 [an article in Auschwitz.

Reflections on the Holocaust, edited by Eva Fleishner], KTAV Publishing House, Inc.; The Cathedral Church of St. John Divine; Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 1977, p. 241-254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist anarchism|Christian anarchism|Jewish anarchism|Islam and anarchism}}
From Proudhon and Bakunin to the Spanish [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], most anarchists have questioned or opposed [[organized religion]], believing that most organized religions are hierarchical or authoritarian and more often than not aligned with contemporary power structures like the state and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Nonetheless, others reconcile anarchism with [[religion]].

[[Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]] and oppose earthly authority such as government and established churches. They believe that [[Jesus]]' teachings and the practice of the [[Early Christianity|early Church]] were clearly anarchistic. Some of them feel that the teachings of the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]s and other early groups of followers were corrupted by contemporary religious views, most notably when [[Theodosius I]] declared [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] [[Christianity]] the official religion of the Roman Empire. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus' directive to "turn the other cheek", are usually strict pacifists, although some believe in a limited justification of defense, especially defense of others. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was Leo Tolstoy, author of ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom. Christian anarchists tend to form experimental communities (such as the [[Catholic Worker]]). They also occasionally [[tax resistance|resist taxation]].

[[Buddhist anarchism]] originated in the influential Chinese anarchist movement of the 1920s. [[Taixu]], one of the leading thinkers and writers of this school, was deeply influenced by the work of Christian anarchists like Tolstoy and by the ancient Chinese [[well-field system]]. In the late 19th century, the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Ghadar]] movement in India (see [[Har Dayal]]), influenced by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought and by [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]] (founder of [[Arya Samaj]]), saw anarchism as a way of propagating the ancient culture of the [[Aryan|Arya]] (not to be confused with the much later appropriation of "Aryan" identity by [[Nazism]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Ghadar Movement: Ideology, Organisation and Strategy'', Harish K. Puri, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar: "The only account of Hardayal's short stay in that island [[Martinique]], comes from [[Bhai Parmanand]], a self exiled Arya Samajist missionary from [[Lahore]], who stayed a month with him there. Har Dayal used that time, says Parmanand, to discuss plans to found a new religion: his model was the Buddha. He ate mostly boiled grain, slept on the bare floor and spent his time in meditation in a secluded place. [[Guy Aldred]], a famous English radical and friend, tells us of Hardayal's proclaimed belief at that time in the coming republic "which was to be a Church, a religious confraternity ... its motto was to be: atheism, cosmopolitanism and moral law' Parmamand says that Har Dayal acceded to his persuasion to go to the USA and decided to make New York a centre for the propagation of the ancient culture of the Aryan." (page 55) and "the ideal social order would be the one which approximated to the legendary Vedic period of Indian history because, as Har Dayal affirmed, practical equality existed only in that society, where there were no governors and no governed, no priests and no laymen, no rich and no poor." (page 112), referencing ''The Social Conquest of the Hindu Race and Meaning of Equality''.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist anarchism was later revived in the 1960s by writers such as [[Gary Snyder]]; an incarnation of this school of thought was popularized by [[Jack Kerouac]] in his book ''[[The Dharma Bums]]''.

With its focus on the environment and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, [[Modern Paganism|neopaganism]], has led to a number of neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and [[activism]].

Discussing the anarchist movement in Britain in 2002, Adam K. has argued that it "has an especially ignorant and hegemonistic perception of the Muslim community", which he attributed to "the anglo-centric nature of the movement". Quoting the statement that "[[Islam]] is an enemy of all freedom loving people" from an anarchist magazine, he argues that this is "no different to the bigoted rhetoric of [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] or even [[British National Party|BNP]] leader [[Nick Griffin]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mostlywater.org/node/4205 Anarchist Orientalism and the Muslim Community in Britain] Accessed 3 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitalism==
{{main|Anarchism and capitalism}}

Throughout most of its history, anarchism has been defined by its proponents in opposition to capitalism, which they believe can be maintained only by state violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, Frank 'Cuban Anarchism: The History of a Movement' See Sharp Press (2001) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Most non-capitalist anarchists follow Proudhon in opposing ownership of workplaces by capitalists and aim to replace [[wage labour]] with workers' associations. These anarchists agree with Kropotkin's comment that "the origin of the anarchist inception of society… [lies in] the criticism… of the hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of society" rather than in simple opposition to the state or government.&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchism'', p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the wage system is hierarchical and authoritarian in nature and consequently capitalism cannot be anarchist.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Brian, ''Anthropology and Anarchism,'' "Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed" (no. 45); Mckay, Iain, ''The legacy of Voltairine De Cleyre'', ''Anarcho-Syndicalist Review'', no. 44; L. Susan Brown, ''The Politics of Individualism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early individualist anarchists considered themselves "fervent anti-capitalists… [who see] no contradiction between their individualist stance and their rejection of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Susan Love, The Free Market as Salvation from Government: The Anarcho-Capitalist View, Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture, edited by James G. Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 107 and p. 104)&lt;/ref&gt; Many defined themselves as socialists. These early individualist-anarchists defined "capitalism" in various ways, but often it was discussed in terms of [[usury]]: "There are three forms of usury, interest on money, rent on land and houses, and profit in exchange. Whoever is in receipt of any of these is a usurer".&lt;ref&gt;James J. Martin. ''Men against the State''. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excluding these, they tended to support free trade, free competition and varying levels of private property such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Homestead principle|homesteading]].&lt;ref name="Madison"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madison, Charles A. |year=1945 |title=Anarchism in the United States |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=46–66 |doi=10.2307/2707055 |publisher=Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 6, No. 1 |jstor=2707055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madison2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madison, Charles A. |year=1943 |title=Benjamin R.

In contrast, anarcho-capitalists support private property along Lockean or similar lines.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this distinction which has led to the rift between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism. Historically, anarchists considered themselves socialists and opposed to capitalism, thus anarcho-capitalism is considered by many anarchists today as not being true anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;As [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] notes in his history of anarchism, "few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice." ''[[Demanding the Impossible]]'', p. 565&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist organisations, for example the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (Spain) and the [[Anarchist Federation (British Isles)|Anarchist Federation]] (Britain and Ireland), generally take an explicitly anti-capitalist stance. In the 20th century, several economists began to formulate a form of radical [[Libertarianism in the United States|American libertarianism]] known as anarcho-capitalism. This has met resistance from those who hold that capitalism is inherently oppressive or statist and many anarchists and scholars do not consider anarcho-capitalism to properly cohere with the spirit, principles, or history of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Marshall, [[Demanding the Impossible]]; John Clark, ''The Anarchist Moment''; Albert Meltzer, ''Anarchism: Arguments for and Against''; Noam Chomsky, ''Understanding Power'', David Weick, ''Anarchist Justice''; Brian Morris, "Anthropology and Anarchism," ''Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed'' (no. 45); Peter Sabatini, ''Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy''; Donald Rooum, ''What is Anarchism?''; Bob Black, ''Libertarian as Conservative''&lt;/ref&gt; However, other anarchists and scholars regard anarchism as referring only to opposition to the non-privatisation of all aspects of the state and thus do consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;1) Perlin, Terry M. Contemporary Anarchism. Transaction Books, New Brunswick, NJ 1979, p. 7. 2) [[Richard Sylvan|Sylvan]], Richard. ''Anarchism''. A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
Many anarchists are actively involved in the [[anti-globalization]] movement, seeing corporate [[globalization]] as a [[neocolonialism|neocolonialist]] attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Globalization is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions. Many anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and/or [[cultural imperialism]] (which they may see as related). Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use "globalization" to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene. Market anarchists and anarcho-capitalists see the worldwide expansion of the division of labor through trade ("globalization") as a boon, but oppose the regulation and cartelization imposed by the World Bank, World Trade Organization and "managed trade" agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA). Many also object to [[fiat money]] issued by central banks and resulting debasement of money and confiscation of wealth.

Groups such as [[Reclaim the Streets]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/features/new_world_disorder/reclaim.html Reclaim the Streets] Donnacha DeLong, RTÉ News Online 2002 retrieved 5 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; were among the instigators of the so-called [[anti-globalization movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newleftreview.org/A2368 The New Anarchists] David Graeber, New Left Review 13, January–February 2002 retrieved 6 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carnival Against Capitalism]] on 18 June 1999 is generally regarded as the first of the major anti-globalization protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/features/new_world_disorder/action2.html G8 Summit - J18: Global Carnival Against Corporate Tyranny, London, England] C.

==Nationalism==
{{see also|Nationalism and anarchism}}
Anarchism has a long history of opposing [[imperialism]], both in the core nations (the colonizers) and the periphery nations (the colonized). In general, anarchists have preferred to focus on building revolutions at home and doing solidarity work for comrades in other countries, e.g. Guy Aldred was jailed for printing [[Shyamji Krishnavarma]]'s ''[[The Indian Sociologist]]''.

Another example of this was [[Rudolf Rocker]], a prominent German anarchist and anti-fascist who was particularly active amongst [[Jewish]] workers. In his ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'', he argued for a "federation of European peoples" which would include Jews. Rejecting biological theories of race and rejecting the concept of nation, he argued that since it was European states that had conquered and colonized the rest of the world, successful libertarian organization amongst Europeans was "the first condition for the creation of a world federation, which will also secure the so-called [[colonialism|colonial]] peoples the same rights for the pursuit of happiness. Many modern anarchists and other anti-imperialists share this approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/4/14/193155/440 Daily Kos], [http://euromayday.at/texte/middlesex.php Euromayday website] accessed 3 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum there was debate within anarchist circles about either to take an [[Abstentionism|abstentionist]] position, vote for independence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or to vote to remain in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and anarchists rarely fit into the easy binary of Yes/ No voters of the referendum with all seeking to go beyond the choices offered at the ballot box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scotlandaf.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/referendum-rant-from-an-immigrant/|title=Referendum rant from an immigrant|last=Afedscotland|date=2014-09-18|website=AFed Scotland|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a debate about what Scottish independence would mean for the anarchist movement and social struggle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Groups like [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|The Anarchist Federation]] in Scotland (mainly in Edinburgh and Glasgow) took a critical stance skeptical of the benefits of Scottish independence &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Scottish anarchists argued that Scottish independence and Scottish nationalism diverted energy away from grassroots struggles and that the movement for Scottish independence sucked people towards Scottish nationalism and electoral politics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afed.org.uk/the-snp-scottish-nationalism-and-the-class-struggle-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/|title=The SNP, Scottish Nationalism, and the Class Struggle: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow|website=afed.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically anarchism was supportive of the [[Anationalism|anationalist]] movement as well as of the [[Esperanto]] language,&lt;ref&gt;"Anarkiistoj estis inter la pioniroj de la disvastigo de Esperanto. En 1905 fondiĝis en Stokholmo la unua anarkiisma Esperanto-grupo. Sekvis multaj aliaj: en Bulgario, Ĉinio kaj aliaj landoj. Anarkiistoj kaj anarki-sindikatistoj, kiuj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito apartenis al la nombre plej granda grupo inter la proletaj esperantistoj, fondis en 1906 la internacian ligon Paco-Libereco, kiu eldonis la Internacian Socian Revuon. Paco-libereco unuiĝis en 1910 kun alia progresema asocio, Esperantista Laboristaro. La komuna organizaĵo nomiĝis Liberiga Stelo. Ĝis 1914 tiu organizaĵo eldonis multe da revolucia literaturo en Esperanto, interalie ankaŭ anarkiisma. Tial povis evolui en la jaroj antaŭ la Unua Mondmilito ekzemple vigla korespondado inter eŭropaj kaj japanaj anarkiistoj. En 1907 la Internacia Anarkiisma Kongreso en Amsterdamo faris rezolucion pri la afero de internacia lingvo, kaj venis dum la postaj jaroj similaj kongresaj rezolucioj.

==The environment==
{{see also|Green anarchism|Social ecology (theory)|Anarcho-primitivism|Ecofeminism|Green syndicalism}}
The environment and sustainability have been an issue for anarchists from at least as far back as Kropotkin's 1899 book ''[[Green Anarchist|Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'', but since the late 1970s anarchists in English-speaking world and European countries have been agitating for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|green anarchists]] often embrace [[deep ecology]], a worldview that strives to cultivate [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use direct action against what they see as Earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the Earth First! movement that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. The more militant [[Earth Liberation Front]], which grew out of Earth First!, also has connections with the anarchist movement. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women.

Murray Bookchin's work on [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], [[David Watson (anarchist)|David Watson]]'s work with ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'' magazine, [[Steve Booth]]'s work in the United Kingdom publication ''[[Green Anarchist]]'' and [[Graham Purchase]]'s writings on [[green syndicalism]] have all contributed to the broad variety and scope of green anarchist/eco-anarchist thought and action. Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism and for some green anarchists civilization itself.

While many anarchists (especially those involved in the anti-globalization movement) continue to see themselves as a leftist movement, some thinkers and activists believe it is necessary to re-evaluate anarchism's relationship with the traditional left. Like many radical ideologies, most [[anarchist schools of thought]] are to some degree [[sectarian]]. There is often a difference of opinion within each school about how to react to, or interact with, other schools. Many anarchists draw from a wide range of political perspectives, such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]], the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], "[[Ultra leftism|ultra leftists]]", [[Autonomism|autonomist Marxism]] and various [[indigenous culture]]s.

A movement called [[post-left anarchy]] seeks to distance itself from the traditional "left"—[[Communism|communists]], [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Social democracy|social democrats]] and the like—and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary "leftist" movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]] and so on). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. Important groups and individuals associated with post-left anarchy include [[CrimethInc.]], the magazine ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'' and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others.

The term [[post-anarchism]] was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'', a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], post-left anarchy, situationism, [[postcolonialism]] and [[Zapatismo]]. By its very nature, post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. Key thinkers nonetheless associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postanarchism.org/ "Post anarchist clearing house"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists, calling themselves "[[insurrectionary anarchists]]", are critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations and advocate informal organization, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles. Proponents include Wolfi Landstreicher and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including ''Armed Joy'' and ''The Anarchist Tension''. This tendency is represented in the United States in magazines such as ''Willful Disobedience'' and ''Killing King Abacus''.

===Communism===
While communism is proposed as a form of social and economic organisation by many anarchists, other anarchists consider it a danger to the liberty and free development of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin, Peter]], [http://www.zabalaza.net/texts/txt_com&amp;anok_pk.htm "Communism and Anarchy"].&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools of anarchism have recognized a distinction between libertarian and authoritarian forms of communism.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881-1908)''; 3 September 1881; 1, 3; APS Online, pg. 3; Tucker uses the terms "voluntary" and "compulsory" communisms. Some market anarchists reject the distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon said of communism that "whether of the utopian or the Marxist variety, that it destroyed freedom by taking away from the individual control over his means of production"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9276558 "Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph"] (2006). ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Communism is exploitation of the strong by the weak".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. "What Is Property?" {{ISBN|1-4191-9353-8}} p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Mikhail Bakunin stated: "I hate Communism because it is the negation of liberty and because for me humanity is unthinkable without liberty. I am not a Communist, because Communism concentrates and swallows up in itself for the benefit of the State all the forces of society, because it inevitably leads to the concentration of property in the hands of the State".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Paul Thomas, ''Karl Marx and the Anarchists'', Routledge (1980), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin was speaking of "[[state communism]]" ([[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian Marxism]]) as verified by the last line which mentions state property—anarcho-communists explicitly reject state property and authority, especially centralized authority.

Although Peter Kropotkin, one of the leading proponents of anarcho-communism while also opposing state communism, argued for an economic model of free distribution between all individuals, many individualist anarchists oppose communism in all its forms on the grounds that voluntary communism is not practicable. Individualist such as Benjamin Tucker, Victor Yarros and Henry Appleton have denied that anarcho-communism is a genuine form of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Benjamin Tucker says: "Yes, genuine Anarchism is consistent [[Manchesterism]], and Communistic or pseudo-Anarchism is inconsistent Manchesterism". Tucker, Benjamin. [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html "Labor and Its Pay"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407014846/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html |date=2005-04-07 }}. From Individual Liberty: selections from the writings of Benjamin T. Tucker); [[Victor Yarros]] says: "There is no logical justification, no rational explanation, and no scientific reasoning has been, is, will be, or can be advanced in defence of that unimaginable impossibility, Communistic Anarchism". Yarros, Victor S. [http://www.againstpolitics.com/market_anarchism/yarros_princely.html "A Princely Paradox"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002707/http://www.againstpolitics.com/market_anarchism/yarros_princely.html |date=2007-09-27 }}. Liberty. Vol 4. No. 19. Saturday, April 9, 1887. whole number 97. [[Henry Appleton (anarchist)|Henry Appleton]] says: "All Communism, under whatever guise, is the natural enemy of Anarchism, and a Communist sailing under the flag of Anarchism is as false a figure as could be invented". Appleton, Henry. [http://praxeology.net/HA-ATF.htm "Anarchism, True and False"]. Liberty 2.24. no. 50. 6 September 1884. p. 4.; [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] says: "One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property". Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.index.html "What is Mutualism?"].&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected its strategies and argued that it is inherently authoritarian.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Frank H. (ed) (1994) ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881-1908)'', Transaction Publishers, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of individualist Henry Appleton, "Communism, being opposed to natural law, must necessarily call upon unnatural methods if it would put itself into practice" and employ "pillage, brute force, and violence".&lt;ref&gt;Appleton, Henry. [http://www.againstpolitics.com/market_anarchism/appleton_boston.htm "The Boston Anarchists"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214233855/http://www.againstpolitics.com/market_anarchism/appleton_boston.htm |date=2005-12-14}}. Liberty, Vol. 4, No. 3, May 26, 1886, Whole No. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-communists reject the criticism, pointing to the principle of voluntary association that underpins their theory and differentiates it from state communism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html#seca31 "An Anarchist FAQ: A.3.1 What are the differences between individualist and social anarchists?"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922025342/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html|date=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individualist anarchists are also willing to recognize anarcho-communism as a legitimate form. [[Kevin Carson]] writes that "free market, libertarian communist, syndicalism, and other kinds of collectivist anarchists must learn to coexist in peace and mutual respect today, in our fight against the corporate state, and tomorrow, in the [[panarchy]] that is likely to succeed it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin A. Carson|Carson, Kevin]]. [http://mutualist.org/id107.html "Mutualist FAQ: Getting There"].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">The '''Janata Tower Case''' was a corruption [[criminal case|case]] in Bangladesh over Janata tower in Karwan Bazar in Dhaka. The case lead to the conviction of former military dictator H. M. Ershad.

== Background ==
Janata Tower is an eleven storey building located in [[Kawran Bazar|Karwan Bazar]], [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/2005/01/30/d501302505104.htm|title = Janata Tower to get a facelift soon|website = archive.thedailystar.net|access-date = 2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally planned to be 15 floors. After construction stopped in 1991 when General Ershad stepped down the tower became a home for squatters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/2005/12/07/d512072505107.htm|title = Janata Tower remains unutilised for long|last = Ayon|first = Kausar Islam|website = archive.thedailystar.net|access-date = 2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 14 April 1991 the Bureau of Anti Corruption (today [[Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh|Anti Corruption Commission]]) filed a case against 17 people including former president and military autocrat [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad|Hussein Mohammad Ershad]] and 19 others with Tejgaon Police Station.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2008/11/12/sc-upholds-hc-rule-in-janata-tower-case|title = SC upholds HC rule in Janata Tower case|website = bdnews24.com|access-date = 2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was charged with abuse of power for collusion with [[M. M. Rahmat Ullah]] in allotting the land for the project; and possessing unaccounted money. The [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh|Justice]] in his 91 -page verdict said General Ershad was found guilty under the Prevention Act; on November 20, 2000, the justice sentenced the former president to seven years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZ8UAQAAIAAJ|title=Asian News Digest: A Weekly Record on Governance, Economy, Development, Human Rights, and Environment|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Asian News Chroniclers|page=1090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was acquired by Bangladesh government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, Ershad could not participate in the [[Bangladeshi general election, 2001|2001 elections]].

Ershad appealed against the verdict in the High Court Division which affirmed the conviction, but reduced the sentence to five years on 24 August 2004. He was also fined 55 million taka.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szfqq7ruqWgC|title=Bangladesh: Past and Present|last=Ahmed|first=Salahuddin|date=2004-01-01|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788176484695|page=231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released with a year and half remaining on his sentence. Ershad's then wife [[Rowshan Ershad]] was fined Ten thousand taka.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shukur Ali Pradhan another accused  in the case had filed to get the tower back from the government. The high court ruled in his favor but the supreme court overturned it and the property remains in government ownership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ershad, the former [[President of Bangladesh]] and chief of the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|National Party]] (''Jatiya Party''), was released on [[bail]] on April 9, 2001 after serving four months in jail in [[Dhaka]].

== Legacy ==
The tower was repurposed as an Software park by the government of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-168136|title = A good year for IT|date = 2010-12-30|website = The Daily Star|access-date = 2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-165201|title = Software park in Janata Tower next year|last = Bhuiyan|first = Mehdi Musharraf|date =|website = thedailystar.net|publisher = The Daily Star|access-date = 2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, editor of the daily [[Manab Zamin|Manab zamin]] was sentenced to jail in May 2002 for contempt of court.

'''Jerry McAuley''' (1839 in [[County Kerry, Ireland]] – September 18, 1884), along with his wife, Maria (née Fahy) McAuley, founded the [[Water Street Mission]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. A self-described "rogue and street thief" who spent seven years in [[Sing Sing]] prison during the 1860s, McAuley's mission became America's first [[Rescue Mission]] and is now known as the New York City Rescue Mission.

==Early years==
McAuley had been born in County Kerry, Ireland in 1839, the son of a counterfeiter. His father abandoned the family to escape law enforcement officers pursuing him. Jerry's mother sent him off to live with his grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://correctionhistory.org/html/chronicl/mcauley/mcauley.html |title=Jerry McAuley, Ex-Inmate of Tombs &amp; Sing Sing, Rescue Mission Pioneer |website=Correctionhistory.org |date=2005-03-17 |accessdate=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison==
In January 1857, aged 19, he was accused of highway robbery, convicted, and sent to [[Sing-Sing]]. While there, McAuley heard a man by the name of Orville Gardner testify of his conversion. On March 8, 1864, aged 26, McAuley was pardoned and set free. He set out to associate with [[Christianity|Christians]].

==Rescue mission==
Soon after this, McAuley met Alfrederick Hatch, a businessman. Hatch became McAuley's confidant. In October 1872 McAuley took possession of the Water Street house. The money he had raised was used to repair the building and soon after, the mission at 316 Water Street named "Helping Hand for Men" was open.

==Years of service==
In 1882, after twelve years, McAuley left Water Street to start the Cremorne Mission near [[Times Square]]. Two years later, on a fall afternoon in September 1884, he died from [[tuberculosis]] contracted while in Sing Sing.
His widow, Maria Fahy McAuley, married prominent architect [[Bradford Gilbert]] in 1892; the couple had a daughter, Blossom.

During Dean's first year in office, he reworked the arrangement between Metro and the [[Nashville Predators]] in order to keep the team in Nashville. During Dean's first term, he faced two major challenges: the [[Great Recession]] and the [[2010 Tennessee floods]]. During his two terms in office, Dean transformed Downtown Nashville by adding a new minor league baseball stadium, a riverfront amphitheater and park and a new convention center dubbed Music City Center. Dean was friendly towards business and often used tax incentives to lure companies to Nashville. He is also involved in conservationist efforts of historical areas such as [[Music Row]] through his involvement with [[Music Industry Coalition]]. He helped preserve historic sites such as [[RCA Studio A]].&lt;ref name=studio&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2015/03/28/studio-a-nashville-50th/70463174/|title=Studio A Nashville 50th|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Dean declared his candidacy for [[Governor of Tennessee]] in the [[Tennessee gubernatorial election, 2018|2018 election]]. In the first three months of the campaign, Dean raised $1.2 million and spent $200,000; he went on to win the Democratic nomination on August 2, 2018 and advanced to the general election.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/07/06/karl-dean-report-raising-1-2-m-first-stretch-tennessee-governors-race/452374001/|title=Karl Dean to report raising $1.2M in first stretch of Tennessee governor's race|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean lost the election to businessman [[Bill Lee (Tennessee politician)|Bill Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wreg.com/2018/11/06/ap-lee-wins-tennessee-governor/|title=AP: Bill Lee wins Tennessee governor|date=2018-11-07|work=WREG.com|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal opinions as Metro Law Director==

In March 2005, Karl Dean wrote that Mayor Bill Purcell could seek a third term, despite a 1994 referendum on "any elected office authorized or created by the [Metro] charter." This was because the 1963 charter states that there is a three-term limit for mayors, the 1994 amendment took place against a backdrop of a push for congressional term limits, and local public discussion focused on the Metro Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brad|last=Schrade|title=Metro law director says Purcell can seek 3rd term|publisher=''The Tennessean''|date=March 11, 2005|url=http://www.tennessean.com/government/archives/05/03/66821219.shtml?Element_ID=66821219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, he said a proposed law to ban job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was not unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anne|last=Paine|title=Metro lawyer says gay rights law meets constitutional test|publisher=''The Tennessean''|date=January 31, 2003|url=http://www.tennessean.com/government/archives/03/01/28279835.shtml?Element_ID=28279835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Metropolitan Council (Davidson County)|Metro Council]] members' health-care benefits came under scrutiny in September 2004, because the Metro Charter does not allow pension benefits for Council members, Dean said that a health-care benefit wouldn't legally fall under a pension benefit, and therefore wouldn't be against the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brad|last=Schrade|title=Health-care benefit shift for council questioned|publisher=''The Tennessean''|date=September 21, 2004|url=http://www.tennessean.com/government/archives/03/01/28279835.shtml?Element_ID=28279835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if an amendment to the Metropolitan Charter requiring raises in the maximum property tax rates approved by the Metro Council to also be approved by Metro voters, Dean said that a court was likely to find that provision of the Metro Charter invalid. This is because, he said, the [[Tennessee General Assembly]] has not authorized the charter of a consolidated government to restrict the authority of a legislative body to levy an ''[[ad valorem]]'' tax on property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2006-03.pdf |url=ftp://ftp.nashville.gov/web/Legal/2006-03.pdf |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayor of Nashville==
=== Elections ===
[[File:Karl Dean 2007.jpg|thumb|Dean at a 2007 Nashville mayoral debate]]
Dean announced his mayoral candidacy on December 19, 2006.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; His campaign message focused on improving education, public safety, and economic development saying "it's all connected." In the general election on August 2, 2007, he placed first with 24.6% of the vote. This advanced him to a run-off election against [[Bob Clement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ELECTION UPDATE: Dean, Clement match-up set; Gentry &amp; Dozier concede|publisher=''The Nashville City Paper''|date=February 23, 2007|url=http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=57169}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2007 Dean won the run-off election with 52.2% of the vote.

Dean easily won re-election in August 2011 with 79.2% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/metro-election-2011-vote-totals|title=Metro election 2011: Vote totals|website=nashvillecitypaper.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean left office on September 25, 2015.  He was succeeded by [[Megan Barry]], the first woman to be Mayor of Nashville.

=== Education policy ===
During Dean's two terms, the budget for Metro Nashville schools increased by $218 million (37 percent) and Nashville schools saw increased graduation rates, reduced dropout rates, and improved test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/3984/Fact-Sheet-Highlights-of-the-Fiscal-Year-2016-Budget|title=Nashville {{!}} Fact Sheet - Highlights of the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget|last=Nashville|website=www.nashville.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the Limitless Libraries program, which connects Nashville Public Libraries to Metro Nashville Schools, part of a greater push to enable opportunities for underserved schools in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.limitlesslibraries.org/about|title=About {{!}} Limitless Libraries|website=www.limitlesslibraries.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean also improved school choice by recruiting charter schools to the city and augmented teaching talent by partnering with Teach for America. As a part of this partnership, summer academies were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nashville.teachforamerica.org/teaching-here|title=Teaching Here|last=|first=|date=|website=Teach for America|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic development ===
Dean's tenure as Mayor marked sales taxes revenue increased by over $100 million (36 percent), indicative of the growth of Nashville as a major city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/3984/Fact-Sheet-Highlights-of-the-Fiscal-Year-2016-Budget.aspx|title=Nashville {{!}} Fact Sheet - Highlights of the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget|last=Nashville|website=www.nashville.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the marquee projects of Dean's mayoral career was overseeing the creation of Music City Center, a massive convention center that has generated over $735 million in revenue for the city. Other projects included the construction of Ascend Amphitheater and First Tennessee Park, public venues that bring in millions of dollars of revenue to the city and have been instrumental in the expansion of downtown Nashville. Finally, Dean incentivized businesses to relocate to Nashville, including [[Bridgestone]] Americas and [[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/22/karl-dean-legacy-nashville-downtown-changes-leadership-flood/31863187/|title=Karl Dean legacy: Downtown Changes, Leadership Flood|last=Garrison|first=Joey|date=August 22, 2015|website=The Tennessean|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Great Recession ====
Dean led Nashville during the Great Recession. At that time, the city experiencing 7 years of GDP growth and an increase of $35 billion (45 percent) in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-01|title=Total Gross Domestic Product for Nashville-Davidson--Murfreesboro--Franklin, TN (MSA)|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NGMP34980|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nashville has had one of the most successful recoveries from the recession. By the end of Dean's mayoral term, Nashville had added the third highest percentage employment since its lowest point in the recession out of all cities in the US, adding over 144,300 jobs (19.3 percent employment growth).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2015/6/04/which-metro-areas-have-gained-the-most-jobs-since-the-great-recession|title=Which Metro Areas Have Gained the Most Jobs Since the Great Recession?|website=www.pewtrusts.org|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crime and safety ===
With public safety as one of Dean's primary campaign promises, Dean increased the size of the Nashville police force by 13.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/Finance/docs/OMB/FY16_Budget/Final/FY16OperatingBudget.pdf|title=Nashville &gt; Page Not Found|last=Nashville|first=|date=|website=www.nashville.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this, Dean opened two new precincts to more equally distribute areas of coverage and started Nashville's first DNA crime lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/2445/Mayor-Opens-Nashvilles-First-FullService-Crime-Laboratory|title=Nashville {{!}} Mayor Opens Nashville's First Full-Service Crime Laboratory|last=Nashville|website=www.nashville.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, Nashville had reached the lowest crime numbers and homicide rate in its history.

=== Environment ===
Dean's time as Mayor was accompanied by increased construction of greenway and bike paths around the city of Nashville. He added over 4,000 acres of park land and created the city's Office of Environment and Sustainability. As a result of his efforts, curbside recycling was expanded around the Metro area and the city moved in a more green direction.

==Gubernatorial campaign==
On February 26, 2017, Dean announced he would run for [[Governor of Tennessee]] in the [[Tennessee gubernatorial election, 2018|2018 election]] as a Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/26/former-nashville-mayor-karl-dean-run-governor-tennessee/98353738/|title=Former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean to run for governor of Tennessee|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is casting himself as a pro-business moderate running on a message of education, jobs, and healthcare in Tennessee.

In the first three months of the campaign, Dean raised $1.2 million and spent $200,000, making him the third most funded candidate for governor behind Republicans [[Randy Boyd (Tennessee politician)|Randy Boyd]] &amp; [[Bill Lee (Tennessee politician)|Bill Lee]].

==Personal life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
Dean has been married to Anne Davis, a prominent Tennessee lawyer, since August 6, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KarlFDean/status/1026638299396534272|title=Happy 35th Anniversary to by beautiful wife Anne.

{{Norwegian-people}}
The '''Kola Norwegians''' ({{lang-no|Kolanordmenn}}) were [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] settlers along the coastline of the [[Kola Peninsula]] in [[Russia]].

==History==
In 1860 the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] granted permission for Norwegian settlements on the Kola. Around 1870, scores of families from [[Finnmark]] in northern [[Norway]] departed for the Kola coast, attracted by the prospects of fishing and trade. The Russian authorities granted them [[trade privileges|privileges]] to trade with Norway.

Most of them settled in [[Tsyp-Navolok]] on the easternmost tip of the [[Rybachiy Peninsula]] ({{lang|ru|Полуостров Рыбачий}}; {{lang-no|Fiskerhalvøya|links=no}} – both terms meaning "Fishermen's Peninsula"). Others settled in [[Vaydaguba]] ({{lang|ru|Вайдагуба}}) at the northwestern tip – Cape Nemetskiy ({{lang|ru|мыс Немецкий}}, "Cape German") – of the same peninsula. A vibrant society developed, retaining contact with Norway, especially with the town of [[Vardø (town)|Vardø]]. Some settlers returned to Norway shortly after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], but most of them remained at Tsyp-Navolok. In 1917 perhaps about 1000 lived on the Kola.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On 23 June 1940, [[Lavrenty Beria]] of the [[NKVD]] ordered the [[Murmansk Oblast]], encompassing the entire Kola Peninsula, to be cleaned of "foreign nationals". As a result, the entire Norwegian population was deported for [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|resettlement]] in the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]]. Soon they had to move from there too, because of pressures caused by the [[Continuation War|Finnish invasion]] of the Soviet Union in 1941. In spring 1942, a large proportion died of starvation and malnutrition.

Despite many having served in the [[Red Army]], they were not allowed to return home to the Kola after the end of the [[Second World War]]. Many children were raised without learning to speak Norwegian.

==Recent history==
After 1992, some descendants of the original settlers began to emphasise their family backgrounds, although only a few had been able to maintain a rusty knowledge of the Vardø dialect of the Norwegian language. Some have now migrated to Norway. There are special provisions in Norwegian immigration law which ease this process, albeit generally being less permissive than those which pertain in other countries which operate a "[[right of return]]". In order to obtain a permit to [[immigrate|move]] to Norway and work there, a foreign citizen must show an adequate connection to the country, such as having two or more grandparents who were born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dep.no/aid/norsk/dok/andre_dok/rundskriv/068081-250002/dok-nn.html|title=A-8/2006 Ikrafttredelse av lov 10.06.2005 nr. 51 om statsborgerskap og statsborgerforskriften, samt av endringer i rettshjelpsloven og utlendingsforskriften|date=11 August 2006|website=Regjeringen.no|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for citizenship, it is awarded on the same basis as to anyone else &amp;mdash; which basis includes the formal renunciation of the original citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udi.no/templates/Tema.aspx?id=7394|title=Want to apply: Citizenship|website=Udi.no|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, approximately 200 Kola Norwegians had settled in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article807148.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614060040/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article807148.ece|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 June 2008|title=Kolanordmenn lever på sosialen- Nyheter - Innenriks - Aftenposten.no|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the small village of Port-Vladimir, the last stronghold of the Kola Norwegians lost its official recognition due to depopulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://murmansk.allnw.ru/kolsky/news/32068|title=Кольский район.

{{Culture of Andorra}}
{{Languages of
| country   = Andorra
| official  = [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
| foreign  = [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]
| sign      = [[French Sign Language]], [[Catalan Sign Language]]
}}

The following languages are spoken in the Principality of [[Andorra]].

== Catalan ==
{{main|Catalan language}}
[[File:Sign in Catalan in Andorra.jpg|thumb|Most signage in Andorra is monolingual in Catalan]]
Catalan is the only official language of Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andorramania.com/constit_gb.htm |title=Constitution of Andorra (Article 2.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the historical and traditional language of the country used by government, television, radio, and other national media and is the main language of all the people living in the territory of Andorran nationality, who constitute 33% of the total population.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

It is also the main language of about 25% of Spanish immigrants (who constitute 43% of Andorra's population), usually those who immigrated since 1985 from nearby [[Catalonia]] or [[Valencian Community|Valencia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Recently the [[Government of Andorra]] is enforcing the learning and use of the language within the immigrant labor force as a means to fully apply the constitution and overcome the issue of people living in a country without knowing its only native language. Despite vast incoming tourism from Spanish-speakers from Spain, both public and private signage in Andorra is mostly monolingual in Catalan.&lt;ref name=girona&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romaniaminor.net/ianua/ianua04/ianua04_08.pdf|format=PDF|title=El català a Andorra: tota una lluita|first=Guillem|last=Molla|publisher=Universitat de Girona|language=it|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022071534/http://www.romaniaminor.net/ianua/ianua04/ianua04_08.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is the only country in which Catalan is the sole official language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gencat.cat/llengua/noves/noves/hm03primavera/catalana/a_farras.pdf | title=The  sociolinguistic situation in Andorra: results of differents studies | accessdate=1 May 2016 | author=Farràs, Jaume}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only country in which Catalan has official status in all of its territory.

== Spanish and Galician ==
{{main|Spanish language|Galician language}}
Spanish is the most important languange in Andorra after Catalan. It is the main language of about 70% of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] national immigrants (the remaining 5% speak [[Galician language|Galician]]). Most came to the country between 1955 and 1985.

The low degree of development of Andorra, the limited education in the immigrants' homelands, and the fear of an invasion by Spain during the [[Franco regime]] made it more difficult for the immigrants to integrate fully until 1993, when the constitution of the country was approved.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Since then, Spanish has become the second most used language of the population living in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catala.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=115|title= Tractaments protocul-laris|work= Estudi sociolingüístic del 2004|publisher=Principality of Andorra|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moreover is the dominant language of communication amongst people of different linguistic backgrounds—"the language of the street", thus triggering recent government efforts to promote more general and universal use of Catalan.&lt;ref name=girona/&gt;

Since Andorra also shares both Catalan and French education systems, children can learn Spanish if parents choose the Catalan option.

{{main|Portuguese language}}
The traditional economic situation in Northern Portugal ([[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte]]) prompted a large migration flux to the country between 1960 and 1980, increasing the Portuguese population to 11% of the total, which added to a small community of [[Brazilian people|Brazilians]] which migrated to Andorra in the 1990s has led to a present-day [[portuguese language|lusophone]] population of about 13% of the country's total.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

== French ==
{{main|French language}}
The nearby border with [[France]], the reduced tax-free cost of living, and job opportunities in the thriving tourist industry have resulted in 7% of the country's total population being French nationals, mainly immigrants from [[Francophone Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadistica.ad|title= Departament d'Estadistica|publisher=principality of Andorra|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the main language of communication next to Catalan in [[Pas de la Casa]] on the French border.&lt;ref name=girona/&gt;

As with Spanish, children can be taught at school in the French language, if parents so choose.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gannon2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dublin University Boat Club racing on the river Liffey]] --&gt;
Trinity College has 49 sports clubs affiliated to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301194425/http://www.tcd.ie/Clubs/ Dublin University Central Athletic Club]. There is a very strong sporting tradition at Trinity; however, in recent years sporting prowess has diminished somewhat with most students engaging in sport for recreational purposes rather than for competitive reasons.

The Central Athletic Club is made up of five democratically elected committees who oversee the development of sport in the college: the Executive Committee is responsible for all activities; the Captains' Committee represents the 49 club captains and awards [[University Sporting Blue|University Colours (Pinks)]], the Pavilion Bar Committee runs the private members' bar, the Pavilion Members' Committee and the Sports Facilities Committee.

The oldest clubs include the [[Dublin University Cricket Club]] (1835) and [[Dublin University Boat Club]] (1836). [[Dublin University Rifle Club]] was first founded in 1840 however the club under its current format was reconstituted in 1962. [[Dublin University Football Club]] which plays [[rugby football]] was founded in 1854 and is the [[oldest football club|world's oldest documented "football club"]]. The [[Dublin University Hockey Club]] was founded in 1893. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070121154143/http://www.tcd.ie/Clubs/DUHAC/ Dublin University Harriers and Athletic Club] was founded in 1885.

There are several graduate sport clubs that exist separate to the Central Athletic Club including the Dublin University Museum Players (cricket), the Lady Elizabeth Boat Club (rowing) and the Mary Lyons Memorial Mallets (croquet).

== Publications ==
Trinity College, Dublin has a very strong tradition of student publications, ranging from the serious to the satirical. All student publications are administered by the Dublin University Publications Committee (often known as 'Pubs') who maintain and administer the Publications room (located in House 6) and all the associated equipment needed to publish its newspapers and magazines.

Trinity News is Ireland's oldest student newspaper having been first printed in 1947 and being in regular circulation since 1953. It is currently published on a fortnightly basis producing 12 issues in total during the academic year. The focus is on students with sections including College News, National News, International News, Features, Film, Music, Food and Drink, Science, Sports Features and College Sports (amongst others). The paper has been very successful in the [[Irish Student Media Awards]] in the past, winning each of the "Newspaper of the Year", "Editor of the Year" and "Journalist of the Year" numerous times in recent years. Currently the position of Editor of Trinity News is a sabbatical one which is widely believed to be a major factor in the newspaper's recent success.

[[The University Times]] is Trinity's newer student newspaper: founded in 2009, it was named Irish Student Newspaper of the Year in its first year, an award won by Trinity News in the three previous years. It is funded by [[Trinity College Dublin Students' Union]] but its Editorial Committee makes editorial decisions independently of the Union. It replaced the University Record.

[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Campanile and Graduate Memorial Building).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Graduates Memorial Building]] (left) and [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]](right)]]
Trinity College has a vibrant student life with 124 societies (in 2011). Student societies operate under the aegis of the Dublin University Central Societies Committee which is composed of the Treasurers of each of the Societies within the College. Society size varies enormously, and it is often hard to determine exact figures for most societies - several claiming to be the largest in the college with thousands of members, while smaller groups may have only 40-50 members.

Situated within the [[Graduates Memorial Building]] is the oldest of Ireland's such societies, the [[University Philosophical Society]] (The Phil). Founded in 1683, the society has strong history in debating and paper-reading. Consequently over the past five centuries it has been addressed by the world’s pre-eminent thinkers and orators. The society meets each Thursday evening to debate motions of interest in the chamber of the Graduate Memorial Building. It counts among its Honorary Patrons multiple [[Noble Prize]] lauretes, Heads of State, notable actors, entertainers, well-known intellectuals, such as  [[Al Pacino]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Sir Christopher Lee]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[John Mearsheimer]].

Another such society is the [[College Historical Society]] which shares the GMB, traces it foundation to 1770, meets each Wednesday evening of Term to debate motions in the chamber of the Graduate Memorial Building, has been addressed by many great orators including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Ted Kenendy]], and counts amongst its former members many of the most prominent men and women in Ireland's history.

Other societies include [[Vincent de Paul Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|Vincent de Paul Society]] (VDP), which organises a large number of charitable activities in the local community; DU Players, one of the most prolific student-drama societies in Europe which hosts more than 50 shows and events a year in the [[Samuel Beckett]] Theatre; [[The DU Film Society]] (Formerly DU Filmmakers, formerly the DU "Videographic Society", founded in 1987) which organises filmmakers and film-lovers on campus through workshops, screenings, production funding, etc.; The DU Radio Society, known as [[Trinity FM]], broadcasts a variety of student made productions on a special events licence on FM frequency 97.3FM for six weeks a year; The [[Trinity LGBT]] society, which is the oldest [[LGBT]] society in Ireland and celebrated its 25th anniversary in the 2007/2008 year; The Dublin University Comedy Society, known as DU Comedy, hosts comedy events for its members and has hosted gigs on campus from comedians such as [[Andrew Maxwell]], [[David O'Doherty]], [[Neil Delamere]] and [[Colin Murphy (comedian)|Colin Murphy]]; The Dance Society, known as [http://www.dance.tcdlife.ie dudance], provides classes in Latin and ballroom dancing, as well as running events around other dance styles such as swing dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/31/dance-society |title=Trinitysocieties.ie |publisher=Trinitysocieties.ie |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029021249/http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/31/dance-society |archivedate=2010-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[Laurentian Society]] was revived. This society played a key role as a society for the few Catholic students who studied at Trinity while "the Ban" was still in force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mckenna.se/highres/payne/payne02tn.pdf |title=Trinity News, Trinity Archive, 1 Nov. 2005, p. 20 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Students' Union ==
The [[TCDSU|Students' Union's]] primary role is to provide a recognised representative channel between undergraduates and the University and College authorities. It represents both undergraduates and postgraduates in matters external to the university. The Executive, the Finance and Services Committee and Sabbatical Officers manage the business and affairs of the Union. The Sabbatical Officers are: The President, Communications Officer, Welfare Officer, Education Officer and Entertainments Officer and are elected on an annual basis; all capitated students are entitled to vote. The SU President, Welfare Officer and Education Officer are ''ex officio'' members of the College Board.

The Students' Union Communications Officer is responsible for the publication of the University Times (formerly the University Record), an editorially independent student newspaper, which is published every two weeks during term by the Students' Union. Though traditionally, the University Times has been seen to be the voice of the Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union, it has strived to remain as separate from the Union as possible. Many of the contributors are drawn from the ranks of class reps, though it is neither censored by TCDSU, nor do the Student's Union dictate its content.

== The Graduate Students' Union ==
The Graduate Students' Union's primary role is to provide a recognised representative channel between postgraduates and the University and College authorities. It primarily consists of two full-time officers, the President, and Vice-President. The GSU President is an ''ex officio'' member of the College Board. The Vice-President also acts as the GSU's Education and Welfare Officer.
The Graduate Students' Union publish the "Journal of Postgraduate Research" on an annual basis.

[[File:The Adyar Club 1905.jpeg|thumb|The Adyar Club, c. 1905]]

'''Madras Club''', or '''Adyar Club''', is a [[Gentlemen's club|gentleman's club]] in the city of [[Chennai]], [[India]]. Founded in 1832, it is the second oldest of its kind in India.&lt;ref name="muthiah"&gt;{{cite book | title=Madras Rediscovered| last=Muthiah| first=S.| year=2004| authorlink=S. Muthiah| publisher=East West Books (Madras) Pvt Ltd| isbn=81-88661-24-4|pages=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Madras Club was founded on 15 May 1832 as a European men-only club.&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt; Its first President was one H. Chamier.&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt; The Adyar Club was founded in 1890.&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt; In contrast to the Madras Club, the Adyar Club gave membership to women.&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt; Originally started as a Europeans-only club, the Adyar Club started admitting Indians as members in 1960.&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt; The two clubs merged in 1963 under the name "Madras Club".&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt; Since the merger, the Madras Club has been admitting Indians as its members.&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt;

The ''Civilian's South India'', in its 1921 issue, considered the Madras Club to be the best of its kind in the country

{{quotation|Madras being the Headquarter of Headquarters, the Madras Club is naturally the Ace of Clubs. It is said to be the best Club in India, and the Civilian can well believe that it is; you can lose yourself in it three or four times running, and parts of it are still believed by some to be unexplored. The Civilian thinks it is the only Club in the Presidency which is a convenience and not an institution or a duty; and that is only because it is so large that nobody knows or cares whether you are there or not|''Civilian's South India'', pp 51-52, 1921.&lt;ref name="srinivasacharip227"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of the city of Madras written for the Tercentenary Celebration Committee| first=C. S.|last=Srinivasachari| year=1939| page=227| publisher=P. Varadachary &amp; Co.|place=Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Headquarters ==

The ''Express Estate'', which now houses the [[Express Avenue]] [[shopping mall]], was till 1947, the original home of the Madras Club.&lt;ref name="muthiah" /&gt; The club moved to [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]] in 1963 and is still based there.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

'''Mazari''' ({{lang-bal|{{Nastaliq|مزاری}}}}) is a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribe in [[Pakistan]]. '''Mazari''' is derived from the Balochi word '''mazar''', which means "Tiger" in the [[Balochi language]].  [[Rojhan-Mazari]], a town in the [[Rajanpur District]] of the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] near the inter-provincial borders of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[Sindh]] and Punjab, is the stronghold of the Mazari tribe.

==History==

[[File:Tribal Elders, April 1896.jpg|thumb|Sir Nawab Imam Buksh Khan Mazari(K.C.I.E) with Richard I.Bruce(C.I.E) Commissioner of The Derajat in April 1896, Dera Ghazi Khan]]

The Mazari tribe is one of the oldest tribes of the [[Baloch people|Baloch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazari|1999|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The area the Mazaris conquered is still known as Tuman Mazari. It encompassed an area that included most of [[Kashmore District]] in Sindh, Tehsil Sadiqabad, Chatha Baksha Mazari District, Jhang and all of Tehsil Rojhan in Punjab. The arrival of the British saw the golden era for the Mazari tribe. The Chief ruled an area from the town of Bhong all the way to the Sulaiman mountain range and from Kashmore to Giamul. This is estimated to be an area of at least 8,000&amp;nbsp;km sq. The Mazaris continuously defeated, overwhelmed and annihilated the Nahars, Machis, Bugtis and Chandios and fought many battles against the Sikhs of Punjab who were the dominant power before the arrival of the British.

===Wars with the Sikh Empire===

[[File:This picture was taken by a mazari tribal chief- It will provide more information to readers- 2013-08-28 22-50.png|thumbnail|A portrait of Sardar Mir Bahram Khan Mazari]]

In 1836, [[Mithankot]], by then a strong Sikh garrison fortress, was attacked by the Mazari Baloch tribal forces under the command of Sardar Karam Khan, the younger brother of the Mazari Chief, Sardar Mir Bahram Khan. The attack came as result of the constant threats of Maharaja Kharak Singh to [[Rojhan Mazari]]. The garrison was burnt to the ground. Any prisoners captured were skinned alive. [[Ranjit Singh]] retaliated by sending Diwan [[Sawan Mal]], his governor of Multan to attack [[Rojhan]]. Rojhan was burnt. Despite this, casualties on the Mazari side were minimal as the [[Sikh]] army lost the element of surprise and the Mazaris were able to evacuate their city in time. They, then took refuge in the Suleiman mountains and continued to harass the Sikhs from there. This resulted in constant skirmishes between both the parties. According to book 'Tehreek e Mujahideen', after hearing about the bravery of Mazari's, [[Syed Ahmad Barelvi]] of Tehreek-e-Mujahidin, approached Sardar Karam Khan, at Kin and offered to fight jointly against Sikhs but he refused to accept the offer, after having consultation with his elder brother, Mir Fasih Khan. Afterwards, Diwan Sawan Mal invited Karam Khan to Multan where they entered to a mutual agreement which was to be ratified at Lahore.

Finally, in 1838 Mir Bahram Khan visited Lahore with 12,000 Mazari tribesmen and officials on the invitation of the Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The Mazaris were well received by the Maharaja at the Lahore Fort and given a royal welcome. The Maharaja had the Mughal-era Naulakha Pavilion (Saman Burj) inside the Lahore Fort specially renovated for the month-long stay of Sardar Mir Bahram Khan Mazari. This meeting between the two leaders officially brought an end to the long war between the Mazari Baloch and the [[Sikh Empire]] that started with the attack on Mithankot. This picture of Mir Bahram Khan Mazari is in the Sikh War Gallery in Amritsar, India, and was painted by the personal French artist of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh's court when Mir Bahram Khan Mazari visited Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;Northern India's Whose Who, Penguin Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The area held by the tribe can be categorized as arid and as well as fertile. To the west of [[Rojhan-Mazari]] lie the [[Sulaiman Range]] and to the east flows the River [[Indus]]. Rainfall is scarce but heavy showers do occur 3-4 times every year which lead to hill torrents from the west. The climate is excellent for crops like cotton, [[wheat]], rice, sugar cane etc. to grow.

==Language==
The language which the Mazari tribe speaks is known as '''Sulimanki Balochi''' which is widely spoken in Rojhan Mazari, Kashmor and in other parts of [[Balochistan]] as well. [[Saraiki language]] is also widely understood in the Rojhan Mazari. Mazaris in [[Sindh]] speak [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] as well.

==Sir Nawab Imam Buksh Khan Mazari==
His Noble Majesty, Sir [[Nawab Mir Imam Buksh Khan Mazari]] was the second son of Mir Bahram Khan Mazari. Mir Dost Ali Khan, his elder brother, was the initial chieftain of the tribe but as he fell to dissipated habits, his  younger more  energetic brother, Imam Buksh Khan took charge of the tribe.

===The Panjab Chiefs===
[[Lepel Griffin]]'s book mentions Sir Nawab Imam Buksh Khan Mazari and his son Nawab Mir Bahram khan Mazari:
{{blockquote|He (Imam Buksh Khan) speedily recognised the advantages of the new regime of law and order, and threw himself heart and soul into the work of making good subjects of the Mazaries. He never allowed self-interest or partnership stand in the way of justice; and the general recognition of his integrity gave him enormous influence, not only with Baluches generally, but among all classes of the population, Musalman and Hindu. His active and intelligent loyalty was conspicuous on various occasions. In the Mutiny he was made Risaldar of a corps raised for service during the absence of the regular cavalry regiment from Asni. He was appointed an Honorary Magistrate in 1859, and he of disposed all the criminal work arising in the Mazari State. Crime was severely dealt with, and good order enforced; his word being law to his people, who had entire faith to justice. An excellent feeling of loyalty prevailed in his territories. His services were conspicuous in deeling with the Maris and Bugtis, with whom he had considerable influence. He was of the greatest assistance to Sir Robert Sandemen when, he had to bring these troublesome and barbaric tribes under control, and prevent their raids on the British territory. In negotiations with the Khan of Kalat, extending from 1874 to 1877, his services were of value in bringing matters to successful issue. He received the title of '''Nawab''' in the latter year for distinguished services generally. He was made a '''Companian of the Indian Empire''' in 1884, and four years later was raised to the rank of '''Knighthood''' in the same order. He was also a provincial Darbari and for a time a member of the ''Punjab Legislative Council''. The Nawab was unquestionably the best of many excellent chiefs whose aid has been so valuable in watching our western border and keeping it free from the ravages of the semi- civilized races living beyond our jurisdiction. His character was singularly admirable one. His energy remained unimpaired to the last, although he was quite blind during his latter years. He died in 1903 and his eldest son, Nawab Bahram Khan, who inherited the whole of his jagir, succeeded him as a chief of the Mazari Tribe. Bahram Khan has won a prestige in his Tuman and in the neighbouring districts in no degree inferior to that which his father enjoyed. His services are sought outside his Tuman and in other districts in the settlement of tribal and inter tribal disputes: the Jacobabad authorities regularly invite him to attend their Jirgas twice a year. He keeps well in touch with the worlds affairs and never spares himself in the work of the Tuman which he has completely in hand. He was granted the title of ''Nawab'' in 1904 and was a '''Companion of the Indian Empire''' in 1907. In December 1907 he was appointed '''President of the Punjab Chief's''' association and was made a member of the '''Punjab Legislative Council''' on 1 January 1910. He is a Provincial Darbari and has been given the powers of an '''Assistant Collector'''. Of his brothers, Sardar Ghulam Haider Khan is an Extra Assistant Commissioner and Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan a Deputy Superintendent of Police. Of his other relations, his cousin Sardar Ali Akbar Khan is a Divisional Darbari, his cousin Sardar Taj Muhammad Khan is Subedar-Major of the Baloch Levy and his nephew Sardar Ghaus Bakhsh Khan a Jamadar of the B.M. Police and an Honorary Magistrate and Munsiff.}}

==Khan Bahadur Sardar Rahim Yar Khan Mazari==
[[File:Khan Bahadur, Sardar Rahimyar Khan Mazari (second from left) with a --British-- official and other --Baloch-- sardars 2013-09-01 15-38.jpg|thumbnail|Khan Bahadur, Sardar Rahimyar Khan Mazari (second from left) with a British official and other [[Baloch people|Baloch]] sardars]]

Rahim Yar Khan was the eldest son of Sardar Ali Akbar Khan Mazari and the grandson of Mir Bahram Khan. The British gave him the title of [[Khan Bahadur]] because of his tireless efforts in the service of the Empire. He was made the interim Tumandar/Chief of the tribe when Mir Murad Bukhsh Khan died and his son, Mir [[Balakh Sher Mazari]], was still a minor.

===Mention in Northern India's Who's Who===
The book describes him in the following words;
{{blockquote|Rahim Yar Khan, Mazari, Sardar, Khan Bahadur, Magistrate First Class, Sub-Judge, Provincial Durbari, Rojhan, District Dera Ghazi Khan. Born 1898. As Musahib Khas to the Honorable Sir Nawab Behram Khan Sahib K.C.I.E, Mazari Chief, gained considerable reputation for having satisfactorily performed a lot of intricate duties. In 1932, on the death of Sardar Mir Murad Bakhsh Khan Sahib the need was felt of appointing a guardian to his minor son, Sardar Mir Balakh Sher Khan. At the Durbar held for the purpose in April 1933, by the Chief Political Agent several Sardars offered themselves for the duty. After due consideration the Chief Political Agent in August 1933, appointed Sardar Rahim Yar Khan as guardian, although Sardar Rahim Yar Khan had not applied for it. He performed this responsible task to universal satisfaction. His high abilities were amply recognized by Government. He was made Provincial Durbari, Punjab and Sind; member, Shahi Jirga, Dera Ghazi Khan; and member, Shahi Jirga, Sind. He was also granted criminal powers 3rd Class and granted an allowance of Rs. 1,250 a year by Government. In 1935 he was invested with criminal powers 2nd class, in 1937 Civil powers 4th Class, and in 1939 criminal powers 1st Class together with some political powers.

In recognition of meritorious services to the Government he was conferred on the '''Title of Khan Bahadur''' in 1939.

During the last Great War Khan Bahadur contributed one lakh of rupees to the War Loan and collected several thousands for War Fund.
Khan Bahadur is held in universal esteem for being god-fearing, good tempered, hospitable, merciful and as a friend of the poor. His name and legacy will go down in the pages of history.}}

==Mir Balakh Sher Mazari==
Mir [[Balakh Sher Mazari]] is the Chieftain ([[Tumandar]]) and the Paramount [[Sardar]] of the Mazari tribe. As the Chief of Mazaris he holds the title of Mir and also goes by the styles of Tumandar and Sardar.  Mir Balakh Sher Mazari is the twenty-second Sardar and the seventh Mir of Mazaris. The eldest of three brothers, he has one surviving brother [[Sherbaz Khan Mazari]] who has played a prominent role in Pakistan politics. He himself is a former caretaker [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] and has been elected to the National Assembly numerous times. He was born on 8 July 1928 to [[Mir Murad Buksh Khan Mazari]], the twenty-first Sardar and the Sixth Mir of Mazaris. Initially Khan Bahadur Sardar Rahimyar Khan Mazari was made the care taker chieftain of the tribe as Mir Sahib, as he respectfully known as, was still a minor. Upon reaching age though, Mir Balakh Sher was formally acknowledged as the Chief, by the British government and tribal elders as well. His father, Mir Murad Buksh Khan Mazari had earlier succeeded his elder brother Mir Dost Muhammad Khan Mazari as the Chief. They were the sons of Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Mazari, the Nineteenth Sardar and Fourth Mir of Mazaris. Balakh Sher Mazari, after the completion of his education from [[Aitchison College]] in 1945 went on to live in [[Rojhan-Mazari]], from where he joined active politics in 1951. He went on to enjoy a fruitful career in politics, which spanned over five decades, before eventually retiring and passing on his political legacy to his grandsons, Dost Muhammad Mazari and Sher Muhammad Mazari. He is still active in his tribal responsibilities and enjoys immense support from the entire Mazari tribe to this day.

==Sardar Sherbaz Khan==
[[Sherbaz Khan Mazari]] is the youngest son of [[Mir Murad Baksh Khan]]. He was born in Rojhan in 1930 and was educated in the Royal Indian Military College in Dehra doon and in Aitchison College
Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari entered politics by supporting Fatima Jinnah, sister of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, against Ayub Khan in the Presidential elections of 1964. In 1970, he was elected to the National Assembly as an independent candidate . He was a signatory to the 1973 Constitution, as head of the independent group in the Assembly. After the Bhutto-led army action in Balochistan and the subsequent banning of the National Awami Party, he formed the National Democratic Party. This was part of an effort to oppose Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's autocratic rule as well as to bring about peace in Balochistan. He served as the leader of the NDP from 1975 to 1985 and the leader of the Opposition in Parliament from 1975-1977. A former friend of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, he became one of his main political opponents in the Pakistan National Alliance. The 1977 elections led to a civil agitation movement which ultimately ousted Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government and brought in Martial Law under General Zia.

During General Zia's regime he again played a key role in opposing the military regime. He helped establish Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), an alliance of opposition parties which included the Pakistan Peoples Party. He spearheaded a movement against the military government as the Chairman of MRD's "Pakistan Bachao "(Save Pakistan )Committee. The resulting agitation caused widespread commercial disruption in Sindh and parts of Punjab and but was brutally suppressed by the army at a cost of many lives. It was only after Zia's death did democracy finally return to Pakistan.
A strong believer of democracy Sardar Mazari was incarcerated on numerous occasions during both Zulfikar ali Bhutto and General Zia's rule. He was one of the few West Pakistani politicians to have opposed the army action in what was then East Pakistan against the Bengali's and the only opponent of Zulfikar Bhutto to have condemned his judicial murder. He was offered key political positions by Zulfikar Bhutto, Zia Ul Haq and later Benazir Bhutto but declined each one of them He has been an outspoken critic of the treatment meted out to Balochi separatists by the Central Government

He was defeated in the 1988 general elections due to differences within the Mazari tribe apparently engineered by "the Establishment" and retired from politics greatly disillusioned. In 1999, he wrote his memoir, ''A Journey to Disillusionment''.

==Main clans==
The Mazari tribe consists of 4 large sub-clans and 60 small sub-tribes. The Mazari Chief family belongs to the Balachani clan. Other clans include Sargani, Gahlani, Gandi, Lolai, Esiani, Pyomaar, Rustamani, Sodvani, Lathani, Gulrani, Sillachi, Harwani etc.

The '''Mojave phone booth''' was a lone [[telephone booth]] in what is now the [[Mojave National Preserve]] in [[California]], which attracted [[Internet|online]] attention in 1997 for its unusual location, at the intersection of two dirt roads in a remote part of the [[Mojave Desert]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} from the nearest paved road (Interstate 15 to the northeast, Kelbaker Road to the southwest) and miles from any buildings.

==History==
[[File:Mojave Phone Booth Headstone.jpg|frame|thumb|right|The headstone commemorating the phone booth, before its removal]]
The phone booth was originally set up in 1948 to provide telephone service to local [[Cinder cone|volcanic cinder]] miners and others living in the area, at the request of Emerson Ray, who owned the Cima Cinder Mine nearby.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite book |last= Nystrom |first= Eric Charles |title= From Neglected Space to Protected Place: An Administrative History of Mojave National Preserve |year= 2003 |publisher= [[National Park Service]] |chapter-url= http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/moja/adhi/adhi6.htm |chapter= Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assigned the name Cinder Peak Policy Station, part of a network of "policy stations" placed by mandate of the California government to serve residents of isolated parts of the state. The Mojave phone booth probably replaced an earlier booth {{convert|30|mi|km}} to the south.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A13200201|title=The Mojave Phone Booth|date=August 16, 2006|work=|publisher=BBC|access-date=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original hand-cranked [[telephone magneto|magneto]] phone was replaced with a payphone in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt; The [[rotary dial|rotary]] phone was then replaced with a [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|touch-tone]] model in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The booth phone's original number was BAker-3-9969. After area codes were established in 1947, it shared the same area code as all of Southern California, 213. In 1951 the area code 714 was split off from 213, and 714 was the booth's area code until 1982, when parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties were given the area code 619. The booth's area code for its final few years of existence was 760.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adventures with the Mojave Phone Booth|last=Daniels|first=Godfrey "Doc"|publisher=Deuce of Clubs|year=2018|isbn=|location=Owl's Head, Sonoran Desert|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a Los Angeles man spotted a telephone icon on a map of the Mojave and decided to visit it. He wrote a letter about his adventure to an underground magazine and included the booth's telephone number. An Arizona man, Godfrey Daniels, read the letter and started a website devoted to the Mojave telephone booth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The booth became an Internet sensation after it was mentioned in a New York Times article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/14/technology/if-a-pay-phone-rings-who-will-answer.html|title=If a Pay Phone Rings, Who Will Answer?|last=Licalzi O'Connell|first=Pamela|date=May 14, 1998|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon other people began calling the booth, others made websites about it, and a few even took trips to the booth to answer, often camping out at the site. Several callers kept recordings of their conversations. Over time, the booth became covered in [[graffiti]] left by visitors.

==Removal==
The booth was removed by [[Pacific Bell]] on May 17, 2000, at the request of the [[National Park Service]]. Per Pacific Bell policy, the phone number was retired. Officially, the removal was because of visitors' environmental impact on the [[national preserve]],&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; and a letter by the Mojave National Preserve's superintendent mentions confronting Pacific Bell with some long-forgotten easement fees.&lt;ref name="NPS letter"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://deserttripper.99k.org/mmletter.html |title= NPS Correspondence |first= Mary |last= Martin |date= June 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[headstone]]-like [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] was later placed at the site, but it too was eventually removed by the National Park Service. Fans of the booth feared that Pacific Bell had destroyed the booth,&lt;ref name="Final fate"&gt;{{cite web |author= Xochitl666 |title= The Final Fate of the Phone Booth |work= The Original Mojave Phone Booth Site |date= October 12, 2004 |url= http://deuceofclubs.com/moj/mojmail.htm#xochitl |access-date= April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was confirmed by Pac-Bell spokesperson Steve Getzug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adventures with the Mojave Phone Booth|last=Daniels|first=Godfrey "Doc"|publisher=Deuce of Clubs|year=2018|isbn=|location=Owl's Head, Sonoran Desert|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story inspired the creation of an independent short film, ''Dead Line'', a short documentary, ''Mojave Mirage'', and a full-length motion picture, ''[[Mojave Phone Booth]]''.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The booth was also an inspiration for the prologue of the [[Glenn Beck]] novel ''[[The Overton Window]]'', and is the subject of a [[99% Invisible]] podcast episode, "Mojave Phone Booth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mojave-phone-booth/|title=Mojave Phone Booth|last=Rosenberg|first=Joe|date=March 1, 2016|website=99 Percent Invisible|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''Adventures with the Mojave Phone Booth'' was published, a full-length book chronicling the booth's history, rise to fame, destruction, and aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mojavephoneboothbook.com|title=Mojave Phone Booth book|last=Daniels|first=Godfrey "Doc"|date=August 5, 2018|website=Mojave Phone Booth book|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4767">The '''Motor Bus Society''' (MBS) is a [[United States]]-based [[non-profit organization]] formed by a [[voluntary association]] of persons who share an interest in [[bus]]es and [[bus transport]]ation in [[North America]] and, in particular, the history of the same.  Founded in 1948, it publishes the quarterly magazine, ''Motor Coach Age'', and holds a national convention semi-annually for its members.&lt;ref name="oregonian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Bill|date=October 2, 2000|title=Motor Bus Society members will go all through the town for convention|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|location=Portland, Oregon|page=B4|url=http://0-infoweb.newsbank.com.catalog.multcolib.org/resources/doc/nb/news/0EB08C946874A58F?p=AMNEWS|via=[[NewsBank]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBS is based in [[New Jersey]]&lt;ref name="contact info"&gt;[http://www.motorbussociety.org/contact.html MBS Contact Information.]  Motor Bus Society.

==History==
Originally organized in 1948 as the '''National Motor Bus Association'''&lt;ref name="oregonian"/&gt; and later changing its name to the '''Motor Bus Society, Inc.''', the group's membership includes people working in the bus industry as well as bus enthusiasts, and some members fit both descriptions.&lt;ref name="50years"/&gt; Its newsletter soon developed into a regular magazine (see below).  Every year since the early 1950s the association has held national membership [[Convention (meeting)|convention]]s, in different cities across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  There are normally two conventions each year, in spring and fall, one held in the eastern U.S. (or  eastern Canada) and the other in the western U.S. (or Canada).&lt;ref name="oregonian"/&gt; As of 2000, MBS had about 1,200 members.&lt;ref name="oregonian"/&gt; It is incorporated in New Jersey as a type-[[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt, non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorbussociety.org/join.html The Motor Bus Society.] Retrieved 2010-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazines==
The Motor Bus Society's [[magazine]], ''Motor Coach Age'' (''MCA'') (ISSN 0739-117X), has been published since 1950.  For one or two years prior to that, MBS circulated a simple [[mimeograph]]ed newsletter named ''Bus Ways'', but this was replaced in January 1950 by ''Motor Coach Age'', which included photographs.  ''MCA'' was changed to a professional format in 1952, with 12- to 16-page issues.&lt;ref name="50years"/&gt; During a period of debate among members as to the society's direction, publication of the magazine became sporadic in the late 1950s, but became regular again in 1967, when a new editor, Albert E. Meier, took over that position.&lt;ref name="50years"/&gt;  Issues thereafter were published monthly and were each 24 pages long.  During the 1980s ''MCA'' publication was variably monthly or bimonthly, then bimonthly in the early 1990s.  Since the beginning of 1995, the magazine has been a quarterly publication.&lt;ref name="50years"/&gt;  Issue size varies between 24 and 56 pages, depending on the subject.

At least since 1967, the content of ''Motor Coach Age'' has always been focused on history,&lt;ref name="oregonian"/&gt; documenting in detail the histories of, for example, [[bus]] transportation in particular cities or particular operating companies, or the history of a specific [[Bus manufacturing|bus manufacturer]].  Included whenever applicable are histories of electric [[Trolleybus|trolley bus]] operation and trolley bus manufacturing.

From July 1994 until the end of 2003 MBS also published ''Motor Coach Today'' (''MCT''),&lt;ref name="index"&gt;[http://www.motorbussociety.org/mca/MCA-MCT%20Index%201950-2006.pdf Motor Coach Age &amp; Motor Coach Today Index, 1950–2006] (PDF). Motor Bus Society. September 30, 2006. Retrieved 2010-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt; a quarterly magazine focusing on present-day operations rather than history.

The '''Mojeños''', also known as '''Moxeños''', '''Moxos''', or '''Mojos''', are an [[indigenous peoples of Bolivia|indigenous people]] of [[Bolivia]]. They lived in south central [[Beni Department]],&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; on both banks of the [[Mamore River]], and on the marshy plains to its west, known as the [[Llanos de Mojos]]. The Mamore is a tributary to the [[Madeira River]] in northern [[Bolivia]].

Mojeños were traditionally [[hunter-gatherer]]s, as well as farmers and pastoralists.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;. [[Jesuit]] missionaries established towns in the Mojos plains beginning in 1682, converting native peoples to Catholicism and establishing a system of social organization that would endure well beyond the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 &lt;ref&gt;Block, David (1994). ''Mission Culture on the Upper Amazon: Native Tradition, Jesuit Enterprise and Secular Policy in Moxos, 1660-1880''; Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Mojeño ethnic identification derives from a process of ethnogenesis as a result of this encounter between a number of pre-existing ethnic groups in this mission environment. This process occurred in several different mission towns, resulting in distinct Mojeño identities, including '''Mojeño-Trinitarios''' (Trinidad mission), '''Mojeño-Loretanos''' (Loreto mission), '''Mojeño-Javerianos''', and '''Mojeño-Ignacianos''' ([[San Ignacio de Moxos]] mission).&lt;ref name=VM93&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = PIEB | isbn = 978-99954-32-24-9 | last = Molina Argandoña | first = Wilder. |author2=Cynthia. Vargas Melgar |author3=Pablo. Soruco Claure  | title = Estado, identidades territoriales y autonomías en la región amazónica de Bolivia | location = La Paz | year = 2008 | page = 93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They numbered some 30,000 in the first decade of the 20th century. Many Mojeño communities are affiliated with the Central de Pueblos Indígenas del Beni and/or the Central de Pueblos Étnicos Mojeños del Beni.&lt;ref name=VM93 /&gt;

==Language==
In addition to Spanish, many Mojeño people speak one of several indigenous languages, belonging to the [[Arawakan language]] family, including [[Ignaciano language]]. In many communities, the language is used in daily life and taught in beginning primary school grades. A dictionary of Ignaciano Mojeño has been published, and the [[New Testament]] was translated into the language in 1980.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==Name==
They are also known as Mojos, Moxos or Moxeños.

==History==

===Moxos Before the Jesuits===
{{main|Llanos de Moxos (archaeology)}}
The previous inhabitants of the region, which before the independence of Bolivia was a single territory called Mojos, were the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal]] Itonama, Cayuvava, Canichana, Tacanam and Movima.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Parroquias de Moxos | title = Historia cultural de Mojos | location = Trinidad, Bolivia | year = 1988 | page = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, the Moxos or the Moxeños arrived.  The Moxos were from the [[Arawak]] ethnic group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74907-5_46 |chapter=The Llanos de Mojos |title=The Handbook of South American Archaeology |pages=927–39 |year=2008 |last1=Walker |first1=John H. |isbn=978-0-387-74906-8 |editor1-first=Helaine |editor1-last=Silverman |editor2-first=William H. |editor2-last=Isbell }}&lt;/ref&gt; an ethnic group which developed a more complex culture between the [[Amazon rainforest]] and [[Los Llanos (South America)]].

For unknown reasons, between the [[15th century BC|15th Century B.C.]] and the [[8th century BC|8th Century B.C.]], agricultural Arawak groups from the lowlands (present-day [[Surinam]]) abandoned their lands and migrated to the west and south, bringing with them a tradition of incised ceramics.  The Moxos, who were part of this population stream, built irrigation canals and crop terraces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.02.011 |title=Pre-Columbian human occupation patterns in the eastern plains of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivian Amazonia |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=1875–85 |year=2010 |last1=Lombardo |first1=Umberto |last2=Prümers |first2=Heiko }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ritual sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = U of California Press | last = Denevan | first = William | title = The aboriginal cultural geography of the Llanos de Mojos of Bolivia | location = Berkeley; Los Angeles | year = 1966 | page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of years before the [[Common Era]], the Arawak also migrated north and populated the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]].  This slow expansion resulted in their arrival at the islands of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] (present-day island of the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]).

Pottery pieces found in the countryside of the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia]], and even in the present-day precinct of the city [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], reveal that the region was populated by an Arawak tribe (known as the [[Chané]]) with a ceramic-making culture.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Writers such as Diego Felipe de Alcaya, tell of a group living between the last buttresses of the [[Andes]] Mountains and the central arm of the [[Rio Grande|Guapay River]].  The communities all throughout this great plain region and along the banks of the river were established and allied under the superior command of a leader, whom Alcaya describes with the title of king.  This king, called by the dynastic name of Grigotá, had a comfortable dwelling and wore a vividly-colored shirt.  Chiefs (caciques), named as Goligoli, Tundi, and Vitupué, were subordinate to Grigotá and had control of hundreds of warriors.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

As a result, the first Jesuits in Moxos encountered a developed, ancient civilization. Thousands and thousands of artificial hills up to 60 feet high dotted the landscape, along with hundreds of artificial rectangular ponds up to three feet deep, all part of a system of cultivation and irrigation. The people used the built-up high ground for farming and dug canals to unite ponds and rivers that caught water in this flood-prone region.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

All these architectural and structural masterpieces can be attributed to the ancestors of the present-day Moxeños, who include the Arawak, the most extensive ethnic group in the area. The [[Moxos language]] belongs to a language family called [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]. The Arawak have always been famous architects, and indeed the great hydraulic works (dated to ca. 250 CE) of their ancient empire is located in the territory of Moxos.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Even today one speaks of the "Amazonian cultures" as a block, despite the differences between the various peoples. The Amazonian cosmos includes a tripartite world: the sky above, the earth here, and the underworld below. These cultures believe that the earth is controlled by a father creator, in collaboration with created spirits or dueños, masters, of places or things and with ancestors who help to maintain justice and balance. Slipping from the norm brings about a spiritual sickness that is cured by a communal search for the cause and by a variety of religious rituals, including prayers and natural remedies. In Moxos the principal dueños are the spirits of the jungle (connected with the tiger) and of the water (connected with the rainbow). Many rich dances renew the life of the community and the universe.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

===Jesuit mission era===
[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests arriving from [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] began evangelizing native peoples of the region in the 1670s. They set up a series of missions near the [[Mamoré River]] for this purpose beginning with Loreto. The principal mission was established at [[Trinidad, Bolivia|Trinidad]] in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Verso | isbn = 978-0-86091-398-6 | last = Gott | first = Richard | title = Land without evil : utopian journeys across the South American watershed | location = London; New York | year = 1993 | page = 225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit missionaries who first encountered the Moxeños found a people with a strong belief in God as father and creator. The Jesuits accepted in their catechism the names the indigenous peoples gave to God in their own languages, trying to embrace all aspects of the culture not contrary to Christian faith or custom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.companysj.com/v153/returntosanignacio.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protection of human life, the preservation of [[property]] and the maintenance of general community security are among NENA's objectives.

One of NENA's main functions is to grade the quality of the [[9-1-1]] (the Universal Emergency Number since 1968) services that exist throughout the [[United States of America]].  Through their Report Card to the Nation (RCN), the RCN Commission reviews and grades the performance of 9-1-1 centers based on their established standards of practice.  
NENA is tracking the deployment of [[Enhanced 9-1-1]] and the Wireless Phase 1 and 2 initiatives.  The latter are enabling 9-1-1 call takers to (in Phase 1) identify the cell tower related to the caller and (in Phase 2) to identify the actual geographic location of the caller.

[[File:AntiSec.svg|thumb|An image that [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] has used to represent the operation; it contains elements of symbols used to represent both Anonymous and [[LulzSec]].]]
'''Operation Anti-Security''', also referred to as '''Operation AntiSec''' or '''#AntiSec''', is a series of [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] attacks performed by members of hacking group [[LulzSec]] and BlackSec, the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], and others inspired by the announcement of the operation. LulzSec performed the earliest attacks of the operation, with the first against the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] on 20 June 2011. Soon after, the group released information taken from the servers of the [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]]; Anonymous would later release information from the same agency two more times. An offshoot of the group calling themselves LulzSecBrazil launched attacks on numerous websites belonging to the [[Government of Brazil]] and the energy company [[Petrobras]]. LulzSec claimed to retire as a group, but on 18 July they reconvened to hack into the websites of British newspapers ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'', posting a fake news story of the death of the publication's owner [[Rupert Murdoch]].

Anonymous released their first cache of the operation on 27 June 2011, taken from an anti-[[cyberterrorism]] program run by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. They continued attacks on the Arizona government. They also launched attacks against the governments of [[Brazil]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Tunisia]]. Their most recent attacks have been against large corporations, [[NATO]], and various United States law enforcement websites. Anonymous has used the stolen credit card numbers of police officers to make unauthorized donations to various causes. Others have also committed hacks in the name of the operation, including a hack into the [[Fox News]] [[Twitter]] account to post a false news story about the assassination of [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] and attacks on the websites of government entities in various countries. The groups involved have published sensitive government and corporate information, as well as the email addresses, names, and social security numbers, and credit card numbers of website users.

[[Law enforcement]] has launched investigations into many of the attacks committed as part of Operation AntiSec. At least seven arrests have been made in connection to activities related to the operation, including the arrests of two purported LulzSec members, a man who provided LulzSec with security vulnerability information, and four alleged members of AntiSec NL, a group inspired by the operation.

==Background==
The [[LulzSec]] hacking group formed in May 2011 and came to international prominence after hacking the websites of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]], [[Sony]], and the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref name=twsj&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morse|last2=Sherr|first1=Andrew|first2=Ian|title=For Some Hackers, The Goal Is Just To Play A Prank|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110605-702801.html|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|page=B1|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Svensson | title = Parting is such tweet sorrow for hacker group | date = 27 June 2011 | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/technology/security/parting-is-such-tweet-sorrow-for-hacker-group-20110626-1glos.html#ixzz1QSL6wvEC | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate = 29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the group claimed to hack "for the lulz" and to enjoy the chaos that follows their intrusions.&lt;ref name=reasons&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=David|title=Three Reasons to Fear Lulzsec: Sites, Skills, and Slant|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2387219,00.asp|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=[[PC Magazine]]|date=19 June 2011|agency=[[Ziff Davis]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zZnbgTxl|archivedate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Jerome|title=Who are the group behind this week's CIA hack?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/who-are-the-group-behind-this-weeks-cia-hack-2298430.html|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=16 June 2011|agency=Independent Print Limited|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zZlxA19Y|archivedate=20 June 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 20 June 2011, the group announced that they were teaming up with hacking collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] for a series of attacks they dubbed Operation Anti-Security or Operation AntiSec.

==LulzSec activities==
LulzSec launched the first attacks of the operation against the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]], the national [[law enforcement agency]] of the [[United Kingdom]] that handles [[cybercrime]]. The group launched a [[Denial-of-service attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]] against the agency's website on 20 June, taking it offline for only a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=David|title=LulzSec claims Soca hack|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/blogs/communication-breakdown-10000030/lulzsec-claims-soca-hack-10022772/|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=[[ZDNet]]|date=20 June 2011|agency=[[CBS Interactive]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zaPT1ekX|archivedate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, they knocked the website of the [[Jianhua District]] in [[Qiqihar]], [[China]] offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ragan|first=Steve|title=LulzSec and Anonymous: Hunting for skeletons hidden in closets|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201125/7295/LulzSec-and-Anonymous-Hunting-for-skeletons-hidden-in-closets|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Tech Herald]]|date=21 June 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zbHJFF18|archivedate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, the group released a large cache of documents taken from the servers of the [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]]. The release, titled "chinga la migra", roughly translating to "fuck the [[border guard|border patrol]]", including email addresses and passwords and hundreds of documents marked "sensitive" or "for official use only".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aamoth|first=Doug|title=LulzSec Claims Breach Against Arizona Law Enforcement|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/06/23/lulzsec-claims-breach-against-arizona-law-enforcement/|accessdate=23 June 2011|newspaper=Techland (Time)|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group claimed that they did so in retaliation for the passage of [[Arizona SB 1070]], a law they saw as leading to unjust racial profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsotsis|first=Alexia|title=LulzSec Releases Arizona Law Enforcement Data In Retaliation For Immigration Law|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/23/lulzsec-releases-arizona-law-enforcement-data-in-retaliation-for-immigration-law/|accessdate=23 June 2011|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona complained that the release of officer identities and the personal information of their families could put them and their families in danger and gave those exposed security protection. In response, they mobilized the [[Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center]] and locked remote access of Department of Public Safety email accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DPS Victim of Cyber Attack|url=http://www.azdps.gov/Media/News/View/?p=316|work=Press Releases|publisher=[[Arizona Department of Public Safety]]|accessdate=30 June 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zonSmr0O|archivedate=30 June 2011|location=[[Phoenix, Arizona]]|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2011, the group released what they described as their last dump of the operation. The release contained a large amount of information from varied sources. Included was information from numerous companies, including half a [[gigabyte]] of data from telecommunications company [[AT&amp;T]] and [[IP address]]es from [[Sony]], [[Viacom]], [[Disney]], [[EMI]], and [[NBC Universal]].&lt;ref name=whittaker&gt;{{cite news|last=Whittaker|first=Zack|title=LulzSec disbands: Final cache includes AT&amp;T internal data and 750,000 user accounts|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/lulzsec-disbands-final-cache-includes-at-t-internal-data-and-750000-user-accounts/11134|accessdate=26 June 2011|newspaper=[[ZDNet]]|date=25 June 2011|agency=[[CBS Interactive]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zijhtzV4|archivedate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|title=LulzSec Says Goodbye, Dumping NATO, AT&amp;T, Gamer Data|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/06/25/lulzsec-says-goodbye-dumping-nato-att-gamer-data/|accessdate=26 June 2011|newspaper=[[Forbes Magazine]]|date=25 June 2011|agency=[[Forbes]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ziimGwf5|archivedate=26 June 2011|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AT&amp;T portion included information pertaining to the release of the [[4G]] LTE, 90,000 personal phones used by [[IBM]], and the development of the [[iPad 3]].&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sin|first=Gloria|title=LulzSec leaked AT&amp;T LTE rollout plans and iPad 3 rumor|url=http://asia.cnet.com/crave/lulzsec-leaked-atandt-lte-rollout-plans-and-ipad-3-rumor-62209544.htm|accessdate=4 July 2011|newspaper=[[CNET]]|date=28 June 2011|agency=[[CBS Interactive]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zw204VrM|archivedate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained over 750,000 usernames and password combinations, including 200,000 from hackforums.net, 12,000 from the [[NATO]] online bookstore, 500,000 from the online [[video game]] [[Battlefield Heroes]], 50,000 from various video game forums, and 29 from [[Ireland|Irish]] [[private investigation]] company Priority Investigations.&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt; Finally, an internal manual for [[AOL]] engineers and a screencapture of the [[United States Navy]] website [[navy.mil]] after being vandalized.&lt;ref name=greenberg/&gt;

===June 2011===
On 27 June 2011, Anonymous published information relating to the Cyberterrorism Defense Initiative's Security and Network Training Initiative and National Education Laboratory program, or Sentinel program, an operation run by the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. The hack included information that the agency distributed in 2009 and contained resources on publicly available hacking software, a list of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] bureau locations, details on counter-hacking tools, and form letters that law enforcement agencies used to obtain user details from [[internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reisinger|first=Don|title=Anonymous ready to roll in post-LulzSec world|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20074610-17/anonymous-ready-to-roll-in-post-lulzsec-world/|accessdate=5 July 2011|newspaper=[[CNET]]|date=27 June 2011|agency=[[CBS Interactive]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zx9CzH8u|archivedate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI revealed that supposed LulzSec leader Hector Xavier Monsegur, who went by the username Sabu, had been aiding law enforcement since pleading guilty to twelve counts, including conspiracy and computer hacking, on 15 August 2011 as part of a [[plea deal]].&lt;ref name=Sabufox&gt;{{cite news|last=Winter|first=Jana|title=Infamous international hacking group LulzSec brought down by own leader|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/03/06/hacking-group-lulzsec-swept-up-by-law-enforcement/|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=6 March 2012|agency=[[News Corporation]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/668lsO0Fu|archivedate=13 March 2012|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for his cooperation, federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Monsegur for his computer hacking, and also not to prosecute him for two attempts to sell [[marijuana]], possession of an illegal handgun, purchasing stolen property, charging $15,000 to his former employer's credit card in a case of [[identity theft]], and directing people to buy prescription drugs from illegal sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">'''[[Polygamy]]''' is legal in '''[[Indonesia]]''', the largest [[Muslim]] population in the world. Polygamy in Indonesia is not just practiced by Muslims, but also customarily done by non-Muslim minorities, such as the Balinese and the Papuans.&lt;ref name="Martyn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Courtens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickell"/&gt;
 
A Muslim man may take up to four wives. As allowed by [[Islam]], a man may take more than one wive as long as he treats them equally and can financially support them all. Despite such religious legality, polygamy has faced some of the most intense opposition than any other nation with the majority consisting of Muslims. Recent restrictions have brought about harsher penalties for unlawfully contracted polygamous unions and polygamy is said to be on the decline. Indonesian military personnel are only permitted to practice polygamy if their religion allows it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/07/defense-ministry-permits-polygamy.html |title=Defense Ministry permits polygamy |first=The Jakarta |last=Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he must prove to the government that his first wife is unable to carry out her duties as a wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genderindex.org/country/indonesia |title=Gender Equality in Indonesia&amp;nbsp;— Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Polygamy under [[Balinese Hinduism]] is sanctioned and unrestricted, but the marriage is regulated by ''[[adat]]'' (traditional customs).&lt;ref name="Martyn"/&gt; Although polygamous marriages are practiced in Bali, the nature of Hindu polygamy has not been included in the national marriage law debates.&lt;ref name="Martyn"&gt;{{cite book

== Complete ban on polygamy ==
In late April 2008, a rally of Indonesian women led a protest against the nation's laws allowing for polygamy and polygamous marriages; urging the government to enact a complete ban over such marriages. Male Indonesian politicians were found to be largely opposed, and such a ban has yet to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/23/2225118.htm |title=Indonesian women lobby for polygamy ban |date=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''posthumous name''' is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in [[East Asia]] after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of [[Table of Chinese monarchs|China]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korea]], [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam]], and [[emperors of Japan|Japan]].

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &amp;ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the [[era name]] and [[temple name]].

==Use==
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Duke Mu of Qin]], and [[King Cheng of Chu]]. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as [[Emperor Yao]] are considered to have posthumous names.&lt;ref&gt;''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. [[:zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014]]&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers of [[Shang Dynasty]] are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. [[Jian, King of Qi]]; [[Min, Marquis of Jin]]; and [[Chen Tuo]].

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the [[Qin Dynasty]], because [[Qin Shi Huang]] proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the [[Han Dynasty]] after the demise of Qin.

===Decline in use===
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang]] the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their [[temple name]] (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or [[era name]] (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

===Later developments===

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-[[Han Chinese]] rulers of [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], [[Silla]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Vietnam]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. King names of [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] and [[List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan]] also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as [[Wu Zetian]], or rebel leaders also had similar style [[regnal name]]s when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin]] and [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had different names from different people. [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Song dynasty few received bad names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad monarchs of the [[Joseon dynasty]] did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

[[Puyi]], the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (d.1908), in Vietnam with the [[Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor]] (d.1925) and in Korea with the [[Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor]] (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to [[Crown Prince Euimin]] and [[Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun]].

===Contemporary Japanese use===
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with [[Emperor Meiji]] (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of [[Hirohito|Emperor Showa]] (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

==Guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.&lt;ref&gt;明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those guidelines:

* Praises
** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler [[Cheng Tang]] (成湯), the founder of the [[Shang Dynasty]].
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
&lt;!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). --&gt;

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly [[stereotypical]]; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the [[Chinese sovereign]] entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example [[Hongwu Emperor]], [[Nurhaci]], [[:zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], [[Sunjo of Joseon]] and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of [[Ju (state)|Ju]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] used place names. Some monarchs of [[Yue (state)]] had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

==China==

===Emperors and empresses===

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for "[[emperor of China|emperor]]", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han]] (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "[[filial piety|filial]]" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]] have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the [[Qing Dynasty]] have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  {{Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation}}: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

===Imperial family===

According to the noble system since the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

===Officials===
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered [[canonization]] in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See [[List of Posthumous Names]] for some examples.

[[Confucius]] has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

==Korea==
In [[Korea]], [[Goguryeo]] kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of [[Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto]], the name described his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Silla]], every monarchs were given the titles of ''wang'' (왕, 王, "king") with two characters in posthumous names from [[Jijeung of Silla]]. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of [[Balhae]] were restricted to one character.

Most of the kings of [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] were called [[temple name]] more than posthumous name unlike dynasties of ancient Korea. All posthumous names for rulers of Goryeo and Joseon end in two of the characters for ''Daewang'' (대왕, 大王, "great king").

Details of the system of posthumous name were made during the Joseon Dynasty. The deposed king's names were made up of three parts: the temple name (묘호), eulogistic names (존호) and  posthumous names (시호). During the Joseon Dynasty, After five days the king's funeral, officials discussed and decided the king's posthumous name. The deceased king, who before his temple and posthumous names was decided, was called ''Daehaeng daewang'' (대행대왕, 大行大王). The Ministry of Culture and Education (예조, 禮曹) was in charge of the naming. When officials of the the ministry of culture and education selected three candidates and reported them to the next king, the next king chose the one of those names that he liked best. Also, Shorn of his power, the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple name unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of ''gun'' (군, 君, "prince"). [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan-gun]] and [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghae-gun]] were are notable examples. And there are some men who they didn't ascend the throne in their lifetime, but proclaimed as kings after they died by the their descendants who became king. There are nine men who proclaimed as kings in the Joseon Dynasty. In Joseon, there are nine men who raised to the status of the emeritus kings.

[[Gojong of Joseon]] proclaimed Korea an empire in 1897, receiving the title of emperor, thus the posthumous names of Gojong and [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]] end in two of the characters for ''Hwangje'' (황제, 皇帝, "emperor"). For example, full posthumous name of Emperor Gojong of Korea is ''Tongcheonyung-un Jogeukdonyun Jeongseonggwang-ui Myeonggongdaedeok Yojunsunhwi Umotanggyeong Eungmyeongripgi Jihwasinryeol Oehunhong-eop Gyegiseonryeok Geonhaenggonjeong Yeong-uihonghyu Sugangmunheon Mujanginik Jeonghyo Taehwangje'' (통천융운조극돈윤정성광의명공대덕요준순휘우모탕경응명립기지화신렬외훈홍업계기선력건행곤정영의홍휴수강문헌무장인익정효태황제, 統天隆運 肇極敦倫 正聖光義 明功大德 堯峻舜徽 禹謨湯敬 應命立紀 至化神烈 巍勳洪業 啓基宣曆 乾行坤定 英毅弘休 壽康文憲 武章仁翼 貞孝太皇帝), or ''Taehwangje'' for short.

[[Crown Prince Hyomyeong]] has been given longest posthumous names in Korea. He were posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with with 117 characters in posthumous names in 1899.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two [[kanji]] characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for [[Emperor Jimmu]] and [[Emperor Antoku]], for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of [[Emperor Monmu]].

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* [[Emperor Jimmu]] (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* [[Emperor Nintoku]] (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* [[Emperor Ōjin]] (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** [[Emperor Saga]] (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a [[palace]] (院 ''in'')
** [[Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō]] (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** [[Emperor Kōmyō]] (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a [[temple]]
** [[Emperor Higashiyama]] (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a [[hill]]
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** [[Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō]]  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** [[Empress Genmei|Empress Gen'''mei''']] (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + [[Empress Genshō|Empress Gen'''shō''']] (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = [[Empress Meishō|Empress '''Meishō''']] (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** [[Empress Kōken|Empress '''Shō'''toku]] (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + [[Emperor Kōnin|Emperor '''Kō'''nin]] (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = [[Emperor Shōkō|Emperor '''Shōkō''']] (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his [[Japanese era name|era]].  For example, after his death, [[Hirohito]] (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed '''Emperor Shōwa''' (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after [[Shōwa period|his era]]; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, [[Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2399">A '''Regional Planning Organization''' is a government body that guides the development of public and private resources in a manner that ensures public safety, well being and livability. Regional planning organizations take different forms and may also include a metropolitan planning organization or may be part of a multi-state or multi-government association. A regional planning organization develops plans that coordinate planning by groups of local governments and special districts that have common social, political, economic, cultural or other similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Chapter 6 Regional Planning|url=https://www.planning.org/growingsmart/guidebook/six01.htm|website=American Planning Association|publisher=American Planning Association Press|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally this process takes the form of [[urban planning]] or one of its sub-disciplines such as [[land use planning]], [[transportation planning]], or [[environmental planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Role of Regional Planning Organizations in Transportation Planning Across Boundaries|url=https://ntl.bts.gov/lib/52000/52100/52163/RPOsMegaregions.pdf|website=United States Department of Transportation|publisher=United States Department of Transportation Volpe Research Cente|accessdate=22 December 2017|page=1-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional planning organizations exist in a variety of different formats. In some areas they are a part of another organizations such as a Regional Council of Governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Council of Governments|url=http://www.rivercog.org/cog.html|website=River Council of Governments, Connecticut|publisher=River Council of Governments, Connecticut|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Councils, COGs &amp; MPOs|url=http://narc.org/about-narc/cogs-mpos/|website=About NARC|publisher=National Association of Regional Councils}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Regional planning organizations are sometimes also called regional development organisations as the need for planning often includes key economic development issues.

'''Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia''' was a mix of [[polytheism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Iranian religions]]. [[Arabs|Arab]] polytheism, the dominant form of religion in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], was based on veneration of [[Deity|deities]] and other rituals. Gods and goddesses, including [[Hubal]] and the goddesses [[al-Lat|al-Lāt]], [[Al-‘Uzzá]] and [[Manāt]], were worshipped at local shrines such as the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]].

Other religions were represented to varying, lesser degrees. The influence of the adjacent [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]s resulted in Christian communities in the northwest, northeast and south of Arabia. Christianity made a lesser impact, but secured some conversions, in the remainder of the peninsula. With the exception of [[Nestorianism]] in the northeast and the [[Persian Gulf]], the dominant form of Christianity was [[Miaphysitism]]. The peninsula had been a destination for Jewish migration since Roman times, which had resulted in a [[diaspora]] community supplemented by local converts. Additionally, the influence of the [[Sasanian Empire]] resulted in [[Iranian religions]] being present in the peninsula. [[Zoroastrianism]] existed in the east and south, while there is evidence of [[Manichaeism]] or possibly [[Mazdak]]ism being practised in Mecca.

Until about the fourth century, almost all Arabs practised polytheistic religions.&lt;ref name="Hoyland2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G.

The majority of extant information about Mecca during the rise of Islam and earlier times comes from the text of Quran itself and later Muslim sources such as the [[Prophetic biography]] literature dealing with the life of [[Muhammad]] and the eighth-century ''[[Book of Idols]]''.&lt;ref name="Peters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis E.

According to [[Ibn al-Kalbi]]'s Book of Idols, descendants of the son of [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] who had settled in Mecca migrated to other lands carried with them the holy stones from Kaaba and after erecting them started circumambulting them just like Kaaba. This according to him led to the rise of idol worship. Based on this, it may be probable that Arabs originally venetrated stones, later adopting idol-worship under foreign influences. The relationship between a god and a stone as his representation can be seen from the third-century work called the Syriac [[homily]] of Pseudo-Meliton where he describes the pagan faiths of Syriac-speakers in northern Mesoptomia, who were mostly Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m5Z9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=salmshezeb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uobDjD5Lts&amp;sig=TFUHDHEJO3ta3eAf7S8TuJVK1mY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwik5sTU05XbAhVDMI8KHRngDCoQ6AEwA3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Pagan God: Popular Religion in the Greco-Roman Near East|page=73, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deities and system of worship ===
{{Main|List of pre-Islamic Arabian deities}}

The pre-Islamic Arab religion was polytheistic, venerating many deities and spirits through statues, [[baetylus]] and natural phenomena. According to the ''[[Book of Idols]]'', there are two known types of statues; idols (''sanam'') and images (''wathan''). If a statue was made of wood, gold, or silver, after a human form, it would be an idol'',''&amp;nbsp;but if the statue was made of stone, it would be an image.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of Idols (1952 Nabih Amin Faris translation)|last=al-Kalbi|first=Ibn|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allah====

Some scholars postulate that in pre-Islamic Arabia, including in Mecca, Allah was considered to be a deity, possibly a [[creator deity]] or a [[Supreme Being|supreme deity]] in a polytheistic [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Allah." ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', edited by Juan E.

South Arabian inscriptions from the fourth century AD refer to a god called [[Rahmanism|Rahman]] ("The Merciful One") who had a monotheistic cult and was referred to as the "Lord of heaven and Earth". [[Aaron W. Hughes]] states that scholars are unsure whether he developed from the earlier polytheistic systems or developed due to the increasing significance of the Christian and Jewish communities. He also adds that it is difficult to establish whether Allah was linked to Rahmanan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aaron W.

====Al-Lāt, Al-ʿUzzā and Manāt====

Al-Lāt, Al-ʿUzzā and Manāt were common names used for multiple goddesses across Arabia.&lt;ref name= Robinson/&gt;&lt;ref name=TaurisPetra/&gt;&lt;ref name=BrillNabateans/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoylandp63/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manattauris/&gt;&lt;ref name= Hoyland142144/&gt;&lt;ref name=FrankArabic/&gt; [[G.R. Hawting]] states that modern scholars have frequently associated the names of Arabian goddesses [[Al-Lāt]], [[Al-‘Uzzá|Al-ʿUzzā]] and [[Manāt]] with cults devoted to celestial bodies particularly [[Venus]], drawing upon evidence external to the Muslim tradition as well as in relation to [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Hawting1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=G.R.

There are two possible etymologies of the name Al-Lāt.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=T. Fahd| year=1986 | title=al-Lat |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|volume=5|page=692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology best reflecting the Arab lexicographical tradition derives the name from the verb ''latta'' (to mix or knead barley-meal). It has also been associated with the "idol of jealousy" erected in the temple of Jerusalem according to the [[Book of Ezekiel]], which was offered an oblation of barley-meal by the husband who suspected his wife of infidelity. It can be inferred from [[Hisham ibn al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]]'s [[Book of Idols]] that a similar ritual was practiced in the vicinity of the idol of Al-lāt in Mecca.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; The second etymology, which is more in line with Semitic traditions in general, takes Al-lāt to be the feminine form of Allah.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; The word al-Lat was used as a name and title for multiple pre-Islamic goddesses of Arabia and was used for either a wife of Allah or a daughter depending on the region.

Allāt's cult was spread in Syria and northern Arabia. From [[Safaitic]] and [[Hismaic]] inscriptions, it is probable that she was worshiped as Lat (''lt''). F. V. Winnet saw Allat as a lunar deity due to association of a crescent with her in 'Ayn esh-Shallāleh and a Lihyanite inscription mentioning the name of Wadd over the title of '''fkl lt''. [[René Dussaud]] and Gonzague Ryckmans linked her with Venus while others have thought her to be a solar deity. John F. Healey considers al-Uzza actually might have been an epithet of Allāt before becoming a separate deity in Meccan pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John F. Healey|title=The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coso-V3gCEAC&amp;pg=PA114|year=2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9-004-10754-0|pages=112, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Redifining Dionysus'' considers she might have been a god of vegetation or a celestial deity of atmospheric phenomenoas and a [[sky deity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paola Corrente|editor= Alberto Bernabé, Miguel Herrero de Jáuregui, Ana Isabel Jiménez San Cristóbal, Raquel Martín Hernández|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|title=Redefining Dionysos|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=FmTnBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=allat+sky&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU_bSRgIncAhUJfisKHeE5B_8Q6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=allat%20sky&amp;f=false|pages=265, 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-‘Uzzá was meanwhile associated with the [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian goddesses]] Nanai, [[Inanna]] and [[Ishtar]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Manat was apparently associated with the Greek goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]].

===Mecca and the Kaaba===
The [[Kaaba]], whose environs were regarded as sacred (''haram''), became a national shrine under the custodianship of the [[Quraysh]], the chief tribe of Mecca, which made the Hejaz the most important religious area in north Arabia.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin33-34"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving M.

In The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKRybwb17WMC&amp;pg=PA286|year=2012|publisher=OUP USA|pages=286–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraha had recently constructed a splendid church in [[Sana'a]], and he wanted to make that city a major center of pilgrimage, but Mecca's Kaaba presented a challenge to his plan.&lt;ref name="Robin286"/&gt; Abraha found a pretext, presented by different sources alternatively as pollution of the church by a tribe allied to the Meccans or as an attack on Abraha's grandson in [[Najran]] by a Meccan party.&lt;ref name="Robin286"/&gt; The defeat of the army he assembled to conquer Mecca is recounted with [[Year of the Elephant|miraculous details]] by the Islamic tradition and is also alluded to in the Quran and pre-Islamic poetry.&lt;ref name="Robin286"/&gt; After the battle, which probably occurred around 565, the Quraysh became a dominant force in western Arabia, receiving the title "God's people" (''ahl Allah'') according to Islamic sources, and formed the cult association of ''ḥums'', which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba.&lt;ref name="Robin286"/&gt;

[[File:Black Stone front and side.PNG|thumb|right|A drawing of the Kaaba's black stone in fragmented form, front and side illustrations.]]

According to tradition, the Kaaba was a cube-like, originally roofless structure housing a [[Black Stone|black stone]] venerated as a [[Fetishism|fetish]].&lt;ref name="Zeitlin33-34"/&gt; The sanctuary was dedicated to Hubal ({{lang-ar|هبل}}), who, according to some sources, was worshiped as the greatest of the 360 idols the Kaaba contained, which probably represented the days of the year.&lt;ref name="armstrong"/&gt; [[Ibn Ishaq]] and [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi|Ibn Al-Kalbi]] both report that the human-shaped idol of Hubal made of precious stone came into possession of the Quraysh with its right hand broken off and that the Quraysh made a hand of gold to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis E. Peters|title=Muhammad and the Origins of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OrCo4VyvGkC&amp;pg=PA108|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1875-8|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; A soothsayer performed [[divination]] in the shrine by drawing ritual arrows,&lt;ref name="Zeitlin33-34"/&gt; and vows and sacrifices were made to assure success.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving M.

====Allah and Hubal====
Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in Meccan religion. According to one hypothesis, which goes back to [[Julius Wellhausen]], Allah (the supreme deity of the tribal federation around Quraysh) was a designation that consecrated the superiority of Hubal (the supreme deity of Quraysh) over the other gods.&lt;ref name="Robin304"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Julien Robin|title=Arabia and Ethiopia. In The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKRybwb17WMC&amp;pg=PA304|year=2012|publisher=OUP USA|pages=304–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also evidence that Allah and Hubal were two distinct deities.&lt;ref name="Robin304"/&gt; According to that hypothesis, the Kaaba was first consecrated to a supreme deity named Allah and then hosted the pantheon of Quraysh after their conquest of Mecca, about a century before the time of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Robin304"/&gt;  Some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of Allah as a name of a polytheist deity centuries earlier, but we know nothing precise about this use.&lt;ref name="Robin304"/&gt; Some scholars have suggested that Allah may have represented a remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities.&lt;ref name="Peterson2007"/&gt; There is disagreement on whether Allah played a major role in the Meccan religious cult.&lt;ref name=berkey42/&gt;&lt;ref name= Peters107&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis E.

====Goddesses====
The three chief [[goddess]]es of Meccan religion were [[Al-lāt]], [[Al-‘Uzzá]], and [[Manāt]], who were called the daughters of Allah.&lt;ref name=berkey42/&gt;&lt;ref name= Robinson/&gt;&lt;ref name= Peters/&gt;&lt;ref name=peterson46/&gt; Egerton Sykes meanwhile states that Al-lāt was the female counterpart of Allah while Uzza was a name given by [[Banu Ghatafan]] to the planet Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Egerton Sykes|author2=Patricia Turner |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pa7KAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=4 February 2014|publisher= Routledge|pages=7, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pilgrimage and rituals====

The pilgrimage involved the stations of [[Mount Arafat]], [[Muzdalifah]], [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] and central Mecca that included [[Safa and Marwa]] as well as Kaaba. Pilgrims at the first two stations performed ''wuquf'' or standing in adoration. At Mina, animals were sacrificed. The procession from one place to Mecca in a pre-reserved route moved towards idols before sunset. At Jabal Quzah, fires were started during the sacred month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xnU3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEu82-id_eAhUMpY8KHWPTCxIQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Emergence of Islam in Late Antiquity: Allah and His People|author=Aziz al-Azmeh|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby the Kaaba was located the betyl which was later called ''[[Maqam Ibrahim]]''; a place called ''al-Ḥigr'' which [[Aziz al-Azmeh]] takes to be reserved for consecrated animals, basing his argument on a Sabeans inscription mentioning a place called ''mḥgr'' which was reserved for animals; and the Well of Zamzam. Both Safa and Marwa were adjacent to two sacrificial hills, one called Muṭ'im al Ṭayr and another Mujāwir al-Riḥ which was a pathway to [[Abu Kubais]] from where the Black Stone is reported to have originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xnU3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEu82-id_eAhUMpY8KHWPTCxIQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Emergence of Islam in Late Antiquity: Allah and His People|author=Aziz al-Azmeh|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The known pilgrimages are that of Ḥilla who performed the ''[[hajj]]'' in autumn season while the other were that of the Ṭuls and the Ḥums who performed the ''[[umrah]]'' in spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xnU3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEu82-id_eAhUMpY8KHWPTCxIQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Emergence of Islam in Late Antiquity: Allah and His People|author=Aziz al-Azmeh|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ḥums were the Quraysh, [[Banu Kinanah]], [[Banu Khuza'a]] and [[Banu 'Amir]] who did not perform the pilgrimage outside the zone of Mecca's ''[[haram (site)|haram]]'', thus excluding Mount Arafat. They also developed certain dietary and cultural restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0OrCo4VyvGkC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=hums+tums+mecca&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYvv2g0N_eAhUBLY8KHdqeAsQQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Muhammad and the Origins of Islam|author=Francis E. Peters|publisher= SUNY Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Kitab al-Muhabbar'', the Ḥilla denoted most of the [[Banu Tamim]], [[Qays]], [[Rabi`ah]], Qūḍa'ah, [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], Khath'am, Bajīlah, [[Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat]], [[Hudhayl]], [[Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah|Asad]], [[Tayy]] and [[Bariq]]. The Ṭuls comprised the tribes of Yemen and Hadramaut, [[Al-Dith ibn Adnan|'Akk]], Ujayb and Īyād. The ''Basl'' recognised at least eight months of the calendar as holy. There was also another group which didn't recognise the sanctity of Mecca's ''[[haram (site)|haram]]'' or holy months unlike the other four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6tFvlaM1LmgC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=tuls+mecca&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqoezMyt_eAhUM5o8KHXhuBPoQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tuls%20mecca&amp;f=false|title= The Places Where Men Pray Together: Cities in Islamic Lands, Seventh Through the Tenth Centuries|author=Paul Wheatley|publisher= University of Chicago Press|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political and religious developments====

The second half of the sixth century was a period of political disorder in Arabia and communication routes were no longer secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Julien Robin|title=Arabia and Ethiopia.

=== History and regional variations ===
==== Non-Arab accounts ====

[[Esarhaddon]]'s annals while talking about returning the idols looted during the campaigns of his father [[Sennacherib]], name some North Arabian gods as Atarsamain, Nukhay, Ruldaiu, and Atarquruma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=nukhay+Essarhadon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibi9_Dkd_eAhVLPo8KHeoEDQEQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nukhay%20Essarhadon&amp;f=false|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in the 5th-century BC work ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', the Arabs at the time only believed in two gods; [[Orotalt]] (whom he identifies with [[Dionysus]]) and [[Al-Lat|Alilat]] (identified with [[Aphrodite Urania|Aphrodite Ourania]]).&lt;blockquote&gt;They believe in no other gods except [[Dionysus]] and the Heavenly Aphrodite; and they say that they wear their hair as Dionysus does his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples. They call Dionysus, ''[[Orotalt]]''; and [[Aphrodite]], ''Alilat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] III:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allat was identified as the mother of the gods by a Nabataean inscription. Herodotus ([[Histories (Herodotus)|Hist.]] I, 131) calls her ''Alilat'' and equates her with the Assyrian goddess [[Mylitta]] and the Persian goddess [[Mitra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Christoph Krehl|Ludolf Krehl]] | title= Über die Religion der vorislamischen Araber | year=1863 | page=43 | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QrFjTimgTOkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Julius Wellhausen]] | title=Reste arabischen Heidentums | edition=2nd | year=1897 | page= 32-33 | url=http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/wellhausen1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]] stated the Arabs worshipped Dionysus and Zeus. [[Origen]] stated they worshipped Dionysus and [[Urania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m5Z9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=orotalt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwift97h07PbAhVEPI8KHRyjClIQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=orotalt&amp;f=false|title=The Pagan God: Popular Religion in the Greco-Roman Near East|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Western Arabia ====
The [[Hejaz]] region specifically was home to three important shrines, one located in [[Ta'if]] was dedicated to [[Al-Lat]], another in [[Nakhla (Saudi Arabia)|Nakhla]] was dedicated to Al-'Uzza, and the other in Al-Qudayd was dedicated to Manat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Various other deities were venerated in the area by specific tribes. For example, the god [[Sa'd (deity)|Sa'd]] was venerated by the tribe of [[Banu Kinanah|Kinanah]] (although he also received worship by the Arab nomads around [[Palmyra]]). [[Suwa'|Suwa]] is an important god of the [[Banu Hudhayl]] tribe. Apparently, animal sacrifice was also practiced. According to the Book of Idols, animals such as camels and sheep would be sacrificed before the deity, often performed on an altar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

[[Medina]], then called Yathrib, was home to two polytheistic tribes; [[Banu Aws]] (which was also known as Aws Manat or "the Gift of [[Manāt]]") and [[Banu Khazraj]]. Both tribes were devout worshippers of the goddess Manat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nuhm, was a god worshipped amongst the Muzaynah tribe,&lt;ref name=Zain&gt;{{cite book|title= Studies on Arabia in Honour of G. Rex Smith|page=93|author=John F.

Al-ʿUzzá was worshipped in Nabataea where she had been adopted alongside Dushara as the presiding goddess at [[Petra]], the Nabataean capital, where she assumed attributes of [[Isis]], [[Tyche]], and [[Aphrodite]].

Manat was another Nabatean goddess and was identified with the Greek goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. She was the goddess of fate and justice. Within the Nabataean kingdom, the place she is most often mentioned is [[Mada'in Saleh|Hegra]] however there is no direct portrayal of her. In some of the inscriptions, she is linked with Dushara in cursing and fining those who violate the terms of use of the tombs and do not observe the rules, respectively. In two of these inscriptions she is linked with her ''Qaysha'' which according to various interpretations might be referring to another deity or an object.&lt;ref name=Manattauris&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FcAoBq4_EnEC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIhMXtyqLJAhWCe6YKHZRcC8AQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans|author= Jane Taylor|publisher= [[I.B.

Al-lat was another Nabatean goddess who was probably identified with [[Athena]] and [[Tyche]]. An image of her containing elements of both human and block form exists at 'Ain Shellaleh in er-Rumm along with an inscription which describes her as the goddess of [[Bosra]]. Three inscriptions mentioning her exist in [[Salkhad]]. However, her name isn't recorded anywhere in Bosra or Petra. Only a single bust of her near the Arched Gate of Petra testifies her existence in the capital.

In the same inscription where Al-lat is mentioned, a deity named ''Hubul'' is also mentioned. Jane Taylor takes this deity to be a god of divination.

The worship of the Syrian god [[Baalshamin]] was imported from [[Hauran]]. The [[Edomite]] god [[Qos (deity)|Qos]] was also worshipped by Nabataeans, as visible from inscriptions at [[Khirbet et-Tannur]].

Petra has many "sacred high places" which include altars that have usually been interpreted as places of human sacrifice, although, since the 1960s, an alternative theory that they are "exposure platforms" for placing the corpses of the deceased as part of a funerary ritual has been put forward. However, there is, in fact, little evidence for either proposition.&lt;ref name="Ball2002"/&gt;

The Aramaic [[stele]] inscription discovered by Charles Hubert in 1880 at [[Tayma]] mentions the introduction of a new god called Salm of ''hgm'' into the city's pantheon being permitted by three local gods - Salm of Mahram who was the chief god, Shingala and Ashira.

Religious worship amongst the [[Qedarites]], an ancient tribal confederation that was probably subsumed into Nabatea around the 2nd century AD, was centered around a polytheistic system in which women rose to prominence. Divine images of the gods and goddesses worshipped by Qedarite Arabs, as noted in Assyrian inscriptions, included representations of [[Atarsamain]], [[Nuha (deity)|Nuha]], [[Ruda (deity)|Ruda]], Dai, Abirillu and Atarquruma. The female guardian of these idols, usually the reigning queen, served as a priestess (''apkallatu'', in Assyrian texts) who communed with the other world.&lt;ref name=Hoylandp132&gt;Hoyland, 2001, pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions in a [[Ancient North Arabian|North Arabian dialect]] in the region of [[Najd]] referring to Nuha describe emotions as a gift from him.

[[Abgal (god)|Abgal]] (cognate with the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ab.gal, related to the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Apkallu]], "ferryman") was a pre-Islamic north Arabian god, known from the Palmyrian desert regions as a [[tutelary deity|god]] of [[Bedouins]] and camel drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jordan| first = Michael| title = Encyclopedia of Gods: Over 2,500 Deities of the World | publisher = Facts on File | date = July 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8160-2909-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bedouins had a code of honour which [[Fazlur Rahman Malik]] states may be regarded as their religious ethics. This code encompassed women, bravery, hospitality, honouring one's promises and pacts, and vengeance. They believed that the ghost of a slain person would cry out from the grave until their thirst for blood was quenched. Practices such as killing of infant girls were often regarded as having religious sanction.&lt;ref name="Carmody"/&gt; Numerous mentions of [[jinn]] in the Quran and testimony of both pre-Islamic and Islamic literature indicate that the belief in spirits was prominent in pre-Islamic Bedouin religion.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving M.

Bedouin religious experience also included an apparently indigenous cult of ancestors.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin59"/&gt; The dead were not regarded as powerful, but rather as deprived of protection and needing charity of the living as a continuation of social obligations beyond the grave.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin59"/&gt; Only certain ancestors, especially heroes from which the tribe was said to derive its name, seem to have been objects of real veneration.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin59"/&gt;

The key role played by Jews in the trade and markets of the Hejaz meant that market day for the week was the day preceding the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="Zeitlin2007"/&gt; This day, which was called ''aruba'' in Arabic, also provided occasion for legal proceedings and entertainment, which in turn may have influenced the choice of Friday as the day of Muslim congregational prayer.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin2007"/&gt; Toward the end of the sixth century, the Jewish communities in the Hejaz were in a state of economic and political decline, but they continued to flourish culturally in and beyond the region.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin2007"/&gt; They had developed their distinctive beliefs and practices, with a pronounced [[Jewish mysticism|mystical]] and [[Jewish eschatology|eschatological]] dimension.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin2007"/&gt; In the Islamic tradition, based on a phrase in the [[Quran]], Arabic Jews are said to have referred to [[Uzair]] as the son of [[Allah]], although historical accuracy of this assertion has been disputed.&lt;ref name= Robinson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|pages=1106–1107|chapter=Ezra|volume=6|quote=Muhammad claims (sura 9:30) that in the opinion of the Jews, 'Uzayr (EZRA) is the son of God.

In [[Nejd]], in the centre of the peninsula, there is evidence of members of two tribes, Kindah and [[Taghlib]], converting to Christianity in the 6th century. However, in the [[Hejaz]] in the west, whilst there is evidence of the presence of Christianity, it is not thought to have been significant amongst the indigenous population of the area.&lt;ref name="Goddard2000"/&gt;

Arabicized Christian names were fairly common among pre-Islamic Arabians, which has been attributed to the influence that Syrianized Christian Arabs had on bedouins of the peninsula for several centuries before the rise of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving M.

Neal Robinson, based on verses in the Quran, believes that some Arab Christians may have held unorthodox beliefs such as the worshipping of a divine triad of God the father, Jesus the Son and Mary the Mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neal Robinson|title=Islam: A Concise Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UL8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-81773-1|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is evidence that unorthodox groups such as the [[Collyridianism|Collyridians]], whose adherents worshiped Mary, were present in Arabia, and it has been proposed that the Qur'an refers to their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mun'im Sirry|title=Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us4sAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=qur'an%20jesus%205%3A72&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars, notably [[Mircea Eliade]], [[William Montgomery Watt]], [[G.R. Hawting]] and [[Sidney H. Griffith]], cast doubt on the historicity or reliability of such references in the Quran.{{refn|group=note|Their views are as follows:
* [[Mircea Eliade]] argues that Muhammad's knowledge of Christianity "was rather approximative"&lt;ref name="Eliade2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mircea Eliade|title=History of Religious Ideas, Volume 3: From Muhammad to the Age of Reforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeenAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77|date=31 December 2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-14772-7|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that references to the triad of God, Jesus and Mary probably reflect the likelihood that Muhammad's information on Christianity came from people who had knowledge of the [[Orthodox Tewahedo|Monophysite Church of Abyssinia]], which was known for extreme [[veneration of Mary]].&lt;ref name="Eliade2013"/&gt;
* [[William Montgomery Watt]] points out that we do not know how far Muhammad was acquainted with Christian beliefs prior to the [[Occupation of Mecca|conquest of Mecca]] and that dating of some of the passages criticizing Christianity is uncertain.&lt;ref name="W. Montgomery Watt 1956 318"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad At Medina|url=https://archive.org/details/muhammadatmedina029655mbp|date=1956|publisher=Oxford At The Clarendon Press|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that Muhammad and the early Muslims may have been unaware of some orthodox Christian doctrines, including the nature of the trinity, because Muhammad's Christian informants had a limited grasp of doctrinal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad At Medina|url=https://archive.org/details/muhammadatmedina029655mbp|date=1956|publisher=Oxford At The Clarendon Press|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Watt has also argued that the verses criticizing Christian doctrines in the Quran are attacking Christian heresies like tritheism and "physical sonship" rather than orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref name="W. Montgomery Watt 1956 318"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Sirry47&gt;{{cite book|author=Mun'im Sirry|title=Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us4sAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=qur'an%20jesus%205%3A72&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[G.R. Hawting]], [[Sidney H.

== Iranian religions ==
Iranian religions existed in pre-Islamic Arabia on account of [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] military presence along the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[South Arabia]] and on account of trade routes between the [[Hejaz]] and [[Iraq]]. Some Arabs in northeast of the peninsula converted to [[Zoroastrianism]] and several [[Fire temple|Zoroastrian temples]] were constructed in [[Najd]]. Some of the members from the tribe of [[Banu Tamim]] had converted to the religion. There is also evidence of existence of [[Manichaeism]] in Arabia as several early sources indicate a presence of "[[zindīq|zandaqas]]" in Mecca, although the term could also be interpreted as referring to [[Mazdakism]]. There is evidence for the circulation of Iranian religious ideas in the form of Persian loan words in Quran such as ''[[firdaws]]'' (paradise).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=95jSBFFaDkUC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAGoVChMImMbXsu2TyQIVSo-OCh221Avd#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Muslim Identities: An Introduction to Islam|author= [[Aaron W.

'''Sexism in the technology industry''' is [[occupational sexism]] in the [[technology industry]]. It has been variously argued{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} in the media that a high ratio of men to women, graduation rates for engineering degrees, and the [[culture]] of the industry itself  cause sexism in the technology industry.

==History==
In 1997, [[Anita Borg]], then senior researcher at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], complained that women "run into subtle sexism every day". At the time, only 5.6% of [[Silicon Valley]] technology companies were represented by women.&lt;ref name="Hamm970825" /&gt;

''The Athena Factor'' is a research report that the [[Harvard Business Review]] published in June 2008 to address the future of the technology industry in the United States. The report proposed solutions to a looming shortage in workers in the science, engineering, and technology field. The report suggested that rather than hiring immigrants, there are many women native to the United States to fill the positions.&lt;ref name="athena"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewlett|first1=Sylvia Ann|last2=Luce|first2=Carolyn Buck|last3=Servon|first3=Lisa J.|last4=Sherbin|first4=Laura|last5=Shiller|first5=Peggy|last6=Sosnovich|first6=Eytan|last7=Sumberg|first7=Karen|title=The Athena Factor: Reversing the Brain Drain in Science, Engineering, and Technology|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&amp;article=1009&amp;context=bjell_symposia&amp;type=additional|website=National Science Foundation|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=14 November 2015|ref=athena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In 1970, 13.6% of U.S. [[computer science]] and information science [[bachelor's degrees]] were awarded to women. By 1984, that number rose to 37.1%. In 2011, however, only 17.6% of undergraduate computer science degrees went to women.&lt;ref name=nces2012&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 2012 |title=Table 349: Degrees in computer and information sciences conferred by degree-granting institutions, by level of degree and sex of student: 1970-71 through 2010-11 |url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp |website=nces.ed.gov |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, [[Google]] posted on its official blog that only 30 percent of its employees globally were women.&lt;ref name=Bock140528&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bock |first1=Laszlo |last2= |first2= |date=May 28, 2014 |title=Getting to work on diversity at Google |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html |type=Blog |work=Official Google Blog|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan140529&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Gail |date=May 29, 2014 |title=Google statistics show Silicon Valley has a diversity problem |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/05/29/most-google-employees-are-white-men-where-are-allthewomen/ |newspaper=Washington Post |location= |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the ''[[New York Times]]'' said "the largest technology companies have released reports showing that only 30% of their employees are women",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Wingfield| first = Nick| title = Intel Allocates $300 Million for Workplace Diversity| work = [[New York Times]]| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2015-01-06| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/technology/intel-budgets-300-million-for-diversity.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the percentage of technical employees being even lower.

A [[Fortune Magazine]] review of data available for the 92 US-based [[venture capital]] firms which had raised "at least one fund of $200 million or more" between 2009-2014 found "only 17 had even one senior female partner", and 4.2% of "partner level VCs" were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Primack| first = Dan| title = Venture capital's stunning lack of female decision-makers| work = Fortune| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2014-02-06| url = http://fortune.com/2014/02/06/venture-capitals-stunning-lack-of-female-decision-makers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Open Diversity Data website has been created to provide access to diversity data for specific companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Open Diversity Data| accessdate = 2015-03-21| url = http://opendiversitydata.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 11% of Silicon Valley executives and about 20% of software developers are women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Corbyn| first = Zoe| title = Silicon Valley is cool and powerful.

A 2015 survey entitle "The Elephant in the Valley"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elephantinthevalley.com|title=Home|website=The Elephant in the Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a survey of two hundred senior-level women in Silicon Valley. 84% of participants were told they were "too aggressive" in the office, and 66% said that they were excluded from important events due to their gender. In addition, 60% of women said that they received unwanted sexual advances in their respective workplaces – the majority of which came from a superior. Almost 40% did not report the incidents out of fear of retaliation.&lt;ref name="newyorker_20171120"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Tech Industry's Gender-Discrimination Problem| website = NewYorker.com| accessdate = 2018-03-29| date = 2017-11-20| url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/the-tech-industrys-gender-discrimination-problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' obtained a copy of Google's Salary Spreadsheet in 2014, which depicts each employee's salary and bonus information. This spreadsheet reports that at Google, women receive lower salaries than their male counterparts for five out of six job titles that are listed on the spreadsheet.&lt;ref name="newyorker_20171120"/&gt;

==Media reports==
In 1997, [[Anita Borg]], then a senior researcher at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) complained that women "run into subtle sexism every day." At the time only one woman, [[Carol Bartz]] of [[Autodesk]], was a [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) among the largest [[Silicon Valley]] technology companies, and only 5.6% of the area's 1,686 major tech firms were run by women. It was even harder for female entrepreneurs. Of the $33.5 billion in [[venture capital]] invested in tech from 1991 through the second quarter of 1996, only 1.6% went to companies launched or headed by women.&lt;ref name=Hamm970825&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamm |first=Steve |date=August 25, 1997 |title=Why Women Are So Invisible |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1997/34/b354184.htm |journal=Business Week |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117023232/http://www.businessweek.com/1997/34/b354184.htm |archivedate=January 17, 1999 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 [[Crunchies]] award event, organized by [[Silicon Valley]] tech industry blogs, was criticized for its use of derogatory language towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Tiku| first = Nitasha| title = Sexism and consequences at TechCrunch's annual award show| website = The Verge| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2015-02-09| url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8004101/sexism-and-consequences-at-techcrunch-s-annual-award-show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple gender harassment and discrimination lawsuits in Silicon Valley have received media attention. One of the most widely reported was [[Pao v. Kleiner Perkins]], a discrimination lawsuit against [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers|Kleiner Perkins]] by then [[Reddit]] interim CEO [[Ellen Pao]], which went to trial in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Rogers| first = Kaleigh| title = Why Ellen Pao's Gender Discrimination Suit Matters| website = Motherboard| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2015-03-10| url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-ellen-paos-gender-discrimination-suit-matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sexual Harassment News| website = VentureBeat| accessdate = 2015-03-21| url = https://venturebeat.com/tag/sexual-harassment/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pao's lawsuit, which alleged that Kleiner Perkins indulged in double standards and denied her the senior partner position, resulted in a verdict for the defendant. Three jurors cited Pao's "increasingly negative performance reviews" as the primary reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/kleiner-lawsuit-idUSL1N0XK2K720150423|title=Kleiner Perkins seeks almost $1mln in costs in Pao case |first1=Dan |last1=Levine |first2=Jim |last2=Christie |publisher=Reuters|date=2015-04-23|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2016, [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] employee AJ Vandermayden filed a lawsuit against her company alleging sex discrimination, [[Retaliation (law)|retaliation]], and other workplace violations. Vandermayden brought about this lawsuit after learning her salary was lower than those of the eight other employees, all male, with whom she worked most closely, despite the fact that some of them had just finished college. She was also subjected to a much harsher standard in order to receive a promotion and pay raise that many of her male colleagues had received simply for working at the company for a certain period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/the-tech-industrys-gender-discrimination-problem|title=The Disrupters|last=Kolhatkar|first=Sheelah|date=2017-11-13|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible causes==
There are several possible causes and theories behind sexism in the technology industry.

=== Investment of grants and conscious belief in intellectual sex differences ===
Some scholars studying discrimination in the tech industry argue that since decision-makers in the tech industry often believe that men are inherently more technically competent than women, they think that it is economically a better investment to employ male tech personnel and to give higher budgets to the male staff than to the female staff. According to this model, those investments lead to more opportunities for male staff to produce high quality results, which in turn reinforces the statistical bias and is used as an argument for male technical superiority, causing a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. These scholars argue that the main problem is not unconscious bias, but conscious belief in allegedly scientific notions of sex differences, citing that the percentage of women in the highest quality tech work have decreased despite a decline in traditional and unconscious gender bias and quotas of women at lower levels of tech (though supposedly scientific claims of sex differences have increased and can account for the increased discrimination at top tech). While this model states that there is systematic discrimination towards women in tech, it explains it as a result of specific economical investment issues and does not presume a society-wide patriarchal structure nor even that discrimination must necessarily favor men in all aspects of society.&lt;ref&gt;Women in Tech: Take Your Career to the Next Level with Practical Advice and inspirational stories, Tarah Wheeler, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cases and Materials on Employment Discrimination, Michael J. Zimmer, Charles A. Sullivan, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender stereotypes ===
Men are typically more authoritative&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Eagly, Alice H. and Johnson, Blair T., "Gender and Leadership Style: A Meta-Analysis" (1990). ''CHIP Documents''. Paper 11. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/chip_docs/11&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and influential than women. In tasks that are perceived as masculine by society, women have less influence and are not considered experts. Only when a task is stereotyped as feminine will a women have more influence or authority than a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://academics.wellesley.edu/Psychology/Psych/Faculty/Carli/GenderAndSocialInfluence.pdf|title = Gender and Social Influence|last = Carli|first = Linda L.|date = 2001|journal = Journal of Social Issues|doi = 10.1111/0022-4537.00106|pmid = |access-date = 15 November 2015|volume=55|pages=81–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violating gender-stereotypic norms results in social penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Penalties for Success: Reactions to Women Who Succeed at Male Gender-Typed Tasks|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|pages = 416–427|volume = 89|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.89.3.416|first = Madeline E.|last = Heilman|first2 = Aaron S.|last2 = Wallen|first3 = Daniella|last3 = Fuchs|first4 = Melinda M.|last4 = Tamkins|pmid=15161402|date=Jun 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The interactive effect of influence tactic, applicant gender, and type of job on hiring recommendations|journal = Sex Roles|date = 1996-04-01|issn = 0360-0025|pages = 581–591|volume = 34|issue = 7–8|doi = 10.1007/BF01545034|first = E.

=== No sexism exists at all ===
According to studies of early childhood development in human children, boys preferred technical toys (e.g. wheeled vehicles) while girls preferred social toys (e.g. furry animals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption|last=Saad|first=Gad|date=2007-01-25|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780805851502|edition=1|location=Mahwah, NJ|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jadva|first=Vasanti|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|last3=Golombok|first3=Susan|date=2010-12-01|title=Infants' Preferences for Toys, Colors, and Shapes: Sex Differences and Similarities|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=6|pages=1261–1273|doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9618-z|pmid=20232129|issn=0004-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Gerianne M.|last2=Wilcox|first2=Teresa|last3=Woods|first3=Rebecca|date=June 2009|title=Sex differences in infants' visual interest in toys|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=427–433|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9430-1|issn=1573-2800|pmid=19016318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same obtains for non-human children: rhesus and vervet monkeys,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassett|first=Janice M.|last2=Siebert|first2=Erin R.|last3=Wallen|first3=Kim|date=August 2008|title=Sex differences in rhesus monkey toy preferences parallel those of children|journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=359–364 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.03.008 |issn=0018-506X |pmc=2583786 |pmid=18452921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Gerianne M|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|date=2002-11-01|title=Sex differences in response to children's toys in nonhuman primates (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus)|url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(02)00107-1/abstract|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|language=English|volume=23|issue=6|pages=467–479|doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(02)00107-1|issn=1090-5138}}&lt;/ref&gt; who cannot be said to be "socialized". Thus sex-based preferences for STEM subjects are innate and assuming third-party bias is wrong in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rabble-rouser/201707/why-brilliant-girls-tend-favor-non-stem-careers|title=Why Brilliant Girls Tend to Favor Non-STEM Careers|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various criticisms of these claims however. One is citing that since infants interact with other humans from birth, if only their parents, and rapidly absorb [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s, the concept of a pre-socialized stage is spurious. These critics argue that the monkeys that have been studied in [[primatology]] are ones that have lived close to human settlements and imitated human habits, and are therefore not non-socialized either.&lt;ref&gt;Picking Barbie™’s Brain: Inherent Sex Differences inScientific Ability?, Alison Nash, Giordana Grossi, June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective, Gary Ferraro, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics buy the existence of a pre-socialized stage, though they argue that there would be no evolutionary function for a brain mechanism that starts to distinguish social phenomena from other phenomena before socialization starts. Therefore, these authors argue, distinctions between toys that predate socialization are unrelated to interests later in life.&lt;ref&gt;The unpredictable species, Philip Lieberman, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthropology: The Human Challenge, William A. Haviland, Harald E. L. Prins, Dana Walrath, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primatologists who argue that since female [[chimpanzee]]s in some groups hunt and use tools at least as much as the males, there is no innate universal primate bias towards technology being male.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Learning Reader: Biological Anthropology, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the [[cultural determinism|cultural deterministic]] approach, the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[documentary]] [[Hjernevask]] presented a few arguments that cause a widespread debate, particularly with the first episode, [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xp0tg8_hjernevask-brainwashing-in-norway-english-part-1-the-gender-equality-paradox_news The Gender Equality Paradox], which also might have contributed to the Scandinavian government's decision to stop funding the regional [[Nordic_Gender_Institute|gender studies institute]].

=== Science, engineering and technology (SET) culture ===
A 2006 project run and sponsored by private sector (and thus not peer-reviewed by academia), the "Hidden Brain Drain", analyzed the careers of women in SET industries. According to the authors of the post-project review,{{refn|group=note|The authors of this report were six women and one man: Ann Hewlett, Carolyn Buck Luce, Lisa J. Servon, Laura Sherbin, Peggy Shiller, Eytan Sosnovich and Karen Sumberg&lt;ref name="athena" /&gt;{{rp|4}}}} the following characteristic of the SET culture, sometimes called the "Athena Effect" may exclude women workers:
* Masculine communication style and masculine group activities
* Unsustainable working hours
* Pressure to have or care for children
* Lack of organizational support when taking risks

Despite the satisfaction that many women find in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}, studies show that a main reason young women do not engage in STEM from an early age may be cultural messages inclining them to other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=Ray|title=Beyond Smash and Crash: Gender-Friendly Tech Ed|journal=The Technology Teacher|date=October 2009|pages=16–21}} See p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Women be uncomfortable engaging in STEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Christina Spears|last2=Leaper|first2=Campbell|title=Perceived Experiences With Sexism Among Adolescent Girls|journal=Child Development|date=2008|volume=79|issue=3|pages=685–704|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01151.x|pmid=18489421|citeseerx=10.1.1.598.1995}} See p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the technology industry itself is not solely responsible for the lack of women in STEM careers. According to Brown and Leaper, "Many parents tend to have higher expectations of sons over daughters in math, science, computers, and sports".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Christina Spears|last2=Leaper|first2=Campbell|title=Perceived Experiences With Sexism Among Adolescent Girls|journal=Child Development|date=2008|volume=79|issue=3|pages=685–704|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01151.x|pmid=18489421|citeseerx=10.1.1.598.1995}} See p. 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, childhood upbringing may also contribute to the alleged gender bias in the technology industry.

=== Male dominated environment ===
According to an essay in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', women leave the tech industry at twice the rate men do. In addition to this, according to different studies, there is an imbalanced gender ratio in the technology industry to begin with. Women are estimated to only make up 25% of employees in the industry. Furthermore,  11% of executives in the technology industry are women. Google has released the gender breakdown for just their company: 17% of the company's employee's are women. Since men are a majority in the industry, corporate events and industry conferences tend to cater to their taste, occasionally in ways which some women perceive as hostile, such as by hiring sexually provocative female performers and product promoters. Instances of sexual harassment at such events are also widely reported. This along with more subtle hostility such as offensive male humor can turn women away from the industry, further exacerbating the demographic imbalance already present.&lt;ref name="Atlantic Silicon Valley"&gt;{{cite news|author=Liza Mundy|title=Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/ |work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-03-14|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of awareness about sexual harassment ===
The principle of sexual harassment has only recently been recognized by the federal government as a legal issue. The first reported case that led to the recognition of sexual harassment as a legal concept was in 1977, in which a woman was fired from her job for refusing her boss' sexual advances. Nine years later, in 1986, the Supreme Court recognized cases like these as sexual harassment and as a violation of the Civil Rights Act. Still, the idea of sexual harassment was not truly recognized by the public until a 1991 case against a Supreme Court nominee was brought forward to Congress. Overall, sexual harassment was not fully recognized by the United States until the late 1900s, yielding a lack of reported incidents up until that point, as well as an increasing, but not yet fully developed, public awareness of the issue.&lt;ref name="Atlantic Silicon Valley"/&gt;

==Effects==
As of 2004, only 4% of the engineering workforce in the UK were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sappleton|first1=Natalie|last2=Takruri-Rizk|first2=Haifa|title=The Gender Subtext of Science, Engineering, and Technology (SET) Organization: A Review and Critique|journal=Women's Studies|date=2008|pages=284–316|doi=10.1080/00497870801917242|volume=37|issue=3}} See p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[information technology]] (IT), the Dice Salary Survey estimated that between 2008 and 2009, women earned an average of 12.43% less in salary than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quesenberry|first1=Jeria L.|last2=Trauth|first2=Elleen M.|title=The (dis)placement of women in the IT workforce: an investigation of individual career values and organisational interventions|journal=Information Systems Journal|date=2012|volume=22|issue=6|pages=457–473|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2575.2012.00416.x}} See pp. 458-459.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear if the Dice survey specifically addresses sexist discrimination as a possible cause for women to earn lower average salaries in technology, or if the [[gender pay gap|pay gap between men and women]] can be accounted for by differences in training, seniority, competence, overtime, or other variables that can effect salary. In addition to unequal pay, one study suggests that women are often excluded from informal work networks and become targets of bullying such as [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sappleton|first1=Natalie|last2=Takruri-Rizk|first2=Haifa|title=The Gender Subtext of Science, Engineering, and Technology (SET) Organization: A Review and Critique|journal=Womens Studies|date=2008|pages=284–316|doi=10.1080/00497870801917242|volume=37|issue=3}} See p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed solutions==
Current [[gender role]]s and expectations may hold back women from entering, sustaining, and advancing in the technology field.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Leaper 686&lt;/ref&gt; To combat sexism in technology, researchers have suggested that companies take responsibility and change their organizational structure issues instead of expecting women to adapt to the current state of the work environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quesenberry|first1=Jeria L.|last2=Trauth|first2=Elleen M.|title=The (dis)placement of women in the IT workforce: an investigation of individual career values and organisational interventions|journal=Information Systems Journal|date=2012|volume=22|issue=6|pages=457–473|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2575.2012.00416.x}} See p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed change would be to have more than simple diversity programs; companies need to ensure that their work environments allow people with various backgrounds and thought processes to work collaboratively to achieve organizational objectives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to Schiebinger, women should not assimilate to the profession, they should modify it; increased minorities in IT means nothing if there is an unaccommodating industry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ray McCarthy, a Middle School technology education teacher, believes that schools have a role to play in the solution to sexism in technology industry. He suggests classrooms have a welcoming feel that engages all students, validate their interests, and support positive inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=Ray|title=Beyond Smash and Crash: Gender-Friendly Tech Ed|journal=The Technology Teacher|date=October 2009|pages=16–21}} See p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed solution is presented by Project include, a nonprofit organization that was established with the purpose of giving everyone a fair chance to succeed in the technology industry. Using the three key values of inclusion, comprehensiveness, and accountability, the organization works to find solution to diversity and inclusion issues that are present in the technology industry. 

* inclusion: companies should improve opportunities for underrepresented groups 
* comprehensiveness: seeking solutions covering all aspects of the company, including culture, operations and team
* accountability: companies should track the results of their efforts in order to hold themselves accountable for their success

==Criticism==
In July 2014, a young, male computer science major at [[Yale College]] wrote in ''[[Forbes]]'' that although women only constitute 16% of the tech workforce, they also only account for 18% of computer science undergraduate degrees awarded to U.S. residents. He opined that the low numbers boiled down to "ultra-capable, math-savvy women" having "a different profile of interests, on average, than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name=Cohen140730&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Isaac |date=July 30, 2014 |title=An 'Ether Of Sexism' Doesn't Explain Gender Disparities In Science And Tech |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/isaaccohen/2014/07/30/an-ether-of-sexism-doesnt-explain-gender-disparities-in-science-and-tech/ |type=Opinion |journal=Forbes |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forbes columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote of witnessing multiple sexist situations, including a technology company founder referred to as a "[[Promotional model|Booth Babe]]" at a trade show. He blamed disproportionate technology-industry sexism, and a low number of females in the field, on a large number of computing-related startup companies hiring primarily young workers, thereby creating "an environment in which many firms' technical teams consist largely of workers who are just out of college, sometimes giving the businesses fraternity-like cultures, leading to sexism that discourages female participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/09/18/heres-the-conversation-men-need-to-have-about-sexism-as-told-by-a-man/ |title= Sexism In Startups: The Frank Conversation We Need To Be Having |website=[[Forbes]] |date=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Macmillan of ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' has referred to this phenomenon as "[[brogrammer]] culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Macmillan |first=Doug |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-01/the-rise-of-the-brogrammer |title= The Rise of the 'Brogrammer' |website=Businessweek |date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cover story appearing on the January 15, 2015 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, titled ''What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women'' proved controversial, both due to its illustration, described as "the cartoon of a faceless female in spiky red heels, having her dress lifted up by a [[Cursor (computing)|cursor]] arrow", and its content, described as "a 5,000-word article on the creepy, sexist culture of the tech industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Burleigh| first = Nina| title = What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women| work = [[Newsweek]]| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2015-01-28| url = http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html?piano_d=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "grove201501"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Grove| first = Lloyd| title = Is Newsweek's 'Red Heels' Cover Image Sexist?| website = The Daily Beast| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2015-01-29| url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/29/is-newsweek-s-red-heels-cover-image-sexist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those offended by the cover were [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] co-host [[Tamron Hall]], who commented "I think it's obscene and just despicable, honestly."

== Incidents ==
In 2012, women created "creeper move" cards, in red, yellow, and green, to hand out at the [[DEF CON]] security conference as an indication of what they perceived to be inappropriate behavior from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sexism and the single hacker: Defcon's feminist moment| website = CNET| accessdate = 2015-03-26| date = 2012-08-17| url = http://www.cnet.com/news/sexism-and-the-single-hacker-defcons-feminist-moment/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference in 2013 featured a game show called "Hacker Jeopardy" (a spoof of [[Jeopardy!]]), in which hostess Vinyl Vanna presided by removing an article of clothing with each correct answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Mills| first = Elinor| title = Sexism and the single hacker: Where are the women at Def Con?| website = PandoDaily| accessdate = 2015-03-26| date = 2013-08-31| url = http://pando.com/2013/08/31/hackers-and-sexism-at-defcon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 at [[Python Conference|PyCon]], attendee Adria Richards overheard a conversation by two men where they joked about a "[[dongle]]" as well as saying they'd "like to fork his [the speaker's] repo" (a non-sexual phrase meaning they'd like to build on the speaker's code). She photographed the men and Tweeted their photo to complain to the Pycon staff. This led to a controversy that came to be known as [[Donglegate]], which included counterpoints that Richards herself had recently made jokes online about the penis size of a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Guardian|title=The Internet Shaming of Lindsey Stone|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/21/internet-shaming-lindsey-stone-jon-ronson}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, one of the men was fired along with Richards herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How "dongle" jokes got two people fired—and led to DDoS attacks|publisher=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, an application called [[Titstare]] made its debut at the [[TechCrunch]] Disrupt conference. Its subject, men staring at women's breasts, proved too much for several commentators. After he defended the app against allegations of misogyny on Twitter, ''[[Business Insider]]'' [[Chief technology officer]] Pax Dickinson was forced to resign. Dickinson later wrote an apology, which was published on [[VentureBeat]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0|title=Technology's Man Problem|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 5, 2014|accessdate=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cofounder and former business partner, [[Elissa Shevinsky]], wrote an article titled ''That's It — I'm Finished Defending Sexism In Tech'', and said "I had defended DefCon's right to do whatever they want.

At the 2015 [[South by Southwest|SXSW festival]], White House Chief Technology Officer [[Megan Smith]] was interrupted multiple times by [[Google]]'s Executive Chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] during a panel discussion on "Sexism in Technology". The head of Google's Unconscious Bias program pointed this out during the discussion and received applause from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Panels on sexism in tech get awkward at SXSW| website = Yahoo Finance| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2015-03-19| url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/panels-sexism-tech-awkward-sxsw-201341558.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2015, software developer [[Sarah Sharp]], known for contributing [[USB3]] support to [[Linux]] and coordinating [[Outreachy]], revealed that she had stopped writing kernel patches after feeling antagonized and seeing what she called "subtle sexist or homophobic jokes" on [[LKML|the mailing list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/06/linix_kernel_dev_who_asked_linus_torvalds_to_stop_swearing_quits_over_swearing/|title=Linux kernel dev who asked Linus Torvalds to stop verbal abuse, quits over verbal abuse|first=Simon|last=Sharwood|publisher=The Register|date=2015-10-06|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although noting that the community's lack of resources was partially to blame, she referred to past discussions in which she sharply criticized the attitudes of [[Linus Torvalds]] and [[Ingo Molnár]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/linus-torvalds-defends-his-right-to-shame-linux-kernel-developers/|title=Linus Torvalds defends his right to shame Linux kernel developers|first=Jon|last=Brodkin|publisher=Ars Technica|date=2013-07-16|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Matthew Garrett]] stated that he would also leave kernel development and agreed with Sharp's assessment of Torvalds' communication style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/matthew-garrett-is-not-forking-linux/|title=Matthew Garret is not forking Linux|first=Steven J|last=Vaughan-Nichols|publisher=ZDNet|date=2015-10-09|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One kernel developer, James Bottomley, urged them to reconsider and stated that the mailing list had made efforts to increase civility in the two years since the most vocal clashes involving Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ostatic.com/blog/linux-discussion-continues-fedora-welcomes-chromium|title=Linux Discussion Continues, Fedora Welcomes Chromium|first=Susan|last=Linton|publisher=Ostatic|date=2015-10-09|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month after the posts by Sarah Sharp, [[Eric S. Raymond]] addressed readers to claim that women's advocacy groups were looking for opportunities to accuse Linus Torvalds and other open source figures of sexual assault at technical conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/06/linus_torvalds_targeted_by_honeytraps_says_eric_raymond/|title=Linus Torvalds targeted by honeytraps claims Eric S. Raymond|first=Simon|last=Sharwood|publisher=The Register|date=2015-11-06|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post contained logs of an [[Internet relay chat|IRC]] chat with an anonymized contact who claimed that the [[Ada Initiative]] had such goals. The source claimed that "They have made multiple runs at him.", and as a result he was no longer willing to risk mentoring women who are already in the technology industry. He then elaborated that [[Linus Torvalds]] no longer spends any time alone at conferences, to which [[Eric S. Raymond]] responded by stating that he would take his source's implied advice.

In 2015, Ellen Pao, an employee at Caufield &amp; Byers, accused the firms of creating an environment riddled with sexism that greatly impacted her career. On a business trip for the firm, an incident occurred in which a male employee came to her hotel room and propositioned her. The firm neglected to recognize the behavior of this man as sexual harassment, even though other similar incidents about this individual had been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/ |title=Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women? |website=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-03-14|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality ===
Gender-discrimination cases in the technology industry often concern not only gender, but race as well. Women of color are affected especially by gender-discrimination as they face two vectors of oppression: sexism and racism. It has been reported in a 2014 diversity report that women make up 17% of Google's employees. In that same report, it was found that Hispanics make up 2% of Google's workers and African-Americans make up only 1%. Because it is a field that is viewed as a meritocracy, tech companies are often hesitant to change the demographic of their employees.&lt;ref name="Atlantic Silicon Valley"/&gt;

=== Nadella controversy ===

While speaking at the [[Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing]] on 9 October 2014, Microsoft CEO [[Satya Nadella]] responded to a request for what his advice would be for women who are uncomfortable asking for a raise. Nadella stated: "It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along," Nadella said,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrgrapevine.com/markets/hr/article/2014-10-10-microsoft-ceo-says-women-asking-for-higher-pay-is-bad-karma|title=Microsoft CEO says women asking for higher pay is 'bad karma'|publisher=HR Grapevine|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to a recording on the website of the event.

"Because that's good karma," Nadella continued. "It'll come back because somebody's going to know that's the kind of person that I want to trust."&lt;ref name="Reuters via Yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-criticized-suggesting-women-011042160.html|title=Microsoft CEO criticized for suggesting women not ask for raises|date=9 October 2014|publisher=Reuters via Yahoo.com|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the comments produced a strong backlash in the media and in social media,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Raphaelson| first = Samantha| title = Microsoft CEO Nadella's Remarks Add To Tech's Sexism Problem| website = All Tech Considered - NPR| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2014-10-10| url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/10/10/355100973/microsoft-ceo-nadellas-remarks-add-to-techs-sexism-problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nadella issued an apology, "Was inarticulate re how women should ask for raise. Our industry must close gender pay gap so a raise is not needed because of a bias" he tweeted several hours after his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musil|first1=Steven|title=Microsoft CEO says he was 'inarticulate' on pay for women in tech|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-ceo-says-he-was-inarticulate-on-pay-for-women-in-tech/|website=[[CNET]]|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Peralta| first = Eyder| title = Microsoft CEO Backtracks On Suggestion That Women Shouldn't Ask For Raises| website = The Two-Way : NPR| accessdate = 2015-03-21| date = 2014-10-09| url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/10/09/354964666/microsoft-ceo-backtracks-on-suggestion-that-women-shouldnt-ask-for-raises}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft also issued a memo on its website in which Nadella wrote: "I answered that question completely wrong," said the memo. "I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work. And when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it's deserved, Maria's advice was the right advice. If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/microsoft-ceo-women-raise-26087689/|title=Microsoft CEO Apologizes for Comments on Women|publisher=ABC News|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;nowiki&gt;C+=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ===
In November 2013, a [[HASTAC]] user named Arielle Schlesinger, studying the relation between [[feminist theory]] and [[programming paradigms]], made a post soliciting feedback on the creation of a feminist programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hastac.org/blogs/ari-schlesinger/2013/11/26/feminism-and-programming-languages|title=Feminism and Programming Languages|first=Arielle|last=Schlesinger|publisher=Hastac|date=2013-11-26|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later that year, a group calling itself the Feminist Software Foundation released a language called ''C Plus Equality'' with syntax similar to C++. Although announced as the type of feminist programming language that Schlesinger had in mind, the alleged purpose of the code was satirizing the [[social justice]]–oriented part of [[Internet culture]] and included numerous references to [[rape]], [[boogeyman]] and [[trigger warnings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/19/feminist_software_foundation_c_plus_equality/|title=Feminist Software Foundation gets grumpy with GitHub... or does it?|first=Simon|last=Sharwood|publisher=The Register|date=2013-12-19|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C+= was originally posted to [[GitHub]] but was removed on December 14 after numerous complaints of sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/12/14/1618239/github-takes-down-satirical-c-plus-equality-language|title=GitHub Takes Down Satirical 'C Plus Equality' Language|publisher=Slashdot|date=2013-12-14|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.mollywhite.net/why-im-not-laughing-at-c-plus-equality/|title=Why I'm not laughing at C Plus Equality|first=Molly|last=White|date=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repository was moved to [[Bitbucket]] but after a debate with the legal team, it was removed on December 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/8629/harassing-repository|title=Harassing Repository|publisher=Atlassian|date=2013-12-19|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code is [https://web.archive.org/web/20150704013753/https://gitorious.org/c-plus-equality currently hosted] on [[Gitorious]] and has since [https://github.com/ErisBlastar/cplusequality reappeared] on GitHub.

=== "Google's Ideological Echo Chamber" memo ===
{{main article|Google's Ideological Echo Chamber}}
An internal memo on Google's ideological [[Workplace diversity|stance toward diversity]], where it is argued that Google had shut down the conversation about diversity, and suggested that [[gender inequality]] in the [[technology industry]] was, in part, due to biological [[differences between men and women]].

The Sherpao family has played a very prominent role in Pakistani politics. [[Khan Bahadur Ghulam Haider Khan Sherpao]] was a prominent leader in the Pakistan movement. His son [[Hayat Sherpao]] was a founder of the [[Pakistan People's Party]] (PPP) and the youngest governor of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] (current [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) before his life was cut short by a tragic assassination at [[Peshawar University]] on February 8, 1975. His assassination has had a profound effect on the political landscape of Pakistan and still continues to be relevant in the politics of the country. His younger brother, [[Aftab Ahmad Sherpao]], is one of the most senior and recognized political leaders of the country and continues to play an active role in politics in his neo-nationalist party [[Qaumi Watan Party]], and in the past served as Pakistan's [[Interior minister,]] Pakistan's [[Minister for Water &amp; Power]], besides being Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas and States and Frontier Regions, before having twice served as the [[Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/musharraf-primarily-wanted-to-secure-his-office-sherpao/691871/ Musharraf primarily wanted to 'secure his office': Sherpao]."

The '''Joan Ganz Cooney Center''' (informally, the Cooney Center) is an independent, [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-partisan research and innovation group founded by [[Sesame Workshop]] in order to advance children's [[literacy]] skills and foster innovation in children's learning through [[digital media]].&lt;ref name="2007 Times Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Elizabeth|title=Institute Named for 'Sesame' Creator|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/television/06sesa.html?fta=y&amp;_r=0|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Joan Ganz Cooney Center was founded in 2007&lt;ref name = corp&gt;"[https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx The Joan Ganz Cooney Center for Educational Media and Research Inc.]" ''Division of Corporations''. Delaware Department of State. Accessed on May 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; to study the role of digital technologies in promoting childhood literacy particularly among elementary school age children. According to the organization's mission statement, the Cooney Center exists "to advance children’s literacy skills and foster innovation in children’s learning through digital media."&lt;ref name="2007 Times Article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cooney Center: Our Mission|url=http://joanganzcooneycenter.org/Our-Mission.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The Cooney Center focuses on research, new technologies, and catalyzing policy change. Its activities comprise three primary themes:

* '''Literacy by Ten''': The Cooney Center co-authored ''Pioneering Literacy in the Digital Wild West: Empowering Parents and Educators'', a 2012 report that has been used by literacy researchers from Stanford University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.com/publications/pioneering-literacy/|title=Pioneering Literacy in the Digital Wild West: Empowering Parents and Educators}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others around the globe.&lt;ref name="Taiwan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Lai-Chung|date=March 2013|title=Child-Computer Interaction Design and Its Effectiveness|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=17932068&amp;AN=90546531&amp;h=cfxqECOwsp0xFDguF%2fmz%2b14b1Q0zk16j4v6itvMMQ3NQBzmyxTF5Lf2Tx89RMETvw6vI4QB8%2bvi%2bWuyOh%2bb3LQ%3d%3d&amp;crl=c|journal=Research &amp; Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning|volume=8|issue=1|page=15|author2=Whei-Jane Wei|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the result of a partnership with the Campaign for Grade Level Reading, led by the [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]], to develop analyses and an action plan to raise literacy rates in America. In 2013, the Cooney Center partnered with the [[National Center for Family Literacy|National Center for Families Learning]] (formerly the National Center for Family Literacy) to form the Aprendiendo Juntos Council, which focuses on improving literacy rates among Spanish-speaking American children.&lt;ref name="AJC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2013/07/k-12/learning-together-new-council-to-study-latino-families-digital-media-use/|title=Learning Together: New Council to Study Latino Families’ Digital Media Use|last=Diaz|first=Shelley|date=11 July 2013|newspaper=The School Library Journal|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Digital Play''': The Cooney Center has released and contributed to a number of reports and surveys on the connection between games and learning. In 2009, with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Cooney Center published ''Game Changer: Investing in Digital Play to Advance Learning and Health'',&lt;ref name="Game Changer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thai|first=Ann My|title=Game Changer: Investing in Digital Play to Advance Learning and Health|year=2009|publisher=The Joan Ganz Cooney Center|location=New York|url=http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/publication/policy-brief-game-changer-investing-in-digital-play-to-advance-childrens-learning-and-health/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used in a 2011 testimony to the [[United States House of Representatives]] Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.&lt;ref name="ESA Testimony"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Michael|title=STEM in Action: Inspiring the Science and Engineering Workforce of Tomorrow|url=http://www.theesa.com/newsroom/Mike_Gallagher_STEM_House_Testimony.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the center offered a prize to top innovators in the field of children's digital learning and in 2011, the Cooney Center organized the first annual [http://www.stemchallenge.org/ National STEM Video Game Competition]. More recently, in February 2014, the Cooney Center launched [http://www.gamesandlearning.org/ GamesandLearning.org], a news site reporting on the latest in the field of educational gaming.&lt;ref name="EdSurge GamesandLearning"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wan|first=Tony|title=Helping Game Developers Tackle the Toughest Game|url=https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-02-11-helping-game-developers-tackle-the-toughest-game|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=EdSurge|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Learning Together''': The Cooney Center is the convener of the Families and Media Research Consortium, which also includes as members [[AARP]], [[Sesame Workshop]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Stanford University]]. As part of the Families and Media Project, the consortium released a series of reports, the first of which was released on January 24, 2014 by the Cooney Center. For [http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/jgcc_learningathome.pdf ''Learning at Home: Families' Educational Media Use in America''], the Cooney Center collected data from parents of young children encompassing a variety of ethnicities and backgrounds in order to assess "the new family media ecology that is shaping interactions in every community in the U.S. and around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Learning at Home: Families' Educational Media Use in America|url= http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/jgcc_learningathome.pdf|date=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report garnered major media attention.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Screen Time Study Finds Education Dropoff|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/screen-time-study-finds-education-drop-off.html?ref=us&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toppo|first=Greg|title=First-of-its-kind survey finds kids spend 8x as much time with educational TV as computers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/01/24/educational-media-survey/4803699/|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post FAM"&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Ceco;oa|title=2- to 4-year-olds are most frequent users of educational media, study finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2-to-4-year-olds-are-most-frequent-users-of-educational-media-study-finds/2014/01/23/9eca108c-8481-11e3-9dd4-e7278db80d86_story.html|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Cooney Center also hosts periodic events aimed at catalyzing policy and industry change. The 2009 Leadership Forum: Breakthrough Learning in a Digital Age,&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakthrough Learning in the Digital Age|url=https://www.google.com/events/digitalage}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted at the Googleplex, attracted more than 200 thought leaders from the research, policy, education, and industries. In 2011, the Cooney Center hosted its annual leadership forum focusing on scaling up effective models that support children's learning with an emphasis on harnessing the largely untapped potential of digital media, especially for struggling learners. [http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/2011/05/20/learning-from-learning-from-hollywood/ ''Learning From Hollywood: Can Entertainment Media Ignite a Digital Revolution?''] brought together leaders from the creative media industries, education, research, policy, and philanthropy. Recent research publications on the potential of video games and mobile platforms for children's learning have received wide attention in the media and among national and state policymakers.&lt;ref name="Rosenworcel Speech"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenworcel|first=Jessica|title=Remarks of Jessica Rosenworcel to the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop|url=http://www.fcc.gov/document/rosenworcel-remarks-joan-ganz-cooney-center-sesame-workshop|work=FCC Website|publisher=FCC|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reports ==
The Cooney Center disseminates research that informs national debates, with the intention of "stimulating investment in effective reforms."&lt;ref name="Cooney Center Reports"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cooney Center Reports|url=http://joanganzcooneycenter.org/Reports.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does so through its publications on timely topics, including the children's fast evolving, interactive media landscape, mobile learning, and the debates over media multitasking. The Cooney Center's inaugural report was ''The Power of Pow! Wham!: Children, Digital Media and Our Nation's Future'' by Rima Shore, Ph.D.

In 2014, the Cooney Center published ''Learning at Home: Families' Educational Media Use in America''. For this national survey, data was collected from 1,577 parents on the amount of media used in their home and its educational value.&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt; "What is more, the study, by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center," reported the ''New York Times'', "shows that as children spend more time with screens as they get older, they spend less time doing educational activities, with 8- to 10-year-olds spending about half the time with educational content that 2- to 4-year-olds do."

== Initiatives ==
The Cooney Center focuses on four key strategies: action research, innovation and model development, partnership building and dissemination. These strategies reflect the Center's field-building mission, which calls for the creation of new knowledge, the creative application of that knowledge in practice, and the engagement of key decision-makers in making investments to drive innovation and scale up what works.

=== National STEM Video Game Competition ===
The Cooney Center, in collaboration with E-Line Media, hosts the National STEM Video Game Challenge as part of the "Educate to Innovate" campaign, which President [[Barack Obama]] launched in November 2009 to “harness the excitement and educational potential of video games to advance STEM learning (science, technology, engineering, and math)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educate to Innovate|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504162519/https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate|archivedate=2010-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cooney Center Fellows Program ===
Cooney Center Fellows assist with high priority research, program development and dissemination activities that examine the potential and challenges associated with digital media applications in promoting children's learning and healthy development. In addition, the Center has established a research fund to help support priority areas.

=== Digital Age Teacher Preparation Council ===
The Cooney Center, in collaboration with the Stanford Educational Leadership Institute, convened a Digital Age Teacher Preparation Council, co-chaired by Linda Darling-Hammond of [[Stanford University]] and Michael Levine. The council's sixteen members from academia, industry, and policy assessed current practices in early education and elementary school teaching and designed a professional development "blueprint" to advance the use of effective digital media in teaching and learning, with a special emphasis on instruction for underserved students. The final report was issued on November 1, 2011.&lt;ref name="Take a Giant Step"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barron|first=Brigid|title=Take a Giant Step: The Blueprint for Teaching Young Children in a Digital Age|date=1 November 2011|publisher=The Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop and Stanford University|location=New York, NY|url=https://edpolicy.stanford.edu/publications/pubs/523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavanaugh was arrested at a hotel in [[Commerce, California]], in December 1984, by [[FBI]] agents posing as Soviet spies. Cavanaugh, who worked at [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], was debt-ridden, undergoing a divorce, and was "willing to take $25,000 American dollars in cash for technology that cost the United States billions to develop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long|first=Tony|title=May 23, 1985: Selling Stealth Secrets to the Reds Comes at a High Price|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/05/may-23-1985-selling-stealth-secrets-to-the-reds-comes-at-a-high-price/|work=Wired|accessdate=2016-09-06|date=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; $25,000 in 1984 is {{inflation|USD|25000|1984|r=-3|fmt=eq}}.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in Tuvalu''' continue to maintain a traditional [[Polynesia#Cultures of Polynesia|Polynesian culture]] within a predominantly Christian society. Tuvaluan cultural identity is sustained through an individual’s connection to their home island.&lt;ref name="LC12"&gt;{{cite web| last =Corlew | first =Laura | work=Ph D dissertation, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa|title= The cultural impacts of climate change: sense of place and sense of community in Tuvalu, a country threatened by sea level rise|date =2012|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/101349/1/Corlew_Laura_r.pdf | accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the traditional community system in [[Tuvalu]], each family has its own task, or ''salanga'', to perform for the community. The skills of a family are passed on from parents to children. The women of Tuvalu participate in the traditional [[music of Tuvalu]] and in the creation of the [[art of Tuvalu]] including using [[cowrie]] and other shells in traditional handicrafts. There are opportunities of further education and paid employment with non-government organisations (NGOs) and government enterprises, education and health agencies being the primary opportunities for Tuvaluan women.

The number of women holding positions of Assistant Secretaries in government departments has increased from 20% in 2012 to nearly 50% in 2014. Also at the nine Island Kaupule (Local Councils) the representation of women has increased from 1 in 2012 to 3 in 2014.&lt;ref name="CEDAW"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |title= Tuvalu Statement 3rd &amp; 4th Periodic Review at the 60th Session of the UN CEDAW Expert Committee On the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Geneva | publisher= Government of Tuvalu|chapter=|date = 2015|url= http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/TUV/INT_CEDAW_STA_TUV_19642_E.pdf | accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
Women participate in the traditional [[music of Tuvalu]] which consists of a number of dances, including the ''[[fatele]]'', ''[[fakaseasea]]'' and the ''[[fakanau]]''.&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Linkels|first1=Ad|title=The Real Music of Paradise|publisher=Rough Guides, Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.)|isbn= 1-85828-636-0|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''fatele'', in its modern form, is performed at weddings, community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals.

== Education ==
Tuvaluan women have access to secondary education at [[Motufoua Secondary School]] on [[Vaitupu]]&lt;ref name="mapia"&gt;{{cite web| title= Motufoua Secondary School|url=http://wikimapia.org/4492759/Motufoua-Secondary-School |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fetuvalu Secondary School]], a day school operated by the [[Church of Tuvalu]], on [[Funafuti]].&lt;ref name="FHS"&gt;{{cite web| title= Fetuvalu High School (Funafuti)|url=http://wikimapia.org/10435819/Fetuvalu-High-School |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are opportunities of further education and paid employment with non-government organisations (NGOs) and government enterprises, education and health agencies being the primary opportunities for Tuvaluan women.

== Roles ==
Tuvaluan women are primarily involved in traditional agriculture and domestic and community activities. The women of Tuvalu participate in the creation of the [[art of Tuvalu]] including using [[cowrie]] and other shells in traditional handicrafts.&lt;ref name="ATP"&gt;{{cite web| last =Tiraa-Passfield | first = Anna |title= The uses of shells in traditional Tuvaluan handicrafts| publisher= SPC Traditional Marine Resource Management and Knowledge Information Bulletin #7|chapter=|date = September 1996|url= http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/InfoBull/TRAD/7/TRAD7_02_Tiraa.pdf| accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tuvaluan women participate in sport, such as in the [[women's association football|women's football]] league competition, the [[Tuvalu A-Division (women)|Tuvalu A-Division for women]], and at international competitions such as representing [[Tuvalu at the 2015 Pacific Games]].

Between 2004 and 2005 the number of women that obtained a credit from the Development Bank of Tuvalu increased from 16% to 30% compared to the number of men obtaining credit, which increased from 31% to 41%. However, the total loan approval rate is still lower for women at 37% compared to men at 63%, and the total loan value for men accounts for 74% of the total credit given.&lt;ref name="AIDS16"/&gt;

Remittances from Tuvaluan men employed abroad as sailors, primarily on cargo ships, is a major source of income for families in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name="ADB2011"&gt;{{cite web| title = Maritime Training Project: Program Completion Reports|chapter= |date = September 2011|publisher= Asian Development Bank | url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/projdocs/2011/32407-013-tuv-pcr.pdf| accessdate=28 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Economic Crisis (GEC) that began in 2007 has impacted on global export-import activities and the demand for shipping, which reduced the need for seafarers from Tuvalu.&lt;ref name="UNICEF_TV"&gt;{{cite web| work= UNICEF|title= Voices of the Vulnerable in the Pacific: Summary Note (‘The Global Economic Crisis impact on Tuvalu Seafarers Remittance: the story of Tangata's Family’)|date =|url= http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Voices_of_the_Vulnerable_in_the_Pacific_SG_report_FINAL_for_website.pdf| accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, do most of the talking and decision making at meetings of the community councils (''[[Falekaupule]]''), which are organised according to the law and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on  7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights.&lt;ref name="SPE1"&gt;{{cite web| title= Tuvalu: A Situational Analysis of Children, Women and Youth - Part 1: Background| publisher= UNICEF Pacific Office, Fiji |date= |url= https://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Tuvalu_Sitan_Part_1.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Milikini Failautusi]], a Tuvaluan activist, said that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an [[aliki]] (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying "[w]hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [get] to say anything at all. They don't have a say. They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families . . . All they have to do is just support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".&lt;ref name="MF"&gt;{{cite web|title= Young Tuvaluan leader challenges gender inequality| publisher= Radio Australia|chapter=|date =29 January 2014|url= http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacific/radio/onairhighlights/young-tuvaluan-leader-challenges-gender-inequality/1255790 | accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tuvaluan Woman (Imagicity 41).jpg|thumb|upright|300px|Tuvaluan woman (2008)]]
Life expectancy for Tuvaluan women is 68.41 years as compared to 64.01 years for males (2015 est.).&lt;ref name ="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tv.html|title=The World Factbook (CIA)|date=25 February 2016|accessdate= 20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
Tuvaluan women have access to health services provided by the Department of Health. There is one hospital, the [[Princess Margaret Hospital (Funafuti)|Princess Margaret Hospital]], in [[Funafuti]] that provides referral and general health services to support the health clinics on each of Tuvalu’s outer islands.&lt;ref name="ADB02"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bruce Knapman |author2=Malcolm Ponton |author3=Colin Hunt  |last-author-amp=yes |title= TUVALU 2002 Economic and Public Sector Review |publisher=Asian Development Bank|pages=134–136|year =2002|url= http://www.adb.org/publications/tuvalu-2002-economic-and-public-sector-review | accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Tuvalu is a group of 9 islands, problems in obtaining emergency services can arise for women on the outer islands if complications occur during birth. Infant mortality in Tuvalu was 25 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012, with an under-five mortality rate of 30 deaths per 1,000 live births. There has been a consistent decline in the under-five mortality rate since 1990.&lt;ref name="AIDS16"/&gt;

The Princess Margaret Hospital is run by 8 medical officers, 20 nurses, 10 paramedical staff and 10 support staff. The other islands have a medical centre manned by two nurses, a nurse assistant and two primary health care workers. &lt;ref name="AIDS16"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |title= Global AIDS Progress Report of Tuvalu| publisher= Ministry of Health Tuvalu|chapter=|date = 2016|url= http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/TUV_narrative_report_2016.pdf| accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no private formal medical services available in Tuvalu. Non-government organizations provide health services, such as: the Tuvalu Red Cross Society; Fusi Alofa (the care and rehabilitation of disabled children); the Tuvalu Family Health Association (training and support on sexual and reproductive health); and the Tuvalu Diabetics Association (training and support on diabetes).

== Politics ==
Throughout the history of the [[Parliament of Tuvalu]] following independence in 1978, three women have been elected: [[Naama Maheu Latasi]], from 1989 to 1997 and [[Pelenike Isaia]] from 2011 to 2015; and Dr [[Puakena Boreham]] who was elected to represent Nui in the 2015 general election.&lt;ref name="RNZ100415"&gt;{{cite web| work= Radio New Zealand |title= Cabinet position could await new Tuvalu MP|date =10 April 2015|url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/270875/cabinet-position-could-await-new-tuvalu-mp| accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The under-representation of women in the Tuvalu parliament was considered in a report commissioned by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in 2005,&lt;ref name="SSF"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Susie Saitala Kofe   |author2=Fakavae Taomia  |lastauthoramp=yes | work= A Research Project Commissioned by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) |title= Advancing Women’s Political Participation in Tuvalu |date = 2005|url= http://iknowpolitics.org/sites/default/files/report_5_-_advancing_women_s_representation_in_tuvalu_209_-_25520and20about20authors.pdf| accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was discussed during a consultation entitled “Promoting Women in Decision Making” was held in Funafuti in May 2010. The outcome was a recommendation for the introduction of two new seats, to be reserved for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=5173 "Women Need Support to Overcome Barriers Entering Parliament"], ''Solomon Times'', 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuvaluan Ministry for Home Affairs, which has responsibility for women’s affairs, stated that steps would be taken to consider the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/newsroom/press-statements/2010/support-for-introducing-reserved-seats-into-tuvalu-parliament.html "Support for introducing reserved seats into Tuvalu Parliament"], [[Pacific Islands Forum]] Secretariat, May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
The problem of violence against Tuvaluan women was highlighted during a week of events in recognition of International Women's Day in March 2013. The traditional cultural values prevent or discourage women from reporting assaults. Legislative changes are proposed to give the Tuvalu police increased powers and allowing the courts to pass tougher sentences for crimes of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="RA130313"&gt;{{cite web| last = Ewart | first = Richard | work= Radio Australia|title= Tuvalu considers tougher penalties for violence against women|date =13 March 2013|url= http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/tuvalu-considers-tougher-penalties-for-violence-against-women/1100742| accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women==

[[File:Tuvaluwoman1894.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of a woman on [[Funafuti]] in 1894 by Count Rudolf Festetics de Tolna]]
In July 2009 Tuvalu reported on compliance with the 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) to the UN CEDAW Committee. The report said that “Committee’s experts expressed concern over the sanctioning of local custom in the [Tuvalu] Constitution and legal system, noting, for example, that husbands were permitted to ‘discipline’ their wives [as well as children]”. As recent many Tuvaluan families have migrated to [[New Zealand]] these practices are in direct conflict with New Zealand’s laws and social environment.&lt;ref name="TFT"&gt;{{cite web|title= Toku fou tiale: A Tuvalu Conceptual Framework for addressing family violence|publisher= The Tuvalu Working Group (New Zealand)|chapter=|date =March 2012 |url= http://www.familyservices.govt.nz/documents/working-with-us/programmes-services/pacific-framework-tuvalu-fa-lr.pdf| accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community published drafting options for legislative reform to assist Tuvalu to make changes to the laws and policies relating to violence against women in order to ensure the full protection of women from all forms of violence.&lt;ref name="NBF"&gt;{{cite web|title= Tuvalu - Legal analysis on violence against women: drafting options for legislative reform | publisher= Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team |chapter=|date =July 2013|url= http://www.rrrt.org/| accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN CEDAW Committee observations on the 2015 review of Tuvalu notes the introduction of new domestic violence legislation, more participation by women in local council meetings and the end of some discriminatory education practices. However the Committee highlighted that women in Tuvalu continue to have low levels of political participation and economic participation. Violence against women is also described as a concern because of the "cultural and the silence and also impunity and this also really stops women to report the cases."&lt;ref name="RNZI0315"&gt;{{cite web| work= Radio New Zealand International|title= Long way to go for women in Tuvalu|date =10 March 2015|url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/programmes/datelinepacific/audio/20170210/long-way-to-go-for-women-in-tuvalu| accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Family Protection and Domestic Violence Act 2014 provides greater protection for women and girls from violence within domestic relationships and also provide for shelters of victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="CEDAW"/&gt;
