The '''Anthropological Index Online''' is an [[academic journal]] indexing service for [[anthropology]].

The service indexes the journals received by The Anthropology Library at [[The British Museum]] (formerly at the [[Ethnography at the British Museum#Museum of Mankind|Museum of Mankind]]), which receives periodicals in all branches of anthropology from academic institutions and publishers around the world. It is a collaboration between the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the Anthropology Department at the [[University of Kent]]. It is also available under licence from [[EBSCO Information Services]] as part of Anthropology Plus.

There are several hundred thousand records to date, the earliest from the late 1950s. Subject coverage is [[cultural anthropology]]/[[social anthropology]], [[physical anthropology]], [[archaeology]] and [[linguistics]]. The index is regularly updated.

'''''Britain Can Make It''''' was an exhibition of industrial and product design held at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="Evans, 1940s House" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Even before the end of [[World War II]], it was recognised that post-war reconstruction of manufacturing and international trade of exported goods would require the widespread acceptance of [[industrial design]] as part of future British manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Design Sourcebook, 1986" /&gt; Accordingly, the ''[[Council of Industrial Design]]'' was founded in 1944 by the [[Board of Trade]], as one of the first [[quango]]s.

==The exhibition==
In September 1945, only a month after the end of the war, the Council announced a national exhibition of design "in all the main range of consumer goods"&lt;ref name="VADS, BCMI" &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Designing Britain 1945 - 1975: Exhibiting Britain 
  |url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/esd.html
  |author=Dr Elizabeth Darling
  |publisher=[[University of Brighton Design Archives]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be held the following year. This was the 1946 ''Britain Can Make It'' exhibition, organized largely at the instigation of the Council's director, S.C. Leslie. The design of the exhibition itself was co-ordinated by Chief Display Designer, [[James Gardner (designer)|James Gardner]].&lt;ref name="Design Sourcebook, 1986" /&gt; The exhibition was held from September to November at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. Part of the reason for choosing this venue was that many of the museum's main exhibits were still in their wartime evacuation storage, outside London.&lt;ref name="VADS, BCMI" /&gt; The venue was undamaged by bombing, empty and available, and itself in need of an attraction to restore its pre-war visitors.

A major theme of the exhibition was [[didactic]], in particular the display "What Industrial Design Means"&lt;ref name="VADS, What Industrial Design Means" &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=What Industrial Design Means
  |url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/whatsinddes.html
  |author=Dr Elizabeth Darling
  |publisher=[[University of Brighton Design Archives]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been the first major commission for [[Misha Black]] and the [[Design Research Unit]]. Through Black's display, "The Birth of an Egg Cup"&lt;ref name="VADS, What Industrial Design Means" /&gt; the role of the designer was presented as the crucial interchange between all the various aspects of design and production. Rather than merely show-casing goods on offer, the exhibition, and this display in particular, were a propagandist attempt to highlight the need to update British approaches to product design if manufacturing was to be successful in post-war competition. The audience was two-fold: the general public who were as yet unused to the notion of design as a distinct process, and also the existing manufacturers who clung to pre-war, if not Victorian, notions of how to run manufacturing industry.

Black's design for the display was deliberately eye-catching, from a 13 feet high plaster egg at its entrance,&lt;ref name="VADS, What Industrial Design Means" /&gt; to the continually-operating plastics moulding press making three thousand egg cups per day during the exhibition.&lt;ref name="VADS, What Industrial Design Means" /&gt; This use of a working model in particular was commented on in surveys of exhibition visitors carried out by [[Mass Observation]].&lt;ref name="VADS, BCMI response" &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Design Research Unit exhibit was their design and scale model for a [[railway coach]], a [[Bilevel rail car#United Kingdom|double-decked]] third class sleeper. This represented two innovations for Britain, indicative of this egalitarian age: the first [[Sleeping car#United Kingdom|sleeper]] for [[economy class#Railways|third class]] rather than first, and also the technical development of fitting two levels into the restricted [[loading gauge#Great Britain|British loading gauge]] by the use of a [[well car]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions to the exhibition ==
A popular reaction in the press was to term it, "''Britain Can't Have It''" as the country was still in the grip of wartime [[Austerity]] measures and the goods on display were intended for export.&lt;ref name="Design Sourcebook, 1986" /&gt; Reactions of those attending the exhibition were varied between the general public, the design [[intelligentsia]] and the manufacturers.&lt;ref name="VADS, BCMI response" /&gt; Critics', such as [[John Gloag]]'s, reactions were highly positive, congratulating the exhibition organisers both on the intellectual quality of their exhibition and also for the achievement of producing it during such a time of austerity. The public's reaction was less sophisticated, but still positive. Their view was generally that of simply wanting products in the shops that they could actually buy. The only real criticisms came from established manufacturers who largely failed to appreciate the exhibition's attempt to emphasise design and who still judged it as a simple shop-window display, of their same pre-war products.

The '''Camden Society''' was a [[text publication society]] founded in [[London]] in 1838 to publish early historical and literary materials, both unpublished manuscripts and new editions of rare printed books. It was named after the 16th-century [[antiquarian|antiquary]] and historian [[William Camden]]. In 1897 it merged with the [[Royal Historical Society]], which continues to publish texts in what are now known as the '''Camden Series'''.

==History==
The formation of the Camden Society in 1838 was the initiative of [[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]], [[John Nichols (printer)#John Bowyer Nichols and John Gough Nichols|John Gough Nichols]], and [[John Bruce (antiquary)|John Bruce]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; It was modelled on the [[Surtees Society]] (founded in 1834 to publish materials relating to the history of [[northern England]]), of which Nichols had been the first treasurer. Other founder members included [[Thomas Amyot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Amyot, Thomas|author=Edward Smith|last= Smith|first=Edward|volume=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Crofton Croker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Croker, Thomas Crofton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Frederic Madden]], [[John Payne Collier]], and Rev. [[Joseph Hunter (antiquarian)|Joseph Hunter]]. [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Francis Egerton]] served as the first President.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 1964, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an annual subscription (originally £1 per year), members received the Society's publications, roughly two volumes per year. The original membership was 500. In 1838, 20% of members were clergymen, 9% held legal qualifications, and 36% were Fellows of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership reached a peak of 1250 in 1845, and began to decline thereafter. By the 1880s, the Camden Society was experiencing financial problems, brought about in part by a project to create a general index to its first 100 volumes. On 2 May 1897 it was amalgamated with (or effectively absorbed into) the [[Royal Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Milne 1968, p. 49n.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Society published some works jointly with the [[Early English Text Society]].

==Publications==
Between 1838 and 1872 the Society published 105 volumes in its first series (now sometimes known as the Old Series); followed by a further 56 volumes in its second series (known as the New Series), which appeared between 1871 and 1896. Following the merger with the Royal Historical Society, the joint society issued another 6 volumes in the New Series, of which the last, volume 62, appeared in 1901. A fresh series was then begun, published under the Royal Historical Society imprint, but named the '''Camden Third Series''', in which 94 volumes appeared between 1900 and 1963. A further 44 volumes were published between 1969 and 1993 in the '''Camden Fourth Series'''; and the '''Camden Fifth Series''', which began publication in 1993, had reached volume 53 by 2017, and remains in progress. The majority of volumes have contained book-length texts (occasionally running into multiple volumes), or thematic groups of shorter texts; but they have also from time to time – both in the two original Camden Society series and in the three RHS Camden Series – been made up of two or more disparate shorter texts, under the series title ''Camden Miscellany''. A total of 36 Miscellany volumes had appeared by 2015. 

Volumes are now published for the RHS by [[Cambridge University Press]].

{{Collecting Hobby}}

The [[hobby]] of '''collecting''' includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining items that are of interest to an individual ''collector''. Collections differ in a wide variety of respects, most obviously in the nature and scope of the objects contained, but also in purpose, presentation, and so forth. The range of possible subjects for a collection is practically unlimited, and collectors have realised a vast number of these possibilities in practice, although some are much more popular than others.

In collections of manufactured items, the objects may be [[antique]] or simply [[collectable]]. Antiques are collectable items at least 100 years old, while other collectables are arbitrarily recent. The word ''vintage'' describes relatively old collectables that are not yet antiques. Previously commonplace items that are now rare are called [[ephemera]].

Collecting is a childhood hobby for some people, but for others a lifelong pursuit or something started in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning how to build a collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.

==Types of collection==
[[File:Stamp album sleeve.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|Stamp album used for [[stamp collecting|collecting stamps]]]]
{{See also|list of collectables}}

The most obvious way to categorise collections is by the type of objects collected. Most collections are of manufactured commercial items, but natural objects such as birds' eggs, butterflies, rocks, and seashells can also be the subject of a collection. For some collectors, the criterion for inclusion might not be the type of object but some incidental property such as the identity of its original owner.

Some collectors are generalists with very broad criteria for inclusion, while others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest. Some collectors accumulate arbitrarily many objects that meet the thematic and quality requirements of their collection, others—called ''completists'' or ''completionists''—aim to acquire all items in a well-defined set that can in principle be completed, and others seek a limited number of items per category (e.g. one representative item per year of manufacture or place of purchase).&lt;ref&gt;For example, book collector [[Rush Hawkins]] (1831 – 1920) sought the first and second books from every European printer before 1501, while illuminated manuscript collector [[Henry Yates Thompson]] (1838 – 1928) maintained a collection of exactly 100 items, selling his least preferable items to make room for new ones.&lt;/ref&gt; The monetary value of objects is important to some collectors but irrelevant to others. Some collectors maintain objects in pristine condition, while others use the items they collect.

==&lt;span id="Price guide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Value of collected items==
[[File:Herbert Kullmann May 1914 sale catalogue.jpg|thumbnail|Herbert Kullmann, picture sale catalogue by [[Bernheim-Jeune]], Paris, May 1914.]]

After a [[collectable]] has been purchased, its retail price no longer applies and its value is linked to what is called the [[secondary market]]. There is no secondary market for an item unless someone is willing to buy it, and an object's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Depending on age, condition, supply, demand, and other factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a collectable for either more or less than what they originally paid for it. A ''price guide'' is a resource such as a book or website that lists typical selling prices.

Products often become more valuable with age. The term ''[[antique]]'' generally refers to manufactured items made over 100 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] requires that an antique "must be over 100 years of age at the time of importation". {{Cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/359/kw/duty%20on%20antiques/session/L3RpbWUvMTUwODM1NjAyMC9zaWQvY3U0S012dm4%3D|title=Duty on personal and commercial imports of antiques, artwork|last=U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Information Center|first=|date=October 18, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some fields, such as [[antique car]]s, the time frame is less stringent. For [[antique furniture]], the limit has traditionally been set in the 1830s. Collectors and dealers may use the word ''vintage'' to describe older collectables that are too young to be called antiques,&lt;ref&gt;For example, the arts and crafts sales website [[Etsy]] requires "vintage" items sold on their platform to be "at least 20 years old". {{Cite web|url=https://www.etsy.com/help/article/4946/ref]|title=Vintage Items on Etsy|last=|first=|date=October 18, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Art Deco]] and [[Art Nouveau]] items, [[carnival glass|Carnival]] and [[depression glass|Depression]] glass, etc. Items which were once everyday objects but may now be collectable, as almost all examples produced have been destroyed or discarded, are called ''[[ephemera]]''.

==Psychological aspects==

Psychological factors can play a role in both the motivation for keeping a collection and the impact it has on the collector's life. These factors can be positive or negative.

The hobby of collecting often goes hand-in-hand with an interest in the objects collected and what they represent, for example collecting [[deltiology|postcards]] may reflect an interest in different places and cultures. For this reason, collecting can have educational benefits, and some collectors even become experts in their field.

Maintaining a collection can be a relaxing activity that counteracts the stress of life, while providing a purposeful pursuit which prevents boredom. The hobby can lead to social connections between people with similar interests and the development of new friendships, it has also been shown to be particularly common among academics. 

Collecting for most people is a choice, but for some it can be a compulsion, sharing characteristics with [[Compulsive hoarding|obsessive hoarding]]. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

It has been speculated{{by who|date=August 2018}} that the widespread appeal of collecting is connected to the hunting and gathering that was once necessary for human survival. Collecting is also associated with memory by association and the need for the human brain to catalogue and organise information and give meaning to ones actions.

==History==
[[Image:Musei Wormiani Historia.jpg|thumb|350px|right|"Musei Wormiani Historia", the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] from the ''Museum Wormianum'' depicting [[Ole Worm]]'s cabinet of curiosities]]

Collecting is a practice with a very old cultural history. In [[Mesopotamia]], collecting practices have been noted among royalty and elites as far back as the third millennium, B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomason |first1=Alison Karmel Thomason |title=Luxury and Legitimation: Royal Collecting in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=2005 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |location=Hampshire, U.K. |isbn=0754602389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] collected books from all over the known world at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. The Medici family, in Renaissance Florence, made the first effort to collect art by private patronage, this way artists could be free for the first time from the money given by the Church and Kings; this citizenship tradition continues today with the work of private art collectors. Many of the world's popular [[museum]]s—from the [http://www.metmuseum.org/ Metropolitan] in New York City to the [http://www.museothyssen.org/ Thyssen] in Madrid or the [http://www.franzmayer.org.mx/ Franz Mayer] in Mexico City—have collections formed by the generous collectors that donated them to be seen by the general public.

The collecting hobby is a modern descendant of the "[[cabinet of curiosities]]" which was common among scholars with the means and opportunities to acquire unusual items from the 16th century onwards. Planned collecting of ephemeral publications goes back at least to [[George Thomason]] in the reign of Charles I and [[Samuel Pepys]] in that of Charles II. Collecting engravings and other prints by those whose means did not allow them to buy original works of art also goes back many centuries. The progress in 18th-century Paris of collecting both works of art and of ''curiosité'', dimly echoed in the English ''curios'', and the origins in Paris, Amsterdam and London of the modern [[art market]] have been increasingly well documented and studied since the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chronologically some essential works are C. Blanc, ''Le trésor de la curiosité'' (1857-58), E. Bonnaffé, ''Les collectionneurs de l'ancienne France'' (1873), l. Courajod, ''La livre-journal de Lazare Duvaux'' (1873), L. Clément de Ris, ''Les amateurs d'autrefois'' (1877), A. Maze-Sencier, ''Le livre des collectionneurs'' (1893), G. Reitlinger ''The Economics of Taste'' (1961), G. Glorieux's monograph, ''À [[l'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of larger numbers of people in collecting activities comes with the prosperity and increased leisure for some in the later 19th century in industrial countries. That is when collecting such items as antique china, furniture and decorative items from oriental countries becomes established. The first price guide was the [[Stanley Gibbons#Stamp catalogues|Stanley Gibbons catalogue]] issued in November 1865.

===On the Internet===

The Internet offers many resources to any collector: personal sites presenting one's collection, online collectable catalogs, dealer/shops websites displaying their merchandise, Internet trading platforms, collector clubs, [[autograph club]], collector forums and collector mailing lists.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Complete UK Hit Singles''''' is a book that lists every [[Single (music)|single]] to have made it into the [[UK Singles Chart]] since its inception in 1952. As well as providing chart data on each of the hits, the book also provides a brief biography on each hit maker, together with facts and trivia about each hit, such as whether it qualified for a BPI sales award, was featured in a film or contains a sample of another track. The book was written by Graham Betts and is the companion volume to '''''Complete UK Hit Albums'''''. &lt;!--"It will have the first number #1 single ever recorded to the latest single." Huh?--&gt;

'''Dar Al Quran''' ([[Arabic]]: دار القرآن) is one of the oldest and most famous houses of the [[medina of Sfax]]. It is the headquarters of the association of Quran and morals preservation.

== History ==
[[File:سقف بهو دار القرآن.jpg|left|thumb|Hall of the Dar]]
Initially, it belonged to one of Sfax's famous poets and scientists, Ibrahim Kharrat (1738-1836), who later donated it and turned it into a [[mausoleum]] to teach [[quran]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.histoiredesfax.com/201504-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%85/|title=دار القرآن الكريم|work=تاريخ صفاقس|access-date=2018-08-27|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the building was seriously damaged, which made Hadj Khalifa Ben Ahmed Tarari Ferjani donate money to restore it during the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]] period. Apart from repairing the structural damage, he introduced new teaching methods and modern courses into the program of the mausoleum.

In 1998, Dar Al Quran was restored for a second time by the Tunisian [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Tunisia)|Ministry of Religious Affairs]], and opened its doors to visitors in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ''Diccionario enciclopédico hispano-americano de literatura, ciencias y artes'' (1887-1899) was a [[Spanish language]] [[general encyclopedia]] produced by Montaner y Simón in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide to the Study and Use of Reference Books |author1= [[Alice B.

The collection currently contains more than 700 books, including spin-offs.

The A6 [[paper size]] (125 × 178&amp;nbsp;mm) is used for these mini books and printed on thick and glossy [[coated paper]], richly decorated with full colour illustrations, from which leap two or three images per page. In this picture-dense format, the authors must squeeze their words in edgewise. Each book of this encyclopaedic collection is composed of a [[monograph]] and focuses on a particular topic, the whole series covers all areas of human knowledge and experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thamesandhudson.com/catnh.html |title=New Horizons series |publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]] |accessdate=13 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606004639/http://www.thamesandhudson.com/catnh.html |archivedate=6 June 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as archaeology, art, culture, civilisation, history, music, religion, science, et cetera. There are 502 expert authors who have written for the collection.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt; They usually use timelines and historical perspective to describe a subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Decouvertes-Gallimard |title=''Collection'' Découvertes Gallimard |publisher=Éditions Gallimard |accessdate=14 April 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the 26{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Le ciel, ordre et désordre}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Sciences-et-techniques/Le-Ciel |title=''Le ciel, ordre et désordre'', collection Découvertes Gallimard (n° 26) |publisher=Éditions Gallimard |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (UK ed. ''The Sky: Order and Chaos''), which narrated in chronological order to present the varied subjects relating to the sky above and peoples' perception of it, through historical vision of cultural, social and religious aspects. Almost all the titles follow the same method, therefore, history is the essential element of perspective for this work.

The [[Photo caption|captions]] for illustrations must be informative, they should not duplicate information in the [[body text]], nor do they interrupt the [[narrative thread]]. Researchers and academics must adhere to the constraints of a mainstream collection. Apart from obvious analytical abilities, authors are asked to write quality text and a sensitivity to illustration. A ''Découvertes Gallimard'' is not a book of authorship, the author is only one of the many speakers.&lt;ref name=à-la-française&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ricochet-jeunes.org/articles/decouvertes-gallimard-ou-la-culture-encyclopedique-la-francaise |title=Découvertes Gallimard ou la culture encyclopédique à la française |last=Hache-Bissette |first=Françoise |date=2001 |website=ricochet-jeunes.org |accessdate=26 September 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Blasselle]], director of the [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]], author of two volumes of {{lang|fr|[[:commons:À pleines pages : Histoire du livre, Volume Ⅰ|Histoire du livre]]}} ("[[History of books|History of the Book]]", № 321 and № 363), and co-author of the 88{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|La Bibliothèque nationale de France : Mémoire de l'avenir}}, explains his experience of working for the collection: "For an author, to write a ''Découvertes'' title is to be trapped, to put oneself in a situation of being obliged to go beyond his/her own formulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Dixième anniversaire de la collection Découvertes |series=Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit, Zazie ? |network=[[France 3]] |date=15 May 1997 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover design is one of the specificities. The old covers are glossy with black background illustrated in colour, the newer covers are matt-laminated rather than glossy,&lt;ref name=Revelations /&gt; but more colourful, with different [[Color code|colour codes]] according to the areas.{{refn|group=note|Red for Arts, brown for Archéologie, blue for Histoire, white for Littératures, dark blue for Religions, yellow for Culture et société, green for Sciences et techniques.}} It differs from other documentary books by its visual: a full-size image, with its framing and the power of figurative elements, also an image that is well-matched to inside [[page layout]]. And there is always a tiny image that suits the theme to illustrate the [[Bookbinding|spine]]. The visual identity is strong, one can even easily recognise different language editions of ''Découvertes'' books. However, there are some exceptions, for instance, the Russian publisher [[AST (publisher)|AST]] adopted a completely different cover design for their {{lang|ru|«Открытие»}} ("Discovery") collection.

Each title in the collection has around 200 pages with approximately 120–200 illustrations printed in four, five, six, or seven colours, both matte and glitter, and sometimes even [[Gold (color)|gold]], as in the 39{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Richard Wagner : L'opéra de la fin du monde}},&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; the metallic gold heightens [[Carl Otto Czeschka]]'s illustrations from {{lang|de|[[Nibelung|Die Nibelungen]]}}. Each book opens with 8–10 full-page illustrations or photographs, prefaced by a pull-quote on the inside front cove, which [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] director Jamie Camplin calls it a "cinema-influenced trailer"&lt;ref name=In /&gt; (called {{lang|fr|[[Pre-credit|pré-générique]]}} in French). For the 96{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Champollion : Un scribe pour l'Égypte}}, this book opens with a succession of reproductions of [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]]'s manuscript {{lang|fr|[[Grammaire égyptienne]]}}; in {{lang|fr|[[L'Europe des Celtes]]}}{{refn|group=note|American edition – ''The Celts: Conquerors of Ancient Europe''; British edition – ''The Celts: First Masters of Europe''.}} (№ 158), the reader is greeted by a series of bronze masks and hoary faces carved in stone;&lt;ref name=In /&gt; the "trailer" for {{lang|fr|La Saga de l'espace}} (№ 3) evokes the tragic launch of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] in 1986; while that of {{lang|fr|La Tour de Monsieur Eiffel}} (№ 62) presents the [[Eiffel Tower]] at every stage of its construction.

[[File:Inside page view of “New York – Chronique d’une ville sauvage”.jpg|thumb|280px|Inside page view of [[Jerome Charyn]]'s {{lang|fr|New York : Chronique d'une ville sauvage}} ("New York: Chronicle of a Wild City"), the 204{{sup|th}} title of "Découvertes" collection. As an example of [[Page layout|layout]].]]
The novelty lies in the subtle orchestration of the text and the illustration, where successive sequences, inserts and foldouts overlapping in double pages.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt; According to the subjects, the [[Body text|body]] (mentioned as {{lang|fr|corpus}} in French) is structured into three to eight chapters. Each chapter is built using journalistic methods, with a [[lead paragraph]] and intertitle. The {{lang|fr|corpus}} is punctuated by double-page spreads of images, known as inserts, sort of a halt for pictures. For the 124{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|La peur du loup}} ("Fear of Wolves"), 2 double-page spreads of reproductions of [[Gustave Doré]]'s engravings to illustrate ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''. These books benefit a lot from journalistic and cinematographic techniques, some titles include [[Panorama|panoramic]] foldouts, kind of projection on big screen. Two foldouts in the 16{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Pompéi : La cité ensevelie}},{{refn|group=note|English edition title (both American and British) – ''Pompeii: The Day a City Died''.}} one showing [[Léon Jaussely]]'s reconstruction of the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of [[Pompeii]], the other representing the actual condition of the [[Theatre Area of Pompeii|theatre quarter]] in 1859 by using [[Paul-Émile Bonnet]]'s drawings, both in a panoramic view. In the 369{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Le papier : Une aventure au quotidien}} ("The Paper: A Daily Adventure"), through a partnership with paper companies, there are even three luxurious foldouts that all made on different papers from [[Arjo Wiggins]], presenting one of the 17{{sup|th}} century watercolours on the traditional manufacture of Chinese paper; the other of the engravings and drawings by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]; the third depicts today's paper [[production line]] with its different machines.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

At the back of each book is the "Documents" section ({{lang|fr|Témoignages et Documents}} in French), unlike the {{lang|fr|corpus}}, this part is always printed in black and white. It works as an anthology, provides more detailed documentary information and historical records. This includes [[wiktionary:dossier#English|dossiers]] made jointly by the author and the publisher, with lead paragraph to link texts and short captions for each dossier. According to the works, the annexes conclude "Documents" section with a chronology, an index, a filmography, a discography, or a bibliography. The sources of all images are always provided in the "List of Illustrations" ({{lang|fr|Table des illustrations}} in French) as well as photo credits, dedicated to those who want to do further research. ''Découvertes'' also stands out for its attention to detail. On the choice of [[typeface]], for example, [[Trump Mediaeval]] is used for common text, Barnattan for intertitles, [[Zapf Dingbats]] for [[guillemet]]s, [[Italic type|italic]] for captions with an [[initial]] and the last line is underlined, et cetera. The French editions are printed by Kapp Lahure Jombart in [[Évreux]], while the Italian printer Gianni Stavro, who has largely contributed to the elaboration of new techniques used in the collection, retains his position as collaborator for international reissues and coeditions. The bindings are solid, sewn and not glued.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; Gallimard promised readers "the most beautiful pocket collection in the world" ({{lang|fr|« la plus belle collection de poche du monde »|italic=no}}).&lt;ref name=Fête&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5r-Eic9mSI |title=Découvertes Gallimard fête son n° 200 (1994) |work=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=13 April 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection formerly consisted of 18 series—{{lang|fr|Archéologie}}, {{lang|fr|Architecture}}, {{lang|fr|Art de vivre}}, {{lang|fr|Cinéma}}, {{lang|fr|Histoire}}, {{lang|fr|Histoires naturelles}}, {{lang|fr|Invention du monde}}, {{lang|fr|Littérature}}, {{lang|fr|Mémoire des lieux}}, {{lang|fr|Musique et danse}}, {{lang|fr|Peinture}}, {{lang|fr|Philosophie}}, {{lang|fr|Religions}}, {{lang|fr|Sciences}}, {{lang|fr|Sculpture}}, {{lang|fr|Sports et jeux}}, {{lang|fr|Techniques}} and {{lang|fr|Traditions}}—which have been abandoned, it is now organised around 7 major areas: {{lang|fr|Arts}}, {{lang|fr|Archéologie}}, {{lang|fr|Histoire}}, {{lang|fr|Littératures}}, {{lang|fr|Religions}}, {{lang|fr|Culture et société}} and {{lang|fr|Sciences et techniques}}.

{{Quote|text=A world of stones. Stones of the pyramids, stones of the temples, stones of the statues. Drowned in the sand, bogged down, forgotten. A world of symbols. Engraved symbols, painted symbols. Mysterious, incomprehensible. A world that would come alive again under the gaze, the pencil, the trowel of travellers, adventurers, scientists, archaeologists. A world that would finally reveal its secrets, in 1822, thanks to [[Jean-François Champollion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vercoutter |first=Jean |date=1986 |title=À la recherche de l'Égypte oubliée |series=Collection "Découvertes Gallimard" |volume=1 |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Gallimard |page=text on the back cover |isbn=978-2-070-53028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 4{{sup|th}} century AD, the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed the closure of all the pagan temples in the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Unexpected consequence: the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]], still alive until then, abruptly stopped being understood. The Pharaonic Egypt fell into oblivion. The [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition of Bonaparte]] in 1798 and the magnificent {{lang|fr|[[Description de l'Égypte]]}} aroused in Europe a craze for the monuments and the art of this ancient civilisation. The deciphering of hieroglyphs by young Champollion in 1822 marks the birth of [[Egyptology]].

From the transport of the [[Luxor Obelisk]] on the [[Place de la Concorde]] to the fabulous discovery of [[Tutankhamun#Legacy|Tutankhamun's treasures]], [[Jean Vercoutter]] recounts the history of rediscovery of ancient Egypt in this small volume—{{lang|fr|À la recherche de l'Égypte oubliée}} (lit. "In Search of Forgotten Egypt"; English edition: ''The Search for Ancient Egypt'')—which inaugurated the collection "Découvertes Gallimard" in 1986. It is part of the {{lang|fr|Archéologie}} series; in other words, the book explaining the whole history of Egyptology—its birth and growth, with all the important figures in this history—&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evene.lefigaro.fr/livres/livre/jean-vercoutter-a-la-recherche-de-l-egypte-oubliee-27420.php |title=À LA RECHERCHE DE L'ÉGYPTE OUBLIÉE |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=23 January 1998 |website=evene.lefigaro.fr |language=fr |access-date=3 November 2018 |quote=Toute l'histoire de l'égyptologie, de sa naissance à son essor avec toutes les figures importantes de cette histoire mentionnées.}}&lt;/ref&gt;of the "search for forgotten Egypt", the study of archaeological sites, artefacts and documents discovered in Egypt in the 18{{sup|th}} and 19{{sup|th}} centuries. It's almost like a "[[graphic novel]]", replete with colour plates. There are seven chapters:
* Ⅰ, "The Disappearance of Pharaonic Egypt" ({{lang|fr|La disparition de l'Égypte des Pharaons}}) evoking the deplorable events that were the [[destruction of the Library of Alexandria]] (it is said that there were seven hundred thousand volumes) and the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|temple of Serapis]] in the same city, missing in any of the buildings those precious texts which could clarify the gaps that exist today about the history of Pharaonic Egypt. Fortunately other sources remained available, the Bible being one of them, as the author well mentioned.
* Ⅱ, "Travellers in Ancient Times" ({{lang|fr|Les voyageurs de l'Antiquité}}) recalls the journey and texts of [[Herodotus]], "the traveller par excellence", followed later by [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Strabo]] (who was very interested in the [[Animal worship|animal cults]]) and [[Plutarch]] (who bequeathed us his version of the [[Osiris myth|myth of Osiris and Isis]], inspired by [[Manetho]]'s text, then preserved in a [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] copy). The Roman emperors [[Hadrian]] and [[Septimius Severus]] are also included in the list of those illustrious travellers in the country of the Nile, preceded by the General [[Germanicus#Egypt|Germanicus]], member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|imperial family]] in the time of [[Tiberius]].

* Ⅲ, "Crusaders, Monks, and Sightseers on the Banks of the Nile" ({{lang|fr|Croisés, moines et curieux au fil du Nil}}) recalling a time when the doors of [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Muslim Egypt]] were virtually closed to the [[Christian West]]. It is true that in the time of the [[Crusades]] there were some texts emerged to lift the Islamic mantle that covered the historic region, but in any case travellers were scarce in south Cairo. Hence, "{{lang|fr|aucun des récits du Ⅰᵉʳ siècle ne sont comparables à ceux des Anciennes|italic=no}}"—at that time no one knew the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] texts anymore. Up to the beginning of the 19{{sup|th}} century, more or less illustrious visitors (the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Johann Michael Vansleb|Vansleb]], [[Jean de Thévenot]], [[Benoît de Maillet]], [[Claude Sicard]], [[Claude-Étienne Savary]], [[Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney|comte de Volney]]), with special emphasis on General [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] leading his army and his sages.
* Ⅳ, "Treasure Hunters and Thieves" ({{lang|fr|Aventuriers et voleurs}}) – Bonaparte's expedition resulted in the most fruitful publication of two notable works, which are [[Vivant Denon]]'s ''Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt'' ({{lang|fr|Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Égypte}}) and {{lang|fr|[[Description de l'Égypte]]}}: "{{lang|fr|De 1802 à 1830, une dizaine de voyageurs de grand valeur, français, allemands, anglais, suisses, viennent voir sur place les merveilles révélées par le|italic=no}} {{lang|fr|Voyage}} {{lang|fr|et la|italic=no}} {{lang|fr|Description}}". It was then that Egypt became, it can be said, fashion. This led to the emergence of [[Egyptomania]] and, much more importantly, the birth of Egyptology. Then the author evokes the acts of European consuls and their active persons engaged in the procurement of antiquities (the [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Great Belzoni]] was one of them), sometimes using processes closer to prey and looting than meticulous prospecting. It is natural that this should happen in those days when archaeological method was still in development.
* Ⅴ, "The Era of the Scholars" ({{lang|fr|L'Ère des savants}}) – The beginning of this era, with the expected prominence given to [[Jean-François Champollion]], who knew how to anticipate the efforts of several competitors ([[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], [[Johan David Åkerblad]] and [[Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy|Silvestre de Sacy]]). Big names in the post-Champollionic phase are those of [[Karl Richard Lepsius]], founder of German Egyptology, [[John Gardner Wilkinson]], the "Father of British Egyptology", and [[Émile Prisse d'Avennes]], who sent a number of Egyptian antiquities to France.
* Ⅵ, "Archaeologists to the Rescue" ({{lang|fr|Les archéologues au secours de l'Égypte}}) – After several decades of unbridled looting, of destruction of monuments, of contempt for the meticulous recording of the finds, came the archaeologists to rescue Egypt. Among them are: [[Auguste Mariette]], who would eventually die in Egypt occupying the high position of Director of Antiquities; [[Gaston Maspero]], Mariette's successor and [[Heinrich Karl Brugsch]], who was associated with Mariette in his excavations at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].
* Ⅶ, {{lang|fr|L'Égypte retrouvée}} (lit. "Egypt Regained"; chapter deleted in English edition) – This chapter evokes the works of [[Howard Carter]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]] ([[KV62|tomb of Tutankhamun]]), and [[Pierre Montet]]'s excavations at [[Tanis]] (tombs of [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]], [[Shoshenq II]] …), it's already in the first half of 20{{sup|th}} century. If the discoveries of the tombs of Tutankhamun and Psusennes had the international exposure, the truth is that almost every year new findings have been brought to light, many of which are only in the knowledge of the teams of work, of scholars and readers of specialised Egyptology journals. At a good pace, the discoveries continue today, methodically exploring the archaeological sites that exist not only in Egypt but also in [[Nubia]]; so "the philologists, epigraphists, historians can examine unearthed documents", and "Egyptology has passed the stage of childhood, it is entering its maturity".

The following "Documents" section containing a compilation of excerpts which is divided into 19 parts,{{refn|group=note|The "Documents" section ({{lang|fr|Témoignages et Documents}}) contains: 1, {{lang|fr|La campagne d'Égypte}}; 2, {{lang|fr|La description de l'Égypte}}; 3, {{lang|fr|Le style «retour d'Égypte»}}; 4, {{lang|fr|Le long voyage des obélisques}}; 5, {{lang|fr|L'inauguration du canal de Suez}}; 6, {{lang|fr|Le voyage en Orient}}; 7, {{lang|fr|Des Américains aux pyramides}}; 8, {{lang|fr|Un officier de marine à Philæ}}; 9, {{lang|fr|Le Sérapéum de Memphis}}; 10, {{lang|fr|La résurrection de Karnak}}; 11, {{lang|fr|La renaissance de Philæ}}; 12, {{lang|fr|Le sauvetage d'Abou Simbel}}; 13, {{lang|fr|Histoires de pillages}}; 14, {{lang|fr|L'égyptologie aujourd'hui}}; 15, {{lang|fr|La journée d'un archéologue}}; 16, {{lang|fr|La nouvelle vie de Ramsès Ⅱ}}; 17, {{lang|fr|Les mystères des pyramides}}; 18, {{lang|fr|Sur la piste de Chéops}}; 19, {{lang|fr|L'Égypte au musée du Louvre}}.}} taken from texts by [[Jean Tulard]] on Napoléon's expedition in Egypt, [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]] (''{{ill|Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem|fr}}''), [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] ({{lang|fr|Voyage en Orient}}), [[Maxime Du Camp]] ({{lang|fr|Souvenirs littéraires}}), [[Eugène Fromentin|Fromentin]] ({{lang|fr|Voyage en Égypte}}), [[Mark Twain]] (''[[The Innocents Abroad]]''), [[Pierre Loti]] ({{lang|fr|La Mort de Philæ}}), [[Auguste Mariette|Mariette]] ({{lang|fr|Le Sérapéum de Memphis}}); and, besides these big names, there are texts by modern Egyptologists such as [[Claude Traunecker]], Vercoutter himself on the [[Abu Simbel temples#Relocation|rescue of Abu Simbel temples]] and [[Jean-Claude Golvin]] (about the restoration works at [[Karnak]]), among others. The other documents recount the transport of Egyptian obelisks to Europe, the inauguration of the [[Suez Canal]], the mummy of Ramesses II under attack by fungi, the renewed attempts to discover the secret of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]], the main works of art of the Egyptian collection at Louvre Museum, etc. The final document also includes references to comic books where Egypt is the theme (''[[Asterix]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' …). The book closes with a list of Ancient Egyptian deities (with images and explanations), complete chronology of Ancient Egyptian history (from 6000 BC to 639 AD), further reading, list of illustrations and an index.

In his book review, the Portuguese Egyptologist {{ill|Luís Manuel de Araújo|pt}} praised the selection of illustrations for this work: "[…] this beautiful volume is valued by the excellent selection of images that lavishly accompanies the text", some of the illustrations belong to classic works from the early days of Egyptology, such as the {{lang|fr|[[Description de l'Égypte]]}}, [[Karl Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]]'s {{lang|de|Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien}}, [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]]'s ''Egypt and Nubia'', among others. De Araújo also notes the erroneous spelling for the divine name by using ''Khourou'' instead of {{lang|fr|Khonsou}} (in English: [[Khonsu]]) when mentioning the temple of this lunar deity at Karnak ({{p.|210}}); the name of the pharaoh of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]]—[[Amenemhat I]]—is wrongly written ''Amenhemat'' ({{p.|214}}), due to failure of revision; and the inexplicable absence of the famous English Egyptologist [[Flinders Petrie]], who introduced new methods of prospecting and registering the findings in archaeological research; and his contemporaries [[Adolf Erman]] and [[George Andrew Reisner]] are also being omitted.{{refn|group=note|This portion—"There are seven chapters: […] and his contemporaries Adolf Erman and George Andrew Reisner are also being omitted."—is based on the book review by Luís Manuel de Araújo, a Portuguese Egyptologist.

[[File:Découvertes Gallimard logo.jpg|thumb|left|Logo of ''Découvertes Gallimard'', it appears on the back cover and book spine, including "{{lang|fr|Hors série|italic=no}}" and some international editions.]]
The ''Découvertes Gallimard'' collection was born in the [[Gallimard Jeunesse]], based on an idea by [[Pierre Marchand (editor)|Pierre Marchand]] after the publications of two pocket collections: ''Découvertes Cadet'' in 1983 and ''Découvertes Benjamin'' in 1984. These three Découvertes collections cater to three levels: grades 4 to 6 (''Découvertes Benjamin''), grades 7 to 9 (''Découvertes Cadet''), and grades 10 and up (''Découvertes Gallimard'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Harber |first=Philip |url=https://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol16no3/frenchlanguageencyclopedia.html |title=French-Language Encyclopedias |year=1988 |website=[[University of Manitoba|umanitoba.ca]] |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pocket encyclopaedia initially named {{lang|fr|Les chemins de la connaissance}} ("The Paths of Knowledge"), Pierre Marchand already had the idea when he entered Gallimard in 1972, as he explains: "I have invested fourteen years of my professional life in this collection. Thanks to the success of {{lang|fr|Livres dont vous êtes le héros}} that we were able to embark on this adventure […] For the first time, genuine encyclopaedias in pocket format […] Our bet is that once you open the book, no matter what subject you read or which page you are on, you can no longer close it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=17 November 1986 |title=Comme un film documentaire |trans-title= |url= |language=fr |magazine=Livres Hebdo, n° 47 |location=Paris |publisher=Electre S.A. |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Françoise Balibar]], [[Jean-Pierre Maury]], [[Jean-Pierre Verdet]], [[Marc Meunier-Thouret]] and some others were the first to experience this pharaonic project that would await the arrival of [[Élisabeth de Farcy]] and [[Paule du Bouchet]], in 1981, for truly to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crilj.org/2011/07/02/une-vieille-histoire/ |title=Une vieille histoire |last=Lallouet |first=Marie |website=Centre de Recherche et d'Information sur la Littérature pour la Jeunesse (CRILJ) |date=2 July 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; To produce encyclopaedias in pocket format and fully illustrated in colours, in that time, many judged such an editorial project insane.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; However, the collection was still created in 1986 and directed by Élisabeth de Farcy. She chose the authors and organised iconographic campaigns, several editors and iconographers were then gathered, copious illustrations were extracted from [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] resources. Élisabeth explained in an interview with {{lang|fr|[[La Croix]]}}: "The image should occupy a central place, as in a work of art."&lt;ref name=Élisabeth&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.la-croix.com/amp/276508 |title=Élisabeth de Farcy, directrice de la collection "Découvertes Gallimard" : "Une collection de poche à l'ambition encyclopédique" |date=13 November 2006 |newspaper=[[La Croix]] |accessdate=19 April 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors were skeptical about this project at first, even contemptuous, but they are eventually fascinated by the collection. Some have even authored several works, such as [[Françoise Cachin]], curator of the [[Musée d'Orsay]], author of three books – {{lang|fr|Gauguin : « Ce malgré moi de sauvage »}}{{refn|group=note|English edition title (both American and British) – ''Gauguin: The Quest for Paradise''.}} (№ 49), {{lang|fr|Seurat : Le rêve de l'art-science}} (№ 108), {{lang|fr|Manet : « J'ai fait ce que j'ai vu »}}{{refn|group=note|American edition – ''Manet: The Influence of the Modern''; British edition – ''Manet: Painter of Modern Life''.}} (№ 203); or [[Jean-Pierre Maury]], who wrote four titles – {{lang|fr|Galilée : Le messager des étoiles}} (№ 10), {{lang|fr|Comment la Terre devint ronde}} (№ 52), {{lang|fr|Newton et la mécanique céleste}}{{refn|group=note|American edition – ''Newton: The Father of Modern Astronomy''; British edition – ''Newton: Understanding the Cosmos''.}} (№ 91) and {{lang|fr|Le palais de la Découverte}} (№ 195).&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

A preview edition, or "zero edition" ({{lang|fr|numéro zéro}} in French) was sent to 500 booksellers during the summer of 1986,&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; and officially released in November. The first twelve titles, twenty-five thousand copies of each volume were printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=8 December 1986 |title=Spécial Gallimard jeunesse |trans-title= |url= |language=fr |magazine=Livres Hebdo, supplément au n° 50 |location=Paris |publisher=Electre S.A. |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We've never seen so many things between the first and last pages of a book" is the slogan proposed by Pascal Manry's advertising agency for the launch of the collection. Without [[market research]] at the start, Pierre Marchand, a self-taught man, explained on the TV programme ''{{ill|Ça se discute|fr}}'': "This project was as old as my thirst for knowledge. No doubt it is necessary to be precisely self-taught to sense the importance of an encyclopaedia. We must have been forced to build our own culture, to seek reliable references, to make clear statements. To conceive ''Découvertes'', I didn't need market research, surveys or tests. Right from the start, I wanted to give the public the books I needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=December 1990 |title=Mon tout, c'est Découvertes Gallimard |trans-title= |url= |language=fr |magazine=[[Lire (magazine)|Lire]] |location=Paris |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Découvertes'' was constituted for youth at the beginning, it was launched for the general adult public in 1986.&lt;ref name=Aestheticization /&gt; The collection then had a rapid-growth, 105 titles (volumes) appeared in five years. It acrossed the borders first time with the Spanish co-publisher {{ill|Aguilar (publisher)|lt=Aguilar|es|Aguilar (editorial)}} in 1989, and 19 countries will finally be associated with it.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt; In 1992, after 151 titles have been published, Gallimard showed interest in the work on [[mermaid]] and [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]] ({{lang|nl|De lokroep van de zeemeermin}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Donder |first=Vic |orig-year=First published 1992 |title=De lokroep van de zeemeermin |series=Standaard Ontdekkingen |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/lokroep-van-de-zeemeermin/oclc/906635282 |website=[[Worldcat.org]] |language=nl |location=Antwerp |publisher=[[Standaard Uitgeverij]] |isbn=90-269-6350-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dbnl.org/tekst/_sep001199401_01/_sep001199401_01_0120.php |title=Bibliographie des oeuvres en langue néerlandaise parues en traduction française signalées en 1993 |date=1994 |website=[[Digital Library for Dutch Literature|DBNL]] |publisher= |accessdate=20 September 2017 |language=Dutch, French}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by {{ill|Vic de Donder|nl}}, a [[Belgians|Belgian]] Dutch-language writer. Nevertheless, the Parisian publishing house hesitated: "Interesting subject, but how can you illustrate that?" Then De Donder showed a list of about one thousand images that he gathered over years, Gallimard was convinced and made him the first non-French-language author in this collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vlaminck |first=M. |date=24 October 1992 |title=Gallimard haalt De Donder binnen |trans-title= |url= |language=nl |newspaper=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |page=15 |location=[[Groot-Bijgaarden]] |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heydays of the collection were at the turn of the 1990s, the authors are mainly recruited from [[academics]] and [[curator]]s. Numerous monographs of artists were often published on the occasions of major exhibitions, with a predilection for painters and musicians. Such as the 165{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Matisse : « Une splendeur inouïe »}}{{refn|group=note|British edition title – ''Matisse: The Sensuality of Colour''; American edition title – ''Matisse: The Wonder of Color''.}} was released for the exhibition "[[Henri Matisse]] 1904–1917" at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in 1993;&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; and Geneviève Haroche-Bouzinac's ''Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun'' (from "Hors série") was on sale at the exhibit of [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Vigée Le Brun]]'s paintings in [[New York City]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.versopolis.com/panorama/127/elisabeth-louise-vige-le-brun-and-the-art-of-seduction |title=Elisabeth Louise Vigée-Le Brun and the Art of Seduction |author=Diane Joy Charney |publisher=Versopolis |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or reactivity in relation to current events, for instance, the 161{{sup|st}} title {{lang|fr|[[Sang pour sang, le réveil des vampires]]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Culture-et-societe/Le-reveil-des-vampires |title=''Sang pour sang, le réveil des vampires'', collection Découvertes Gallimard (n° 161) |publisher=[[Éditions Gallimard]] |access-date=29 August 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|British version title – ''Vampires: The World of the Undead''; American version title – ''Vampires: Restless Creatures of the Night''.}} was published in 1992 for the release of [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola]]'s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula|Dracula]]'' in the same year; and {{lang|fr|La mine dévoreuse d'hommes}} (№ 184)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KEjSPAAACAAJ&amp;dq=La+Mine+dévoreuse+d%27hommes | title = La mine dévoreuse d'hommes | publisher = [[Éditions Gallimard]] | website = [[Google Books]] | access-date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the release of the French film ''[[Germinal (1993 film)|Germinal]]''; {{lang|fr|Un Conservatoire pour les Arts et Métiers}} (№ 222) for the [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] of the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers|CNAM]]; {{lang|fr|La Mode : Un demi-siècle conquérant}} (№ 511) was on sale on the occasion of "[[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] retrospective" at the [[Petit Palais]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/decouvertes/photos/a.113338219660.96877.110193529660/351170094660/?type=3&amp;theater |title=Découvertes Gallimard |date=8 March 2010 |website=Facebook |publisher=Gallimard |accessdate=27 September 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some works were launched within an extremely limited time frame, such as {{lang|fr|Mémoires du Louvre}} (№ 60), for the inauguration of the [[Louvre Pyramid]] in 1989; and {{lang|fr|Les Temples de l'opéra}} (№ 77) for the [[Opéra Bastille]], in 1990, both completed in six to eight weeks instead of the usual two or three months. Alongside many works dictated by current events, there are also a number of favourites, sometimes strange, such as a book devoted to [[red hair]] (№ 338 – {{lang|fr|Roux et rousses : Un éclat très particulier}}), which is unusual in this type of collection.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; Some subjects can be more difficult to sell but considered necessary, such as the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] (№ 138 – {{lang|fr|La Perspective en jeu : Les dessous de l'image}}), images of [[human body]] (№ 185 – {{lang|fr|Les images du corps}}{{refn|group=note|British version title – ''The Human Body: Image and Emotion''; American version title – ''Images of the Body''.}}) and [[mannerism]] (№ 457 – {{lang|fr|Le maniérisme : Une avant-garde au XVIᵉ siècle}}).&lt;ref name=Élisabeth /&gt; But in recent years, there were more monographs on the memory of places and large institutions instead of artists, as well as various sociological and religious aspects, for instance, a book on the [[history of New York City]] by [[Jerome Charyn]], which is translated and adapted from his English work ''Metropolis: New York as Myth, Marketplace, and Magical Land'' (№ 204 – {{lang|fr|New York : Chronique d'une ville sauvage}}); volumes on [[homosexuality]] (№ 417 – {{lang|fr|La longue marche des gays}}) and [[Substance abuse|drugs]] (№ 423 – {{lang|fr|Les drogues : Une passion maudite}}); titles about [[Marian devotions]] and [[Marian apparition|apparition]] (№ 401 – {{lang|fr|La Vierge : Femme au visage divin}} &amp; № 524 – {{lang|fr|Le monde de Lourdes}}). And also numerous volumes devoted to writers, for example, the 381{{sup|st}} title {{lang|fr|Marcel Proust : La cathédrale du temps}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Litteratures/Marcel-Proust |title=''Marcel Proust : La cathédrale du temps'', collection Découvertes Gallimard (n° 381) |publisher=[[Éditions Gallimard]] |accessdate=19 April 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficult subjects were frequently in demand, possibly because there was less competition. Thus a book on the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] (№ 95 – {{lang|fr|Le rêve cistercien}}) was one of the bestsellers in 1990. While the others like {{lang|fr|La fièvre de l'or}} (№ 34, about [[gold rush]]) or {{lang|fr|Sous le pavillon noir : Pirates et flibustiers}} (№ 45, about [[Piracy|pirates]]) are presumably subjects more common and popular, were relative failures. Generally, the most popular titles are those from {{lang|fr|Arts}} and {{lang|fr|Archéologie}} series, the first title and the 24{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|L'écriture, mémoire des hommes}}{{refn|group=note|English edition (both American and British) – ''Writing: The Story of Alphabets and Scripts''.}} (both in {{lang|fr|Archéologie}} series) remain two of the bestsellers.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt; As of 2001, the former would have sold more than five hundred thousand copies worldwide. As for the {{lang|fr|Sports et jeux}} series, there are only 4 most favoured titles: {{lang|fr|La saga du Tour de France}} (№ 81), {{lang|fr|La balle au pied : Histoire du football}} (№ 83), {{lang|fr|Jeux Olympiques : La flamme de l'exploit}} (№ 133) and {{lang|fr|Voyous et gentlemen : Une histoire du rugby}} (№ 164).&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; Competition has emerged as early as in the middle of the 1990s, circulation and novelties have been decreased gradually, but partially offset by another original collection {{lang|fr|'''Découvertes Gallimard Hors série'''}}, which is like a spin-off.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt;

Today, there are about fifteen old titles from the collection that are updated every year according to the current cultural and scientific research. History is the main point of ''Découvertes''. It is completed by archaeology, [[art history]] and science, richly accompanied by unpublished illustrations from ancient times to our days. Thus it forms a solid editorial base.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt; On 25 March 1994, ''Découvertes Gallimard'' celebrated its publication of 200{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Voyages en Utopie}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Litteratures/Voyages-en-utopie |title=''Voyages en Utopie'', collection Découvertes Gallimard (n° 200) |publisher=[[Éditions Gallimard]] |accessdate=17 April 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Musée national des Monuments Français]].&lt;ref name=Fête /&gt; The collection underwent two successive redesigns, one in September 1998 (№ 359 – {{lang|fr|Le Théâtre de Boulevard : « Ciel, mon mari ! »}}) for exterior model (colour of book's back-cover, more explicit signage), and the other in March 2000 (№ 390 – {{lang|fr|L'Esprit des savoirs}}) for interior page layout.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt; The "Documents" section of those re-editions is shortened, the average pagination of each volume decreases. The collection, which was too soon associated with a [[Channel surfing|zapping]] visual culture, reaffirmed its first purpose: the image does not take precedence over the text, but combined with text to animate and enrich the reading.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt; These books benefit from the latest technologies, with their mockups are all made using [[Desktop publishing|DTP]] now. Since the [[QuarkXPress|X Press]] software was only released in 1987, the first 30 titles were made in a traditional way, with [[phototypesetting]]. The current price of a ''Découvertes'' book is between 8.40 and 15.90 [[euro]]s ([[Pound sterling|£]]7.95 in UK, [[United States dollar|$]]12.95–$14.95 in US and [[Canadian dollar|$]]19.95 in Canada) according to its category and number of pages, this is considered an extremely low price for a book of this quality.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclopédie]]'' is the first French encyclopaedia, a work edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and many other contributors. It was one of the first encyclopaedias to realise the form we would recognise today, also the first one to include contributions from many named [[Encyclopédistes|contributors]], and perhaps the most famous early encyclopaedia. The 100{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Le Roman vrai de l'Encyclopédie}} (lit. "True Novel of the Encyclopaedia") is dedicated to this work.]]

"This inexpensive pocket encyclopaedia embodies its [[Humanism|humanistic]] dream: to make the most advanced state of knowledge available to everyone.

In order to remedy the problems of international proprietaries and reproduction rights of works of art, the co-publishers firstly define a number of titles, then they choose according to their own editorial line, and share the high cost of worldwide photographic rights. Therefore, [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in the United States chose more titles about traditional cultural subjects, while in Japan, the publisher {{ill|Sōgensha|ja|創元社}} prefers original titles, such as {{lang|fr|Les sorcières, fiancées de Satan}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Decouvertes-Gallimard/Culture-et-societe/Les-Sorcieres-fiancees-de-Satan |title=''Les sorcières, fiancées de Satan'', collection Découvertes Gallimard (n° 57) |publisher=[[Éditions Gallimard]] |accessdate=18 April 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (lit.

In addition to these foreign co-editions, ''Découvertes Gallimard'' has also been involved in institutional partnerships for several years, notably the one held since 1989 with the [[Réunion des Musées Nationaux]] (RMN): thirty-two titles have been released (as of 2001), plus a title in English dedicated to [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] (№ 277 – ''Corot: Extraordinary landscapes''), [[Impressionism]] [[box set]] and four books in the "Hors série". The principle of these co-editions is based on a sharing of costs and revenues, the RMN brings its knowledge of museums and [[Content delivery network|distribution network]], while the publisher brings its editorial competence. When a title is linked to an exhibition, it generates a lot of additional sales through the RMN. Other partnerships with public or private companies, such as the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|CEA]] (№ 282 – {{lang|fr|L'atome, de la recherche à l'industrie : Le Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique}}), [[Crédit Mutuel]] (№ 379 – {{lang|fr|L'odyssée de l'euro}}), [[L'Oréal]] (№ 405 – {{lang|fr|Les vies du cheveu}}{{refn|group=note|English edition – ''Hair: The Long and the Short of It''.}}), paper industries (№ 369 – {{lang|fr|Le papier : Une aventure au quotidien}}), et cetera. The partner is sometimes explicitly indicated in the "acknowledgments" (№ 379), but it is most often mentioned equivocally (№ 405), even modestly kept in silence (№ 389 – {{lang|fr|Vive l'eau}}).&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

Documentary-style book publishing has been in decline in France for several years, [[market saturation]] is one of the causes, competition from other medias is another, especially from the internet. Despite its excellent image to the public, ''Découvertes Gallimard'' is also concerned by this disaffection. It remains an indisputable success internationally, but in France, the sales are eroding. The number of new productions decreases and also the prints. On 1 March 1999, the director of [[Gallimard Jeunesse]] and creator of ''Découvertes'', Pierre Marchand, after working for 27 years at Gallimard, left to become a [[creative director]] at [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]. This was no doubt a big loss to the collection, but with more than 10 years of experience and a rich fund created over years, ''Découvertes'' finally surpassed the difficulties.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt; The end of 2006 is marked by the celebration of {{lang|fr|Découvertes Gallimard}}'s 20{{sup|th}} anniversary and the publication of its 500{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Art brut : L'instinct créateur}}. On this occasion, a website was specially created for the collection, which is now the official website ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.decouvertes-gallimard.fr&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. On the occasion of [[Éditions Gallimard]]'s [[centennial]] in 2011, ''Découvertes Gallimard'' launched its first [[E-book|digital book]] for iPad: the 569{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Gallimard : Un éditeur à l'œuvre}} ("Gallimard: A Publisher at Work") by {{ill|Alban Cerisier|fr}}.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt;

Image is the essential part to ''Découvertes Gallimard'', the collection drew much inspiration from magazine [[Page layout|layout]] designs. Full colour pictures, documentary illustrations, archival photographs, historical maps occupy a central place in this work, as said Pierre Marchand himself: "the language of images is a universal language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parutions.com/pages/1-1-140-2851.html |title=Un entretien avec Pierre Marchand – Fondateur du département Jeunesse des éditions Gallimard |website=parutions.com |date=12 October 1999 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the 1980s, [[Desktop publishing|DTP]] and photo digitisation did not exist, the sophisticated mockups were entirely handmade and the iconographers ran around museums, libraries, painting galleries and other agencies to look for documents. Today, the technology has simplified all these procedures but the difficulties are elsewhere, the status of the image is increasingly complex.&lt;ref name=Élisabeth /&gt;

Contemporary subjects often generate much higher costs since the publisher is obliged to work with photographic agencies. In the choice of documents, priority is given to those original, unpublished images. Besides, the iconographers of ''Découvertes'' have some exceptional documents, such as English explorer [[Frederick Catherwood]]'s original drawings of [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins decorate the 20{{sup|th}} title {{lang|fr|Les cités perdues des Mayas}}.{{refn|group=note|English edition title (both American and British) – ''Lost Cities of the Maya''.}}&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

It's not difficult to illustrate subjects like arts, civilisations, archaeology... But when it comes to a theme like "[[pain]]" (№ 370 – {{lang|fr|La douleur : Un mal à combattre}}) or "[[sustainable development]]" (№ 495 – {{lang|fr|Le développement durable : Maintenant ou jamais}}), it becomes more delicate. The question is how to avoid repetitiveness or the flatly illustrative image, then the solution lies in a broadening field, through the use of historical documents, works of art and [[film still]]s.&lt;ref name=Élisabeth /&gt;

== Case study in aestheticisation movement ==
The [[wiktionary:aestheticisation|aestheticisation]] of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] everyday life, according to [[Sociology|sociologists]] [[Michel Maffesoli]] and [[Mike Featherstone]], it seems to spring from two parallel movements rooted in [[modernity]], the so-called "dual postmodern aestheticisation movement": first an aesthetic [[hedonism]] (Maffesoli) and second the trivialisation of art (Featherstone). The second movement is the result of the de-[[Academic art|academisation]] and de-[[institutionalisation]] of art, thus "art is part of everyday life". ''Découvertes Gallimard'' is considered an example of 'art as part of everyday life' within this study.&lt;ref name=Aestheticization /&gt;

[[Pierre Marchand (editor)|Pierre Marchand]], Head of [[Gallimard Jeunesse]] who created the new kind of artistic encyclopaedia with a dynamic layout, that would be as much a magazine as an encyclopaedia. It has been described by a Gallimard employee that Découvertes "seduces like a magazine but has the duration of a book", kind of an objectified and specialised luxury magazine. A lot of work and research is done on the reproduction of images and the choice of illustrations, often unpublished documents like antique engravings, old photos, on all types of themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyorkmania.fr/2010/08/livre-new-york-chronique-dune-ville-sauvage/ |title=Livre — New York : Chronique d'une ville sauvage |date=4 August 2010 |website=New York Mania ! |accessdate=29 December 2017 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this collection, all books share the same concept as to layout and looks, each book itself could become a work of art rather than only its substitute. It is coupled with up-to-date editing equipment, organisational innovations and a constant pursuit of higher printing quality at lower cost. And a more friendship than business relation between Marchand and the Italian printer Gianni Stavro has advanced the state of the art in printing. The suppliers of Découvertes are supposed to cooperate between themselves, "for instance, the French printer had a problem concerning the pigments, so the Italian printer invited him over to explain how he could solve the problem", explained by a Gallimard employee.&lt;ref name=Aestheticization /&gt;

Pierre Marchand might not be an "Artistic Master", but he is almost considered as such by his employees. {{lang|fr|Découvertes}}' staff work like a team, where everybody is concerned with everything at the same time. They share the same culture and values, their office is intentionally built like a vessel, with Marchand as 'captain' on the bridge, and anyone, at any time, is free to contribute with his/her own ideas about authors, pictures, front covers, …, and becomes leader of a project.&lt;ref name=Aestheticization&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cova |first1=Bernard |last2=Svanfeldt |first2=Christian |year=1993 |title=Societal Innovations and the Postmodern Aestheticization of Everyday Life |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256431763_Societal_innovations_and_the_postmodern_aestheticization_of_everyday_life |journal=[[International Journal of Research in Marketing]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=Amsterdam |volume=10 |issue= |pages=297–310 |doi= |accessdate=27 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spin-offs ==
* {{lang|fr|'''Découvertes Gallimard Hors série'''|italic=no}}: The title roughly translates as "off-series" or "off-collection". "Hors série" books are even smaller (120 × 170&amp;nbsp;mm, generally, but not always), each one consists of 48 pages with full colour illustrations. These books are designed like museum guide booklets, according to Gallimard, "{{lang|fr|des livres à visiter comme une exposition|italic=no}}" (lit. "books to visit like an exhibition"). Most of them are dedicated to artists like [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Arcimboldo]], [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]], [[Gustave Le Gray|Le Gray]], et cetera, during major exhibitions devoted to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.decouvertes-gallimard.fr/Decouvertes/hors_serie.go |title=HORS SÉRIE |publisher=[[Gallimard]] |accessdate=23 September 2017 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307233650/http://www.decouvertes-gallimard.fr/Decouvertes/hors_serie.go |archivedate=7 March 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|fr|'''Une autre histoire du XXᵉ siècle'''|italic=no}}: Literally means "Another History of the 20{{sup|th}} Century". A closed series in ''Découvertes Gallimard'' collection released in 1999, consists of ten volumes for ten decades, written by French historian {{ill|Michel Pierre|fr|Michel Pierre (historien)}} and based on the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] cinematographic archives.&lt;ref name=Découvertes /&gt;
* {{lang|fr|'''Découvertes Gallimard Albums'''|italic=no}}: Consists of 13 volumes, 12 volumes released in 1992 and one in 1994, a larger format (210 × 270&amp;nbsp;mm) is used for these books.
* {{lang|fr|'''Découvertes Gallimard Texto'''|italic=no}}: A 6-volume series released in 1998, inspired by the "Documents" section at the back of every ''Découvertes Gallimard'' book.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

The "Hors série" books are often coupled with exhibitions and it works well. While the other attempts to diversify the collection have often resulted in resounding commercial failures: the "Albums" and "Texto". Despite an interesting concept: the use of [[Film still|still images]] from Gaumont archives for "{{lang|fr|Une autre histoire du XXᵉ siècle|italic=no}}", this series has had mixed success.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

According to French magazine ''[[L'Expansion]]'', some other positive reviews including ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'': "Revolutionary… Literally spectacular…"; ''[[The Times]]'': "A brand-new and daring collection"; ''[[Die Zeit]]'': "As soon as you open these handy books, you can not get away from them anymore"; ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'': "A collection that recalls nineteenth-century encyclopaedias, where intelligence went hand in hand with curiosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/gutenberg-fait-de-la-resistance_1409632.html |title=Gutenberg fait de la résistance |author=Roger Alexandre |date=20 December 1993 |magazine=[[L'Expansion]] |accessdate=3 January 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French news magazine ''[[L'Express]]'': "Real monographs, published as art books, offered in pocket format and sold at a pocket price […] ''Découvertes'' changed the face of [[Encyclopedism|encyclopaedism]] and art book, adapting the book to the era of '[[Channel surfing|zapping]]'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/l-invention-des-decouvertes_810690.html |title=L'invention des Découvertes |last=Garcia |first=Daniel |date=1 November 2005 |magazine=[[L'Express]] |language=fr |access-date=31 August 2018 |quote=De véritables monographies, éditées comme des livres d'art, proposées en format poche et vendues à un prix poche […] « Découvertes » a changé la face de l'encyclopédisme et du livre d'art, adaptant le livre à l'ère du « zapping ».}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{ill|Le Journal des Arts|fr}}''—a French bimonthly journal—calls the collection a "classic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/medias/la-mue-des-decouvertes-gallimard-138599 |title=La mue des Découvertes Gallimard |last=Manca |first=Isabelle |date=28 June 2018 |website=lejournaldesarts.fr |language=fr |access-date=29 October 2018 |quote=C'est ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler un « classique ».}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also regarded by ''{{ill|Livres Hebdo|fr}}''—a French weekly magazine—as one of six collections that have marked the history of French publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.livreshebdo.fr/article/decouvertes-gallimard-le-savoir-en-images |title=« Découvertes Gallimard », le savoir en images |last=Combet |first=Claude |date=11 May 2018 |magazine=[[Livres Hebdo]] |language=fr |access-date=29 October 2018 |quote=Cinquième volet de notre série sur six collections qui ont marqué l'histoire de l'édition française.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all the favours to its quality and attractive visual design, the collection suffers from a problem of identity in bookshops: where to put these books? With books for youth or books for adults? As pocket books or [[human science]] documentary books? And opt for a thematic scattering on the shelves. Many booksellers renounce the displays that were exclusively reserved for "Découvertes" due to high competition. All the more so because a rather tight inventory management at Gallimard, the complete titles are never available at the same time, which does not appreciate the customers. The problem of identification is also latent in [[print media]], the journalists, even if they are personally delighted to receive the new titles from a [[press agent]], would not be too enthusiastic about presenting a simple pocket book in their articles, even if it's a brand new title and not a reprint.&lt;ref name=à-la-française /&gt;

''Découvertes'' books have been selectively translated into English, published by [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] in United Kingdom under the title '''''New Horizons''''' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thamesandhudson.com/books/filter-group/new-horizons-series |title=Books: New Horizons series |publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]] |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.publishinghistory.com/new-horizons-thames-hudson.html |title=''New Horizons'' (Thames and Hudson) - Book Series List |website=www.publishinghistory.com |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which launched its first titles in 1992 with the slogan, "the expanding universe between two covers". According to Thames &amp; Hudson director Jamie Camplin, the remit is to "[[Educational entertainment|educate in an entertaining way]]".&lt;ref name=In&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/in-the-beginning-was-the-picture |title=In the beginning was the picture |author=Jim Davies |work=[[Eye Magazine]] |date=Summer 1994 |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Gottlieb (publisher)|Paul Gottlieb]], former director and editor in chief of the New York-based publisher [[Abrams Books]] (then called Harry N. Abrams), discovered Pierre Marchand's "Découvertes" collection at the Gallimard stand during the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair|Bologna Book Fair]] in 1991, which he called "a dazzling array of books" and an "imaginative combination of text and pictures in a magnificently produced series of paperback books". He began to negotiate for English language translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20020527/24880-pierre-marchand-remembered.html |title=Pierre Marchand Remembered |author1=Hedwige Pasquet  |author2=Christine Baker |author3=Christopher Davis |author4=Paul Gottlieb |author5=[[Herbert Lottman]] |author6=Dick Robinson |author7=Klaus Flugge |author8=[[Peter Mayer]] |date=May 27, 2002 |website=[[Publishers Weekly|publishersweekly.com]] |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was eventually titled '''''Abrams Discoveries''''' series by the U.S. publisher. They began to publish in the spring of 1992, and more than 100 titles were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abramsbooks.com/?s=Discoveries |title=Search Results: Discoveries |publisher=[[Abrams Books]] |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thriftbooks.com/series/abrams-discoveries/90018/ |title=Abrams Discoveries series - 91 book (incomplete) |work=[[Thriftbooks]] |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/abrams-discoveries |title=An incomplete list of Abrams Discoveries series |work=[[Goodreads]] |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Barrie Kerper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF4AZd6MUa4C&amp;pg=PT609&amp;lpg=PT609&amp;dq=Discoveries+/+Harry+Abrams+illustration&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k-IFvaLEfG&amp;sig=qr7Cllceo3355RAVw8f0htre4ZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzsZLCjbLTAhVIuBQKHfFMBt8Q6AEIYzAR#v=onepage&amp;q=Discoveries%20%2F%20Harry%20Abrams%20illustration&amp;f=false |title=Paris: The Collected Traveler |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |work=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two publishers share the translation costs, the American edition is then re-edited to take into account [[American and British English spelling differences|English spelling]], or vice versa.&lt;ref name=In /&gt; Unlike the original French edition which each volume has a number on the book's spine, the American and British editions are not put into numerical order. UK edition's book spines have titles in white with black background, while the more Gallimard-style US edition has titles in colour and sometimes with decorative features, like an {{larger|[[Ankh|☥]]}} for ''Cleopatra: The Life and Death of a Pharaoh'' and a {{larger|[[Fleur-de-lis|⚜]]}} for ''Heraldry: An Introductin to a Noble Tradition''. As for the "Documents" section, though some co-publishers print the entire French version, Thames &amp; Hudson reformulates this part, tailoring the material to suit the nuances of the UK market.&lt;ref name=In /&gt;

'''Eprints in Library and Information Science''' ('''E-LIS''') is an international [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] for academic papers in [[Library and Information Science]] (LIS). Over 12,000 papers have been archived to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/ |title=E-LIS Homepage |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is freely accessible, aligned with the [[Open Access]] (OA) movement and is a voluntary enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.rclis.org/handle/10760/6634 |title=E-LIS: an international open archive towards building open digital libraries |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322064324/http://eprints.rclis.org/handle/10760/6634 |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About E-LIS ==

E-LIS is the largest international open repository in the field of [[Library and Information Science]]. It is freely accessible and users are able to search, access, and [[self-archiving|archive]] full-text documents

=== Objectives ===

E-LIS is based on the philosophy and principles of [[Open-source software|open source]] software whereby people from all over the world co-operate in building freely-licensed software. Its aim is to further the open access philosophy by making full text Library and Information Science documents visible, accessible, harvestable, searchable, and usable by any potential user with access to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/handle/10760/13220 |title=The management of an international open access repository : the case of E-LIS |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the E-LIS are:

* To improve knowledge of the building and management of open archives working practically in the field within the framework of [[Digital library|Open Digital Libraries]];
* Not only to promote open archives in various disciplinary environments, but also to create a valid and credible model in the Library and Information Science discipline for the building of a global LIS archive;
* To establish a base for communal work between librarians information technology professionals, and to enhance the [[Open Access]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/handle/10760/13288 |title=Promotion of Open Access through self-archiving in Sri Lanka: getting experiences from E-LIS |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Governance ===

E-LIS is established, managed and maintained by an international team of 73 librarians and information scientists from 47 countries and support for 22 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/cms/governance |title=E-LIS Governance|accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of an international Library and Information Science network has been stimulated by the extension of the open access concept to LIS works and facilitated by the dissemination of material within the LIS community. 

The editorial work is performed under the management of an executive board that drives the policies, alliances, new actions, collaborations and any topic that is of interest to E-LIS. The executive board is made up of two chief executives, two representatives of the editorial team, two representatives of [http://www.ciepi.org/ CIEPI] - International Centre for Research in Information Strategy and Development -which is the association created by E-LIS members for representing institutionally the E-LIS interest as a legal entity - and two technical representatives that have deep technical experience on document repositories. In addition to this structure, the advisory board appointed to advise the executive board is formed by institutions and people that support E-LIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.rclis.org/cms/governance executive board]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Users ===

There are currently 8,000 authors represented in E-LIS. It is possible to deposit works in any language, although abstracts and keywords must be included in English, in addition to abstracts and keywords in the original language of the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/cms/policy |title=E-LIS Submission Policy |year=2003 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a broad sense, any document related to [[Library science|LIS]] that is electronically available, can be submitted to the archive in [[PDF]] or [[HTML]]. The types of user are: [[librarians]], [[academics]], [[archivists]], information management specialists from: [[Academic library|academic libraries]], [[archives]], government libraries, [[health libraries]], [[information centre]]s, [[museum]]s, [[national libraries]], [[private libraries]], [[public libraries]], [[school libraries]] or [[universities]].

E-LIS provides features for editors and users including automatic alerts for editors, full metadata display of metadata records, full-text search, browsing by user, a counter in the homepage as well as statistics.

A strength of the repository is the national editors from 47 countries, carrying out the quality control of the [[metadata]]. Each editor approves documents of their own country and coordinates the actions on the promotion of E-LIS in their country. All the editors share this common vision and mission, while contributing to E-LIS with their own experience and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/handle/10760/10158 |title=E-LIS: the Open Archive for Library and information Science |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

E-LIS deals with each country's specific issues to decide the best solution for technical and non-technical barriers so that international visibility can be promoted whilst national interests are served. International co-operation can facilitate debate on current issues.

=== Copyright ===

Copyright is one of the key issues for E-LIS. The submission of documents and their accessibility is not an infringement of copyright. All work in E-LIS remains property of the author. If the document is a preprint, the process is quite straightforward because there are no limits concerning copyright: the author holds the exclusive copyright for the pre-refereed preprints. For the refereed postprint, the issue becomes more complex. The author might have given the rights to, for instance, a publisher. The right to self-archive the refereed postprint is a legal matter because the [[copyright transfer agreement]] applies to the text. Most journals permit self-archiving, but it depends on the publisher's copyright policy. Authors can also deposit the postprint inside the archive with restricted access. Some publishers have stated that they grant these rights as a standard procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/cms/copyright |title=E-LIS Copyright Policy |year=2003 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright law gives the creator of copyrighted work exclusive rights, which may be both segmented and transferred to others.

=== Funding ===

Being a nonprofit and voluntary initiative, in the past E-LIS has received small funds from the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]], but there is no regular funding of any kind from any institution or state.

=== Activities ===

The current short-term plan of activities is described in the "Acropolis Strategy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.rclis.org/cms/acropolis |title=The Acropolis Strategy |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Acropolis Strategy" roadmaps the actions of the E-LIS community in 2011. It was drafted by the E-LIS Executive Board and E-LIS staff and sets critical goals, which are expected to improve the current situation of E-LIS services. The "Acropolis Strategy" is continuously referred to in order to assess the progress of the E-LIS community activities. One of E-LIS Team prime priorities is to publish the bibliographic data in E-LIS as [[Linked Data|Linked Open Data]].

In [[academic publishing]], an '''eprint''' or '''e-print''' is a digital version of a research document (usually a journal article, but could also be a [[thesis]], conference paper, book chapter, or a book) that is accessible online, whether from a local [[institutional repository|institutional]], or 
a central (subject- or discipline-based) [[digital repository]].&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, S., Carr, L., Brody, T. and Oppenheim, C. (2003). "[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7725/ Mandated online RAE CVs linked to university eprint archives]". ''Ariadne'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swan, A., Needham, P., Probets, S., Muir, A., Oppenheim, C., O’Brien, A., Hardy, R., Rowland, F. and Brown, S. (2005). "[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11000/ Developing a model for e-prints and open access journal content in UK further and higher education]". ''Learned Publishing'', 18 (1). pp. 25-40. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crow, Raym (2006). [http://scholarship.utm.edu/20/ The Case for Institutional Repositories: A SPARC Position Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204073537/http://scholarship.utm.edu/20/ |date=2011-02-04 }}.

"[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11000/ Institutions, their repositories and the Web]". ''Serials Review'', 34 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

When applied to journal articles, the term "eprints" covers both [[preprint]]s (before [[peer review]]) and [[postprint]]s (after peer review).

Digital versions of materials other than research documents are not usually called e-prints, but some other name, such as [[e-book]]s.

A '''Flora''' is a [[book]] or other work which describes the [[plant]] [[species]] occurring in an area or time period, often with the aim of allowing identification. The term is usually capitalized to distinguish it from the use of "[[flora]]" to mean the plants rather than their descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a Flora? |work=Flora of China (online) |publisher=Harvard University Herbarium |url=http://flora.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/what_is.htm |accessdate=2014-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classic and modern Floras are listed below. 

Traditionally Floras are books, but some are now published on [[CD-ROM]] or [[website]]s. The area that a Flora covers can be either geographically or politically defined. Floras usually require some specialist botanical knowledge to use with any effectiveness. 

A Flora often contains diagnostic keys. Often these are [[identification key|''dichotomous'' keys]], which require the user to repeatedly examine a plant, and decide which one of two alternatives given in the Flora best applies to the plant.

Floras produced at a local or regional level rarely contain identification keys. Instead they aim to impart more detailed understanding of the local status and distribution of that area's plants. Maps showing species distribution may be included, and nowadays are computer-generated from [[biological database]]s. Specific reference may be made to new arrivals and historic records in order to impart understanding of the changes in an area's vegetation over time.

Level II codes are composed of a single letter in the range A to V, followed by 4 digits. Level II codes are maintained by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). There is some overlap between HCPCS codes and [[National Drug Code]] (NDC) codes, with a subset of NDC codes also in HCPCS, and vice versa. The CMS maintains a crosswalk from NDC to HCPCS in the form of an Excel file. The crosswalk is updated quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is HCPCS?|url=http://www.aapc.com/resources/medical-coding/hcpcs.aspx|publisher=AAPC|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Level II codes==
The letters at the beginning of HCPCS Level II codes have the following meanings:&lt;ref&gt;State of Wisconsin, Department of Health Services, Clinical Advisory Committee on Health and Emerging Technology. Procedure Code Overview. March 25, 2010. Retrieved on 2010-12-12 from http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/cachet/March2510mtg/3.25.10CACHETCPTandHCPCSOverview.doc.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three important HCPCS Level 2 codes for digital mammograms that often used (G0202, G0204 and G0206).
The original mammogram codes (film based mammograms) are CPT codes (77055, 77056, and 77057), so it would be easy to overlook the increasingly used digital mammogram codes that remain as HCPCS Level 2 codes if one did not know they existed (and possibly under-report mammogram statistics).

'''''Historia naturalis palmarum: opus tripartitum''''' ("Natural History of Palms, a work in three volumes") is a highly illustrated, three-volume [[botany|botanical]] book of [[Arecaceae|palms]] (''Arecaceae'') by German [[botanist]] [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]]. The work is in [[Latin]] and was published in [[Book size|imperial folio]] format&lt;ref name="bluemacaws"&gt;[http://www.bluemacaws.org/hist16.htm Excerpts from ''An account of travels in Brazil at the command of his Majesty, Maximilian Joseph I, King of Bavaria, in the years 1817 to 1820 by Dr. J.B von Spix and Dr. C.F.P. von Martius''] www.bluemacaws.org&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leipzig]] (''Lipsiae'') by T.O. Weigel, volume one in 1823 and the final volume in 1850. It includes more than 550 pages of text and 240 [[Chromolithography|chromolithographs]], including views of habitats and botanical dissections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciweb.nybg.org/Science2/Onlinexhibits/exhbtcata.html The New York Botanical Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;   

''Historia naturalis palmarum'' was based on Martius' travels in [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]] with [[zoologist]] [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] from 9 December 1817 to 1820.  Their expedition was sponsored by the [[King of Bavaria]], [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]], with instructions to investigate natural history and tribal Indians. The pair travelled over 2,250 km (1,400 mi) throughout the [[Amazon Basin]], the most species-rich palm region in the world, collecting and sketching specimens. They began in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]] before making their way north and inland. They became the first non-Portuguese Europeans to obtain permission to visit the Brazilian Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aradergalleries.com/detail.php?id=1677 Arader Galleries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928100748/http://www.aradergalleries.com/detail.php?id=1677 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their return to [[Bavaria]], the King awarded both men [[knighthood]]s and lifetime pensions.&lt;ref name="pacsoa"&gt;[http://www.pacsoa.org.au/places/People/martius.html Palm and Cycad Societies of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first volume, Martius outlined the modern classification of palms and prepared the first maps of palm [[biogeography]]. The second volume described the palms of Brazil, and in the third, known as ''Expositio Systematica'', he systematically described all known [[Genus|genera]] of the palm family, based on his own work and that of others.

The majority of drawings of palms for the second volume, dedicated to Brazilian palms, were credited to Martius, with just a few landscapes, representing areas not travelled by Martius, taken from works by [[Frans Post]] and [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]].

The book was reprinted in two volumes in 1971.&lt;ref name="pacsoa" /&gt;

Other works by Martius based on the expedition were ''[[Reise in Brasilien]]'' (''Journey in Brazil''), published in three volumes in 1823, 1828 and 1831, and the massive 40-volume [[monograph]] ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'' which was completed by others in 1906.

[[E. J. H. Corner]] (1966) described the book as "the most magnificent treatment of palms that has been produced"&lt;ref&gt;[[E. J. H. Corner|Corner, E.J.H.]] 1966. ''Natural History of Palms''. University of California Press. Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alexander von Humboldt]] said of the work and author: "For as long as palms are named and known, the name of Martius will be famous."&lt;ref name="bluemacaws" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6703">'''Labelling''' or '''labeling''' is describing someone or something in a word or short phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labelling on dictionary.com (definition 2)|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/labelling}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, describing someone who has broken a law as a criminal. [[Labeling theory|Labelling theory]] is a theory in [[sociology]] which ascribes labelling of people to control and identification of deviant behaviour.
It has been argued that labelling is necessary for communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Oxonian, Volume 86, pp184|publisher=Association of American Rhodes Scholars|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;cd=21&amp;id=Lw8iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=labeling#search_anchor|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the use of the term  is often intended to highlight the fact that the ''label'' is a description applied from the outside, rather than something intrinsic to the labelled thing.  This can be done for several reasons:
*To provoke a discussion about what the best description is
*To reject a particular label
*To reject the whole idea that the labelled thing can be described in a short phrase.
This last usage can be seen as an accusation that such a short description is overly-[[Reduction (philosophy)|reductive]].

Giving something a label can be seen as positive, but the term ''label'' is not usually used in this case.  For example, giving a name to a common identity is seen as essential in [[identity politics]].

Labelling is often equivalent to [[pigeonholing]] or the use of [[stereotypes]] and can suffer from the same problems as these activities.

The labelling of people can be related to a [[reference group]].  For example, the labels ''black'' and ''white'' are related to [[black people]] and [[white people]]; the labels ''young'' and ''old'' are related to [[young people]] and [[old people]].

The labelling of [[Work of art|works of art]] can be related to [[genre]].  For example, a piece of music may be described as [[progressive rock]] or [[Independent music|indie]] or ragga jungle drum and bass.  However, there are other labels that can be applied to a work, such as [[Derivative work|derivative]], [[Low culture|low]] or [[High culture|high]].  The use of the word labelling is less common in the context of works of art than people.  However, it also often represents the rejection of a label.  For example, an [[artist]] may feel that the labeller is attempting to restrict the scope of the artist's work to that which is covered by the label.

== Labelling system on the World Wide Web ==
Labelling on the Web represent the [[Chunk (information)|chunks of information]] in our information environments. In an information environment, labels occur in 2 formats: textual and iconic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Information Architecture for the web and beyond|authors=Louis Rosenfeld, Peter Morville, Jorge Arango |publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc.,|year = 2015|isbn = 9781491911686|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating labels, the goal is to communicate efficiently, and without taking up too much space. Labels should be written in a language that’s familiar to the users, and in a way that they will detect new and recognize similar concepts. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Textual labels ===
'''Contextual links''' are hyperlinks to chunks of information on other pages or another location on the same page, and need to draw meaning from their surrounding text.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Headings:''' Labels are often used as headings to present subsequent information and create a hierarchy within contents. A hierarchical relationship between headings is established visually through a consistent use of numbering, font size, colour and styles, white spaces, indentation, or a combination of these items.

'''Navigation system choices:''' There is no standard for a navigation system but common categories might be:
* Main, Main Page, Home
* Search, Find, Browse, Search/Browse
* Site Map, Contents, Table of contents, Index
* Contact, Contact Us
* Help, FAQ,
* News, News and events, News and announcements, Announcements
* About, About us, About, Who we are.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Index terms''' are often referred to as keywords, tags, descriptive metadata, taxonomies, controlled vocabularies and thesauri. Such labelling systems can describe any type of content such as sites, subsites, pages, or content chunks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Iconic Labels ===
Icons can serve as a substitute for text to represent information. Iconic labels are used as navigation systems, especially in mobile apps, where screen space is constrained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Labelling in argumentation ==
In context of argumentation and debate, labelling a debator or position is often (whether consciously or unconsciously) used as a "[[red herring]]" to divert or dismiss the argument, instead of valid [[Argumentation_theory|argumentation]]. Often in the form of [[Association_fallacy#Guilt_by_association_as_an_ad_hominem_fallacy|ad hominem association fallacy]] aiming at accrediting or discrediting the argument or the debator by associating them with an emotionally charged label. Typically negatively; labelling it as [[Appeal_to_ridicule|ridiculous]] or [[Appeal_to_spite|despicable]], though it can also go the other way round; attempting to gain sympathy for example by promoting the debator or position as [[Argument_from_authority|authoritative]], or by appealing to [[Appeal_to_pity|pity]]. - Using labelling in argumentation this way constitute an [[informal fallacy]]. - For example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The guy believed that it can be done with the right technology.
*The guy is a ''perverted pansy''. (ie. Therefor it can never be done.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The witness claim to have seen something that indicates foul play.
*It is ''paranoid'' to assume foul play. (ie. Therefor whatever the witness might have seen is irrelevant.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Markings indicate that it was done with a crowbar. - And secondly, Mr X is a suspect..
*It is ''ridiculous'' to suspect mr X. (ie. Therefor it is also ridiculous to assume it was done with a crowbar.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been suggested that something it said in the book could be wrong.
*It is a ''very noble'' book. (ie. Therefor the suggestion is wrong.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''library catalog''' or '''library catalogue''' is a register of all [[bibliography|bibliographic]] items found in a [[library]] or group of libraries, such as a network of libraries at several locations. A bibliographic item can be any information entity (e.g., books, computer files, graphics, [[realia (library science)|realia]], cartographic materials, etc.) that is considered library material (e.g., a single [[novel]] in an [[anthology]]), or a group of library materials (e.g., a [[trilogy]]), or linked from the catalog (e.g., a webpage) as far as it is relevant to the catalog and to the users (patrons) of the library.

The '''card catalog''' was a familiar sight to library users for generations, but it has been effectively replaced by the [[online public access catalog]] (OPAC). Some still refer to the online catalog as a "card catalog".{{who|date=August 2018}}  Some libraries with OPAC access still have card catalogs on site, but these are now strictly a secondary resource and are seldom updated.  Many libraries that retain their physical card catalog will post a sign advising the last year that the card catalog was updated.  Some libraries have eliminated their card catalog in favour of the OPAC for the purpose of saving space for other use, such as additional shelving.

The largest library catalog in the world is the [[WorldCat|WorldCat.org]] [[union catalog]] managed by the non-profit library cooperative [[OCLC]], based in [[Dublin, Ohio]].  In January 2016, WorldCat.org had over 360,000,000 catalog records and over 2 billion library holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A global library resource|url = http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/catalog.en.html|website = www.oclc.org|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en|last = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goal ==

[[Charles Ammi Cutter]] made the first explicit statement regarding the 
objectives of a bibliographic system in his ''Rules for a Printed Dictionary Catalog'' in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Libraries in the United States of America then History, Condition, and Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rj-f4-Ps-AkC|year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 
Cutter, those objectives were

1. to enable a person to find a book of which either (Identifying objective)
*the author
*the title
*the subject
*the date of publication

2. to show what the library has (Collocating objective)
*by a given author
*on a given subject
*in a given kind of literature

3. to assist in the choice of a book (Evaluating objective)
*as to its edition (bibliographically)
*as to its character (literary or topical)

These objectives can still be recognized in more modern definitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001930/http://www.allegro-c.de/formate/gz-1e.htm|title=What Should Catalogs Do? / Eversberg|date=5 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; formulated throughout the 20th century. 1960/61 Cutter's objectives were revised by Lubetzky and the Conference on Cataloging Principles (CCP)  in Paris. The latest attempt to describe a library catalog's goals and  functions was made in 1998 with [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]] (FRBR) which defines four user tasks: find,  identify, select, and obtain.

A catalog helps to serve as an [[inventory]] or [[bookkeeping]] of the library's contents. If an item (e.g. a book, a CD, a DVD, etc.) is not found in the catalog, the user may continue her/his search at another library. [[Library theft|Library thieves]], who may be staff or regular visitors of the library, risk discovery if an item listed in the catalog is missing from the shelves. To reduce this risk, a thief may also steal the catalog card describing the item.&lt;ref&gt;Vennard, Martin (April 24, 2013)  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22249700 The curious tale of the stolen books], ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catalog card ==

A catalog card is an individual entry in a library catalog containing bibliographic information, including author’s name, book title, and even approximate location (on bookshelf). Eventually the mechanization of the modern era brought the efficiencies of card catalogs. It was around 1780 that the first card catalog appeared in Vienna. It solved the problems of the structural catalogs in marble and clay from ancient times and the later codex (handwritten and bound) catalogs that were manifestly inflexible and presented high costs in editing to reflect a changing collection.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eue&amp;AN=117044671&amp;site=eds-live|title=EBSCOhost Login|website=search.ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cards used may have been French playing cards, which, in the 1700s, were blank on one side.&lt;ref name=kraj&gt;{{Citation

Using these books in a new system of public libraries included an inventory of all books. The backs of the playing cards contained the bibliographic information for each book and this inventory became known as the "French Cataloging Code of 1791".&lt;ref name= Nix&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraryhistorybuff.org/cardcatalog-evolution.htm|title=Evolution of the Library Card Catalog|last=Nix|first=Larry|date=2009|website= www.thelibraryhistorybuff.org|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English inventor [[Francis Ronalds]] began using a catalog of cards to manage his growing book collection around 1815, which has been denoted as the first practical use of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|first=M.S.|date=1902|title=The Progress of the Modern Card Catalog Principle|url=|journal=Public Libraries|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-1800s, [[Natale Battezzati]], an Italian publisher, developed a card system for booksellers in which cards represented authors, titles and subjects. Very shortly afterward, [[Melvil Dewey]] and other American librarians began to champion the card catalog because of its great expandability. In some libraries books were catalogued based on the size of the book while other libraries organized based only on the author’s name.&lt;ref name="schifman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a19379/a-short-history-of-the-index-card/ |title=How the Humble Index Card Foresaw the Internet|last=Schifman|first=Jonathan|date=2016|website=www.popularmechcanics.com|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made finding a book difficult.

The first issue of the official publication of the American Library Association, the Library Journal, made clear that the most pressing issues facing libraries were the lack of a standardized catalog and an agency to administer a centralized catalog. Responding to the standardization matter, the ALA formed a committee that quickly recommended the 2-by-5-in (5-by-12-cm) "Harvard College size" cards as used at Harvard and the Boston Athenaeum. However, in the same report, the committee also suggested that a larger card, approximately 3 by 5 in (7.5 by 12 cm) would be preferable. By the end of the nineteenth century, the bigger card won out, mainly to the fact that the 3-by-5-in (7.5-by-12-cm) card was already the “postal size” used for postcards.

Melvil Dewey saw well beyond the importance of standardized cards and sought to outfit virtually all facets of library operations. To the end he established a Supplies Department as part of the ALA, later to become a stand-alone company renamed the Library Bureau. In one of its early distribution catalogs, the bureau pointed out that “no other business had been organized with the definite purpose of supplying libraries”. With a focus on machine-cut index cards and the trays and cabinets to contain them, the Library Bureau became a veritable furniture store, selling tables, chairs, shelves and display cases, as well as date stamps, newspaper holders, hole punchers, paper weights, and virtually anything else a library could possibly need. With this one-stop shopping service, Dewey left an enduring mark on libraries across the country. Uniformity spread from library to library. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Card Catalog: Books, Cards, and Literary Treasures|last=The Library of Congress|first=The Library of Congress|publisher=Chronicle Books LLC|year=2017|isbn=9781452145402|location=California|pages=84,85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey and others devised a new system. Books were organized by subject then those would be alphabetized based on the author’s name. Each book was assigned a “[[call number]]” which identified the subject and location. The decimal points divided different sections of the call number. The call number on the card matched a number written on the spine of each book.&lt;ref name="schifman" /&gt; During this time, in 1860 the American Assistant Librarian [[Ezra Abbot]] began designing a card catalog that was easily accessible and secure for keeping the cards in order; he managed this by placing the cards on edge between two wooden blocks. He published his findings in the Annual Report of the Library for 1863 and they were adopted by many American libraries.&lt;ref name="Nix" /&gt; Work on the catalog began in 1862 and within the first year 35,762 catalog cards had been created.  The catalog cards were 2 x 5 inches; the Harvard College size.  One of the first acts of the newly formed [[American Library Association]] in 1876 was to set standards for the size of the cards used in American libraries, thus making their manufacture and the manufacture of cabinets, uniform.&lt;ref name="kraj" /&gt; [[OCLC]], long the major supplier of catalog cards to the world's libraries, printed the last one on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OCLC prints last library catalog cards

In a physical catalog, the information about each item is on a separate card, which is placed in order in the catalog drawer depending on the type of record. If it was a non-fiction record, Charles A. Cutter's classification system would help the patron find the book they wanted in a quick fashion.  Cutter's classification system is as follows: 
* A, general works (encyclopedias, periodicals, society publications);
* B-D, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion;
* E-G, Biography, History, Geography, and Travels;
* H-K, Social Sciences, Law;
* L-T, Science and Technology;
* X, Philology; Z, Book Arts, Bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart (2009). The Library: An Illustrated History. New York: Skyhorse Publishing. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here's an example of a catalog card, which would be filed alphabetically in the Author section:

== Types ==
[[File:Sample Catalog Record.png|thumb|Sample card catalog record]]
Traditionally, there are the following types of catalog:
* ''Author'' catalog: a formal catalog, [[collation|sorted]] alphabetically according to the names of authors, editors, illustrators, etc.
* Subject catalogue: a catalogue that sorted based on the Subject.
* ''Title'' catalog: a formal catalog, sorted alphabetically according to the article of the entries.
* ''Dictionary'' catalog: a catalog in which all entries (author, title, subject, series) are interfiled in a single alphabetical order. This was a widespread form of card catalog in North American libraries prior to the introduction of the computer-based catalog.&lt;ref name=Wiegand&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiegand|first1=Wayne|last2=Davis|first2=Donald G., Jr.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|date=1994|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|isbn=0824057872|pages=605–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Index term|Keyword]]'' catalog: a subject catalog, sorted alphabetically according to some system of keywords.
* Mixed alphabetic catalog forms: sometimes, one finds a mixed author / title, or an author / title / keyword catalog.
* ''Systematic'' catalog: a subject catalog, sorted according to some systematic subdivision of subjects. Also called a ''Classified'' catalog. 
* ''Shelf list'' catalog: a formal catalog with entries sorted in the same order as bibliographic items are shelved. This catalog may also serve as the primary inventory for the library.

== History ==
[[File:Schlagwortkatalog.jpg|thumb|A card catalog in the [[University Library of Graz]] ]]
The earliest librarians created rules for how to record the details of the catalog. By 700 BCE the Assyrians followed the rules set down by the Babylonians. The seventh century BCE Babylonian [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] was led by the librarian Ibnissaru who prescribed a catalog of clay tablets by subject. Subject catalogs were the rule of the day, and author catalogs were unknown at that time. The frequent use of subject-only catalogs hints that there was a code of practice among early catalog librarians and that they followed some set of rules for subject assignment and the recording of the details of each item. These rules created efficiency through consistency—the catalog librarian knew how to record each item without reinventing the rules each time, and the reader knew what to expect with each visit. The task of recording the contents of libraries is more than an instinct or a compulsive tic exercised by librarians; it began as a way to broadcast to readers what is available among the stacks of materials. The tradition of open stacks of printed books is paradigmatic to modern American library users, but ancient libraries featured stacks of clay or prepaper scrolls that resisted browsing.&lt;ref name="search.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

During the early modern period, libraries were organized through the direction of the librarian in charge.  There was no universal method, so some books were organized by language or book material, for example, but most scholarly libraries had recognizable categories (like philosophy, saints, mathematics).  The first library to list titles alphabetically under each subject was the [[Sorbonne]] library in [[Paris]]. Library catalogs originated as [[manuscript]] lists, arranged by format ([[book size|folio]], quarto, etc.) or in a rough alphabetical 
arrangement by author. Before printing, librarians had to enter new acquisitions into the margins of the catalog list until a new one was created.  Because of the nature of creating texts at this time, most catalogs were not able to keep up with new acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Murray|Murray]], pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the printing press was well-established that strict cataloging became necessary because of the influx of printed materials.  Printed catalogs, sometimes called ''dictionary catalogs'', began to be published in the early modern period and enabled
scholars outside a library to gain an idea of its contents.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. (1) Radcliffe, John ''Bibliotheca chethamensis: [[Chetham's Library|Bibliothecae publicae Mancuniensis]] ab Humfredo Chetham, armigero fundatae catalogus, exhibens libros in varias classas pro varietate argumenti distributos''; [begun by John Radcliffe, continued by Thomas Jones]. 5 vols. Mancuni: Harrop, 1791–1863. (2) 
Wright, C. T. Hagberg &amp; Purnell, C. J. ''Catalogue of the [[London Library]], St. James's Square, London''. 10 vols. London, 1913–55. 
Includes: Supplement: 1913–20. 1920. Supplement: 1920–28. 1929. Supplement: 1928–53. 1953 (in 2 vols). Subject index: (Vol. 1). 1909. 
Vol. 2: Additions, 1909–22. Vol. 3: Additions, 1923–38. 1938. Vol. 4: (Additions), 1938–53. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of these in the library 
itself would sometimes be interleaved with blank leaves on which additions could be recorded, or bound as ''guardbooks'' in which slips 
of paper were bound in for new entries. Slips could also be kept loose in cardboard or tin boxes, stored on shelves. The first [[index card|card catalogs]] appeared in the late 19th century after the standardization of the 5 in. x 3 in. card for personal filing systems, enabling much more flexibility, and towards the end of the 20th century the Online public access catalog was developed (see below). These gradually became more common as some libraries progressively abandoned such other catalog formats as paper slips (either loose or in sheaf catalog form), and guardbooks. The beginning of the Library of Congress's catalog card service in 1911 led to the use of these cards in the majority of American libraries. An equivalent scheme in the United Kingdom was operated by the [[British National Bibliography]] from 1956&lt;ref&gt;Walford, A. J., ed. (1981) ''Walford's Concise Guide to Reference Material''. London: Library Association; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  and was subscribed to by many public and other libraries.

More about the early history of library catalogs has been collected in

== Sorting ==
[[File:Librarian at the card files at a senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Librarian at the card files at a senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota (1974)]]

In a title catalog, one can distinguish two sort orders:
* In the ''grammatical'' sort order (used mainly in older catalogs), the most important word of the title is the first sort term. The importance of a word is measured by grammatical rules; for example, the first noun may be defined to be the most important word.
* In the ''mechanical'' sort order, the first word of the title is the first sort term. Most new catalogs use this scheme, but still include a trace of the grammatical sort order: they neglect an article (The, A, etc.) at the beginning of the title.

The grammatical sort order has the advantage that often, the most important word of the title is also a good keyword (question 3), and it is the word most users remember first when their memory is incomplete. However, it has the disadvantage that many elaborate grammatical rules 
are needed, so that only expert users may be able to search the catalog without help from a librarian.

In some catalogs, persons' names are standardized (i. e., the name of the person is always cataloged and sorted in a standard form) even if it appears differently in the library material. This standardization is achieved by a process called [[authority control]]. Simply put, authority control is defined as the establishment and maintenance of consistent forms of terms – such as names, subjects, and titles – to be used as headings in bibliographic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/authority-control|title=Authority Control|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com Unabridged|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of the authority control is that it is easier to answer question 2 (Which works of some author does the library have?). On the other hand, it may be more difficult to answer question 1 (Does the library have some specific material?) if the material spells the author in a peculiar variant. For the cataloguer, it may incur too much work to check whether ''Smith, J.'' is ''Smith, John'' or ''Smith, Jack''.

For some works, even the title can be standardized.  The technical term for this is ''[[uniform title]]''. For example, translations and re-editions are sometimes sorted under their original title. In many catalogs, parts of the [[Bible]] are sorted under the standard name of 
the book(s) they contain.  The plays of William Shakespeare are another frequently cited example of the role played by a ''uniform title'' in the library catalog.

Many complications about alphabetic sorting of entries arise. Some examples:
* Some languages know sorting conventions that differ from the language of the catalog. For example, some [[Dutch language|Dutch]] catalogs sort ''IJ'' as ''Y''. Should an English catalog follow this suit? And should a Dutch catalog sort non-Dutch words the same way?  (There are also pseudo-[[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] which sometimes come at the beginning of a word, such as [[Œdipus]].  See also [[collation]] and [[Locale (computer software)|locale]].)  
* Some titles contain numbers, for example ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Should they be sorted as numbers, or spelled out as ''&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;wo thousand and one''?  (Book-titles that begin with non-numeral-non-alphabetic glyphs such as '''#1''' are similarly very difficult.  Books which have [[diacritics]] in the first letter are a similar but far-more-common problem; [[casefolding]] of the title is standard, but stripping the diacritics off can change the meaning of the words.) 
* ''[[Honoré de Balzac|de Balzac, Honoré]]'' or ''Balzac, Honoré de''?  ''[[José Ortega y Gasset|Ortega y Gasset, José]]'' or ''Gasset, José Ortega y''?  (In the first example, "de Balzac" is the legal and cultural last name; splitting it apart would be the equivalent of listing a book about tennis under "-enroe, John Mac-" for instance.  In the second example, culturally and legally the lastname is "Ortega y Gasset" which is sometimes shortened to simply "Ortega" as the masculine lastname; again, splitting is culturally incorrect by the standards of the culture of the author, but defies the normal understanding of what a 'last name' is—i.e. the final word in the ordered list of names that define a person—in cultures where multi-word-lastnames are rare.

In a subject catalog, one has to decide on which [[library classification|classification]] system to use.  The cataloguer will select appropriate subject headings for the bibliographic item and a unique classification number (sometimes known as a "call number") which 
is used not only for identification but also for the purposes of shelving, placing items with similar subjects near one another, which aids in browsing by library users, who are thus often able to take advantage of [[serendipity]] in their search process.

Rules governing the creation of MARC catalog records include not only formal cataloging rules such as [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]], second edition (AACR2),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacr2.org/|title=AACR2|website=www.aacr2.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access.rdatoolkit.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716192234/http://access.rdatoolkit.org/ |archivedate=2015-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also rules specific to MARC, available from both the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] and the [[OCLC]], the Online Computer Library Center global cooperative which builds and maintains [[WorldCat]].&lt;ref name="WorldCat"&gt;{{cite web

# The online catalog does not need to be sorted statically; the user can choose author, title, keyword, or systematic order dynamically.
# Most online catalogs allow searching for any word in a title or other field, increasing the ways to find a record.
# Many online catalogs allow links between several variants of an author's name. 
# The elimination of paper cards has made the information more accessible to many people with disabilities, such as the [[visually impaired]], [[wheelchair]] users, and those who suffer from [[Mold health issues|mold allergies]] or other paper- or building-related problems.
# Physical storage space is considerably reduced.
# Updates are significantly more efficient.

The '''Linnean Society of London''' is a society dedicated to the study of, and the dissemination of information concerning, [[natural history]], [[evolution]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. It possesses several important biological specimen, manuscript and literature collections and publishes [[academic journal]]s and books on plant and animal biology. The society also awards a number of prestigious medals and prizes for achievement.

A product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|18th-century enlightenment]], the society is historically important as the venue for the first public presentation of the [[Theory of Evolution]].

The patron of the society is Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. Honorary members include the present monarchs of [[Japan]], Emperor [[Akihito]], and [[Sweden]], King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], both of whom have active interests in natural history, and the eminent broadcaster, Sir [[David Attenborough]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linnean.org/our-fellows/royal-patrons-and-honorary-fellows Royal patrons and honorary fellows - Linnean Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Linnean Society was founded in 1788 by botanist Sir [[James Edward Smith]]. The society derives its name from the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]], the 'father of taxonomy', who systematised biological classification through his [[binomial nomenclature]]. He was known as Carl von Linné after his ennoblement, hence the spelling 'Linnean', rather than 'Linnaean'. The society had a number of minor name variations before it gained its Royal Charter on 26 March 1802, when the name became fixed as "The Linnean Society of London". In 1802, as a newly incorporated society, it comprised 228 fellows. It is the oldest extant natural history society in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, pp. 2, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history the society has been a non-political and non-sectarian institution, existing solely for the furtherance of natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The inception of the society was the direct result of the purchase by Sir James Smith of the specimen, book and correspondence collections of Linnaeus. When the collection was offered for sale by the heirs of Linnaeus, Smith was urged to acquire it by Sir [[Joseph Banks]], the eminent botanist and president of the [[Royal Society]]. Five years after this purchase Banks gave Smith his full support in founding the Linnean Society, and he became one of the first Honorary Members of the new society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick O'Brian|O'Brian, P.]] (1987) ''Joseph Banks'', Collins Harvill. p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The society has numbered many prominent scientists amongst its fellows. One such was the botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]], who was president (1849-1853); he named the [[cell nucleus]] and discovered [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Harris, Henry | title = The Birth of the Cell | year = 1999 | publisher = Yale University Press | pages = 76&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 [[Charles Darwin]] was elected a fellow; he is undoubtedly the most illustrious scientist ever to appear on the membership rolls of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous fellow was biologist [[Thomas Huxley]], who gained the nickname "Darwin's bulldog" for his outspoken defence of evolution. Men notable in other walks of life have also been fellows of the society, including the physician [[Edward Jenner]], pioneer of [[vaccination]], the [[Arctic]] explorers Sir [[John Franklin]] and Sir [[James Clark Ross]], colonial administrator and founder of [[Singapore]], [[Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles]] and [[Prime Minister]] of Britain, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, pp. 50, 53, 197-198&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1857 the Society has been based at [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]], [[London]]; an address it shares with a number of other learned societies: the [[Geological Society of London]], the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public exposition of the 'Theory of Evolution by [[Natural Selection]]', arguably the greatest single leap of progress made in biology, was presented to a meeting of the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. At this meeting a [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|joint presentation of papers]] by Charles Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was made, sponsored by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] and [[Charles Lyell]] as neither author could be present.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, I.B. (1985) ''Revolution in Science'', Harvard University Press, 1985, pp. 288-289&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 the society experienced the novelty of electing women fellows; this followed a number of years of campaigning by the botanist [[Marian Farquharson]]. Whilst the society's council was reluctant to admit women, the fellows were much less so, with only 17% voting against the proposal. Among the first to benefit from this were: ornithologist and photographer [[Emma Turner (photographer)|Emma Louisa Turner]], [[Lilian J. Veley]], a [[microbiologist]] and [[Annie Lorrain Smith]], a [[lichenologist]] and [[mycologist]], all formally admitted on 19 January 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, pp. 88-93&lt;/ref&gt; Also amongst the first women to be elected in 1904 was the [[paleobotanist]], and later pioneer of family planning, [[Marie Stopes]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Linnean'' (2005) Vol. 21(2) , p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's connection with evolution remained strong into the 20th century. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Sir Edward Poulton]], who was president 1912-1916, was a great defender of natural selection and was the first biologist to recognise the importance of [[frequency-dependent selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, E. B. 1884. Notes upon, or suggested by, the colours, markings and protective attitudes of certain lepidopterous larvae and pupae, and of a phytophagous hymenopterous larva. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1884: 27–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first female president of the society was [[Irene Manton]] (1973 to 1976), who pioneered the biological use of [[electron microscopy]]. Her work revealed the structure of the [[flagellum]] and [[cilia]], which are central to many systems of cellular motility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Preston | first1 = Reginald Dawson | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1990.0011 | title = Irene Manton. 17 April 1904-13 May 1988 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 35 | pages = 248 | year = 1990 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=F11B388DB00824EE363263C01B8AF8FA?doi=10.1.1.693.4850&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Biography of Irene Manton sponsored by the Linnean Society, in The Linnean, Special Issue No. 5 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen an increased interest within the society in issues of [[biodiversity]] conservation. This was highlighted by the inception in 2015 of an annual award, the [[John Spedan Lewis]] Medal, specifically honouring persons making significant and innovative contributions to conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linnean.org/the-society/medals-awards-prizes-grants/the-john-spedan-lewis-medal John Spedan Lewis Medal ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

[[Fellow|Fellowship]] requires nomination by at least one fellow, and election by a minimum of two thirds of those electors voting. Fellows may employ the [[post-nominal letters]] 'FLS'. Fellowship is open to both professional scientists and to amateur naturalists who have shown active interest in natural history and allied disciplines. Having authored relevant publications is an advantage, but not a necessity, for election. Following election, new fellows must be formally admitted, in person at a meeting of the society, before they are able to vote in society elections. Admission takes the form of signing the membership book, and thereby agreeing to an obligation to abide by the statutes of the society. Following this the new fellow is taken by the hand by the president, who recites a formula of admission to the fellowship. Other forms of membership exist: 'Associate', for supporters of the society who do not wish to submit to the formal election process for fellowship, and 'Student Associate', for those registered as students at a place of tertiary education. Associate members may apply for election to the fellowship at any time. Finally, there are three types of membership that are prestigious and strictly limited in number: 'Fellow ''honoris causa''', 'Foreign', and lastly, 'Honorary'. These forms of membership are bestowed following election by the fellowship at the annual Anniversary Meeting in May.&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, pp. 195, 198-202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ca1-tls.edcdn.com/Charter-and-Byelaws-2016-Final-24May2016.pdf?mtime=20160916102354 The Charter and Bye-laws of the Linnean Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==
Meetings have historically been, and continue to be, the main justification of the society's existence. Meetings are venues for people of like interests to exchange information, talk about scientific and literary concerns, exhibit specimens and listen to lectures. Today, meetings are held in the evening and also at lunchtime, most are open to the public as well as to members. The majority are held in Burlington House, but other venues are also occasionally used. On the 24th of May, traditionally regarded as the birthday of Carolus Linnaeus, the Anniversary Meeting is held. This is for fellows and guests only, and includes ballots for membership of the council of the society and the awarding of medals.&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, pp. 149-152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medals and prizes==
The Linnean Society of London aims to promote the study of all aspects of the biological sciences, with particular emphasis on evolution, taxonomy, biodiversity, and sustainability.  Through awarding medals and grants, the Society acknowledges and encourages excellence in all of these fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linnean.org/the-society/medals-awards-prizes-grants The Linnean Society of London: Medals and Prizes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, pp. 165-174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Linnaeus' [[botanical]] and [[zoology|zoological]] collections were purchased in 1783 by Sir James Edward Smith, the first President of the society, and are now held in London by the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/students/modules/hi916/week5/white_the_purchase_of_knowledge.pdf|title=The purchase of knowledge: James Edward Smith and the Linnean collections|last=|first=|date=1999|website=www.warwick.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections include 14,000 plants, 158 fish, 1,564 shells, 3,198 insects, 1,600 books and 3,000 letters and documents. They may be viewed by appointment and there is a monthly tour of the collections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linnean.org/research-collections/linnaean-collections The Linnean Society of London: Linnean Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's own plant collection of 27,185 dried specimens, together with his correspondence and book collection, is also held by the Society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linnean.org/research-collections/smith-collections The Linnean Society of London: Smith Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other notable holdings of the society include the notebooks and journals of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and the paintings of plants and animals made by [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] (1762–1829) in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gage A. T. and Stearn W. T. (1988) ''A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London'', Linnean Society of London, pp. 175-181 (specimen collections) 183-188 (manuscript, illustration and publication collections)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the society's collection was added to the list of nationally significant collections in England by the [[Arts Council England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advisor.museumsandheritage.com/four-collections-of-national-importance-gain-designated-status-from-arts-co/ Linnean Society is one of four collections nationally recognised]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Linnean Society began its extensive series of publications on 13 August 1791, when Volume I of ''Transactions'' was produced. Over the following centuries the society published a number of different journals, some of which specialised in more specific subject areas, whilst earlier publications were discontinued. Those still in publication include: the ''[[Biological Journal of the Linnean Society]]'', which covers the evolutionary biology of all organisms, ''[[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]]'', which focuses on plant sciences, and ''[[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]]'' focusing on animal systematics and evolution. ''The Linnean'' is a biannual newsletter. It contains commentary on recent activities and events, articles on history and science, and occasional biographies/obituaries of people connected to the Linnean Society; it also includes book reviews, reference material and correspondence. The society also publishes books and ''Synopses of the British Fauna'', a series of field-guides.&lt;ref&gt;Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T.

      <comment>/* Sortable list */ A bunch of nonsense - no state called "Palestine" was established in 1300 BC, the biblical 12 tribes founded the Kingdom of Israel, State of Palestine was not declared until 1988 and the earliest entity resembling a state is Palestinian National Authority established in 1994. There is no evidence of any "Palestinians" before 18th or 17th century.</comment>

{{Original research|date=December 2017}}
Below is a list of [[sovereign state]]s with the dates of their formation (date of their independence or of their constitution), sorted by continent. 
This list includes the [[List of sovereign states|195 states]] which are currently full member states or observer states of the [[United Nations]]. This does not include [[List of former sovereign states]], but does include several [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;listed are the five UN member states with limited recognition: Israel (not recognized by 32 members), North and South Korea (no mutual recognition), Armenia (not recognized by Pakistan) and Cyprus (not recognized by Turkey); "China" has universal recognition, but the UN is unclear on which of the Chinas (People's Republic or Republic) this refers to.&lt;/ref&gt;
For [[proposed states]] or various indigenous nations which consider themselves still under occupation, see [[list of active autonomist and secessionist movements]]. 
[[Micronations]] are not included in this list.

[[Nation-building]] is a long evolutionary process, and in most cases the date of a country's "formation" cannot be objectively determined; e.g., the fact that [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of France|France]] were sovereign kingdoms on equal footing in the medieval period
does not prejudice the fact that [[England]] is not now a sovereign state (having passed sovereignty to the [[UK]] in 1707), while [[France]] is a Republic founded in 1792  (technically, France currently refers to the [[French Fifth Republic]], formed in 1958).

An unambiguous measure is the [[List of national constitutions|date of national constitutions]]; but as constitutions are an entirely [[modern era|modern]] concept, all formation dates by that criterion are modern or early modern (the oldest constitution being that of [[San Marino]], dating to 1600).

[[Independence]] dates for widely recognised states earlier than 1919 should be treated with caution, since prior to the founding of the [[League of Nations]], there was no international body to recognise nationhood, and independence had no meaning beyond mutual recognition of ''[[de facto]]'' sovereigns (the role of the League of Nations was effectively taken over by the [[United Nations]] after the Second World War). See also: [[disputed territories]].

Many countries have some remote (or fantastically remote) symbolic foundation date as part of their [[national mythology]], sometimes [[antiquity frenzy|artificially inflating]] a country's "age" for reasons of [[nationalism]], sometimes merely gesturing at a long and gradual process of the formation of an [[ethnic identity]]. Such dates reflect not the formation of a [[Sovereign state|state]] (an independent political entity), but of a [[nation]] (an ethnic or cultural grouping), terms that are often conflated in the context of [[nation state]]s.

The following list contains the formation dates of countries with a short description of those events. For a more detailed description of a country's formation and history please see the main article for each country.

| Independence declared from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref name="SFRJ"&gt;According to the [[Badinter Arbitration Committee]], the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was dissolved into five states. This is the result when the Serb-dominated [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY) was formed on 27 April 1992 as a [[rump state]], consisting only of the former Socialist Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Its government claimed continuity to the former country, however, the international community refused to recognize it as such. The stance of the international community was that Yugoslavia had dissolved into its separate states. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was prevented by a UN resolution on 22 September 1992 from continuing to occupy the United Nations seat as [[successor state]] to SFRY. This question was important for claims on SFRY's international assets, including embassies in many countries. Only in 1996 had the FRY abandoned its claim to continuity from the SFRY. The FRY was dominated by Slobodan Milošević and his political allies. This was reaffirmed in the Succession Agreement signed in June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sortable list==
In this list, "date of last subordination" refers to the last date of control by an external government. The list shows large groupings associated with the dates of independence from [[decolonization]] (e.g. 41 current states gained control of sovereignty from [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] between 1956 and 1966)&lt;!--- '56 to '66 are nice-sounding and narrow-band bookends ---&gt; or dissolution of a [[political union]] (e.g. 18 current states gained control of sovereignty from [[Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia]] between 1990 and 1992). In other cases, a sovereign state submitted to foreign [[military occupation]] or political subjugation for a period of time and later regained its independence (e.g. 6 current states gained control of sovereignty from [[Nazi Germany]] between 1944 and 1945).

Dates refer to ''de facto'' rule or occupation of the major territory, whether or not legitimized by international recognition.

In a union such as Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, or the Kalmar Union, one of the constituents can be considered the dominant power – generally where the seat of government was located.  The United Kingdom is a particularly complicated case. If England is viewed as the dominant member, then history can be traced from Roman conquest, Saxon invasions, 10th century unification, and the 1066 Norman Conquest before the union of England and Scotland in 1707. However, if viewed from a Scottish perspective, an unbroken history of sovereignty can be traced from unification in 843 through the 1707 union with England (with a brief [[Tender of Union|annexation by England]] from 1657 to 1660).  Some Scots view the 1707 union as a ceding of sovereignty to England.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher A Whatley (2001). ''Bought and Sold for English Gold: The Union of 1707'' (Tuckwell Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''United Arab Emirates:''' In [[United Arab Emirates]], the directory is titled ''Yellow Page Gulf UAE''. Established in January 2011, is the LARGEST yellow pages of GULF. Yellow Pages Gulf.
* '''United Kingdom:''' The first Yellow Pages directory in the UK was produced by the [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] Corporation's telephone department (now [[Kingston Communications]]) in 1954. This was distributed with the alphabetical phone directory rather than as a stand-alone publication. The company now produces [[Hull Colour Pages|The Hull Colour Pages]].

:With the encouragement of [[The Thomson Corporation]], at the time an advertising sales agent for the nationalised [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]]'s [[telephone directory]], a business telephone number directory named the Yellow Pages was first produced in 1966 by the GPO for the [[Brighton]] area, and was rolled out nationwide in 1973. The Thomson Corporation formed Thomson Yellow Pages in 1966 to publish and to distribute the directory to telephone subscribers for the GPO, and later for [[Royal Mail|The Post Office]].

:Thomson Yellow Pages was sold by The Thomson Corporation in 1980, at the same time as Post Office Telecommunications became the (then) state-owned [[British Telecom]] (BT). The Yellow Pages directory continued to be distributed to all telephone subscribers by BT. At the same time, The Thomson Corporation formed Thomson Directories Ltd, and began to publish the [[Thomson Local]] directory, which would remain the Yellow Pages' main, and often sole, competitor in the UK for more than the next two decades, and would be the competitive driving force behind such changes to Yellow Pages as the adoption (in 1999) of colour printing and "white knock out" listings.

:In 1984 the year that BT was privatised, the department producing the directory became a stand alone subsidiary of BT, named Yellow Pages. In the mid-1990s the Yellow Pages business was re-branded as [[Yell Group|Yell]], although the directory itself continued to be known as the Yellow Pages.

:Yell was bought by venture capitalists in 2001, and in 2003 was floated on the Stock Exchange. After the one year "no competition" clause expired BT too went into competition with the Yellow Pages, re-entering the market by adding similar content to their existing directory, "The Phone Book", adding a classified section to the traditional alphabetical domestic and business listings.

:Yellow Pages, [[Thomson Local]] and BT's [[The Phone Book]] display advertising and can be booked directly with advertising sales representatives.

:Nowadays the KC Yellow Pages is referred to as [[Hull Colour Pages]], and is separate from the White Pages. Yell now also publishes an East Yorkshire edition of Yellow Pages in competition.

[[File:Bsyps.png|right|Bell System Yellow Pages Logo]]
* '''United States:''' In the past, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Qwest, the three largest phone companies in the U.S., dominated the U.S. yellow pages industry; however, the term "yellow pages" and the ''Walking Fingers'' logo was heavily marketed by AT&amp;T pre [[Bell System Divestiture|divestiture]]. However, AT&amp;T never filed a trademark registration application for the current and most recognized version of the ''Walking Fingers'' logo, so it is in the public domain. AT&amp;T allowed the "independent yellow pages" industry to use the logo freely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/9_opinions/91-1461.html Bellsouth v. Datanational]&lt;/ref&gt; The "independents" are unrelated to the incumbent phone company and are either pure advertising operations with no phone infrastructure or telephone companies who provide local telephone service elsewhere. Such independents include operators who typically focus on industry or business segments, or local market directories.

:Yellow pages publishers or their agents sell the right to place advertisements within the same category, next to the basic listings.

:For example, [[AT&amp;T]] is the dominant local telephone service provider in [[California]], but since Bell Atlantic and [[GTE]] merged to become [[Verizon]], it now provides service in many pockets such as [[West Los Angeles (region)|West Los Angeles]]. [[Los Angeles]] telephone users can select from telephone directories published by AT&amp;T, Verizon (published by [[Idearc Media|Idearc]]), Yellow Book USA, PDC Pages (Phone Directories Company) [[PDC Pages.com]] and other independent publishing companies. [[R. H. Donnelley]] is also in local markets across country with Dex Printed Directories and [[DexKnows.com]]. In Northern California, Valley Yellow Pages [[MyYP.com]] is a large regional independent publisher. Additionally, in the smaller markets, many yellow pages publishers are beginning to offer directories catering to specific niche business or industry segments, such as automotive, manufacturing, environmental/green products, imports, exports, and the like. One such example is the [[Export Yellow Pages]] (a yellow page directory published in partnership with the US Department of Commerce that focuses on U.S. exporters) and vertical directories offered by Yellow Pages Nationwide, Inc. Media an Online Digital Yellow Pages company, Consolidation and M&amp;A activity in the directory publishing market continues to remain very high in the U.S. and there is an increasing move toward internet based directories as internet usage for search increases and concerns over the possible negative environmental effects of the books becomes more evident.
: [[Yellowpages.com]] is a subsidiary of [[Dex Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/14207102/1/the-yellow-pages-which-apparently-still-exists-has-been-acquired-by-dex-media.html|title=The Yellow Pages, Which Apparently Still Exists, Has Been Acquired by Dex Media|last=Berman|first=Laura|date=2017-07-01|work=TheStreet|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) linguistic area''' is a [[sprachbund|linguistic area]] that stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] (or Miao–Yao), [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] (represented by [[Chamic]]) and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] families. Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar typological features, which are believed to have spread by [[cultural diffusion|diffusion]].{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=182–184}} [[James Matisoff]] referred to this area as the '''Sinosphere''', contrasted with the "[[Indosphere]]", but viewed it as a zone of mutual influence in the ancient period.{{sfnp|Matisoff|1991|p=486}} "Sinosphere" is more commonly used to refer to the [[East Asian cultural sphere]].

David Gil (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Gil, David. 2015. ‘The Mekong-Mamberamo linguistic area?’ In N. J. Enfield and B. Comrie, Eds. ''Languages of Mainland Southeast Asia: The State of the Art''. Berlin, Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area to be part of the larger [[Mekong-Mamberamo linguistic area]], which also includes languages in [[Indonesia]] west of the [[Mamberamo River]].

==Language distribution==
The Austroasiatic languages include [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Khmer language|Khmer]], as well as many other languages spoken in scattered pockets as far afield as Malaya and eastern India. Most linguists believe that Austroasiatic languages once ranged continuously across southeast Asia and that their scattered distribution today is the result of the subsequent migration of speakers of other language groups from southern China.{{sfnp|Sidwell|Blench|2011|pp=339–340}}

Chinese civilization and the [[Chinese language]] spread from their home in the [[North China Plain]] into the Yangtze valley and then into southern China during the first millennium BC and first millennium AD.
Indigenous groups in these areas either became Chinese, retreated to the hill country, or migrated to the south.
Thus the Kra–Dai languages, today including [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Shan language|Shan]], were originally spoken in what is now southern China, where the greatest diversity within the family is still found, and possibly as far north as the Yangtze valley.
With the exception of [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]], most of the Kra–Dai languages still remaining in China are spoken in isolated upland areas.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=233}}
Similarly the Hmong–Mien languages may originally have been spoken in the middle Yangtze.
Today they are scattered across isolated hill regions of southern China.
Many of them migrated to southeast Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, after the suppression of a series of revolts in [[Guizhou]].{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=278–279}}

The upland regions of the interior of the area, as well as the plains of Burma, are home to speakers of other Sino-Tibetan languages, the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]].
The Austronesian languages, spoken across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, are represented in MSEA by the divergent Chamic group.

The far southern Sinitic languages [[Cantonese]] and [[Pinghua]] are also part of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, as demonstrated by Hilário de Sousa (2015).&lt;ref&gt;de Sousa, Hilário. 2015. ‘The Far Southern Sinitic languages as part of Mainland Southeast Asia.’ In N. J. Enfield and B. Comrie, Eds. ''Languages of Mainland Southeast Asia: The State of the Art''. Berlin, Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Post (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Post, M. W. 2015. ‘Morphosyntactic reconstruction in an areal-historical context: A pre-historical relationship between North East India and Mainland Southeast Asia?’ In N. J. Enfield and B. Comrie, Eds. ''Languages of Mainland Southeast Asia: The State of the Art''. Berlin, Mouton de Gruyter: 205 – 261.&lt;/ref&gt; observes that the [[Tani languages]] of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Northeast India]] typologically fit into the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, which typically has creoloid morphosyntactic patterns,&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, John H. 2007. ''Language Interrupted: Signs of non-native acquisition in standard language grammars''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than with the languages of the Tibetosphere. Post (2015) also notes that Tani culture is similar to those of Mainland Southeast Asian hill tribe cultures, and is not particularly adapted to cold montane environments.

==Syllable structure==
A characteristic of MSEA languages is a particular syllable structure involving [[monosyllabic]] [[morpheme]]s, [[lexical tone]], a fairly large inventory of consonants, including phonemic [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], limited clusters at the beginning of a syllable, and plentiful vowel contrasts.
Final consonants are typically highly restricted, often limited to glides and nasals or [[unreleased stop]]s at the same points of articulation, with no clusters and no voice distinction.
Languages in the northern part of the area generally have fewer vowel and final contrasts but more initial contrasts.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=186–187}}

Most MSEA languages tend to have monosyllabic morphemes, but there are exceptions.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|p=186}}
Some polysyllabic morphemes exist even in Old Chinese and Vietnamese, often loanwords from other languages.
A related syllable structure found in some languages, such as the [[Mon–Khmer languages]], is the [[sesquisyllable]], consisting of a stressed syllable with approximately the above structure, preceded by an unstressed "minor" syllable consisting only of a consonant and a [[neutral vowel]] {{IPA|/ə/}}.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|p=186}}
That structure is present in many conservative Mon–Khmer languages such as [[Khmer language|Khmer]] (Cambodian), as well as in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and it is reconstructed for the older stages of a number of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].

==Tone systems==
Phonemic tone is one of the most well-known of southeast Asian language characteristics.
Many of the languages in the area have strikingly similar tone systems, which appear to have developed in the same way.

===Origin of tonal contrasts===
The tone systems of [[Middle Chinese]], [[proto-Hmong–Mien]], [[proto-Tai]] and early Vietnamese all display a three-way tonal contrast in syllables lacking stop endings.
In traditional analyses, syllables ending in stops have been treated as a fourth or "[[checked tone]]", because their distribution parallels that of syllables with nasal codas.
Moreover, the earliest strata of loans display a regular correspondence between tonal categories in the different languages:{{sfnp|Downer|1963}}{{sfnp|Luo|2008|p=11}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=56}}

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"

! scope="col" | proto-Tai
! scope="col" | proto-Hmong–Mien
! scope="col" | Middle Chinese

|-
| *A (''ngang-huyền'') || *A || *A || 平 ''píng'' "level"   || -

| *B (''sắc-nặng'') || *C || *B || 上 ''shǎng'' "rising" || *-ʔ
|-
| *C (''hỏi-ngã'') || *B || *C || 去 ''qù'' "departing" || *-h &lt; *-s
|}

The incidence of these tones in Chinese, Tai and Hmong–Mien words follows a similar ratio 2:1:1.{{sfnp|Ballard|1985|p=171}}
Thus [[rhyme dictionaries]] such as the ''[[Qieyun]]'' divide the level tone between two volumes while covering each of the other tones in a single volume.
Vietnamese has a different distribution, with tone B four times more common than tone C.{{sfnp|Ballard|1985|p=171}}

It was long believed that tone was an invariant feature of languages, suggesting that these groups must be related.
However this category cut across groups of languages with shared basic vocabulary.
In 1954 [[André-Georges Haudricourt]] solved this paradox by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other (atonal) Austroasiatic languages.
He thus argued that the Austroasiatic proto-language had been atonal, and that its development in Vietnamese had been conditioned by these consonants, which had subsequently disappeared, a process now known as [[tonogenesis]].
Haudricourt further proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.
Other scholars have since uncovered transcriptional and other evidence for these consonants in early forms of Chinese, and many linguists now believe that [[Old Chinese]] was atonal.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=56}}
A smaller amount of similar evidence has been found for proto-Tai.{{sfnp|Gedney|1989}}
Moreover, since the realization of tone categories as pitch contours varies so widely between languages, the correspondence observed in early loans suggests that the conditioning consonants were still present at the time of borrowing.{{sfnp|Ratliff|2002}}

===Loss of voicing with tone or register split{{anchor|Tone split}}{{anchor|Register split}}===
A characteristic [[sound change]] (a [[Phonemic differentiation#Phonemic splits|phonemic split]]) occurred in most southeast Asian languages around 1000 AD.
First, syllables with voiced initial consonants came to be pronounced with a lower pitch than those with unvoiced initials.
In most of these languages, with a few exceptions such as [[Wu Chinese]], the voicing distinction subsequently disappeared, and the pitch contour became distinctive.
In tonal languages, each of the tones split into two "registers", yielding a typical pattern of six tones in unchecked syllables and two in checked ones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=53}}
[[Pinghua]] and [[Yue Chinese]], as well as neighbouring Tai languages, have further tone splits in checked syllables, while many other Chinese varieties, including [[Mandarin Chinese]], have merged some tonal categories.

Many non-tonal languages instead developed a register split, with voiced consonants producing [[breathy voice|breathy-voiced]] vowels and unvoiced consonants producing [[modal voice|normally voiced]] vowels.  Often, the breathy-voiced vowels subsequently went through additional, complex changes (e.g. diphthongization).  Examples of languages affected this way are [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] (Cambodian).  Breathy voicing has since been lost in standard Khmer, although the vowel changes triggered by it still remain.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=192–193}}

Many of these languages have subsequently developed some voiced obstruents.  The most common such sounds are {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} (often pronounced with some implosion), which result from former preglottalized {{IPA|/ʔb/}} and {{IPA|/ʔd/}}, which were common phonemes in many Asian languages and which behaved like voiceless obstruents.  In addition, Vietnamese developed voiced fricatives through a different process (specifically, in words consisting of two syllables, with an initial, unstressed [[minor syllable]], the medial stop at the beginning of the stressed major syllable turned into a voiced fricative, and then the minor syllable was lost).

==Morphology and syntax==
Most MSEA languages are of the [[isolating language|isolating]] type, with mostly mono-morphemic words, no [[inflection]] and little [[affixation]].
Nouns are derived by compounding; for example, [[Mandarin Chinese]] is rich in polysyllabic words.
Grammatical relations are typically signalled by word order, [[grammatical particle|particle]]s and [[coverb]]s or [[preposition]]s.
[[linguistic modality|Modality]] is expressed using [[sentence-final particle]]s.
The usual word order in MSEA languages is [[subject–verb–object]].
Chinese, [[Bai language|Bai]] and [[Karen language|Karen]] are thought to have changed to this order from the [[subject–object–verb]] order retained by most other Sino-Tibetan languages.
The order of constituents within a noun phrase varies: noun–modifier order is usual in [[Tai languages|Tai]] and [[Hmongic languages]], while in Chinese varieties and [[Mienic languages]] most modifiers are placed before the noun.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=187–190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=280}}
[[Topic-comment]] organization is also common.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=189–190}}

MSEA languages typically have well-developed systems of [[numeral classifier]]s.{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|p=189}}
The [[Bengali language]] just to the west of Southeast Asia also has numerical classifiers, even though it is an Indo-European language that does not share the other MSEA features. Bengali also lacks [[grammatical gender|gender]], unlike most [[Indo-European languages]].

{{Greek myth (personified)}}
In [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], the '''Moirai''' or '''Moerae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔɪ|r|aɪ|,_|-|r|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/moirai Moirai] in [[Oxford Living Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/moirai Moirai] in [[Collins English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|Μοῖραι}}, "apportioners"), often known in English as the '''Fates''' ({{lang-la|Fata|Fata, -orum (n)=}}), were the white-robed [[Anthropomorphism|incarnations]] of [[destiny]]; their [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent was the [[Parcae]] (euphemistically the "sparing ones"), there are other equivalents in cultures that descend from the [[Proto-Indo-European_mythology#Societal_deities|proto-Indo-European culture]]. Their number became fixed at three: [[Clotho]] (spinner), [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] (allotter) and [[Atropos]] (literally 'unturnable' but metaphorically 'inflexible' or 'inevitable' – i.e. death).

They controlled the mother thread of life of every mortal from birth to death. They were independent, at the helm of necessity, directed fate, and watched that the fate assigned to every being by eternal laws might take its course without obstruction. The gods and men had to submit to them, although [[Zeus|Zeus's]] relationship with them is a matter of debate: some sources say he can command them (the ''Zeus Moiragetes''), yet others suggest he was also bound to the Moirai's dictates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Moirai.html#Zeus |title=Theoi project: Moirae and the Throne of Zeus |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Homer]]ic poems '''Moira''' or '''Aisa''', is related with the limit and end of life, and [[Zeus]] appears as the guider of destiny. In the ''[[Theogony]]'' of [[Hesiod]], the three '''Moirai''' are personified, daughters of [[Nyx]] and are acting over the gods.&lt;ref name=Hesiod221&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' 221–225. "Also Night ([[Nyx]]) bare the destinies (Moirai), and ruthless avenging Fates ([[Keres (mythology)|Keres]]), who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and gods... until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty." [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm online ''The Theogony of Hesiod. Transl. Hugh Evelyn White'' (1914) 221–225].&lt;/ref&gt; Later they are daughters of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]], who was the embodiment of divine order and law. In [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' the Three Fates are daughters of [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (necessity).&lt;ref&gt;''Plato, Republic 617c (trans. Shorey) (Greek philosopher 4th century BC)'': [http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ananke.html Theoi Project – Ananke].&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that '''Moira''' is related with [[Tekmor (mythology)|Tekmor]] (proof, ordinance) and with [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (destiny, necessity), who were primeval goddesses in [[mythical]] [[cosmogonies]]. The ancient Greek writers might call this power '''Moira''' or [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]], and even the gods could not alter what was ordained :

"''To the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) the might of Zeus must bow; and by the Immortals' purpose all these things had come to pass, or by the Moirai's ordinance.''"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] |title=The Fall of Troy |location=13. 545 ff |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0490%3Abook%3D13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Prometh.515&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', 510–518: "Not in this way is Moira (Fate) who brings all to fulfillment, destined to complete this course. Skill is weaker far than Ananke (necessity). Yes in that even he (Zeus) cannot escape what is foretold." [http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ananke.html Theoi Project – Ananke]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a universal principle of natural order has been compared to similar concepts in other cultures like the [[Vedic]] [[Rta]], the [[Avesta]]n [[Asha]] ([[Asha|Arta]]) and the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] [[Maat]].

In earliest [[Greek philosophy]], the [[cosmogony]] of [[Anaximander]] is based on these [[mythical]] beliefs. The goddess [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] (justice, divine retribution), keeps the order and sets a limit to any actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''In Physica'' 24.13. The Greek peers of Anaximander echoed his sentiment with the belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate: Bertrand Russell (1946).

==Etymology==
[[File:Rundscheibe Drei Parzen KGM AE470.jpg|thumb|The three fates, Lachesis, Atropos, and Cloto; by Hans Vischer c. 1530 AD. [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]]]]
The [[ancient Greek]] word '''moira''' (μοῖρα) means a portion or lot of the whole, and is related to ''meros'', "part, lot" and ''moros'', "fate, doom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Moira Moira], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] ''meritum'', "reward", [[English language|English]] ''merit'', derived from the [[PIE]] root ''*(s)mer'', "to allot, assign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=merit merit], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moira'''  may mean portion or share in the distribution of booty (ίση μοῖρα ''ísē moîra'' "equal booty"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]], 9.318:[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmoi%3Dra ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': μοῖρα],&lt;/ref&gt; portion in life, lot, destiny, (μοῖραv ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι ''moîran éthēken athánatoi'' "the immortals fixed the destiny")&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 19.152: :[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmoi%3Dra ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': μοῖρα]&lt;/ref&gt; death (μοῖρα θανάτοιο ''moîra thanátoio'' "destiny of death"), portion of the distributed land.,&lt;ref&gt;The citizents of [[Sparta]] were called ''omoioi'' (equals), indicating that they had equal parts ("isomoiria" ἰσομοιρία) of the allotted land&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used for something which is meet and right (κατὰ μοῖραν, ''katà moîran'', "according to fate, in order, rightly")&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 16.367: :[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmoi%3Dra ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': μοῖρα]&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that originally the word '''moira''' did not indicate destiny but included ''ascertainment'' or ''proof'', a non-abstract certainty. The word [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]], which was an agent related to unexpected events, came to be similar to the word '''moira'''.&lt;ref&gt;M.Nillson, Vol I, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;  This agent or cause against human control might be also called [[tyche]] (chance, fate): "You mistress '''moira''', and [[tyche]], and my [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] "&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Iph.Aul. V 113'': " ΄'ω πότνια μοίρα καί τύχη, δαίμων τ΄εμός "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%3Dxh ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': τύχη].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''nomos'', "law", may have meant originally a portion or lot, as in the verb ''nemein'', "to distribute", and thus "natural lot" came to mean "natural law".&lt;ref&gt;L.H.Jeffery (1976) ''Archaic Greece. The City-States c. 700–500 BC ''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge p. 42 {{ISBN|0-510-03271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dike'', "justice", conveyed the notion that someone should stay within his own specified boundaries, respecting the ones of his neighbour. If someone broke his boundaries, thus getting more than his ordained part, then he would be punished by law. By extension, ''moira'' was one's portion or part in destiny which consisted of good and bad moments as was predetermined by the ''Moirai'' (Fates), and it was impossible for anyone to get more than his ordained part. In modern [[Greek language|Greek]] the word came to mean "destiny" (μοίρα or ειμαρμένη).

[[Destiny|Kismet]], the predetermined course of events in the [[Muslim]] traditions, seems to have a similar etymology and function: [[Arabic]] ''qismat'' "lot" ''qasama'', "to divide, allot"  developed to mean [[Fate]] or destiny. As a loanword, '''''qesmat''''' 'fate' appears in [[Persian language|Persian]], whence in [[Urdu]] language, and eventually in English [[Destiny|Kismet]].

==The three Moirai==
[[File:The Three Fates by Paul Thumann.jpg|thumb|''The Three Fates'' by [[Paul Thumann]] (19th century)]]

When they were three,&lt;ref&gt;The expectation that there would be three was strong by the 2nd century CE: when Pausanias visited the temple of Apollo at Delphi, with Apollo and Zeus each accompanied by a Fate, he remarked "There are also images of two Moirai; but in place of the third Moira there stand by their side Zeus Moiragetes and Apollon Moiragetes."&lt;/ref&gt; the Moirai were:
* '''[[Clotho]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|θ|oʊ}}, Greek {{lang|grc|Κλωθώ}} {{IPA-el|klɔːˈtʰɔː|}} – "spinner") spun the thread of life from her [[Distaff]] onto her [[Spindle (textiles)|Spindle]].  Her Roman equivalent was ''[[Nona (mythology)|Nona]]'', (the 'Ninth'), who was originally a goddess called upon in the ninth month of [[pregnancy]].  
* '''[[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|k|ᵻ|s|ɪ|s}}, Greek {{lang|grc|Λάχεσις}} {{IPA|[ˈlakʰesis]}} – "allotter" or drawer of lots) measured the thread of life allotted to each person with her [[measuring rod]].  Her Roman equivalent was ''[[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]'' (the 'Tenth').  
* '''[[Atropos]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|r|ə|p|ɒ|s}}, Greek {{lang|grc|Ἄτροπος}} {{IPA|[ˈatropos]}} – "inexorable" or "inevitable", literally "unturning",&lt;ref&gt;Compare the ancient goddess [[Adrasteia]], the "inescapable".&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called Aisa) was the cutter of the thread of life.  She chose the manner of each person's death; and when their time was come, she cut their life-thread with "her abhorred [[Scissors|shears]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears, / And slits the thin spun life." [[John Milton]], [[Lycidas]], l. 75. {{wikisource-inline|Lycidas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Roman equivalent was ''[[Morta (mythology)|Morta]]'' ('Dead One').

In the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' of [[Plato]], the three Moirai sing in unison with the music of the [[Siren (mythology)|Seirenes]]. [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] sings the things that were, [[Clotho]] the things that are, and [[Atropos]] the things that are to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plato|authorlink=Plato|title=Republic|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|edition=2 (November 15, 1992) |page=617c|translator=Sorrey|ISBN=978-0872201361}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pindar]] in his Hymn to the Fates, holds them in high honour. He calls them to send their sisters [[Hours (mythology)|Hours]], [[Eunomia (goddess)|Eunomia]] (Lawfulness), [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] (Right), and [[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]] (Peace), to stop the internal civil strife:
            &lt;blockquote&gt;
            Listen Fates, who sit nearest of gods to the throne of Zeus,
            and weave with shuttles of adamant,
            inescapable devices for councels of every kind beyond counting,
            [[Atropos|Aisa]], [[Clotho]] and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]],
            fine-armed daughters of [[Nyx|Night]],
            hearken to our prayers, all-terrible goddesses,
            of sky and earth.
            Send us rose-bosomed Lawfulness,
            and her sisters on glittering thrones,
            Right and crowned Peace, and make this city forget the misfortunes which lie heavily on her heart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], '' Fragmenta Chorica Adespota, 5''. Diehl&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Fates tapestry -460755563.jpg|thumb|The three '''Moirai''', or the triumph of death, Flemish [[tapestry]] c. 1520, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]

In ancient times caves were used for burial purposes in eastern [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]], along with underground shrines or temples. The priests and the priestesses had considerable influence upon the world of the living. Births are recorded in such shrines, and the [[Greeks|Greek]] legend of conception and birth in the tomb – as in the story of [[Danaë|Danae]]- is based on the ancient belief that the dead know the future. Such caves were the caves of [[Ida (mountain)|Ida]] and [[Dikte]] mountains in [[Crete]], where myth situates the birth of [[Zeus]] and other gods, and the cave of [[Eileithyia]] near [[Knossos]].&lt;ref name=Wunderlich290&gt;R. G. Wunderlich  (1994). ''The secret of Crete''. Efstathiadis group, Athens pp. 290–291, 295–296. (British Edition, Souvenir Press Ltd. London 1975)  {{ISBN|960-226-261-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] goddesses were named [[Britomartis|Diktynna]] (later identified with [[Artemis]]), who was a mountain [[nymph]] of hunting, and [[Eileithyia]] who was the goddess of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert|Burkert]], Walter. (1985). ''The Greek Religion'', Harvard University Press. pp 32–47&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that in Pre-Greek religion Aisa was a [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]. In [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean]] religion Aisa or Moira was originally a living power related with the limit and end of life. At the moment of birth she spins the destiny, because birth ordains death.&lt;ref name=Ilias7.52&gt;"Not yet is thy fate (moira) to die and meet thy doom" ([[Ilias]] 7.52), "But thereafter he (Achilleus) shall suffer whatever Fate (Aisa) spun for him at his birth, when his mother bore him": ([[Ilias]] 20.128 ): [[Martin P. Nilsson|M. Nilsson]]. (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion'' Vol I, C.F.Beck Verlag., Műnchen pp. 363–364&lt;/ref&gt; Later Aisa is not alone, but she is accompanied by the "Spinners", who are the [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of [[Destiny|Fate]].&lt;ref name=Oddysey7.198&gt;"But thereafter he shall suffer whatever Fate (Aisa) and the dread Spinners spun with her thread for him at his birth, when his mother bore him." (''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.198)&lt;/ref&gt; The act of spinning is also associated with the gods, who at birth and at marriage do not spin the thread of life, but individual events like destruction, return or good fortune. Everything which has been spun must be winded on the spindle, and this was considered a cloth, like a net or loop which captured man.&lt;ref&gt;"Easily known is the seed of that man for whom the son of Cronos spins the seed of good fortune at marriage and at birth." ([[Odyssey]], 4.208 ): 
[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]]. (1967). "Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion". C.F.Beck Verlag., München pp. 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

Invisible bonds and knots could be controlled from a loom, and twining was a magic art used by the magicians to harm a person, and control his individual fate.&lt;ref name=Nilsson114&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]]. (1967). "Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion". C.F.Beck Verlag., München pp. 114, 200&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar ideas appear in [[Norse mythology]],&lt;ref&gt;"If a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero. But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving. ":Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007): ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo.  P. 72 {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Greek folklore. The appearance of the gods and the Moirai may be related to the fairy tale motif, which is common in many [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] sagas and also in Greek folklore. The fairies appear beside the cradle of the newborn child and bring gifts to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]]. (1967). "Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion". C.F.Beck Verlag., München pp. 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple attendants may be considered representations of the Moirai, who belonged to the underworld, but secretly guided the lives of those in the upperworld. Their power could be sustained by witchcraft and oracles.&lt;ref name="Wunderlich290"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]] the Moirai at birth are accompanied by [[Eileithyia]]. At the birth of [[Hercules]]  they use together a magic art, to free the newborn from any "bonds" and  "knots".&lt;ref name=Nilsson114/&gt;

==The Homeric Moira==
[[File:AstraeaVSH.JPG|thumb|An 1886 bas-relief figure of [[Astraea (mythology)|Dike Astraea]] in the Old Supreme Court Chamber at the [[Vermont State House]].]]

Much of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] religion survived into [[classical Greece]], but it is not known to what extent Greek religious belief is Mycenean, nor how much is a product of the [[Greek Dark Ages]] or later. [[Moses I. Finley|M.Finley]] detected only few authentic Mycenean beliefs in the 8th-century [[Homeric]] world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses I. Finley|M.Finley]] (1978). ''The world of Odysseus''. p.124&lt;/ref&gt; The religion which later the Greeks considered [[Greeks|Hellenic]] embodies a paradox. Though the world is dominated by a divine power bestowed in different ways on men, nothing but "darkness" lay ahead. Life was frail and unsubstantial, and man was like "a shadow in a dream".&lt;ref&gt;"Man's life is a day. What is he, what is he not? A shadow in a dream is man.: [[Pindar]], ''Pythionikos'' VIII 95-7: C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience''. The World publishing company. Cleveland and New York.  p. 64 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Homeric]] poems the words ''moira'', ''aisa'', ''moros''  mean "portion, part". Originally they did not indicate a power which led destiny,  and must be considered to include the "ascertainment" or "proof". By extension ''Moira'' is the portion in glory, happiness,  mishappenings, death (μοίρα θανάτοιο: destiny of death)  which are unexpected events. The unexpected events were usually attributed to [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]s, who appeared in special occurrences. In that regard ''Moira'' was later considered an agent, like the daemon of Pre-Greek religion.&lt;ref name=Nilsson361&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]] (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, Vol I ''. C.F.Beck Verlag. München.  p.361-368&lt;/ref&gt;

People believed that their portion in destiny was something similar with their portion in booty, which was distributed according to their descent, and traditional rules. It was possible to get more than their ordained portion (moira), but they had to face severe consequences because their action was "over moira" (υπέρ μοίραν:over the portion). It may be considered that they "broke the order".  The most certain order in human lives is that every human should die, and this was determined by ''Aisa'' or ''Moira'' at the moment of birth.&lt;ref name=Ilias7.52/&gt; The [[Mycenae|Myceneans]] believed that what comes should come ([[fatalism]]), and this was considered rightly offered (according to [[destiny|fate]]: in order). If someone died in battle, he would exist like a shadow in the gloomy space of the underworld.&lt;ref name=Nilsson361/&gt;

The kingdom of ''Moira'' is the kingdom of the limit and the end. In a passage in ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Apollo]] tries three times to stop [[Patroclus]] in front of the walls of [[Troy]], warning him that it is "over his portion" to sack the city. Aisa (moira) seems to set a limit on the most vigorous men's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 16.705: "Draw back noble Patrolos, it is not your lot (aisa) to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor yet it will be that of Achilleus, who is far better than you are.": C.Castoriades (2004), ''Ce que fait La Grece. 1 D' Homere a Heraclite. La creation Humaine II ''. Edition du Seuils, Paris p.300&lt;/ref&gt;

Moira is a power acting in parallel with the gods, and even they could not change the destiny which was predetermined. In the [[Iliad]], [[Zeus]] knows that his dearest [[Sarpedon]] will be killed by [[Patroclus]], but he cannot save him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 16.433: "Ah, woe is me, for that it is fated that Sarpedon, dearest of men to me, be slain by Patroclus, son of Menoetius!  And in twofold wise is my heart divided in counsel as I ponder in my thought whether I shall snatch him up while yet he liveth and set him afar from the tearful war in the rich land of Lycia, or whether I shall slay him now beneath the hands of the son of Menoetius."&lt;/ref&gt; In the famous scene of [[Weighing of souls|Kerostasia]], [[Zeus]] the chief-deity of the [[Mycenae|Myceneans]] appears as the guider of destiny. Using a pair of scales he decides that [[Hector]] must die, according to his  ''aisa'' (destiny).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. V. |last=Morrison |title=Kerostasia, the Dictates of Fate, and the Will of Zeus in the Iliad |journal=Arethusa |volume=30 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=276–296 |doi=10.1353/are.1997.0008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision seems to be independent from his will, and is not related with any  "moral purpose". His attitude is explained by [[Achilleus]] to [[Priam]], in a parable of two jars at the door of Zeus, one of which contains good things, and the other evil. Zeus gives a mixture to some men, to others only evil and such are driven by hunger over the earth. This was the old  "heroic outlook".&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 24.527-33: C. M. Bowra (1957). ‘’The Greek experience’’. The World publishing company. Cleveland and New York.  p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The personification of  ''Moira''   appears in the newer parts of the epos. In ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is accompanied by the "Spinners",  the personifications of [[Destiny|Fate]], who do not have separate names.&lt;ref name=Oddysey7.198/&gt; Moira seems to spin the predetermined course of events. [[Agamemnon]] claims that 
he is not responsible for his arrogance. He took the prize of [[Achilleus]], because [[Zeus]] and Moira predetermined his decision.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 19.87:"Howbeit it is not I that am at fault, but Zeus and Fate (Moira) and Erinys, that walketh in darkness, seeing that in the midst of the place of gathering they cast upon my soul fierce blindness on that day, when of mine own arrogance I took from Achilles his prize."&lt;/ref&gt; In the last section of ''[[Iliad]]'', ''Moira'' is the  "mighty fate" (μοίρα κραταιά:moira krataia) who leads destiny and the course of events. [[Thetis]] the mother of [[Achilleus]] warns him that he will not live long because mighty fate stands hard by him, therefore he must give to [[Priam]] the corpse of [[Hector]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 24.131: "For I tell thee, thou shall not thyself be long in life, but even nowdoth death stand hard by thee and mighty fate (moira krataia)".&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Hector]]’s birth mighty fate predetermined that his corpse would be devoured by dogs after his death, and [[Hecuba|Hecabe]] is crying desperately asking for revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]]  24.209: On this wise for him did mighty fate spin with her thread at his birth, when myself did bear him, that he should glut swift-footed dogs far from his parents, in the abode of a violent man. "&lt;/ref&gt;

Hesiod introduces a moral purpose which is absent in the [[Homer]]ic poems. The Moirai represent a power to which even the gods have to conform. They give men at birth both evil and good moments, and they punish not only men but also gods for their sins.&lt;ref name=Hesiod221/&gt;

In the cosmogony of [[Alcman]] (7th century BC),  first came [[Thetis]] (Disposer, Creation), and then simultaneously [[Greek primordial deities|Poros]] (path) and [[Tekmor (mythology)|Tekmor]]  (end post, ordinance).&lt;ref&gt;τέκμωρ (Τekmor): fixed mark or boundary, end post, purpose  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dte%2Fkmar τέκμαρ],

Later in the [[Orphic]] cosmogony, first came [[Thetis|Thesis]] (Disposer), whose ineffable nature is unexpressed. [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (necessity) is the primeval goddess of inevitability who is entwined with the time-god [[Chronos]], at the very beginning of time. They represented the cosmic forces of Fate and Time, and they were called sometimes to control the fates of the gods. The three Moirai are daughters of Ananke.&lt;ref&gt;''Orphica.

==Mythology==
[[File:Sarcophagus Prometheus Louvre Ma339.jpg|thumb|[[Prometheus]] creates man. [[Clotho]] and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] besides [[Poseidon]] (with his trident), and presumably [[Atropos]] besides [[Artemis]] (with the moon crescent). [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[sarcophagus]], [[Louvre]].]]

The Moirai were supposed to appear three nights after a child's birth to determine the course of its life, as in the story of [[Meleager]] and the firebrand taken from the hearth and preserved by his mother to extend his life.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, story of Meleager in ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 1.65.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Karl Braswell from readings in the [[Hesychius of Alexandria|lexicon of Hesychius]], associates the appearance of the Moirai at the family ''hearth'' on the ''seventh'' day with the ancient Greek custom of waiting seven days after birth to decide whether to accept the infant into the Gens and to give it a name, cemented with a ritual at the hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braswell |first=Bruce Karl |title=Meleager and the Moirai: A Note on Ps.-Apollodorus 1. 65 |journal=Hermes |volume=119 |issue=4 |year=1991 |pages=488–489 |jstor=4476850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sparta]] the temple to the Moirai stood near the communal hearth of the ''[[polis]]'', as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] observed.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 3.11. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

As goddesses of birth who even prophesied the fate of the newly born, [[Eileithyia]], the ancient Minoan goddess of childbirth and divine midwifery, was their companion. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions an ancient role of Eileythia as "the clever spinner", relating her with destiny too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.21.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 8.21.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Their appearance indicate the Greek desire for health which was connected with the Greek cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' VII 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moirai assigned to the terrible [[chthonic]] goddesses [[Erinyes]] who inflicted the punishment for evil deeds their proper functions, and with them directed fate according to necessity. As goddesses of death they appeared together with the [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]s of death [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]] and the infernal Erinyes.&lt;ref name=Theoi.Moirai&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Moirai.html |title=Theoi Project Moirai |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lachesis (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|left|Bas relief of [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]. Base of a lampstand in front of the Supreme Court of the United States [[Washington, D.C.]].]]
In earlier times they were represented as only a few—perhaps only one—individual goddess. [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' (xxiv.209) speaks generally of the Moira, who spins the thread of life for men at their birth; she is ''Moira Krataia'' "powerful Moira" (xvi.334) or there are several Moirai (xxiv.49). In the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (vii.197) there is a reference to the ''Klôthes'', or Spinners. At Delphi, only the Fates of Birth and Death were revered.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1951:32.&lt;/ref&gt; In Athens, [[Aphrodite]], who had an earlier, pre-Olympic existence, was called ''[[Aphrodite Urania]]'' the "eldest of the Fates" according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (x.24.4).

&lt;!-- .There is not any reference for the Eteocretan text. 
A bilingual [[Eteocretan]] text&lt;ref&gt;The inscription, from the Delphinion in [[Dreros]], was published by Henri van Effenterre in ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique'' '''70''' (1946:602f); the original inscription has disappeared:  [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Eteocretan/Dreros2.html on-line text.]&lt;/ref&gt;  has the Greek translation Ομοσαι δαπερ Ενορκίοισι (''Omosai d-haper Enorkioisi'', "But may he swear [these] very things to the Oath-Keepers"). In [[Eteocretan]] this is rendered —&lt;small&gt;S|TUPRMĒRIĒIA&lt;/small&gt;, in which &lt;small&gt;MĒRIĒIA&lt;/small&gt; may refer to the divinities the Hellenes knew as the Moirai.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}--&gt;

Some Greek mythographers went so far as to claim that the Moirai were the daughters of [[Zeus]]—paired with [[Themis]] ("Fundament"),  as [[Hesiod]] had it in one passage.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'', 904.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the older myths they are daughters of primeval beings like [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] ("Night") in [[Theogony]],  or [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] ("Necessity") in [[Orphic]] cosmogony. Whether or not providing a father even for the Moirai was a symptom of how far Greek mythographers were willing to go, in order to modify the old myths to suit the [[patrilineal]] Olympic order,&lt;ref&gt;"Zeus obviously had to assimilate this spinning Goddess, and he made them into his daughters, too, although not by all accounts, for even he was bound ultimately by Fate", observe Ruck and Staples (1994:57).&lt;/ref&gt; the claim of a paternity was certainly not acceptable to [[Aeschylus]], [[Herodotus]], or [[Plato]].

Despite their forbidding reputation, the Moirai could be placated as goddesses. Brides in [[Athens]] offered them locks of hair, and women swore by them. They may have originated as birth goddesses and only later acquired their reputation as the agents of destiny.

According to the mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], in the [[Gigantomachy]], the war between the Giants and Olympians, the Moirai killed the Giants [[Agrios]] and [[Thoon (mythology)|Thoon]] with their bronze clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1–2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zeus and the Moirai==
[[File:Atropos.jpg|thumb|[[Bas relief]] of [[Atropos]] cutting the thread of life]]

In the [[Homeric]] poems [[Moira (fate)|Moira]], who is almost always one, is acting independently from the gods. Only [[Zeus]], the chief sky-deity of the [[Mycenean Greeks|Myceneans]] is close to Moira, and in a passage he is the being of this power.&lt;ref name=Nilsson361 /&gt; Using a [[weighing scale]] (balance) Zeus weighs [[Hector|Hector's]] "lot of death" ([[Keres (mythology)|Ker]]) against the one of [[Achilleus]]. Hector's lot weighs down, and he dies according to [[Fate]]. Zeus appears as the guider of destiny, who gives everyone the right portion.&lt;ref name=Nilsson217&gt;[[Ilias]] X 209 ff. O.Crusius Rl, Harisson ''Prolegomena'' 5.43 ff: [[Martin P. Nilsson|M. Nillson]] (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion. Vol I ''. C.F.Beck Verlag. München pp. 217, 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is similar to the famous scene in the [[Culture of Egypt|Egypt]]ian book of the dead, although the conception is different. [[Anubis]] weighs the sins of a man's heart against the feather of truth. If man's heart weighs down, then he is devoured by a monster: Taylor, John H. (Editor- 2009), ''Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead: Journey through the afterlife''. British Museum Press, London, 2010. pp. 209, 215 {{ISBN|978-0-7141-1993-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Mycenean vase, Zeus holds a [[weighing scale]]  (balance) in front of two warriors, indicating that he is measuring their destiny before the battle. The belief ([[fatalism]]) was that if they die in battle, they must die, and this was rightly offered (according to fate).&lt;ref&gt;M.P.Nilsson, "Zeus-Schiksalwaage ". ''Homer and Mycenea '' D 56. The same belief in [[Destiny|Kismet]]. Also the soldiers in the World-War believed that they wouldn't die by a bullet, unless their name was written on the bullet: [[Martin P. Nilsson|M. Nillson]] (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion. Vol I ''. C.F.Beck Verlag. München pp. 366, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Theogony]]'', the three ''Moirai'' are daughters of the primeval goddess, [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] ("Night"),&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], ''Handbook of Greek Mythology'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt; representing a power acting over the gods.&lt;ref name=Hesiod221/&gt; Later they are daughters of [[Zeus]] who gives them the greatest honour, and [[Themis]],  the ancient goddess of law and divine order.&lt;ref name="Finley78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery42"/&gt;

[[File:Clotho (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|Bas relief of [[Clotho]]. Base of a lampstand in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]]]
Even the gods feared the Moirai or [[Fate]]s, which according to [[Herodotus]] a god could not escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''Histories'' I 91&lt;/ref&gt; The Pythian priestess at [[Delphi]] once admitted, that [[Zeus]] was also subject to their power, though no classic writing clarifies as to what exact extent the lives of immortals were affected by the whims of the Fates.  It is to be expected that the relationship of Zeus and the Moirai was not immutable over the centuries. In either case in antiquity we can see a feeling towards a notion of an order to which even the gods have to conform. [[Simonides]] names this power [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (necessity) (the mother of the ''Moirai'' in [[Orphic]] cosmogony) and says that even the gods don't fight against it.&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz. Fr.420&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeschylus]] combines [[Fate]] and necessity in a scheme, and claims that even Zeus cannot alter which is ordained.&lt;ref name=Prometh.515/&gt;

A supposed epithet ''Zeus Moiragetes'', meaning "Zeus Leader of the Moirai" was inferred by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] from an inscription he saw in the 2nd century AD at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]: "As you go to the starting-point for the chariot-race there is an altar with an inscription ''to the Bringer of Fate.''&lt;ref&gt;The Greek is ''Moiragetes'' (Pausanias, 5.15.5).&lt;/ref&gt; This is plainly a surname of Zeus, who knows the affairs of men, all that the Fates give them, and all that is not destined for them."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, v.15.5.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Temple of Zeus at [[Megara]], Pausanias inferred from the relief sculptures he saw "Above the head of Zeus are the [[Horae|Horai]] and Moirai, and all may see that he is the only god obeyed by Moira." Pausanias' inferred assertion is unsupported in [[cult (religion)|cult practice]], though he noted a sanctuary of the Moirai there at Olympia (v.15.4), and also at [[Corinth]] (ii.4.7) and [[Sparta]] (iii.11.8), and adjoining the sanctuary of [[Themis]] outside a city gate of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;"There is a sanctuary of [[Themis]], with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a sanctuary of the Fates, while the third is of Zeus of the Market. Zeus is made of stone; the Fates have no images." (Pausanias, ix.25.4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and temples==
[[File:Schadow Grabmal Alexander 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The three '''Moirai'''. Relief, grave of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander von der Mark|de}} by [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]]. [[Alte Nationalgalerie|Old National Gallery]], [[Berlin]]]]

The fates had at least three known temples, in [[Ancient Corinth]], [[Sparta]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. At least the temple of Corinth contained statues of them: 
:"[On the Akropolis (Acropolis) of Korinthos (Corinth) :] The temple of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) and that of Demeter and Kore (Core) [Persephone] have images that are not exposed to view."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 4. 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple in Thebes was explicitly imageless:  
:"Along the road from the Neistan gate [at Thebes in Boiotia (Boeotia)] are three sanctuaries. There is a sanctuary of Themis, with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a sanctuary of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates), while the third is of Agoraios (Agoreus, of the Market) Zeus. Zeus is made of stone; the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) have no images."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 25. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple in Sparta was situated next to the grave of [[Orestes]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 11. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from actual temples, there was also altars to the Moirai. Among them was notably the altar in Olympia near the altar of Zeus Moiragetes,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 15. 5&lt;/ref&gt; a connection to Zeus which was also repeated in the images of the Moirai in the temple of Despoine in Arkadia&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 37. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Delphi, where they were depicted with Zeus Moiragetes (Guide of Fate) as well as with Apollon Moiragetes (Guide of Fate).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 10. 24. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
On Korkyra, the shrine of Apollo which was legendary founded by Medea was also a place on which offerings where made to the Moirai and the nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 1216 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The worship of the Moirai are described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] for their altar near Sicyon: 
:"On the direct road from Sikyon (Sicyon) to Phlios (Phlius) . . . At a distance along it, in my opinion, of twenty stades, to the left on the other side of the Asopos [river], is a grove of holm oaks and a temple of the goddesses named by the Athenians the Semnai (August), and by the Sikyonians the Eumenides (Kindly Ones). On one day in each year they celebrate a festival to them and offer sheep big with young as a burnt offering, and they are accustomed to use a libation of honey and water, and flowers instead of garlands. They practise similar rites at the altar of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates); it is in an open space in the grove."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 11. 3 - 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural parallels==

===Europe===
[[File:Nornorna spinner ödets trådar vid Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|The [[Norns]] spin the threads of [[Destiny|fate]] at the foot of [[Yggdrasil]], the tree of the world.]]

In [[Roman mythology]] the three Moirai are the [[Parcae|Parcae or Fata]], plural of "fatum" meaning prophetic declaration, oracle, or destiny. The English words [[fate]] (native [[wyrd]]) and [[fairy]] (magic, enchantment), are both derived from "fata", "fatum" .&lt;ref&gt;''Online Etymology Dictionary'': [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fate fate], [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fairy fairy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]] the [[Norns]] are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men, twining the thread of life. They set up the laws and decided on the lives of the children of men.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Voluspa]]'' 20: [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]]' translation for [[The American-Scandinavian Foundation]] with clickable names [http://cybersamurai.net/Mythology/nordic_gods/LegendsSagas/Edda/PoeticEdda/Voluspo.htm Völuspá] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718115311/http://cybersamurai.net/Mythology/nordic_gods/LegendsSagas/Edda/PoeticEdda/Voluspo.htm |date=2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their names were [[Urðr]], related with [[Wyrd]], weird ([[destiny|fate]]), [[Verðandi]],  and [[Skuld]], and it has often been inferred that they ruled over the past, present and future respectively, based on the sequence and partly the etymology of the names, of which the first two (literally 'Fate' and 'Becoming') are derived from the past and present stems of the verb ''verða'', "to be", respectively&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym Swedish Etymological dictionary ]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the name of the third one means 'Debt' or 'Guilt', originally 'That which must happen'.&lt;ref&gt;'' Online Etymology Dictionary'' [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shall shall]&lt;/ref&gt;

In younger legendary sagas, the Norns appear to have been synonymous with witches ([[Völva]]s), and they arrive at the birth of the hero to shape his destiny. It seems that originally all of them were [[Disir]], ghosts or deities associated with destruction and destiny. The notion that they were three may be due to a late influence from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebook (1913)/ Uggleupplagan.19.Mykenai-Newpada. [http://runeberg.org/nfbs/0792.html Nordisk Familjebook]&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to their (disputed) association with the past, present and future.

The [[Valkyries]] (choosers of the slain), were originally [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemons]] of death. They were female figures who decided who will die in battle, and brought their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain. They were also related with spinning, and one of them was named [[Skuld]] (debt, guilt).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson H.R. Ellis (1988). ''Myths and symbols in Pagan Europe. Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions''. Manchester University Press p. 58-61 {{ISBN|0-7190-2579-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be related to [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]], the daemons of death in Greek mythology, who accompanied the dead to the entrance of [[Hades]]. In the scene of [[Weighing of souls|Kerostasie]] Keres are the "lots of death", and in some cases Ker (destruction) has the same meaning, with Moira interpreted as "destiny of death" (''moira thanatoio'' :μοίρα θανάτοιο) .&lt;ref name=Hesiod221/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Keres (mythology)|Keres]], derived from the Greek verb ''kirainein'' (κηραίνειν) meaning "to be destroyed". Compare ''Kir'' (κηρ), "candle". M.Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p 218, 366&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] [[Matres]] and [[Matrones]], female deities almost entirely in a group of three, have been proposed as connected to the [[Norns]] and the [[Valkyries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Landow|title=Norse Mythology, a guide to the ghosts, heroes, rituals and beliefs|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=2001|ISBN=0-19-515382-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moirai were usually described as cold, remorseless and unfeeling, and depicted as old crones or hags. The independent ''spinster'' has always inspired fear rather than matrimony: "this sinister connotation we inherit from the spinning goddess," write Ruck and Staples (Ruck and Staples 1994:). See [[weaving (mythology)]].

[[File:Egypt dauingevekten.jpg|thumb|A section of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' written on papyrus showing the "Weighing of the Heart" in the [[Duat]] using the feather of [[Maat]] as the measure in balance.]]

The notion of a universal principle of natural order has been compared to similar ideas in other cultures, such as [[Asha|aša]], ([[Asha]]) in [[Avestan language|Avestan]] religion, [[Rta]] in [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], and [[Maat]] in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ramakrishna (1965:153–168), James (1969:35–36)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] religion and [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Asha|aša]], is commonly summarized in accord with its contextual implications of "truth", "right(eousness)", "order". [[Asha|Aša]] and its [[Vedic]] equivalent, [[Rta]], are both derived from a [[PIE]] root meaning "properly joined, right, true". The word is the proper name of the divinity [[Asha]], the personification of "Truth" and "Righteousness". ''Aša'' corresponds to an objective, material reality which embraces all of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1086/462470|last=Duchesne-Guillemin|first=Jacques|title=Heraclitus and Iran|journal=History of Religions|volume=3|issue=1|year=&lt;!--(Summer,--&gt;1963|pages=34–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cosmic force is imbued also with morality, as verbal Truth, and Righteousness, action conforming with the moral order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mary|last=Boyce|title=Zoroaster the Priest|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=University of London|location=London, England|volume=33|issue=1&lt;!-- In Honour of Sir Harold Bailey--&gt;|date=1970|pages=22–38|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00145100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the literature of the [[Mandeans]], an angelic being has the responsibility of weighing the souls of the deceased to determine their worthiness, using a set of scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Bunson|title=Angels A to Z|publisher=Crown Publishing|location=New York City|date=1996|ISBN=978-0517885376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Vedic religion, [[Rta]] is an ontological principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe. The term is now interpreted abstractly as "cosmic order", or simply as "truth",&lt;ref&gt;Mahony (1998:3).&lt;/ref&gt; although it was never abstract at the time.&lt;ref&gt;See the philological work of Own Barfield, e.g Poetic Diction or Speaker's Meaning&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that this idea originally arose in the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] period, from a con-sideration (so denoted to indicate the original meaning of communing with the star beings) of the qualities of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Oldenberg1894&gt;[[Hermann Oldenberg|Oldenberg, Hermann]] (1894). ''Die Religion des Veda''. Berlin: Verlag von Wilhelm Hertz.  Pp. 30,195–198&lt;/ref&gt;

The individuals fulfill their true natures when they follow the path set for them by the ordinances of ''Rta'', acting according to the [[Dharma]], which is related to social and moral spheres.&lt;ref name=Brown373&gt;Brown, W. N. (1992). "Some Ethical Concepts for the Modern World from Hindu and Indian Buddhist Tradition" in: Radhakrishnan, S. (Ed.) ''Rabindranath Tagore: A Centenary Volume 1861 – 1961''. Calcutta: Sahitya Akademi. {{ISBN|81-7201-332-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The god of the waters [[Varuna]] was probably originally conceived as the personalized aspect of the otherwise impersonal ''Ṛta''.&lt;ref&gt;Ramakrishna, G. (1965). "Origin and Growth of the Concept of ''Ṛta'' in Vedic Literature". Doctoral Dissertation: University of MysoreCf.&lt;/ref&gt; The gods are never portrayed as having command over ''Ṛta'', but instead they remain subject to it like all created beings.&lt;ref name=Brown373/&gt;

In [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]], [[maat]] was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian concept of [[truth]], balance, order, [[law]], [[morality]], and [[justice]]. The word is the proper name of the divinity [[Maat]], who was the goddess of harmony, justice, and truth represented as a young woman. It was considered that she set the order of the universe from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] at the moment of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Myths of Ancient Egypt, Robert A. Armour, American Univ in Cairo Press, p167, 2001, {{ISBN|977-424-669-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maat was the norm and basic values that formed the backdrop for the application of justice that had to be carried out in the spirit of truth and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Siegfried|last=Morenz|title=Egyptian Religion|translator-first=Ann E.|translator-last=Keep|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithica, New York|date=1992|ISBN=0-8014-8029-9|pages=117–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egyptian mythology]], Maat dealt with the weighing of souls that took place in the underworld. Her feather was the measure that determined whether the souls (considered to reside in the heart) of the departed would reach the paradise of afterlife successfully. In the famous scene of the [[Culture of Egypt|Egypt]]ian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', [[Anubis]], using a scale, weighs the sins of a man's heart against the feather of truth, which represents [[maat]]. If man's heart weighs down, then he is devoured by a monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=John H.|editor-last=Taylor|title=Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead: Journey through the afterlife|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London, England|date=2010|ISBN=978-0-7141-1989-2|pages=209, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Jazz Archive''' is a collection of materials pertaining to jazz and blues that is kept at the Loughton Library in Essex, England. The archive was founded by British trumpeter [[Digby Fairweather]] in 1998 and contains visual and print materials from the 1920s to the present.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Jazz Archive|url=https://www.nationaljazzarchive.co.uk/about|website=www.nationaljazzarchive.co.uk|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrons of the archive have included [[Baroness Amos]], [[John Altman (composer)|John Altman]], [[Liane Carroll]], [[Deirdre Cartwright]], [[Gary Crosby (bassist)|Gary Crosby]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Soweto Kinch]], [[Cleo Laine]], [[Michael Parkinson]], [[Courtney Pine]], [[John Prescott]], [[Clare Teal]], [[Kate Westbrook (musician)|Kate Westbrook]], and [[Mike Westbrook]].&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

In 2011 the Archive was awarded a grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. The grant enabled the cataloguing and digitisation of a substantial proportion of the collection, as well as a learning programme for schools and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dame Cleo Laine announces £346,300 for National Jazz Archive|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/news/Pages/GrantforNationalJazzArchive.aspx#.UW69icqRAlQ|publisher=Heritage Lottery Fund|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Jazz Archive is a registered charity and relies on support from donations and volunteers.

== Collections ==

The National Jazz Archive holds more than 3,000 reference books, specialist periodicals and bulletins. It also tells the story of jazz and blues in the UK through photographs, printed articles, memorabilia, artworks and personal papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornucopia: National Jazz Archive Collection Summary|url=http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/7474|publisher=Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA)|accessdate=17 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505150703/http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/7474|archivedate=5 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive has built up a collection of around 2,500 books on [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[popular music]] and [[dance]]. Books date from 1914 to recent publications on the subject of jazz. Rarities include two early books on jazz: R.W.S. Mendl's ''The Appeal of Jazz'' (1927) and Stanley R. Nelson's ''All About Jazz'' (1934). Duplicate books are distributed to library outreach partners at institutes of higher education throughout the UK. All books are available for visitors to browse.

The archive holds more than 600 journals dating from 1927 to the present. They reflect historical, cultural, social, and aesthetic developments in jazz. Although the archive holds an extensive collection of rare British journals, it also holds publications from around the world, including important titles from the US and Europe.

The '''''North American Environmental Atlas''''' is an interactive mapping tool created through a partnership of government agencies in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], along with the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]], a trilateral international organization created under the [[North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation]] (NAAEC). By "mapping [[North America]]'s shared environment", the Atlas depicts environmental issues from a continental perspective.

==Purpose==

The North American Environmental Atlas builds on information created, gathered, and harmonized by government [[scientist]]s and [[cartographer]]s from [[Natural Resources Canada]], the [[United States Geological Survey]], and Mexico's [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía]]. Each country's contributing team works closely with their partner agencies in the other countries to ensure seamless and harmonized data.

The Atlas provides a foundation to analyze the status of environmental conditions and identify significant trends across North America. It contains data on [[Drainage basin|watersheds]], terrestrial and marine [[ecoregions]] and protected areas, industrial [[pollution]], human impact, and base layers including transportation and waterways. The Commission for Environmental Cooperation uses these geospatial data  to  identify priority areas to conserve [[biodiversity]], track cross-border [[pollution]], monitor [[carbon emissions]] across major [[transportation]] routes, and predict the spread of [[invasive species]]

==Map Information==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Land Cover.jpg|thumb|alt=A sample map.|A map layer showing land cover for the year 2005]] --&gt;

Information included in the Atlas includes accurate, seamless [[map]]s, documentation, and [[geospatial]] data that crosses political [[borders]]. This data is displayed as series of interactive map layers in an easy to use map viewer format.

Most layers in the North American Environmental Atlas are at a [[scale (map)|scale]] of 1:1:10,000,000 or finer.

The variety of layers in the Atlas continues to expand in order to support analysis of environmental conditions. Increasingly, data are being made compatible with tools such as [[Google Earth]] and ArcGis On-line/Arc Explorer. The entire collection of maps, data, and downloadable files is available for free online at the [http://www.cec.org/naatlas CEC website].

The '''Charter of Paris for a New Europe''' (also known as the '''Paris Charter''') was adopted by a summit meeting of most [[Europe]]an governments in addition to those of [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], in [[Paris]] from 19–21 November 1990. The charter was established on the foundation of the [[Helsinki Accords]], and was further amended in the 1999 [[Charter for European Security]]. Together, these documents form the agreed basis for the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. However, not all OSCE member countries have signed the treaty.

The Charter was one of many attempts to seize the opportunity of the [[fall of Communism]] by actively inviting the former [[Eastern bloc]]-countries into the ideological framework of the West. It has been compared to the [[Conference of Versailles]] of 1919 or the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 in its grandiose ambition to reshape Europe{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. In effect, the Paris Summit was the [[peace conference]] of the [[Cold War]]: ''[[Perestroika]]'' had ultimately put an end to the ideological and political division of the [[Iron Curtain]]. Pluralist [[democracy]] and [[market economy]] were together with [[international law]] and [[multilateralism]] seen as the victors, and as the common values and principles of national and international conduct that now ruled from [[Vancouver]] to [[Vienna]] to [[Vladivostok]].

The Charter established an ''Office for Free Elections'' (later renamed [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]]) in [[Warsaw]], a ''Conflict Prevention Centre'' in Vienna, and a secretariat. Later, in 1992, a Secretary General was also appointed. It was agreed that the Foreign Ministers are to convene regularly for political consultations.

British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] attended the summit while undergoing a challenge to her leadership of the country's ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and it was while in Paris that she learned she had not obtained sufficient votes in the first round of the party's [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|leadership election]] to be declared the winner outright, necessitating a further round of voting. Thatcher later claimed that the fact she was in Paris and unable to begin immediately rallying support was one of the factors that led to her leaving the leadership election and resigning as party leader and Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Wielding the Knife |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03bk83y |access-date= |series=Thatcher: The Downing Street Years |series-link= |first= |last= |network=[[BBC Television]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=10 November 1993 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee was established along with the Council of Senior Scholars by royal decree on August 29, 1971 (8th of Rajab 1391 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]) by  [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal ibn Abd al-Aziz]] of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=Islamopedia&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120226104000/http://islamopediaonline.org/websites-institutions/permanent-committee-islamic-research-and-opinion-saudi-arabia Islamopedia: "Standing Committee for Scholarly Research and Issuing Fatwas, (Saudi Arabia)"] retrieved from archive.org March 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Under section four of the decree, it stated, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The Permanent Committee has been left the task of selecting its members from amongst the members of the Council (of Senior Scholars) in accordance with the Royal Decree. Its aim is to prepare research papers ready for discussion amongst the Council (of Senior Scholars), and issue fataawa on individual issues. This is by responding to the fatwa-seeking public in areas of 'aqeedah, 'ibaadah and social issues. It will be called: The Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and [[Fatwa|Fataawa]] (''al-Lajnah ad-Daa'imah lil-Buhooth al-'Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa''.)”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is possible to write to the Permanent Committee asking for a fatwa on a specific topic. Since its inception, the Permanent Committee has replied to Muslims not only in Saudi Arabia but in many other countries, seeking rulings in [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) on a variety of questions, including [[Hadeeth|Hadith]] (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad), [[Ibadah]] (worship), and [[Aqeedah]] (Islamic creed) issues. 

In their [[Fatwa|fataawa]], the Permanent Committee strive for thoroughness.  All fataawa are derived from evidence from the three sources of Islamic knowledge: the [[Qur'an]], authentic [[Sunnah]], and understanding of the rightly guided companions of the Prophet Muhammad. The fataawa writers will usually explain all the potential Islamic viewpoints of an issue and will then explain, which in their view is the most authentic opinion based on the evidence. The fatwas issued by the committee have been arranged in a compendium of 32 volumes.&lt;ref name=Islamopedia /&gt;

==Authority==
In 2010, Saudi [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] decreed that only officially approved religious scholars would be allowed to issue fatwas in Saudi Arabia, namely the 21 member [[Council of Senior Scholars (Saudi Arabia)|Council of Senior Scholars]], the country's highest religious body, and the (four or five)  member Permanent Committee, whose members are drawn from the Council of Senior Scholars.&lt;ref name=restriction&gt;[http://carnegieendowment.org/2010/10/27/saudi-fatwa-restrictions-and-state-clerical-relationship/6b81 Carnegie Endowment: "Saudi Fatwa Restrictions and the State-Clerical Relationship" by Christopher Boucek] October 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
A new committee affiliated with the Permanent Committee and headed by one Saleh bin Mohammed al-Luhaydan was created by the Council of Senior Scholars to supervise the issuance of fatwas and prevent unauthorized scholars from issuing any.  All imams and preachers were instructed by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs  to abide by the edict and explain it their Friday sermons and violators were reprimanded.&lt;ref name=restriction/&gt; 
In 2010, the Islamic fatwa website [[Islam-QA]] run by Saudi Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Al-Munajid]] was banned in [[Saudi Arabia]] due to the fact that it was issuing independent fatwas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/09/03/118350.html Al Arabiya: "Saudi Arabia blocks 'Islam Question and Answer'" (''in Arabic'')] September 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a fatwa purported to have been issued by Grand Mufti stating that [[Osama Bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] were following the correct path in their efforts to reestablish the Islamic [[caliphate]] was denounced by the committee as a fabricated lie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011021793958 Saudi Gazette: "Aal Al-Sheikh refutes fatwa misquoting senior Ulema"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314000338/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011021793958 |date=2014-03-14 }}| June 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aawsat.net/2011/02/article55247494 Asharq Al-Awsat: "Saudi Grand Mufti cries foul over fake fatwa"]| aawsat.net| February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A fatwa available in English on the government-run website of the committee reads, "Whoever refuses to follow the straight path deserves to be killed or enslaved" and "it will be known that the origin of slavery is the capturing in [[Jihad]] against the disbelievers to correct those who were captured by isolating them from the evil environment they lived in "&lt;ref&gt;[http://alifta.com/Fatawa/fatawacoeval.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=4661&amp;PageID=6286&amp;SectionID=7&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=6338&amp;MarkIndex=0&amp;0#WhydoesIslamnotprohibitslavery Fatwas of the Permanent Committee: "It is said: Why does Islam not prohibit slavery?"] Fatwa no. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}
  
In [[United States]] [[business law]], a '''registered [[agent (law)|agent]]''', also known as a '''resident agent'''&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Nevada Revised Statutes [http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-014.html#NRS014Sec020 § 14.020].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''statutory agent''',&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Ohio Revised Code [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/1701.07 § 1701.07].&lt;/ref&gt; is a business or individual designated to receive [[service of process]] (SOP) when a [[business entity]] is a party in a [[legal action]] such as a lawsuit or summons.&lt;ref name="Colley"&gt;{{cite book | title=Corporate Governance | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnK2o1GvEt0C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22registered+agent%22&amp;sig=RVc6ARalLRcqWlxGgnaV9BkoJWc| last=Colley| first=John L. | year=2003| publisher=McGraw–Hill Professional| isbn=0-07-140346-9| page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registered agent's address may also be where the state sends the paperwork for the periodic renewal of the business entity's charter (if required). The registered agent for a business entity may be an officer or employee of the company, or a third party, such as the organization's lawyer or a service company. Failure to properly maintain a registered agent can affect a company negatively.&lt;ref name="Colley" /&gt;

==The function of a registered agent==

Most businesses are not [[self-employed|individuals]] but instead [[business entity|business entities]] such as [[corporation]]s or [[Limited Liability Company|limited liability companies (LLCs)]]. This is because there are substantive (and substantial) liability protections as well as tax advantages to being "[[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]]" as opposed to being "[[self-employed]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Writing|first1=Alexis|title=What Are the Tax Benefits of Incorporating a Business?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/tax-benefits-incorporating-business-408.html|website=Small Business Chronicle|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most jurisdictions in the United States require that any business entity that is formed or doing business within their borders designate and maintain a "registered agent".&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Code of Virginia, Section 13.1-634; Pennsylvania law refers only to the "agent who maintains the registered office for the corporation", 15 Pa.Consol.Stat. §108(a), but this person is customarily referred to as the "agent".&lt;/ref&gt; This person may be known as the "resident agent"&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Code of Maryland, Corporations and Associations Article, Section § 2-108.&lt;/ref&gt; or "statutory agent",&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Arizona Revised Statutes, Section 10-501.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the laws of the individual jurisdiction in which the business entity is registered. The purpose of a registered agent is to provide a legal address (not a [[Post office box|P.O. Box]]) within that jurisdiction where there are persons available during normal business hours to facilitate [[service of process|legal service of process]] being served in the event of a [[legal action]] or [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', California Corporations Code, Section 1701.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the registered agent is also the person to whom the state government sends all official documents required each year for tax and legal purposes, such as [[franchise tax]] notices and [[annual report]] forms. It is the registered agent's job to forward these suit documents and notices to the entity itself.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', Code of Virginia, Section 13.1-634(B).&lt;/ref&gt; Registered agents generally will also notify business entities if their state government filing status is in "good standing" or not. The reason that these notifications are a desired function of a registered agent is that it is difficult for a business entity to keep track of legislative changes and report due dates for multiple jurisdictions given the disparate laws of different states.

Penalties for not maintaining a registered agent generally will cause a jurisdiction to revoke a business’s corporate or LLC legal status as well as in some cases, assess additional penalty fees on the entity.{{Citation needed|reason=This is true, however it should be cited|date=March 2014}}

If a registered agent fails to perform their function, it can have dire consequences for the business entity. For example, if a customer fell inside a store and sued the store, and the store's registered agent failed to notify the business entity of a summons to appear in court to respond to the lawsuit, then when the case went to trial, nobody would appear to defend the store and the customer would win by a [[default judgment]]. Additionally, the store would likely not be able to get the [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] overturned on appeal because they had been properly served. This is one of the most common reasons that business entities generally will utilize a third party as their registered agent be it a commercial service company, an attorney, or in some cases, a CPA.

The person at the [[business]] entity that maintains contact with the registered agent is the corporate secretary or governance officer.

==Who can perform the function of a registered agent==
Different states have different requirements for registered agents. Typically, the agent must be a natural person resident of the state in question or, in states that allow entities to serve as registered agents, an entity having a business office within the state and authorized to do business in the state.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', New Hampshire Revised Statutes [http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXVII/293-A/293-A-5.01.htm § 293-A:5.01](1)(i): "An individual who resides in this state . . . " or an entity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Virginia Code § 13.1-634.&lt;/ref&gt; In some states a [[business entity]] is legally allowed to act as its own registered agent, if at least one of its officers is a resident of the state, but other jurisdictions may require that a business entity designate a third party as its registered agent.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', D.C. Code Section 29-101.10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Because most states permit one business entity to serve as a registered agent for others, some businesses exist to serve that exact function, charging a fee to act as the registered agent for hundreds or thousands of businesses in a given state.

==Designating a registered agent==

In most all cases, the registered agent for a [[business entity]] is assigned in the formation documents filed in a jurisdiction when the entity is originally created.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Code of Maryland, Corporations and Associations Article, § 4A-204(a)(3) requires the articles of organization of a limited liability company to include "the name and address of its resident agent".&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person forming a corporation in the State of [[Nevada]] or [[Delaware]], would designate the registered agent along with the agent's address on the articles of incorporation filed with the [[Nevada Secretary of State]] or [[Delaware Secretary of State]] respectively. If the agent cannot sign the articles to be filed, some states such as [[Nevada]] provide that the registered agent may be designated using a separate "Registered Agent Acceptance" form with the appropriate acceptance and signature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nvsos.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=866 Example of "Registered Agent Acceptance" form (Nevada)]&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the business or the individual accepting responsibility as registered agent must sign to accept the responsibility of acting as agent. In most states it is a crime to knowingly file a false document with the office of the [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]], although the penalties vary widely. For example, in Nevada it is a Class "D" [[felony]] to forge this signature, but in [[Michigan]] it is only a [[misdemeanor]].

==Changing a registered agent==

For varying reasons a business entity might at some point wish to change their registered agent to another party after a registered agent has already been designated. This is accomplished by obtaining a form from the secretary of state where the business entity is registered, completing said form, and filing it with that state office along with any requisite fees which may vary from state to state. In some cases the required form may simply be a dedicated change of registered agent form, and in other cases, such as in Delaware, an actual amendment to the articles of the business entity must be filed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corp.delaware.gov/faqs.shtml#coa Delaware Change of Agent FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registered agent information==

Information about persons or entities that may be willing to act as registered agents/resident agents by state is usually maintained by the respective [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]]. Most states also offer free access to their databases to find a business entity's registered agent.

==Model Registered Agents Act==

The ''Model Registered Agents Act'' (MoRAA) is an effort spearheaded by the [[American Bar Association]] Business Law Section and the International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA) – Business Organization Section (BOS) to standardize [[business entity]] laws as they relate to annual reports, registered agents and other laws and forms used to file business entities.&lt;ref name="Model RA Act"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Registered%20Agents%20Act,%20Model%20(2006)%20(Last%20Amended%202011)|title=Model Registered Agents Act (2006) (Last Amended 2011)|accessdate=2018-04-11|publisher=Uniform Law Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also creates two distinct classes of registered agent: "commercial" and "non-commercial." The National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) organized a drafting committee composed of commissions, ABA, and IACA representatives who drafted the act's language. NCCUSL adopted MoRAA at its 2006 annual meeting. It was amended in 2011.[http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Registered%20Agents%20Act,%20Model%20(2006)%20(Last%20Amended%202011)] Eleven US jurisdictions (Arkansas, District of Columbia, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) have since adopted the model act, and Delaware did not adopt the act, but did adopt the "commercial registered agent" provision.&lt;ref name=Adoption&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Registered Agents Act - Technical Challenges of Implementation|url=http://www.iaca.org/iaca/wp-content/uploads/01_ITS_MORAA_NCR.pdf|publisher=International Association of Commercial Administrators|accessdate=2014-03-03|author=International Association of Commercial Administrators|pages=4–5|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem this effort seeks to alleviate is that disparate laws, filing requirements, and forms in all of the US jurisdictions where business entities are filed creates a quagmire for any company seeking to register to do business in those jurisdictions. By adopting a common set of laws, the Model Registered Agents Act seeks to create a uniform and simple process of filing and maintaining a business entity in any jurisdiction adopting it.

==Government listings==

Some state business entity laws name the Secretary of State's office or business entity filing office as the registered agent of last resort, in the event the named registered agent can't be found. By law, service may be made on the office if the entities registered agent can not be found. However, the plaintiff must demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to service the registered agent before it may serve the Secretary of State. The state laws vary in how to complete service on the Secretary of State and the amount of fees charged. Some of the states that may have this statutory provision are listed below. MoRAA eliminated this provision but some of the states that adopted MoRAA maintained this provision.

The tricycle's wheel diameter was {{Convert|5.18|m}} and the length was {{Convert|11.37|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-tricycle | title=Largest tricycle | publisher=Guinness World Records | date=16 August 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCrecord"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34464790 | title=India man eyes record with 26-foot-high car | work=BBC | date=7 October 2015 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yadav and his museum are mentioned in the ''[[Limca Book of Records]]'' and have also been featured on ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''&lt;ref name="NewsMinute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/lives/496 | title=India's own version of Ripley's Believe It or Not; this car museum in Hyderabad has it all! | work=[[The News Minute]] | date=21 March 2015 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All the exhibits of the museum accompany a plaque giving information of the make of the car, the time it took to manufacture and the maximum speed it can attain. The museum also has the smallest double decker bus in the world which can accommodate 10 people. Twelve different motor cycles in small size are on display of which the smallest is {{Convert|33|cm}} in height and can be driven at the speed of {{Convert|30|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="NewsMinute"/&gt;

Yadav stated that some of the cars are created keeping special occasions in mind. For [[International Women's Day|Women's Day]], he designed a car shaped like a [[handbag]] and [[stiletto]] that was powered by a 6cc engine. For [[Bal Diwas]] (Children's Day), he designed cars based on a [[pen]], [[pencil]] and [[Pencil sharpener|sharpener]]. A [[condom]] shaped car was unveiled to commemorate [[World AIDS Day]].&lt;ref name="causecraftscar"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cause crafts car |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/from-social-work-to-plain-creativity-representational-automobile-design-spans-a-wide-range/article6419538.ece |first=Prince |last=Frederick |date=26 September 2014 |work=[[The Hindu]] |location=Chennai |accessdate=16 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homemade cars cost around {{GBP}}1,000{{endash}}{{GBP}}1,800 (₹85,000{{endash}}₹150,000) for manufacturing; but are not for sale.

[[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] are different sects of [[Islam]] and the difference of opinions have resulted in many [[Fatwa]]s, non-binding but authoritative [[legal opinion]] or learned interpretation issues pertaining to the [[Islamic law]]. Fatwas are based on the question and answer process found in the Quran, which seeks to enlighten on theological and philosophical issues, [[hadith]], legal theory, duties, and the [[Sharia|Sharia law.]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=U.S. Conflicts in the 21st Century: Afghanistan War, Iraq War, and the War on Terror: Afghanistan War, Iraq War, and the War on Terror|last=Tucker|first=Spencer|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2015|isbn=9781440838798|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of difference==
While all [[Islamic schools and branches|sects]] of [[Islam]] recognise the [[Qur'an]], they differ in which other authorities they acknowledge; in particular the question of the [[Succession to Muhammad]] separates the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], who acknowledge the elected [[Rashidun]] [[Caliph]]s and their descendants, from the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who acknowledge the [[Imam]]s or descendants of Prophet [[Muhammad]]; these two branches are then subdivided by their views on the further course of the succession. [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[fiqh]] differs with [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[fiqh]] on not only political issues, but also important theological issues. Various attitudes towards Shias can be found among the worldwide majority Sunni community.

==Opinions==
The Sunni fatwas on Shias often involved legal opinions issued by an expert in the Sharia law. However, modern fatwas were also given by other Muslim authorities and these were recognized as long as they cite the legal sources used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the notable fatwas are listed below:

===Negative===
===Ibn Abidin===
However, major Sunni scholars have declared the unbelief of Shias who hold certain beliefs. For example, Imam [[ibn Abidin]], a source of authoritative fatwas for [[Hanafi]]s writes:&lt;ref&gt;Are Shi'as considered Muslims?: http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=1898&amp;CATE=164 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805090802/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=1898&amp;CATE=164 |date=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is no doubt in the disbelief (kufr) of those that falsely accuse [[Aisha|Sayyida Aisha]] (Allah be pleased with her) of adultery, deny the Companionship of [[Abu Bakr|Sayyiduna Abu Bakr]] ( Allah be pleased with him), believe that [[Ali|Sayyiduna Ali]] (Allah be pleased with him) was an Imam... even if they believe in Allah, the last Prophet, and the perfection of the Quran (Radd al-Muhtar, 4/453).}}

===Ahmad Raza===
According to Imam [[Ahmad Raza]], the founder of the [[Barelwi]]-movement, most Shiites of his day were apostates because they repudiated necessities of religion. This includes, according to him, the following:&lt;ref&gt;Fatwa on Sunni marriage with shia: http://www.islamic.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Fiqh/Sunni%20marriage%20with%20Shia.htm{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
a) to believe that [[Shia view of the Quran|Qur'an is incomplete]].

b) to call it 'book of `Uthman'.

c) elevate sayyiduna `ali karram Allâhu wajhah and other imâms above the prophets .

d) if these imâms are held to be higher than even one prophet .

e) to allege that Allâh  was regretful after issuing a command and hence remorsefully, changed His earlier ruling.

f) to allege that Allâh didn't realize the wisdom of a certain ruling (or the lack of it) and when He realized it, [[Bada'|He changed the rule]].

g) to allege that RasûlAllâh  practised [[Taqiya|taqiyyah]] in the course of his tabligh.

Those who hold the above and other such statements that amount to disbelief are kâfirs by ijmâ`a. All dealings with them are similar to those with apostates. it is in Fatâwâ Dhahîriyyah, Fatâwâ hindiyyah, Hadiqatun Nadiyyah: [aHkâmuhum aHkâm al-murtaddîn] they are to be dealt with as apostates.}}

Other Sunni and Salafi scholars who have declared Shiites as deviants or apostates:

#[[Ibn Hazm]] &amp;mdash; ''"Shia are not even Muslims"'', when [[Christian]]s debating him brought a Shia book as reference.&lt;ref&gt;See ''al-Millal wa al-Nahl'' الفصل في الملل والنحل 2/213&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Ibn Taymiya]] — He considered Shiites more heretical than Jews, Christians and many polytheists. Noting contemporary circumstances, he considered Shiites more harmful to the Muslim community than groups such as the Crusaders and Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=V. G. Julie Rajan|title=Al Qaeda’s Global Crisis: The Islamic State, Takfir and the Genocide of Muslims|date=30 Jan 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317645382|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Ibn Khaldoun]] &amp;mdash; ''"astray people"'', ''"Shia are the source of all deviant groups in Islam history"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_25.htm Shi'ah tenets concerning the question of the imamate.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Nizam al-Mulk]] — where he fully attacks the [[Rafida]].&lt;ref&gt;See his book [[Siyasatnama]], chap 41.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are reports that says that he and Malik Shah I after a debate between Sunni and Shi'a scholars which was prepared by him by the orders of Malik Shah I resulted in converting both him and the king to the Shi'a Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mughatil ibn Bakri]], ''In search of Truth in Baghdad'' (در جستجوی حق در بغداد), also appearing under the title "راهي به سوي حقيقت", {{ISBN|964-93287-8-5}}, p.134-136. Link to item in publisher's catalog: [http://www.iran-books.com/Book/detail.asp?key=5-8-93287-964]&lt;/ref&gt; The story is reported by the son-in-law of Nizam al-Mulk, [[Mughatil ibn Bakri]] who attended the debate.
#[[Manzur Nu'mani]] — issued a fatwa in December 1987 declaring Shia kuffar (non-believers), which was endorsed by hundreds of prominent [[Deobandi]] scholars in India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muhammad Moj|title=The Deoband Madrassah Movement: Countercultural Trends and Tendencies|date=1 Mar 2015|publisher=Anthem Press|location=Appendix I: The Deobandi Stance vis-a-vis Muslim Groups Other Than The Barelwis: B. The DMM on Shia Muslims: iii. Changes in the Quran|isbn=9781783084463}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]] — Several of his fatwas denounced Shiites as atheists and apostates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vali Nasr|title=The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future|date=17 Apr 2007|publisher=W. W.

#[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] — After saying he had previously been misguided to pursue Sunni-Shia rapprochement, Qaradawi went on to condemn Shiites as heretics in several fatwas and praised virulently anti-Shia Saudi [[Wahhabi]] clerics for being “more mature and far-sighted” than himself in generally judging Shias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hassan Hassan|title=Hatred, violence and the sad demise of Yusuf Al Qaradawi|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/hatred-violence-and-the-sad-demise-of-yusuf-al-qaradawi#full|accessdate=28 April 2015|work=The National|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE GULF AND SECTARIANISM|url=http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR91_GULF_ANALYSIS_AW.pdf|publisher=European Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=28 April 2015|pages=3, 11|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Ehsan Elahi Zaheer]] — Denounced the Shia as infidels and [[Zionist]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moghadam|editor1-first=Assaf|title=Militancy and Political Violence in Shiism: Trends and Patterns|date=21 Jul 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136663536|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Abdul-Rahman al-Barrak]] — In a "vicious" fatwa against the Shia he concluded with: "the Sunni and Shia ''mathhabs'' (beliefs) are completely contradictory and cannot be reconciled; the talk of Sunni-Shia rapprochement is utterly false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Emile Nakhleh|title=A Necessary Engagement: Reinventing America's Relations with the Muslim World|date=29 Dec 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400829989|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Abu Basir al-Tartusi]] — In his fatwa against Shia, he warned Muslims to "Interact with the Shii [[Rafida|Rejectionists]] as you would with a person whose very existence is full of betrayal, treachery, fury and hatred against Islam and Muslims!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=V. G. Julie Rajan|title=Al Qaeda’s Global Crisis: The Islamic State, Takfir and the Genocide of Muslims|date=30 Jan 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317645382|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Ali al-Khudair]] — In his ''Fatwa fi l-Shi'a'', he says: "What we have today are the Rafidis [i.e., [[Twelver]]s], the [[Batiniyya|Batini]] [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ilis]], the Batini [[Alawites|Nusayris]], and the Batini [[Druze|Duruz]]. These four groups are the ones who deify the [[Ahl al-Bayt|Al al-Bayt]] [i.e., the family and descendants of the Prophet Muhammed], they seek their intercession and are the worshippers of graves (quburiyyun). So these [people] are infidel polytheists (mushrikun kuffar) and are not Muslims. There is no difference [in status] between their scholars and followers (muqallidihim) or the ignorant among them (juhhalihim). They are all polytheists and are not Muslims and cannot be excused for their claim to be ignorant that they are worshipping other than God (la yu'dharan bi-l-jahl fi 'ibadati-him li-ghayr allah)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=V. G. Julie Rajan|title=Al Qaeda’s Global Crisis: The Islamic State, Takfir and the Genocide of Muslims|date=30 Jan 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317645382|pages=121–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Imam [[Ash-Sha'bi]] — "The Rafida are the Jews of this nation. They hate Islam as the Jews hate Christianity. They embraced Islam, not because they longed for it or because they feared Allah, but because they detested the Muslims and intended to overpower them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Israel Friedlaender|title=The Heterodoxies of the Shiites in the Presentation of Ibn Hazm|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1908|volume=29|page=19|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/fantastic/TheHeterodoxies.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015|publisher=American Oriental Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] — In one of his fatwas he accused Shiites of shirk (polytheism) because of their cult of the saints, which included the adoration of figures such as Ali and Husayn and the veneration of tombs and shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nabil Mouline|title=The Clerics of Islam: Religious Authority and Political Power in Saudi Arabia|date=1 Jul 2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300178906|page=70|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Lacey|title=Inside the Kingdom|date=30 Jun 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781446472361|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Shah Waliullah Dehlawi]] — He believed that the Shia interpretation and practices of Islam should be discarded, since they greatly misguide people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Saifudheen Kunju|title=SHAH WALIULLAH AL-DEHLAWI: THOUGHTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS|url=https://www.academia.edu/592790/SHAH_WALIULLAH_AL-DEHLAWI_THOUGHTS_AND_CONTRIBUTIONS|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are Sunni fatwas that were considered Sunni obligation to the "insult offered to the Sunni faith by the Shia religious literature."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al Qaeda’s Global Crisis: The Islamic State, Takfir and the Genocide of Muslims|last=Rajan|first=V.G. Julie|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138789975|location=London|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is demonstrated in the case of some Sunni fatwas issued in Pakistan, which were considered as defensive materials created for the purpose of defending the faith from the Shia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The latter's mere existence in the country within the context of these specific fatwas was considered as an insult.

===Other opinions===
In 1959, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mahmood Shaltoot [[Al-Azhar Shia Fatwa|issued fatwa]] that Shia theology is a part of Islam. In 2016, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]] reissued Shaltoot's fatwa on Shia Muslims, calling Shia the fifth school of Islam and seeing no problem with conversions from Sunni to Shia Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijtihadnet.com/fatwa-al-azhars-grand-imam-shia/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, both Sunni and Shia scholars released the so-called [[Amman Message|2004 Amman Message]], which established some form of standards to prevent or at least discredit and counter renegade interpretations such as those made by [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shariah: What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Esposito|first=John|last2=DeLong-Bas|first2=Natana|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780199325054|location=Oxford|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative outlined who are qualified to issue fatwas or legal opinions, promoting a more conservative framework over progressive interpretations. The Amman Message also asserted the common beliefs of the two Islamic sects.

Shaykh [[Faraz Rabbani]] has noted that it is not the way of Sunnis to make blanket [[takfir]] of Shias. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;Sunnipath's stance on Shia: http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=13662&amp;CATE=1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301195217/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=13662&amp;CATE=1 |date=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...we only declare someone who denies something necessarily known of the religion to be a kafir--and this is not the case with common Shias. Someone who says 'There is no God but Allah, Mohammed is the Prophet of Allah' is a Muslim. Shia Muslims, who make this declaration of faith are therefore MUSLIM.}}

'''Tate St Ives''' is an [[art gallery]] in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], Cornwall, England, exhibiting work by modern British artists with links to the St Ives area. The Tate also took over management of another museum in the town, the [[Barbara Hepworth Museum|Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden]], in 1980.

The Tate St Ives was built between 1988 and 1993 on the site of an old gasworks, it now receives around 210,000 visitors each year. In 2015, it received funding for an expansion, doubling the size of the gallery, and closed in October 2015 for refurbishment. The gallery re-opened in October 2017.

== History ==
In 1980, [[Tate]] group started to manage the [[Barbara Hepworth Museum|Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden]], dedicated to a St Ives artist closely linked with [[Henry Moore]]. The group decided to open a museum in the town, to showcase local artists, especially those already held in their collection.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/who-we-are/history-of-tate#stives|website=Tate|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the group purchased a former gas works and commissioned architects [[Evans and Shalev|Eldred Evans and David Shalev]], to design a building for the gallery in a similar style to the gas works. The building included a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] at the centre of the gallery, looking over [[Porthmeor Beach]] and was completed in 1993. The gallery opened in June 1993, the second of the Tate's regional galleries after [[Tate Liverpool]], receiving more than 120,000 visitors before the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

The '''Golden Letter''' is a manuscript written on rolled [[gold]] in the [[Burmese language]], which was sent on 7 May 1756  by King [[Alaungpaya]] of [[Burma]] to the King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] of Great Britain in [[London]]. It is now preserved at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library in [[Hanover]].&lt;ref name="LeiderKing7"&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the Golden Letter was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.unesco.de/kommunikation/2015/weltdokumentenerbe-2015.html Fünf deutsche Neueinträge im „Memory of the World“-Register]'' (in German), unesco.de&lt;/ref&gt; as a common heritage of Myanmar, Germany, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Letter of the Burmese King Alaungphaya to King George II of Great Britain|publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-golden-letter-of-the-burmese-king-alaungphaya-to-king-george-ii-of-great-britain/|accessdate=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Pyinoolwin_--_DSA_Alaungpaya.JPG|thumb|King Alaungpaya of Burma]]
[[File:George_II_1755-1767.jpg|thumb|George II of Great Britain]]
King [[Alaungpaya]] of Burma was one of the most influential rulers of his time in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Ruppelt, Jacques Leider: ''The Golden Letter from King Alaungphaya …'', pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuppeltLeider11"&gt;Georg Ruppelt, Jacques Leider: ''The Golden Letter from King Alaungphaya …'', pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, the British [[East India Company]] (EIC), founded in 1600, had established itself in India and was building up its economic and political influence. On the "tenth day of the waxing Moon in the [Burmese] month Kason of the Sakkaraj-year 1118" (7 May 1756 in the Gregorian calendar),&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaungpaya directed that four letters be drawn up by his chancery. One letter – the golden and thus the most important – was addressed to the British king, George II. The second was addressed to the director of the East India Company, the third to the British [[President of Madras]], and the fourth to the headmaster of the island [[Negrais]] in the [[Irrawaddy River]] delta.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pp. 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretation of their contents,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaungpaya had all the letters, which differed in both content and style depending on their respective recipients,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; already be translated in [[Rangoon]], and sent these translations together with the originals. At the headquarters of the East India Company in London, the receipt of the letter was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Golden Letter, Alaungpaya offered to George II that the longstanding trade relationship between their countries be expanded. Among other things, this could be done by having the East India Company set up a fortified trading post at the harbor city [[Pathein]] on the southwestern coast of Burma. At the time of the letter's composition, the Company had only a minor outpost on the small island of Negrais. This was far away from trading routes, had no infrastructure to support it, and lay in an unhealthy climatic zone.&lt;ref name="RuppeltLeider9"&gt;Georg Ruppelt, Jacques Leider: ''The Golden Letter from King Alaungphaya …'', pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that one king wrote to another to make such an offer in the form of a costly, artfully produced and decorated letter made from gold, showed on the one hand the importance and value of the offer, and on the other hand the generosity of this gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides stood to profit: the sender could project his reputation externally, and burnish his own internal power. The recipient could further his economic strategy against the competition from the [[French East India Company]] (''Compagnie française des Indes orientales'').

The recipient of the Golden Letter was George II, who was born in Hanover and belonged to the [[House of Welf]]. He was simultaneously the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|King of Great Britain]] and the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], joining these territories in [[personal union]]. The letter was next sent to Madras, where there were various delays causing it to arrive in London only in March 1758, almost two years after it was first sent.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the almost two-year delay could be the [[Seven Years' War]], which broke out in 1756, the year that the letter was written. Great Britain was directly involved in the war. Alaungpaya sent the Golden Letter to George II together with another letter addressed to the directors of the East India Company. Both recipients, however, understood neither the contents nor the significance of the message, and therefore saw no reason to respond in a diplomatically measured manner. This initiative of the Burmese ruler was seen more as a curiosity, than as a serious political move by a less-powerful state. Alaungpaya not only received no reply to his offer, but had no acknowledgement that the letters had even arrived at their destinations. It is known that he saw this disregard for him as a serious insult.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

George II sent the letter, considered to be a curiosity, to the library in his home city of Hanover, where it arrived three weeks later, albeit with an incorrect description.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The error was due to Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen, who was a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] to George II.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek: Historische Akten der Bibliothek V15, f 29, cited in ''Nomination form: International Memory of the World Register. The Golden Letter of the Burmese King Alaungphaya to King George II of Great Britain.'' pg. 3, footnote 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Münchhausen described it, in a ministerial letter to the librarian at Hannover, Christian Ludwig Scheidt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://der-goldene-brief.gwlb.de/uploads/pics/V15_S29r_frei.jpg Image of the ministerial letter of 28 March 1758 from Münchhausen to Scheidt]&lt;/ref&gt; as a diplomatic note in "Indian" (i.e. [[Sanskrit]]) from an Indian prince of the [[Coromandel Coast]], whose religion forbade him from eating anything living and who worshipped fire.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus was the letter archived. For the next 248 years, apart from an incident in 1768, the Golden Letter received no more attention. On 11 June 1768, the Danish prince (later King) [[Christian VII]] arrived in Hanover on his [[Grand Tour]], where the Letter was shown to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://der-goldene-brief.gwlb.de/typo3temp/pics/Bodemann_Eintrag_GoldenerBrief1-2_4a9fac0939.jpg Entry in the Bodemann Catalogue under Nr. 571a, pg. 98f.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he accidentally damaged it.&lt;ref name="LeiderKing7" /&gt; This damage is still visible today. The letter returned to obscurity. In 1867, Eduard Bodemann copied the erroneous description of the letter for his [[Library catalog|catalog]] of the "Royal Library at Hanover" under the shelf mark "IV 571 a".

Although the Golden Letter was known to have existed, and transcripts could be found in various archives, until its "rediscovery" in 2006, it was unknown where the original was or whether it even still existed. Only after this rediscovery was the text translated, and its true significance recognized. In February 2013, the Golden Letter was registered in the German list of national cultural treasures, under the law for cultural protection (''Kulturschutzgesetz'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/germany_uk_germany_golden_letter_eng.pdf|title=Nomination form International Memory of the World Register – The Golden Letter of the Burmese King Alaungphaya to King George II of Great Britain|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Description ===

==== Material ====
[[File:Goldener_Brief_Hamsa_Rubine_(Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz_Bibliothek).jpg|thumb|The mythical bird Hamsa, sign of Alaungpaya.]]
The rectangular letter measures 54.7 by 8.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and is 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Including the 24 rubies, its total weight is 100 g.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Spectroscopic analysis by the Lower Saxony State Office for the Protection of Historical Monuments (''Niedersächsichen Landesamt für Denkmalpflege'') found its [[fineness]] to be between 95.25 and 98.69%. The 24 egg-shaped rubies originate from a mine in the region of the Burmese city [[Mogok]]. Each ruby is held in a hexagonal setting of gold, measuring 6 by 6&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="LeiderKing103"&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ornamentation ====
The thin gold layer is bordered on both right and left sides of the text by two vertical rows of twelve rubies each. On the left edge is an [[Repoussé and chasing|embossed]] figure of the mythical bird Hamsa, the king's signet, in an octagonal, richly decorated field. The signet figure was pressed onto the letter.

==== Text ====
The text of the letter runs from left to right. It is finely engraved in Burmese script in ten lines of equal length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://der-goldene-brief.gwlb.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/GoldenerBrief/Birmanische_Fassung.pdf|title=[Transcript of the Burmese Golden Letter from King Alaungpaya to King George II, 1756]|last=|first=|date=|website=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Containers ====
[[File:Goldener_Brief_Stosszahn_(Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz_Bibliothek).jpg|thumb|The only surviving container used to transport the letter, a hollowed-out and ornamented elephant tusk.]]
The packaging of this valuable document for delivery was chosen to be artistically lavish and expensive, as well as robust for the long journey. The Letter was originally rolled in red paper and then stored in a cylindrical ivory container. This lidded container was especially made from a hollowed-out and decorated [[tusk]] of a Burmese elephant (''[[Asian elephant|Elephas maximus indicus]]''). Only some of the ornamentation can be recognized today. The container was itself placed in a kind of pouch made from [[brocade]]. This was itself inside a [[casket]] of polished wood, varnished with red [[resin]] and ornamented with gold. Attached to the casket was a piece of paper with the text in English. For protection, all these containers were further stowed in a robust red pouch while en route to London. Aside from the ivory cylinder, nothing remains of the other containers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Forgotten" and rediscovered ===
Due to the entry in the Bodemann Catalogue under the [[Accession number (library science)|shelf mark]] "Ms IV 571a", the existence of the Letter was always known within the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library (GWLB) and to researchers, not least because of transcripts in various archives. However, because of the erroneous description, the original received almost no attention for 250 years. In July 2005, Friedrich Hülsmann, the director of the Book- and Library-Systems department at the GWLB, invited Jacques Leider, a [[Luxembourg]]-born historian and Southeast Asia expert at the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] in Paris, to help with identifying the document. Until this time, it was thought to be a Sanskrit document because of the catalogue entry. At the first examination, Leider already determined that it was written in Burmese, and that its meaning had been completely misunderstood until then.

=== Research ===
Jacques Leider was tasked in 2007 by the GWLB to research on the history of the Golden Letter. In addition to researching the history of the Letter and its "fate" in London, Leider translated the text and compared the original with other versions that exist as transcriptions in archives, e.g. in Myanmar. He published his results in 2009 in an extensive report.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques P. Leider: ''King Alaungmintaya’s Golden Letter to King George II …'', pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the German [[Federal Foreign Office]] sponsored the [[Digitization|3D-digitization]] of the Letter through its cultural programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/KulturDialog/Kulturerhalt/Myanmar-GoldenerBrief_node.html|title=Myanmar: Der Goldene Brief als Digitalscan|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Auswärtiges Amt (Federal Foreign Office, Germany)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010212242/http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/KulturDialog/Kulturerhalt/Myanmar-GoldenerBrief_node.html|archive-date=10 October 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Significance ===
The choice of material and the quality of the handiwork are indicators of the status that the author attached to the contents of the Golden Letter and its recipient - and also to himself. The Letter could be the only example of its kind in the world today. That Great Britain, in the person of George II, was so uninterested in cooperating with Burma, could be put down to the geopolitical situation of the time. From 1756, Britain and other European states were involved in the [[Seven Years' War]]. It fought against several European states on different continents, and also in North America. Even the duchy of Hanover was involved on the British side in this conflict. Due to the years of conflicts, the East India Company withdrew from Burma and showed little interest in expanding its engagement there. Eventually, this together with many ill-advised political and military actions by Britain caused Alaungpaya to destroy the outpost on Negrais in the Irrawaddy Delta, which broke relations between the two states for decades.

The document also allowed a reassessment of the legacy of Alaungpaya, whose role was often oversimplified to that of a warrior, neglecting his actions in geopolitics and as a skilled international diplomat.

Against this background, the Golden Letter of Alaungpaya is not only a unique artefact of [[art history]], but also a window into the contemporary geopolitical relationship between Great Britain (and the East India Company in particular) and a resurgent Kingdom of Burma.

=== UNESCO Memory of the World Register ===
In 2014, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library, the [[Ministry of Culture (Myanmar)|Myanmar Ministry for Culture]], and the [[British Library]] sent their nomination of the Golden Letter as a documentary heritage to [[UNESCO]] for inclusion in the [[Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This application was approved in October 2015, and the Golden Letter has been included in the Register since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/KulturDialog/Kulturerhalt/Myanmar_GoldenerBrief_Unesco.html|title=Der Goldene Brief des Königs Alaungphaya von Myanmar an Georg II. gehört zum UNESCO-Weltdokumentenerbe|last=|first=|date=12 October 2015|website=Auswärtiges Amt (Federal Foreign Office, Germany)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103235616/http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/KulturDialog/Kulturerhalt/Myanmar_GoldenerBrief_Unesco.html|archive-date=3 November 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a long renovation of the library building, the certificate from UNESCO was finally presented on 29 March 2017 by Verena Metze-Mangold, president of the UNESCO commission, to the library director Anne May. Present at the ceremony were Yin Yin Myint, Myanmar ambassador; Annabel Gallop, the curator of the Southeast Asian collection at the British Library; [[Prince Heinrich of Hanover]] representing the House of Welf; and [[Gabriele Heinen-Kljajic|Gabriele Heinen-Kljajić]], State Minister for Science and Culture in Lower Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Verbrieftes Weltkulturerbe / Festakt zur Aufnahme des Goldenen Briefs in das Unesco-Weltdokumentenerbe in der Gottfried-Wihelm-Leibniz-Bibliothek|last=Moers|first=Mario|date=30 March 2017|work=Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Club]] praised the film saying it was "A genuinely suspenseful whodunit about a team of wannabe filmmakers exploiting a rash of L.A. murders targeting hipsters...''The Scenesters'' is definitely, if dryly, funny in its satirical take on fame-seeking indie-rock types—boosted by a literally killer soundtrack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/austin/articles/austin-film-festival-spotlight-todd-berger-on-kill,34299/ | title=Austin Film Festival spotlight: Todd Berger on killing The Scenesters |accessdate=22 Oct 2011 | date=22 Oct 2011 | work=[[The A.V.

Todd Gilchrist from [[Fearnet]] called the film "A compelling whodunit that manages to pack more of a punch than the latest retro-noir murder mystery, The Scenesters is a satisfying, successful look at predators and prey, hipsters and Hollywood dreamers, and films and filmmakers that doesn't purely chase its own tail - and better yet, doesn't make moviegoers chase it either... destined to become a cult classic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/reviews/b18248_scenesters_review.html/ | title='The Scenesters' Review |accessdate=16 Feb 2011 | date=16 Feb 2011 | work=[[Fearnet]] | last=Gilchrist | first=Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22372">An  '''international marriage''', or '''transnational marriage''', is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.

Culture and language differences are often encountered as obstacles, although there are exceptions. Where ethnic groups are divided between multiple sovereign states ([[irredentism]] or [[stateless nation]]s) or places which once shared common citizenship are separated by borders of newly-independent nations ([[decolonisation]]), transnational marriages do not necessarily imply different cultures.

In an age of increasing [[globalization]], where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

==Motives==
Transnational marriage may occur when someone from one [[country]] visits or lives in another country for school, work, political asylum, refuge, or due to their family relocating.

In general terms, reasons for transnational marriage include:
*A visitor may become attracted to a [[citizen]] of a host country, marrying them. This is usually a [[cross-cultural]] marriage, although there are times in which that citizen may be from the same [[culture]]. Marrying a citizen of the host country may help in becoming a citizen of that land and staying there permanently. Sometimes the host culture is the one with which the person identifies, and thus desires to marry someone of that culture rather than someone from their "home" culture.
*A soldier, while posted abroad, may fall in love with a local citizen. See [[war bride]], [[war children]] and [[lost Canadians]].
*A computer user possessing an account on an internet social network may become attracted to another user holding an account in another country and the two may unite by means of travel arrangements. 
*A traveller may be attracted to a citizen of a third country who is also visiting or living in the host country, marrying someone who has the shared experience of living amidst different cultures regardless of citizenship.
*Having become a citizen of the host country, a recent immigrant may go back to their homeland temporarily to find a spouse, sometimes through [[arranged marriage]]. This may come as a result of missing home, family, and culture, and desiring to have such in one's life. Another variant is to choose a [[picture bride]] from the homeland due to inability to marry a local citizen. One may then bring one's spouse to their new country of citizenship through [[family reunification]] provisions in [[immigration law]].
*Historically, colonists would espouse mates from their respective home countries, such as [[King's Daughters]] in francophone [[Lower Canada]].
*Members of linguistic or cultural minorities may espouse someone from that same group by crossing international boundaries. While [[Madawaska, Maine]] is heavily [[francophone]], the [[French language in the United States]] is spoken by a tiny minority. Cross into [[Acadia]]n [[New Brunswick]] or into [[Quebec]] and the [[French language]] becomes commonplace.
*The territory of a cultural or language group often does not align with national boundaries; for instance, a [[Germany|German]]-[[Austria]]n or German-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] couple might share a common [[German language|language]] and freedom of travel in the [[Schengen Area]] while holding legally-different nationality. A linguistic or cultural group often extends beyond the territory of its nominal home state ([[irredentism]]) or a group may be arbitrarily split between multiple legal political entities as a [[stateless nation]]. Territory inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] often is not aligned with current official political boundaries.
*In rare instances, both members of a transnational couple are from the same town or village, but live in different nations because a community has been divided by an international boundary. The [[Haskell Free Library and Opera House]], itself divided by the border, was built by one such couple in the divided village of [[Stanstead, Quebec|Rock Island]]-[[Derby Line, Vermont|Derby Line]].

Obstacles to transnational marriage include:
* [[Citizenship]] of two or more nations - one or both spouses must change citizenship or become a [[multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] or [[permanent residency|permanent resident]]. Changing one's citizenship can be a long process, and for some it is an ordeal of negotiating the laws and language of a new country.
* [[Culture]] - Learning how to live with a new spouse where cultural assumptions and norms may vary greatly. 
* [[Language]] - From mere Dialect differences to totally different languages.

In some cases, an ethnic group has no difference in culture or language but is artificially divided for geopolitical reasons. Places which once shared common nationality may have lost this status to [[decolonisation]], but still share language or other identifiers.

In these cases, cultural or language barriers do not apply, aside from the possibility of dealing with the influence of a distinct dominant culture of the host country or countries. Depending on the countries, there may still be major issues in terms of legal status.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In more ancient times,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} some marriages between distinctly different tribes and nations were due to royalty trying to form alliances with or to influence other kingdoms or to dissuade marauders or slave traders. More recently, transnational marriages are due to globalization, with migration of labor, increased communication, and many more situations where foreigners come into contact with each other. It is also more common in some areas where class and tribal separations are becoming less strict. If one shares values that transcend culture, then it is easier to get married across cultures.

However, there are many barriers and restrictions to cross-cultural, inter-tribal or racial, and particularly transnational, marriages. People tend to marry those similar to them, some even preferring to marry first cousins, whom they trust. In an interesting twist, transnational arranged marriage between [[cousin]]s or relatives occur more often in some places with migration and [[family reunification]] policies, as some people still want their culture and family when marrying, even in a distant place.

==Historical attitudes==
{{Tone|date=November 2009}}
The [[Bible]] and the [[Laws of Manu]] are two religious historical documents which give some insight into the views on transnational marriage in antiquity. In the Bible, Abraham's God warns the [[Israelites]] not to marry people from seven nations residing in the land of Canaan for fear that they would then proceed to worship the gods of the other nations.&lt;ref&gt;(Exodus 34:16, Deuteronomy 7:3-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermarriage with other nations was permissible. There are several instances of transnational marriages in the Bible, such as [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] being given Egyptian wives by Pharaoh, [[Rahab|Rahab of Jericho]] marrying one of the Israelite spies she hid, Ruth the Moabite taking care of her mother-in-law Naomi, and King [[Solomon]] marrying Pharaoh's daughter, as well as many other foreign wives. King Solomon married to make alliances and keep the peace, and the others because they lived by each other. However, the difference in reaction to the transnational marriages is how the newcomers responded to the Abrahamic God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=11&amp;chapter=9&amp;version=31|title=1 Kings 9|work=New International Version|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Solomon was punished by God for facilitating his wives' worship of their own gods in Israel and then worshipping alongside them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=11&amp;chapter=11&amp;version=31&amp;context=chapter|title=1 Kings 11|work=New International Version|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samson]] espoused a Philistine, who betrayed him to that nation. The book of [[Ezra]] tells of the response of the Jewish exiles to either separate from their foreign wives they had married in [[Babylon]] or be separated from the community of exiles when the exiles were trying to turn back to the Abrahamic God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034:16;%20Deuteronomy%207:3,4;%201%20Chronicles%2023:22;%20Ezra%209:1,2,12;|title=Exodus 34:16; Deuteronomy 7:3-4; 1 Chronicles 23:22; Ezra 9:1-2 &amp;12|work=New International Version|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses' sister, Miriam, criticizes him for marrying a Cushite woman. She is then stricken with leprosy for criticizing Moses (Numbers 12:1-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatthebible.blogspot.com/2014/07/moses-married-non-jew.html|last=Freedman|first=Beno|title=Moses Married a Non-Jew|work=What the Bible Actually Says|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Laws of Manu]],&lt;ref&gt;Buhler, Georg (1969) ''The Laws of Manu.'' Translated with extracts from seven commentaries by Georg Buhler, Volume 25 in the Sacred Books of the East edited by F. Max Muller volume XXV, New York: Dover Publications, Inc. pp. 75-83, 401-429.&lt;/ref&gt; a religious document for the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] [[Brahmins]] invading [[India]], speaks of how to keep oneself clean but also intermarry with the indigenous peoples in order to create a caste system. A Nepali anthropologist writes on how a Brahmin man might marry four wives of different castes, and keep all the eating and living quarters of his different caste wives and children separate. His children and grandchildren, born to women of lower castes, will have even lower status and not be taught the laws. The only social mobility is downward.&lt;ref&gt;"There are also special differences in socialization for the children of mixed Bahun-Matwali marriages, the source of most of those in the Chhetri caste. ... The mixed household may include at least three castes, if not more, having wives from Bahun, Chhetri and Matwali castes, who must remain restricted to their appropriate areas. The father, then, eats in a separate area from the children, who eat in a separate area from the mother. ... The family is thus strongly divided along caste lines. The mother, here, is even more disparaged than in the purely Bahun family. She is Matwali; not only a source of potential pollution, but the cause for lowered, Chhetri, status of the son of a Bahun (1992: 74-75)" Bista, Dor Bahadur. ''Fatalism and Development: Nepal's Struggle for Modernization'' Hyderabad or Calcutta, India: Orient Longman Limited. 1991, Reprinted 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, although no longer specifically due to transnational marriage, the [[Miscegenation|interracial]] sexual contact in the Americas produced a system that defined social status by skin color, and is still followed by some people, but in particular those whom it subjugated. People would marry those with lighter skin color to keep their social status and were against marrying anyone of "lower" status, particularly around the time of belief that certain people were of a superior race than others.&lt;ref&gt;(personal experience, anecdotes, and reading but need citation)&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different perspective of interracial or transnational marriage is from those who tend to marry their cousins, sometimes even first cousins. They do so in order keep the family together socially and economically, thus disproving of marriage outside. Recently, this practice has become technically transnational due to differences in citizenship, even though the people are still family. An example of transnational marriage that kept the family together was among European [[Royal family|royalty]]. [[Queen Victoria]]'s grandchildren were all over Europe, keeping the royalty together. She was referred to as the "grandmother of Europe." However, some of the resulting alliances brought nations into the Great War ([[World War I]]) which otherwise could have retained [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. More recent examples are from a mass migration from the less developed regions of the world to the more developed regions, helped by the policies of family reunification. A fairly common practice among South Asian immigrants to the UK or USA is to have arranged marriages to someone back "home," in order to keep the culture and traditions within their family.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Alison|date=June 2006|title=The arranged transnational cousin marriages of British Pakistanis: critique, dissent and cultural continuity|journal=Contemporary South Asia|volume=15|issue=2|pages=209–20|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/ccsa/2006/00000015/00000002|accessdate=2008-07-16|doi=10.1080/09584930600955317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charsley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charsley|first=Katherine|author2=Shaw, Alison |date=October 2006|title=South Asian transnational marriages in comparative perspective|journal=Global Networks: a Journal of Transnational Affairs|volume=6|issue=4|pages=331–44|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/glob/2006/00000006/00000004/art00001|accessdate=2008-07-16|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0374.2006.00147.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern attitudes==
Today, there is a mixed reaction to transnational marriage in some areas, especially as it continues to spread. [[Family reunification]] policies have upset some people in host countries, as people are less likely to assimilate if they continue to marry people from their home countries, thus keeping their cultures alive in the host cultures.&lt;ref name="MWUK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationwatchuk.com/Briefingpapers/other/transnational_marriage.asp |title=Transnational marriage and the formation of Ghettoes |date=2005-09-22 |publisher=Migration Watch UK |accessdate=2008-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106154157/http://www.migrationwatchuk.com/Briefingpapers/other/transnational_marriage.asp |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are suspicious of transnational marriages, as they think the non-citizen spouse may use their marriage only to obtain legal status in the host country.&lt;ref name="Ex-US"&gt;''Ex-US Immigration Employee, Sister Admits Fake Marriages Scheme'' Immigration Link Fall 2007 Vol. 3 No. 3 [http://www.spar-bernstein.com Law Offices of Spar &amp; Bernstein]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623093039/http://www.spar-bernstein.com/ |date=June 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others find their families torn apart if one spouse is detained or deported for legal reasons.&lt;ref name="Police"&gt;''Police Officer, Wife Live In Fear, Uncertainty About Deportation'' Immigration Link Fall 2007 Vol. 3 No.b 3 [http://www.spar-bernstein.com Law Offices of Spar &amp; Bernstein]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623093039/http://www.spar-bernstein.com/ |date=June 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many legal barriers and hurdles to cross in transnational marriage, as well as being allowed to remain living together in the same country.

==Third culture kids==
{{main|Third culture kid}}
Immigrants may also take their families with them, meaning that their children grow up in different lands, learning a different culture and language often feeling more at home in the host country than their "home" country. These children, called third culture kids, often tend to feel affinity to those who have also lived in more than one country and culture, and tend to marry people of diverse backgrounds, regardless of nationality and citizenship.&lt;ref name="Pollock"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollock|first=David C. |author2=Van Reken, Ruth E. |title=Third Culture Kids: The Experience of Growing Up Among Worlds|publisher=Nicholas Brealey Publishing|location=London|date=2001-05-25|edition=2nd revised|isbn=1-85788-295-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others decide on a transnational marriage without having lived long in their new country. Traveling has resulted in transnational relationships, marriages, and even families, although it is not known how common such results are.

==One debate: should national laws discourage or encourage transnational marriage?==
Currently, it can be legally difficult to have a transnational marriage. There are many barriers, for example in Indonesia it can be very difficult for the married couple if the husband is not Indonesian.&lt;ref name="Faist"&gt;{{cite book|title=Transnational Social Spaces: Agents, Networks and Institutions|editor=Faist, Thomas |editor2=Ozveren, Eyüp |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|date=2004-08-30|isbn=0-7546-3291-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SmFwL3XZTf0C|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expat.or.id/info/mixmarriages.html|title=Mixed Marriages: Indonesians and Expatriates|publisher=Living in Indonesia|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of increasing transnational marriage, policy makers in various countries are starting to consider whether they should discourage or encourage transnational marriage.

The grounds given for discouraging transnational marriage are that:
* False marriages occur to gain citizenship or conduct human trafficking.&lt;ref name="Ex-US" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Erik|title=Transnational Marriage in Thailand: The Dynamics of Extreme Heterogamy|editor=Bauer, Thomas G. |editor2=McKercher, Bob|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2003|series=Sex and Tourism: Journeys of Romance, Love, and Lust|pages=57–80|chapter=5|isbn=0-7890-1203-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AfLOZUWx7rYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=transnational+marriage+and+citizenship|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The marriages are cross-cultural and thus children or spouses may not be as loyal or patriotic to the new country.
* There is a lack of assimilation and creation of ghettos if second and third generation immigrants are still marrying persons from the country of their ancestors.&lt;ref name="MWUK" /&gt;

The grounds given for encouraging transnational marriage are that:
* Transnational marriage reconnects extended families or even persons of similar backgrounds that are living all over the globe.
* It helps relations between countries by strengthening trade and contact, or in case of war, enables one country to know more about the other (case of Kibei or Japanese-Americans during WWII).
* People are increasingly marrying across national boundaries and harsh laws just tear families apart.&lt;ref name="Police" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Constable|first=N. |date=April–June 2003|title= A Transnational Perspective on Divorce and Marriage: Filipina Wives and Workers|journal=Identities: Global Studies in Power and Culture|publisher=Routledge, Part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group|volume=10|issue=2|pages=163–80|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/gide/2003/00000010/00000002/art00002#aff_1|accessdate=2008-07-16|doi=10.1080/10702890304328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===United States===
In the United States federal law, [[International Marriage Broker Regulation Act]] regulates international marriage, primarily to restrict misuse of the institution of marriage to immigrate to the country.

===Pakistan, Afghanistan===
Frequent among Pashtun and Baloch tribes near the [[Durand Line]] where marriage between transborder corresponding their cultures are frequent. The straddling of people between the border has been a contentious ongoing issue between the two countries.

'''Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum''' was a proposed art [[museum]] in the city of [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]]. On April 8, 2008 an international [[Jury#Non-trial juries|jury]] named [[Zaha Hadid]], a British-Iraqi [[architect]], the winner of the international design competition for the museum.&lt;ref name=BLOO&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Bloomberg News|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aB1F5bbX10VM|title=Zaha Hadid to Design Planned Museum in Lithuania|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was initially scheduled to open in 2011.&lt;ref name=BLOO/&gt; Later, it was announced, that museum was scheduled to open in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.development.lt/2010/vilnius-municipal-projects.html#museum|title=Municipal projects — Development Lithuania}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was postponed due to alleged illegal channeling of funds to the Jonas Mekas Arts Center and has been under investigation since 2010.&lt;ref name="lithuaniatribune.com"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20120203025213/http://www.lithuaniatribune.com/2011/02/07/guggenheim-museum-initiative-in-vilnius-to-be-taken-over-by-the-finns/ Guggenheim Museum initiative in Vilnius to be taken over by the Finns], ''The Lithuania Tribune'' (February 7, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum project, as of March 2012, was reported as having regained support, including that of the Vilnius mayor, Arturas Zuokas, even though the embezzlement inquiry was still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.15min.lt/en/article/culture-society/vilnius-revives-old-idea-of-building-hermitage-guggenheim-museum-528-202329#axzz1pYoaEVe6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
As envisioned in 2008, Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum would have presented [[art exhibition|exhibition]]s of new media art, parts of the [[New York City]] anthology film archive, and [[Fluxus]] art.&lt;ref name=BLOO/&gt; The Fluxus art movement flourished in New York during the 1960s, and was led by Lithuanian-born artist [[Jurgis Mačiūnas]].&lt;ref name=BLOO/&gt; Another important part of the exhibition would have been a collection of works by Lithuanian [[avant-garde]] [[film maker]] [[Jonas Mekas]]. These works are currently held by the [[Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center]]. Collections from [[Saint Petersburg]]'s [[Hermitage Museum]] and New York City's [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] would have been displayed as well.

It is estimated that the museum would have cost up to 170 million [[Lithuanian litas|litas]] (75 million [[United States dollar|USD]]).&lt;ref name=LRT&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Lrt.lt|url=http://www.lrt.lt/news.php?strid=5044&amp;id=4465893|title=Gugenheimas Vilniuje: pasirinkimas iš trijų grožybių|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion was initially scheduled for 2011. A [[feasibility study]] was conducted to explore various aspects of the project's implementation, including market and economic impact analyses.  However. due to corruption allegations, the entire project ended.&lt;ref name=herm&gt;{{cite web|publisher=
[[Hermitage Museum]]|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/11/2008/hm11_1_197.html|title=Zaha Hadid Wins Competition to Develop Design for Proposed Museum in Vilnius|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs==
[[Image:Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum by Daniel Libeskind.jpg|thumb|Design submitted by Daniel Libeskind]]
Three architects submitted their designs for the final competition: [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Massimiliano Fuksas]], and [[Daniel Libeskind]].

Daniel Libeskind, winner of the competition to rebuild the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], presented his work under the name ''"Nexus"'' ([http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=16609361 see Daniel Libeskind's visualization]). According to Libeskind, his concept links the [[history of Vilnius]] to its present via a ''Connection''.&lt;ref name=LRT/&gt; He stated that ''"This connection is revealed through the structure, which with its wide and slashing arcades covers history and innovation, [[Vilnius Old Town|old panoramas]] and new [[skyscraper]]s, the city and the [[Neris river]]"''.&lt;ref name=LRT/&gt; Libeskind also asserted the need to connect nature and architecture: ''"Tightness between landscape, which turns to building, and building, which converts to landscape, ravels unheard possibility to create a sculptural form, which opens to visitor"''.&lt;ref name=LRT/&gt;
[[Image:Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum by Massimiliano Fuksas.jpg|thumb|left|Massimiliano Fuksas's design]]
The dominant features of Massimiliano Fuksas' project are crossed domes, which leave an impression of movement ([http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=16609154 see Massimiliano Fuksas' visualization]). According to Fuksas, huge "eyes" looking into the sky would point and filter daylight into the building. Fuksas asserted that such design principles would allow ''"visitors to clearly distinguish the exposition halls from other spaces - restaurants and shops - and provide comfortable access to the river."''&lt;ref name=LRT/&gt; The center of the building would be reserved for permanent Mekas and Mačiūnas collections.

Zaha Hadid, a [[Pritzker Prize]] winner, proposed a "[[mystical]] object, hovering over spindled artificial landscape strip" ([http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=16609322 see Zaha Hadid's visualization]). She chose to draw a contrast between the building's forms and the [[Vertical direction|vertical]] forms of nearby skyscrapers. The top of the building reflects surroundings of the Vilnius city. Hadid asserted that ''"It is especially important today to acknowledge cultural buildings, that they have unique and special [[morphology (architecture)|morphologies]]. Those buildings should make an impression on people, people should accept them."''&lt;ref name=LRT/&gt;

The director of the Hermitage Museum [[Mikhail Piotrovsky]], the director of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] [[Thomas Krens]], the director of [[Frankfurt]]'s Museum of Architecture Peter Schmal, and the vice-chairman of the [[Lithuanian Architects Union]], Gintaras Čaikauskas, were members of the jury that evaluated the designs. Lithuanian Prime Minister [[Gediminas Kirkilas]] and former Vilnius Mayor [[Juozas Imbrasas]] also participated in the decision-making process.&lt;ref name=delfi&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[delfi.lt]]|url= http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=16606948|title=Guggenheimo muziejaus Vilniuje konkursą laimėjo Z.Hadid|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination of Proposal Study Due to Scandal==
The Vilnius Guggenheim Initiative was ended after allegations of corruption involving the [[Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center]], discovered after an audit by the National Audit Office of Lithuania.  Finland then received the opportunity to develop the museum in [[Guggenheim Helsinki Plan|Helsinki]] with no further chances to develop the museum in Vilnius.&lt;ref name="lithuaniatribune.com"/&gt;

'''''Vsya Rossiya''''' (literally translated "''All Russia''" or "''The whole Russia''") was the title of a series of directories of the [[Russian Empire]] published by [[Aleksei Sergeevich Suvorin]] on a yearly basis from 1895 to 1923 and was continued under the name '''''Ves SSSR''''' (Literally translated ''All of the USSR'' or ''The whole USSR'') from 1924 to 1931. Each volume was anywhere between 500 and 1500 pages long. The directories contained detailed lists of government offices, public services and medium and large businesses present in major cities across Russia including [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], . These directories are often used by [[genealogists]] today to trace family members who were living in pre-revolutionary Russia and the early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period when [[vital records]] are missing or prove difficult to find. [[Historians]] use them to research the [[social histories]] of late 19th century and early 20th century Russia.

==Contents==

The following information can be found in most editions:
*a surname index of over 100,000 names and thousands of companies
*a directory of prominent landowners
*Lists members of the Imperial House of Russia and government officials 
*statistical information about the Russian Empire
*Population figures
*information and guidelines about trade and industry in Russia
*Lists of joint-stock companies
*Sub-sections detailing a directory of each district of each province, listing administrative officials, merchants, industrial and commercial manufacturers
*Original advertising

== Availability ==

Many original directories in the series (or [[microfiche]] copies thereof) can be found in libraries across the U.S., Europe (including the [[Baltic countries]], Finland the United Kingdom and Germany) however most only have an incomplete collection.

==Other city directories in Russia ==
Suvorin also published city directories for [[Saint Petersburg]] under the title ''[[Ves Petersburg]]'' (Literally translated ''All Petersburg'' or ''The Whole Saint Petersburg'') for the years 1894 to 1940 and for [[Moscow]] under the title ''[[Vsia Moskva]]'' (Literally translated ''All Moscow'' or ''The Whole Moscow'') for the years 1875 to 1936.

The '''''White Privilege Conference''''' is a yearly conference held to discuss the issue of [[white privilege]].&lt;ref name=EN&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands of teachers flock to ‘White Privilege Conference’|date=April 15, 2016|first=Victor|last=Skinner|url=http://eagnews.org/thousands-of-teachers-descend-on-white-privilege-conference/|publisher=[[Education Action Group Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=At New York Private Schools, Challenging White Privilege From the Inside|first=Kyle|last=Spencer|date=February 20, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/nyregion/at-new-york-private-schools-challenging-white-privilege-from-the-inside.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyym.org/?q=Spark-January2016-Hitchcock|title=The White Privilege Conference|date=January 28, 2016|first=Jeffrey|last=Hitchcock|publisher=[[New York Yearly Meeting]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Tim Wise - Between Barack and a Hard Place: Racism and White Denial in the Age of Obama|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?285738-1/book-discussion-barack-hard-place|accessdate=April 5, 2015|series=[[Book TV]]|credits=[[Tim Wise]]|network=[[C-SPAN]]|station=White Privilege Conference|location=Memphis|airdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference features several workshops and groups for students and adults about racism, race, perceived white privilege, [[sexism]], black [[oppression]], [[racial injustice]], as well as discussions of [[LGBT|lesbian, gay and transgender rights]], as well as [[Islam]] and [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref name=EN/&gt;

==History and founding==
The White Privilege Conference was founded in 2000 by Eddie Moore Jr., a former diversity director at Brooklyn Friends.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; 

As of 2016, many New York private schools had students and faculty attending the conference.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==2016 White Privilege Conference deemed "too white"==
At the 2016 White Privilege Conference attendees complained that the conference was "too white".&lt;ref name=TDC&gt;{{cite web|title=White Privilege Conference Attendees Complain Conference Is Too White|author=Neff, Blake|date=April 18, 2016|url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/18/white-privilege-conference-attendees-complain-conference-is-too-white/|publisher=[[The Daily Caller]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired by the 2015 [[Twitter]] [[88th Academy Awards|#OscarsSoWhite]] campaign, Twitter users adopted the hashtag #WPCSoWhite and claimed the conference that was supposed to fight [[white privilege]] instead entrenched it.&lt;ref name=TDC/&gt;

The Twitter tag appeared to have been started by Aeriel Ashlee, an [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] education consultant who attended the 2016 conference and objected to many sections of a keynote address delivered by [[white people|white]] historian [[James W. Loewen]], including his use of the [[Nigger|N-word]].&lt;ref name=TDC/&gt;

==Media criticism==
The conference has been criticized by some in the media&lt;ref name=NB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/kristine-marsh/2015/02/20/nyt-applauds-elite-ny-private-schools-white-privilege-propaganda|publisher=[[NewsBusters]]|title=NYT Applauds Elite NY Private Schools’ ‘White Privilege’ Propaganda|first=Kristine|last=Marsh|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as nothing more than [[white guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Always room in the budget for white guilt|first=Katherine|last=Kersten|date=April 13, 2011|url=http://www.startribune.com/always-room-in-the-budget-for-white-guilt/119508364/|work=[[Star Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
