{{Advanced Placement}}

The '''Advanced Placement Psychology''' ('''AP Psychology''', '''AP Psych''', or '''APPSY''') course and corresponding exam are part of [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement Program]]. This  course is tailored for students interested in the field of [[psychology]] and as an opportunity to earn Advanced Placement credit or exemption from a [[college]]-level psychology course.  It was the shortest AP exam until the [[AP Physics C]] exam was split into two separate exams in 2006.

==Topics covered==
The College Board provides a course of study to help educators prepare their students for the AP Psychology exam. The exam covers the following 14 areas. The percentage indicates the portion of the multiple-choice section of the exam focused on each content area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP: Psychology|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/psych/topics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam==
[[Image:AP Psych Test.JPG|thumb|left|Free response section booklet]]
The exam includes two sections: a 70-minute [[multiple choice]] section (100 questions) and a 50-minute [[free response]] section (2 prompts). The multiple choice provides two-thirds of the grade and the free-response provides the remaining third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP: Psychology|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/psych/exam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, total scores on the multiple-choice section are based only on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are no longer deducted for incorrect answers. Grading (the number of points needed to get a certain score) is slightly more strict as a result.

==Grade distribution==

The exam was first held in 1992. Grade distributions for the Psychology exam scores since 2010 were:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">'''[https://www.accountablenow.org Accountable Now]''' is a global platform, founded in 2008 by a group of independent non-profit organisations, which is intended to foster [[accountability]] and [[Transparency (behaviour)#Non-governmental organizations|transparency]] of [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organisations]] (CSOs), as well as stakeholder  communication and performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/webprofile-ngos/Files/22/INGO-Accountability-Charter_en.pdf INGO Accountability Charter] &lt;/ref&gt; It supports CSOs to be transparent, responsive to stakeholders and focused on delivering impact. 

Accountable Now was founded under the name International NGO Charter of Accountability by eleven leading CSOs, including development, humanitarian, environmental, rights-based and advocacy organisations. As Membership and global collaboration increase, CSOs collective voices are strengthened. Today, 29 Member Organisations are active in more than 150 countries and impact stakeholders all over the world.

== Background ==
CSOs are more important than ever before in framing and influencing social, political and economic environments. On the national level they provide disaster relief and social service, promote self-help and self- governance in developing countries where they are operating. In addition they enhance a strong international [[Civil society|Civil Society]] by creating informal but important normative regimes which are influencing international institutions in their decision-making. This greater involvement of CSOs also raises the question of how they justify their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. David and Mark H. Moore (2001): “Accountability, Strategy, and International Nongovernmental Organizations”, in: “Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly” 30: p.569, online: [http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/30/3/569]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSOs have a particular interest in meeting standards on accountability and transparency in view of the responsibilities towards not only the cause which they are meant to serve, but also stakeholders of various types, including donors and sponsors (possibly comprising corporations and governments), intended program beneficiaries, staff and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Maria Francesch-Huidobro: ''Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), {{ISBN|978-981-230-831-3}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&amp;pg=PA60 p. 60]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Kumi Naidoo: ''Global civic society: Rallying for real change''.

Accountable Now is considered a contributing element to underscoring the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of CSOs.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Matthews: ''Intellectual Property, Human Rights and Development: The Role of NGOs and Social Movements'', MPG Books Group, UK, {{ISBN|978-1-84720-785-2}}, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CxgHNQz5Oq8C&amp;pg=PA229 p. 229]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

===Development===
At the International Advocacy Non-Government Organisations (IANGO) Workshop hosted by Transparency International in June 2003, the importance of promoting accountability and legitimacy was discussed by its participants. As they recognised their growing involvement in international issues the need of promoting accountability was highlighted. The Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organisations at the Harvard University was asked for a research paper on the topic to provide a foundation for following discussions.
At the following annual meetings in 2004 and 2005 the participants analysed their own concepts of accountability, set up an initial draft and with the help of independent consultant specialists revised the draft until a final version was ready to launch.&lt;ref&gt;Explore Charter background on: {{cite web|url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/background-of-the-charter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170305/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/background-of-the-charter/ |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption ===
[https://s3.amazonaws.com/webprofile-ngos/Files/22/INGO-Accountability-Charter_en.pdf The INGO Accountability Charter], signed in June 2006 by eleven leading [[international NGO]]s active in the area of [[human rights]], environment and social development, set the course for the establishment of Accountable Now (then known as the INGO Accountability Charter) and it has been referred to as “the first ever set of international and cross-sector guidelines for the NGO sector”&lt;ref name="brainard-p175"&gt;Lael Brainard, Derek Chollet (editors): ''Global development 2.0: can philanthropists, the public, and the poor make poverty history?'', The Brookings Institution, {{ISBN|978-0-8157-1393-7}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tgDGgLaDw8IC&amp;pg=PA175 p. 175]&lt;/ref&gt; and the “first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector”.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stuart Thompson: ''Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civic society forum''. In: James W. St. G. Walker, Andrew S. Thompson: ''Critical mass: the emergence of global civil society'', The Centre for International Governance Innovation and Wilfried Laurier University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-55458-022-4}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3Q0rFXjPQ4C&amp;pg=PA214 p. 214]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding Signatories ===
The founding signatories were [[ActionAid|ActionAid International]], [[Amnesty International]], [[CIVICUS]] World Alliance for Citizen Participation, [[Consumers International]], [[Greenpeace International]], [[Oxfam International]], [[International Save the Children Alliance]], [[Survival International]], [[Terre des hommes|International Federation Terre des Hommes]], [[Transparency International]] and [[World YWCA]].

== Articles ==
The charter is ''based on ten core principles and aimed at enhancing respect for human rights, good governance, accountability and transparency, encouraging stakeholder communication, promoting inclusion and environmental responsibility, and improving organisational performance and effectiveness''.&lt;ref name="brainard-p175"/&gt; It documents the commitment of [[international NGO]]s to these aims. 

== Organisation ==
In 2008, the signatory-NGOs decided to found an independent organisation of the same name ''International NGO Accountability Charter Ltd'' in order to organise the reporting and vetting process of the member organisations against the charter commitments and develop them further. Today, the organisation operates under the name [https://www.accountablenow.org Accountable Now] and has 29 member organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-accountable-now/|title=Who we are|newspaper=Accountable Now|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Related codes of conduct ==
In 1997, the [[One World Trust]] had created an ''NGO Charter'', a [[code of conduct]] comprising commitment to accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneworldtrust.org/csoproject/cso/initiatives/358/charte_des_ong_ngo_charter Charte des ONG (NGO Charter)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052118/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/csoproject/cso/initiatives/358/charte_des_ong_ngo_charter |date=2011-09-28 }}, One World Trust, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2385">The '''Australian Student Prize''' (formerly the ''[[Howard Florey|Lord Florey]] Student Prize'') was an [[Australian Government]] [[prize]] that was awarded annually from 1991 to 2014, to give "national recognition to academic excellence and achievement in secondary education". Five hundred students received the award each year, which previously consisted of a certificate and cash prize. The cash prize was [[Australian dollar|A$]]2000 until 2014, when the prize was reduced to $1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ryan Electorate: Education|url=http://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2014-08-28.44.1|website=openaustralia.org.au|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nation’s top students recognised|url=http://ourkidz.com.au/content/view/2056/278/lang,en/|website=ourkidz.com.au|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is no longer awarded as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australian Student Prize {{!}} Department of Education and Training, Australian Government|url = https://www.education.gov.au/australian-student-prize|website = www.education.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09|first = Department of Education and Training, Australian|last = Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, each [[States and territories of Australia|State and Territory]] Minister for Education nominated a number of students (according to the state or territory's proportion of [[year 12]] students) for the prize each year. Medallists from Australia's teams in the [[International Biology Olympiad|International Biology]], [[International Chemistry Olympiad|Chemistry]], [[International Olympiad in Informatics|Informatics]], [[International Mathematics Olympiad|Mathematics]] and [[International Physics Olympiad|Physics Olympiads]] also received the Australian Student Prize.

Prize winners were announced in the year following their completion of [[high school]], generally in June. Names were printed in various newspapers across Australia, and were posted on the [https://education.gov.au/australian-student-prize prize's website], where a list of past winners is still available.

'''Brenda Mary Rawnsley, Mrs. Keighley''' (née Hugh-Jones; 31 July 1916 in [[Oxford]], Oxfordshire – 25 June 2007 in [[Milford on Sea]], Hampshire) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] arts campaigner and education activist. During [[World War II]], she was based in [[North Africa]] as an Air Ministry Squadron Leader.

==Biography==
Born as '''Brenda Mary Hugh-Jones''', daughter of Llewellyn Arthur Hugh-Jones, Governor of [[Faiyum|Faiyum in Egypt]], and Dulcibella Eden, a cousin of [[Anthony Eden]], she was educated at [[Queen Anne's School]], [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]]. She earned a scholarship to attend [[Oxford University]], but left without graduating, in order to join her father in [[Cairo]].

===World War II===
In 1939, she enlisted in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]] Officer Cadet training unit, but soon left to work for the [[Ministry of Economic Warfare]] in London. Through mutual friends she met Flt Lt Derek Rawnsley, who had made history by flying solo in a [[Tiger Moth]] from [[Australia]] to [[Oxford]]. In 1937 Lt Rawnsley had founded the '''Federal Union Movement''' with Charles Kimber and Patrick Ransome, seeking the unification of Europe to avoid war. Hugh-Jones and Rawnsley were married in February 1941, but he was immediately posted overseas in the [[RAF]]. By the end of 1941, Mrs Rawnsley was a [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] officer. Fluent in French, Arabic and Greek, she was of great importance and sent in 1942 to [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]], and later, to [[List of former RAF stations#Former Overseas RAF Stations|RAF Ramleh]] in the then-[[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate in Palestine]]. {{cn|date=December 2013}}

Lt Rawnsley was killed in a February 1943 accident, after which Mrs Rawnsley worked with 201 Squadron, Alexandria and was subsequently posted to [[Algiers]] in February 1944 to work with Gen. Wilson, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Middle East. Later she returned to England to work with [[Duncan Sandys]], trying to forecast the course of flying bombs (V1s) and rockets (V2s). In June 1945 she was dispatched on an intelligence mission to the German flying bomb factory in the [[Harz Mountains]], and subsequently wrote a history of the flying bomb for the Air Ministry, leaving the service with the rank of squadron leader and a variety of medals in 1945.

In 1935, with the backing of Sir [[Philip Sassoon]], Derek Rawnsley had set up '''Picture Hire Ltd.''', which made available for rent original pictures by contemporary artists, and '''School Prints Ltd.''', which aimed to loan sets of reproductions to schools so that children could learn about the world's great works of art. With the support of [[Victor Bonham Carter]] and architect [[Raglan Squire]] she followed her late husband's goals of bringing "good" art to schoolchildren who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to enjoy it. {{cn|date=December 2013}}

In her introductory letter to artists she wrote: ''"We are producing a series of auto-lithographs, four for each term, for use in schools, as a means of giving school children an understanding of contemporary art."'' The majority of the prints were lithographed directly by almost two dozen artists and printed by the [[Baynard Press]]. To minimise framing costs, each picture included a decorative border, and they were distributed to schools in redundant cartridge cases bought from the [[Ministry of Supply]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Later life and death===
In 1949 she married Geoffrey Keighley, and they had one son. The couple divorced in 1952. Brenda Keighley also continued the original idea of lending out works, expanding it in the 1950s to "Pictures for Industry", which offered 700 prints for display in factories and workplaces, and "Pictures in Hospitals". In 1971 ''[[The Observer]]'' agreed to sell the remaining stocks of the European series and the rest of the business was sold to [[Patrick Seale]], the paper's Middle East correspondent. Rawnsley was elected to the position of Master of the ''Fine Art Trade Guild''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fineart.co.uk/Trade/About_Us/The_Master_of_the_Guild.aspx Fine Art Trade Guild]&lt;/ref&gt; (1961–62). She subsequently worked as a librarian before retiring to [[Hampshire]], where she died, aged 90.

'''Build-A-Bird''' (1986 or earlier) was educational software for the [[Unisys ICON]] II public school computer. It may have appeared on the ICON I or Unisys ICON III.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Elmer V. Information, communications and technology transfer: proceedings of the 43. FID congress held in Montréal, Québec, Canada 14–18 September 1986 = Information, communications et transfert de la technologie. Amsterdam u.a: North-Holland, 1987. p. 211 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pv4aAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Build-A-Bird%22+ICON&amp;dq=%22Build-A-Bird%22+ICON&amp;ei=-tlXS9jOJo7IzgS4xLjTDg&amp;cd=2 Google books]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Build-A-Bird was designed and developed by Ergonomics Lab, [[University of Toronto]]. Gameplay revolved around creating a bird by choosing from a selection of different body parts such as stork-like legs, short legs adapted to alighting on various natural surfaces, or predatory talons. Beak type and wing type were also among the changeable body part selections in Build-A-Bird. Upon selecting your preferred, various body part types the game would provide one or several real life birds that fit your selections. What happened next in the game involved educational material about your bird's range and habitat. The visual representations of the birds, their body parts and the bird habitats were in colour and vivid for the time but lacked animation.

== Early life and marriage ==
Camilla Cobb was born Camilla Clara Mieth in [[Dresden|Dresden, Germany]].&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; Her older sister, Anna, was married to [[Karl G. Maeser]].&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; Cobb joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1855&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; and emigrated to the [[United States]] with the Maeser family on the packet ship Tuscarora in 1857. She arrived in Utah in 1860.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt;

Four years later, in 1864, Camilla married James T. Cobb (1833- ), a man who had been baptized after his arrival in Utah by Karl G. Maeser. James Cobb taught under Maeser at the 15th Ward School.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; James and Camilla Cobb went on to become the parents of seven children.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt;

== Career as an educator ==
In 1874, while in New York and surrounding areas visiting her husband's relatives, Cobb went to New Jersey and was trained as a kindergarten teacher in a system run by [[Adolph Douai]].&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; Upon her return to Utah in the fall of 1874 she founded a kindergarten in [[Salt Lake City]] with the help of [[John Willard Young|John W. Young]].&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; The following year she wrote an article in the ''[[Woman's Exponent]]'' explaining the importance of kindergarten.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; She maintained her school as a kindergarten for two years, and later opened it to children of all ages. Among her students was [[Heber J. Grant]], who would later be president of the LDS Church.

== Church leadership ==
When the Salt Lake Stake primary was first organized in 1880, Cobb was made a counselor in its presidency.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; She remained in this position until 1896, when she was made president of the Salt Lake Stake primary, overseeing the LDS primary in all of Salt Lake County.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000" /&gt; At that point the Salt Lake primary had 46 associations, nearly 4,000 children, and 309 adults holding teaching or other positions.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; Cobb served as head of the Salt Lake Stake primary until the Salt Lake Stake was divided in 1904.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt;

Beginning in 1898 Cobb served as a member of the Primary General Board.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt; She remained on the general board until 1917.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2000"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="950">The '''Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria''' is the body which supervises [[Israel]]i [[List of Israeli universities and colleges|universities and colleges]] in the [[West Bank]]. Its authority in the West Bank is similar to that of the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] in Israel proper.

As Israeli law does not apply in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied West Bank]], the Council for Higher Education in Israel has no legal standing there, so by a [[Israeli Military Order|military decree]] a similar institution was formed in the West Bank to regulate the Israeli institutions of higher learning there.

The Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria only applies to Israeli institutions and not to [[Education in the Palestinian territories|Palestinian institutions]] which also exist in the West Bank.

It was established in 1981 as the '''Center for Planning, Information, and Computer Science''' offering only a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Computer Science]]. The department was formally declared as a college in 1984. In 1990, the college was transferred to its new building, the INTELLECT (Information Technology Lecture) Building, which was eventually renamed as the Gokongwei Building. In 1996 the college was granted semi-autonomous status along with the Graduate School of Business which led into the establishment of [[De La Salle-Professional Schools, Inc.]]. The college became a part of De La Salle Professional Schools but later transferred back to the university.

==Accreditation==
The BS Computer Science program of the college was the first Computer Science program in the country to be given accreditation by the [[Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities]] in 1989. It was granted a Level II accreditation in 1993, and was re-accredited to Level II in 1998. In 2000, the college was named as one of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]'s Center of Development and Excellence in [[Information Technology]]. In 2005, the [[Computer Science]] program of the college received a Level III accreditation by PAASCU, becoming the first Level III Accredited Computer Science Program in the Philippines {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. It is the highest accreditation granted in the [[Philippines]] to this date for Computer Science programs. In March 2007, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] recognized the college as Center of Excellence in [[Information Technology]].

==Academic Research Centers==
[[Image:Gox.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gokongwei Hall Administration and Faculty Offices]]

===Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing and Networking (AdRIC)===
Formerly known as Advanced Research Institute for Computing (AdRIC), the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing and Networking is the research center of the college. The aim of the center is to produce both local and international researches through faculty researchers. The center was established in 1994 to facilitate research directives of the college. It also has its research laboratories on the fourth floor of the Gokongwei Hall. The following are the activities done by the center:
*Symposium on Semantic Web and Ontology
*2nd Natural Language Processing Research Symposium
*Constraint-based Action Planning
*De La Salle University Science and Technology Congress 2005
*[[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|DOST]] Research Proposal Preparation
*Machine Translation Project

===Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET)===
The Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET) is a multidisciplinary research and professional laboratory at the College of Computer Studies that investigates the science of complex adaptive systems and explores innovative ways of interacting with computing solutions. Aside from performing research, the center also functions as a development laboratory for the creation of various civic computing solutions, integrating research done internally.

COMET is currently composed of lead researchers, cohorts, and research assistants. The lead researchers come from the fields of computing, statistics, mathematics and physics. The cohorts and research assistants are students from the different programs and specializations under the College of Computer Studies. The research lab also leverages its research in complex adaptive systems and computer-human interaction with the development of civic computing solutions. It also provides avenues for the professional growth of its lead researchers and cohorts.

The lab has three divisions, namely: Complex Systems, Seamless Interactions (Human-Computer Interaction), and Civic Services.

===Consulting and Education Center===
Consulting and Education Center is a continuing non-degree computer training center of the college currently headed by Engr. Jesus Gonzalez. The center provides quality education for both professionals and students. Included in its services are corporate trainings, tutorials, and summer classes catering children, secondary students, and professionals. As an academic center of the college, it also holds seminars and major conferences such as the Emerging Technologies for Philippines 2020 (ETFP) held last April 17–18, 2006 at the New World Renaissance Hotel.

===Cisco Academy Training Center ===
The college is the Cisco Academy Training Center for Expanded Courses (Sponsored Curriculum) or CATC-SC of the country. The center is responsible for conducting trainings on sponsored curriculum courses such as Fundamentals of Unix, Fundamentals of Java, IT Essentials, and Voice and Data Cabling. Under DLSU, trainings for sponsored curriculum courses are categorized into two: instructor and professional trainings.

===Center for Empathic Human-Computer Interactions (CEHCI)===
The Center for Empathic Human-Computer Interactions laboratory investigates the problem of multimodal emotion modeling and empathic response modeling to build human-centered design systems. By multimodal, we mean we recognize a human’s emotion based on facial expressions, speech, and movement (such as posture and gait). Because we extend a computing system from a  software to a physical space, novel approaches to providing empathic responses are required.  To achieve this, we  use emotion-based interactions together with sensor-rich, ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence.

Currently, we are focused on the development of a self-improving, ambient intelligent empathic space. It is a three-year project funded by the Philippine Government's Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development. It is on its first year with an initial grant of PhP 3,300,000.

'''Vannadil Pudiyaveettil Dhananjayan''' (born 17 April 1939) and '''Shanta Dhananjayan''' (born 12 August 1943), also known as the Dhananjayans, are a dancing couple of India.

==Personal life==
V.P Dhananjayan was born into a [[Malayali]] Poduval family on 17 April 1939 in [[Payyanur]], [[Kannur District]], Kerala, India. He was born into a family with eight children struggling to make ends meet, when a chance meeting with [[Kathakali]] Master Guru Chandu Panicker of [[Kalakshetra]] made his father decide purely on instinct to send his son and V.Balagopalan to Kalakshetra under his tutelage. Dhananjayan joined [[Kalakshetra]] on 5 October 1953 and was a leading male dance under Rukmini Devi (founder of [[Kalakshetra]]) from 1955–1967. He graduated from [[Kalakshetra]] with a Post Graduate Diploma in Dance ([[Bharatanatyam]] and [[Kathakali]]) with distinction, and also holds a B.A in Economics and Politics. 	

Shanta Dhananjayan was born on 12 August 1943 into a well-to-do [[Malayali]] Nair family in [[Malaysia]] and traces her ancestry back to [[Kerala]] from where her family migrated to [[Malaysia]]. She was a child prodigy and by the time she was 3, her parents were convinced that Shanta would be a dancer. They found in her an inborn response to dance and joy of movement and decided to send her to India for her education. They sent her at age eight to [[Kalakshetra]] in June 1952, a year before Dhananjayan, where she later graduated with a Post-Graduate Diploma with distinction in [[Bharatanatyam]] and also learned [[Kathakali]] and [[Carnatic music]]. She was a leading female dancer at [[Kalakshetra]] from 1955–1968.

The couple have two sons. The elder, Sanjay, lives in the USA and their younger son, [[Satyajit]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiosatyajit.com Studio Satyajit official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; is an accomplished automobile photographer and dancer who lives with his wife and son in Chennai, India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharatakalaanjali.org/intro.html Bharata Kalanjali Website&amp;nbsp;– Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Kalakshetra===
Were it not for providence in the form of Guru Chandu Panicker, Dhananjayan would have been working in some monotonous job in [[Kerala]]. Dhananjayan received a scholarship at [[Kalakshetra]] to study [[Bharatanatyam]], Kathakali, Mridangam and music. Shanta trained in [[Bharatanatyam]] and music apart from other subjects for nearly a decade. They believe that whatever they have been able to achieve today is due to the painstaking mentoring of their Gurus Rukmini Devi Arundale and Chandu Panicker and various other faculty members of Kalakshetra such as NS Jayalakshmi and Sarada Hoffman.

While at Kalakshetra, it was love at first sight for Dhananjayan. Shanta was the first girl he met as he was being escorted into the portals of Kalakshetra by Guru Panicker. Though Shanta was a serious student completely devoted to her dance and music, she had secretly made up her mind, at the age of 12, to partner Dhananjayan in life. Dhananjayan expressed his desire to marry Shanta when she was 18, but she left for [[Malaysia]] after graduation and did not let him know of her consent till after returning to India 4 years later. They married in 1966 at the [[Guruvayoor]] Temple in [[Kerala]].

==Career&amp;nbsp;– Dancing Duo==
The Dhananjayans left [[Kalakshetra]] in the late 1960s to build a career on their own. During that time, only the wealthy and aristocrats who could spend to have their own children perform, dominated the dance scene in Chennai. However, the calibre of the Dhananjayans was such that they stole the thunder with their novel ideas that they brought to their presentations through a unique repertoire that they developed. The vitality of dance, their costumes, the attraction of merging of the male and female dance principles in specially conceived duets were all part of the charisma of their performances. They started to receive invitations from both within the country and from abroad. They have travelled all over the world to major cultural centres to present their art.

Some of their major performances/productions include:&lt;ref&gt;Dancer on Dance, V.P Dhananjayan, Bharata Kalanjali&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pandit [[Ravi Shankar]]'s Magnum Opus "GHANASHYAM" 1989/90
*National Dance Institute, New York "CHAKRA", with a cast of 1,000 multinational children
*A joint venture of Ohio Ballet Co., Cuyahoga Community College and Cleveland Cultural Alliance&amp;nbsp;– Jungle Book Ballet
*Choreographer for International Art Festival of Government of Singapore, "Sita Rama Katha" 1986 In the same festival, choreographed dance drama "Sanghamitra" with Singapore Artistes 1994
*Mahaabhaaratham dance drama jointly produced by French Theatre Fluerry &amp; Association Vaani in Reunion French Island 1998, 1999

==Teaching==
The Dhananjayans place particular emphasis on imparting Indian tradition and culture to their bharata natyam students. Some details about which they are particular are:
*Wearing a large bindi
*Using the term "Samskrutam" instead of "Sanskrit"
*Using the term "Natyam" instead of "Dance" to describe the art they teach
*Using the name "Bharat" instead of "India" in reference to their nation of origin

===Bharata Kalanjali===
The Dhananjayans started their own dance school ''Bharata Kalanjali'' in 1968 in Adyar, Chennai. It began with a handful of students, and is today a premier academy of dance and music with several hundreds of students and a repertory fashioned out of its own students and graduates.

===Bhaaskara===
The couple has established an academy of arts at Dhananjayan's birthplace Payyanur in [[Kerala]]. They conducted an annual summer Naatya Gurukulam camp which is no longer in operation.

===Yogaville===
The Dhananjayans have been conducting an annual summer gurukulam camp at the Satchidananda Ashram, Yogaville, [[Virginia]], USA, since 1988. Developed by the Natya Adyayana Gurukulam, the camp is an intensive, full-time residential course devoted entirely to the fine arts. Situated in the Virginia countryside, it is attended by Indian-American and international students. The teachers endeavour through it to spread awareness to their students of Indian culture, values, and explicate the philosophy underlying Hinduism.

==Honours==
Some of the major awards and accolades conferred on the Dhananjayans:

===Definition===

There is some variability in the definition of dyslexia.  Some sources, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, define it specifically as a learning disorder.&lt;ref name=ninds1/&gt;  Other sources, however, define it simply as an inability to read in the context of normal intelligence, and distinguish between ''developmental dyslexia'' (a learning disorder) and ''acquired dyslexia'' (loss of the ability to read caused by brain damage).  [[ICD 10]], the manual of medical diagnosis used in much of the world, includes separate diagnoses for "developmental dyslexia" (81.0)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ICD-10 Version:2015|url = http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F81.0|website = apps.who.int|accessdate = 4 November 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151102042503/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F81.0|archivedate = 2 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for "dyslexia and alexia" (48.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ICD-10 Version:2015|url = http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/R48.0|website = apps.who.int|accessdate = 4 November 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151102042503/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/R48.0|archivedate = 2 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DSM 5]], the manual of psychiatric diagnosis used in the United States, does not specifically define dyslexia, justifying this decision by stating that "the many definitions of dyslexia and dyscalculia meant those terms would not be useful as disorder names or in the diagnostic 
criteria". Instead it includes dyslexia in a category called [[learning disability|specific learning disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Specific%20Learning%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Specific learning disorders |work=American Psychiatric Publishing |year=2013 |accessdate=6 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923220742/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Specific%20Learning%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Characteristics of dyslexia}}
In early childhood, symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of dyslexia include [[speech delay|delayed onset]] of speech and a lack of phonological awareness, as well as being easily distracted by background noise.&lt;ref name=Handler2011/&gt; A common myth closely associates dyslexia with mirror writing and reading letters or words backwards.&lt;ref name="LilienfeldLynn2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;pg=PT88|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread Misconceptions about Human Behavior|last2=Lynn|first2=Steven Jay|last3=Ruscio|first3=John|last4=Beyerstein|first4=Barry L.|date=15 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-6074-5|pages=88–89|last1=Lilienfeld|first1=Scott O.|authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld|authorlink4=Barry Beyerstein|accessdate=19 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109130327/https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;pg=PT88|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are seen in many children as they learn to read and write, and are not considered to be defining characteristics of dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Handler2011/&gt;

Problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may accompany difficulties with summarizing stories, memorization, reading aloud, or learning foreign languages. Adults with dyslexia can often read with good comprehension, though they tend to read more slowly than others without a learning difficulty and perform worse in [[spelling]] tests or when reading nonsense words – a measure of phonological awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarrad|first1=Lum|title=Procedural learning is impaired in dyslexia: evidence from a meta-analysis of serial reaction time studies|journal=Research of Developmental Disabilities|date=October 2013|pages=3460–76|pmid=23920029|pmc=3784964|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2013.07.017|volume=34|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroanatomy===
{{Main|Neurological research into dyslexia}}
Modern [[neuroimaging]] techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] ([[fMRI]]) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have shown a correlation between both functional and structural differences in the brains of children with reading difficulties.&lt;ref name="Whitaker2010r"&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitaker, Harry A.|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Brain and Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNcDiRV2jJQC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-096499-7|page=180|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109173223/https://books.google.com/books?id=GNcDiRV2jJQC&amp;pg=PA180|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dyslexics show less electrical activation in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved with reading, such as the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], and the middle and [[Brodmann area 20|ventral temporal cortex]].&lt;ref name=Pammer2014/&gt; Over the past decade, brain activation studies using PET to study language have produced a breakthrough in the understanding of the neural basis of language. Neural bases for the visual [[lexicon]] and for auditory verbal [[short-term memory]] components have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=cathy|title=A Review and Synthesis of the first 20 years of Pet and fMRI studies of heard Speech, Spoken Language and Reading|journal=NeuroImage|date=16 August 2012|volume=62 |issue=2|pages=816–847|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.04.062|pmid=22584224|pmc=3398395}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some implication that the observed neural manifestation of developmental dyslexia is task-specific (i.e. functional rather than structural). fMRIs in dyslexics have provided important data which point to the interactive role of the [[cerebellum]] and cerebral cortex as well as other brain structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=S|title=Neuroimaging essentials in essential tremor: a systematic review.|journal=NeuroImage: Clinical|date=May 2014|pages=217–231|pmc=4110352|pmid=25068111|doi=10.1016/j.nicl.2014.05.003|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandler|first1=William|title=The genetic relationship between handedness and neurodevelopmental disorders|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|date=February 2014|pages=83–90|pmc=3969300|pmid=24275328|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2013.10.008|volume=20|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cerebellar theory of dyslexia proposes that impairment of cerebellum-controlled muscle movement affects the formation of words by the tongue and facial muscles, resulting in the [[fluency]] problems that are characteristic of some dyslexics. The cerebellum is also involved in the [[Autonomic nervous system|automatization]] of some tasks, such as reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cain|first1=Kate|title=Reading development and difficulties|date=2010|publisher=TJ International|page=134|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FT6RALjOr9QC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=cerebellar+theory+of+dyslexia#v=onepage&amp;q=cerebellar%20theory%20of%20dyslexia&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 March 2015|isbn=9781405151559}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that some dyslexic children have motor task and balance impairments has been used as evidence for a cerebellar role in their reading difficulties.

It is considered '"pure" because it is not accompanied by other significant language-related impairments. Pure dyslexia does not affect speech, handwriting style, language or comprehension impairments.&lt;ref name="Starrfelt 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Starrfelt |first1=Randi |last2=Ólafsdóttir |first2=Rannveig Rós |last3=Arendt |first3=Ida-Marie |year=2013 |title=Rehabilitation of pure alexia: A review |journal=Neuropsychological Rehabilitation |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=755–79 |pmid=23808895 |pmc=3805423 |doi=10.1080/09602011.2013.809661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure dyslexia is caused by lesions on the [[visual word form area|visual word form area (VWFA)]]. The VWFA is composed of the left [[lateral occipital sulcus]] and is activated during reading. A lesion in the VWFA stops transmission between the [[visual cortex]] and the left [[angular gyrus]]. It can also be caused by a lesion involving the left [[occipital lobe]] or the [[splenium]].

==History==
{{Main|History of developmental dyslexia}}
Dyslexia was identified by [[Oswald Berkhan]] in 1881,&lt;ref name="Oswald Berkhan ref 1"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Berkhan O |year=1917 |title=Über die Wortblindheit, ein Stammeln im Sprechen und Schreiben, ein Fehl im Lesen |trans-title=About word blindness, adyslalia of speech and writing, a weakness in reading |language=German |journal=Neurologisches Centralblatt |volume=36 |pages=914–27 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DmEsAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AUCALB3248710&amp;q=Wortblindheit#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term ''dyslexia'' was coined in 1887 by [[Rudolf Berlin]], an [[ophthalmologist]] in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=''Über Dyslexie'' |trans-title=About dyslexia |year=1884 |journal=Archiv für Psychiatrie |volume=15 |pages=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term to refer to the case of a young boy who had a severe impairment in learning to read and write, despite showing typical intelligence and physical abilities in all other respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences and Analytical Index: A Yearly Report of the Progress of the General Sanitary Sciences Throughout the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_IhAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|year=1888|publisher=F.

Pringle Morgan, a British physician from [[Seaford, East Sussex]], published a description of a reading-specific learning disorder in a report to the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' titled "Congenital Word Blindness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Patricia|title=Encyclopedia of language development|date=2014|publisher=SAGE|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mvfSAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR30|isbn=9781483346434}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between phonological and surface types of dyslexia is only descriptive, and without any etiological assumption as to the underlying brain mechanisms. However, studies have alluded to potential differences due to variation in performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mishra|first1=Srikanta K.|title=Medial efferent mechanisms in children with auditory processing disorders.|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=October 2014|pmid=25386132|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00860|pmc=4209830|volume=8|pages=860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and society==
{{Main|Dyslexia research}}
{{See also|International Dyslexia Association}}
The majority of currently available dyslexia research relates to [[Writing system|alphabetic writing system]]s, and especially to [[Languages of Europe|European languages]].&lt;ref name="Reid2012a"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Gavin|title=The Routledge Companion to Dyslexia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrBQAmfXYooC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-61710-2|page=16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109205019/https://books.google.com/books?id=QrBQAmfXYooC&amp;pg=PA16|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, substantial research is also available regarding dyslexics who speak Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, or other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richlan|first1=Fabio|title=Functional neuroanatomy of developmental dyslexia; the role of orthographic depth|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=May 2014|pmid=24904383|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00347|pmc=4033006|volume=8|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case with any disorder, society often makes an assessment based on incomplete information. Before the 1980s, dyslexia was thought to be a consequence of education, rather than a basic disability. As a result, society often misjudges those with the disorder.&lt;ref name=pmid21046003/&gt; There is also sometimes a workplace stigma and negative attitude towards those with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Berr|first1=J|title=Factors influencing work participation of adults with developmental dyslexia|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|pmc=3913008|pmid=24460949|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-77|volume=14|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a dyslexic's instructors lack the necessary training to support a child with the condition, there is often a negative effect on the student's learning participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Inclusion of Students with Dyslexia in Higher Education: A Systematic Review Using Narrative Synthesis|journal = Dyslexia (Chichester, England)|date = 1 November 2014|pmc = 4253321|pmid = 25293652|pages = 346–369|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/dys.1484|first = Marco|last = Pino|first2 = Luigina|last2 = Mortari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">An '''Environmental Literacy Plan''' (ELP) refers to a state education plan to teach about how ecosystems and human systems are interdependent, particularly, how the consumption choices human beings make alter their ability to live sustainably. ELP’s serve as a central component of the [[No Child Left Inside (movement)]] (NCLI) of 2008 which the House of Representatives passed on September 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by the NCLI of 2008, ELP’s must contain numerous and explicit provisions. The [[North American Association for Environmental Education]] (NAAEE) condenses NCLI act into five components which allow states to become eligibile for funds allocated through the NCLI act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Association of Environmental Education|url=http://www.naaee.net/|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The purpose of an ELP is to create a comprehensive education plan for environmental literacy that can be evaluated on the basis of student learning outcomes. the NCLI legislation defines goals as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancing content and achievement standards, Developing or disseminating innovations or model programs, Research, particularly on integrating environmental education in the study of other subjects

== Definition ==
An Environmental Literacy Plan (ELP) refers to a state education plan to teach about how ecosystems and human systems are interdependent, particularly, how the consumption choices human beings make alter their ability to live sustainably. ELP’s serve as a central component of the 2008 [[No Child Left Inside (movement)]] (NCLI)  which the House of Representatives passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State standards, content areas, and courses or subjects ===

Environmental Literacy Plan’s include environmental literacy content standards in grades Pre-K through 12th grade. Curriculum integration of the environmental literacy standards into the curriculum occur through content integration or as standalone topics of learning. "Attention should be paid to mandated learning outcomes and curriculum content, standardized tests, and instructional syllabuses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkowitz|first=Alan|title=New Opportunities for ecology education in the United States in Ecology for Education|year=1993|publisher=New Cambridge Press|location=Cambridge|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clear and supported learning standards are required to ensure high school graduates possess a determined degree of environmental literacy.

=== High school graduation requirements ===
One  component of an ELP is the consideration of how environmental literacy will be incorporated into the state’s graduation requirement. Hence high school courses should be aligned with the topic of environmental literacy, programming opportunities for students should be offered or credits for environmental literacy should be a requirement for graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Developing a State Environmental  Literacy Plan|journal=North American Association for Environmental Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional development ===

The ELP provides provisions for both pre-service and in-service teacher preparation. Teacher preparation within the field of environmental literacy will need to support learning using place-based and experiential learning strategies. "The work of reorienting teachers education for the values of sustainability is crucial to creating a new understanding of ourselves and our place in communities, in the living world and in traditions of relational reciprocity that will sustain us all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Patrick|title=Who Will Teach the Teachers in Teaching Sustainability, Teaching Sustainably| year=2012| publisher=Stylus Pub|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment of environmental literacy ===
The initial ELP should contain a detailed description of how the state education agency will assess and measure the learning achieved through the implementation of the ELP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment of environmental literacy of students will measure the extent to which the ELP was successful.

=== Implementation and support ===
Key logistical and implementation issues will be addressed within the ELP. One of the most essential components of the ELP is  planning for future funding and support. As designated by the NCLI act of 2008 funding tampers off after the initial year of implementation and eventually reduces to 50% of total program expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=govgtrack.us|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ELP outlines and anticipates future sources of funding for the state environmental literacy program. The ELP also considers how federal and state education-related legislation and initiatives such as IDEA or STEM funding will be integrated into the overall environmental literacy program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20625">The '''Essar leaks''' include e-mails, office memos, telephone conversations and other records allegedly leaked from the systems of the Indian business conglomerate [[Essar Group]]. The leaked records allegedly contain evidence of politician-corporate nexus in India, and show how business interests unfairly manipulate Indian government and judiciary.

In 2015, an unnamed [[whistleblower]] leaked a set of internal e-mails and memos from the Essar Group, alleging that the conglomerate had granted favours to several politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. Essar denied the allegations, terming the alleged favours as "common courtesies" that are legally justifiable. Essar also claimed that some of the leaked material was fabricated, and was being used to [[blackmail]] them.

In May 2016, lawyer Suren Uppal reported the existence of a new set of secretly recorded conversations to the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]]. The conversations involve influential politicians, bureaucrats, businesspeople, bankers, and other [[very important person|VIP]]s. Uppal claimed to have received these tapes from the former Essar employee Albasit Khan, and alleged that the Essar officials illegally [[telephone tapping|tapped]] these conversations during the 2000s. In June 2016, after the ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' magazine made Uppal's claims public, Khan denied Essar's role in tapping the conversations. He acknowledged the existence of the tapes, but stated he had received these tapes from the now-deceased [[Mumbai Police]] officer [[Vijay Salaskar]], a claim denied by Mumbai Police. According to Khan, the ultimate source and authenticity of the tapes are unknown. He admitted to having informed Uppal about the tapes, but accused Uppal of fabricating the Essar link to extort money from the business. Uppal denied the allegations, and promised to release the tapes to the [[Supreme Court of India]]. Essar completely denied the story, accusing Suren Uppal of being an extortionist.

== Background ==

=== 2015 leak: E-mails and memos ===

In 2015, a [[whistleblower]] approached lawyer-activist [[Prashant Bhushan]], and leaked a set of internal e-mails and memos from Essar Group. The material indicated that Essar Group had granted favours to several politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. This led to allegations that Essar had been trying to unfairly influence public policy and opinion. Bhushan's [[Centre for Public Interest Litigation]] (CPIL) filed a [[Public interest litigation in India|PIL]] before the [[Supreme Court of India]], requesting an investigation into these allegations.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/doing-needful-essar-industry-influence |title=Doing The Needful |author=Krishn Kaushik |publisher=Caravan |date=1 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Essar Group filed an affidavit seeking dismissal of the PIL, calling the favours as legally justifiable "common courtesies".&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-calls-its-favours-to-government-officials-common-courtesies/ |title=Essar Group calls its favours to govt officials ‘common courtesies’ |author=Utkarsh Anand |newspaper=Indian Express |date=26 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 leak: Phone tapping ===

On 1 June 2016, the Delhi-based lawyer Suren Uppal submitted a 29-page complaint to [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] alleging that Essar had [[telephone tapping|tapped]] VIP conversations during 2000s.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-tapped-ambani-brothers-suresh-prabhu-atal-bihari-vajpayee-pmo-staff-rajiv-mehrishi-2857573/ |title=PMO gets complaint: Essar allegedly tapped Ambani brothers, Suresh Prabhu, Vajpayee PMO staff |newspaper=Indian Express |author=Ritu Sarin |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Uppal, the Essar Group had carried out the [[cellphone surveillance|surveillance]] on the Prime Minister's Office (starting with [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee|A. B. Vajpayee]]), the cabinet ministers, government bureaucrats and rival businesspeople.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"/&gt;

According to Uppal, the tapping was done under the supervision of Albasit Khan (or Basit Khan), a former head of security and vigilance at Essar Group. Uppal claims to be Khan's former legal representative, and has alleged that Khan was forced to resign from Essar in 2011, after being accused of keeping back some of the recorded conversations.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"/&gt; He has alleged that "special mobile SIM cards or the mobile interceptor mobile SIM cards" were used to tap the conversations.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"/&gt; Until 2005, the surveillance was carried out over the [[BPL Mobile]] network, which had been under Essar's control. The network was also used by Essar's rival [[Reliance Industries Limited]] (RIL), which allowed Essar to tap their conversations. However, RIL moved out of this network after 2005. After that, Essar allegedly used [[Hutchison Essar|Hutchison]] network for the tapping.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"/&gt;

In June 2016, the ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' magazine published a report on these tapped conversations.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/outlooks-essar-leaks-claim-reliance-remotely-controls-all-pillars-indian-democracy-45001 |title=Outlook's Essar leaks: Tapes claim Reliance remotely controls all pillars of Indian democracy |publisher=The News Minute |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Albasit Khan told the media that Essar had not recorded these conversations, and stated that their source and authenticity were unknown. Khan acknowledged the existence of tapes containing the conversations, but stated that the [[Mumbai Police]] officer [[Vijay Salaskar]] had given these tapes to him for "safekeeping" in 2005. Mumbai Police denied this, and ''Outlook'' doubted Khan's claim, pointing out that the tapes include conversations from as late as 2011.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/mumbai-police-dismiss-essar-whistle-blowers-claim-that-crime-branch-was-tapes-so/296982 |title=Mumbai Police Dismiss Essar Whistle-Blower's Claim That Crime Branch Was Tapes' Source |publisher=Outlook |author=Meetu Jain |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan admitted that had had met Uppal in January 2016, and had informed him about the tapes. But he denied hiring Uppal as his lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/essar-leaks-how-the-story-changed-overnight-1466238985.html |title=Essar leaks: How the story changed overnight |author=Charu Kartikeya |publisher=Catch News |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan alleged Uppal of fabricating the Essar link to extort money from the business.&lt;ref name="IE_slams"/&gt; In response, Uppal claimed that he and Khan had been working to "expose" the tapping, but Khan backed out under Essar Group's influence. He promised to hand over the alleged tapes to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] as part of a [[Public interest litigation in India|Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL).&lt;ref name="IE_slams"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/vvips-phone-tapping-ex-essar-employee-slams-lawyer-suren-uppal-who-in-turn-shows-emails-to-establish-link-2859990/ |title=Ex-Essar employee slams lawyer Uppal who, in turn, shows emails to ‘establish link’ |author=Ritu Sarin |newspaper=Indian Express |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a June 2009 memo, senior executive Sunil Bajaj suggested giving 200 high-end cell phones to senior politicians and bureaucrats of the new UPA government, in order to "invest on right people at the right places for reaping long-term benefits".

* In another 2009 e-mail, Sunil Bajaj suggested earmarking at least 200 recruitment slots for job referrals from powerful politicians and bureaucrats. He argued that the recommended candidates were often "highly qualified", so the company would not have a problem hiring them.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* Later e-mails from 2012 and 2013 show that Essar hired at least 60 people recommended by VIPs, which included:&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

* In one e-mail, Essar's corporate communications executive stated that she had "coordinated" a story about Essar's involvement in the [[2G spectrum case]], in the magazines ''[[Tehelka]]'' and ''[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]''. Prashant Bhushan identified the ''Tehelka'' story as ''Madness in CBI's method'', written by the journalist [[Ashish Khetan]] (now an [[Aam Aadmi Party]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]]). In this article, Khetan criticized the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] for unfairly targeting Essar in the scam investigation. The article was published in December 2011, a month after Essar paid Tehelka {{INR}} 30 million as sponsorship amount for the magazine's ''Think Fest'' event.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* A set of e-mails reveal that the Steel ministry's joint secretary Syedain Abbasi was granted accommodation at Essar's guest house in Delhi, although he was eligible for government-granted accommodation. In a 2013 email, the Essar executive Rajamani Krishnamurti describes Abbasi as "a very important person" who was handling the "majority of Essar’s issues". The e-mail reveals that Abbasi had advised Essar to oppose a particular government proposal through industry bodies such as [[ASSOCHAM]], [[Confederation of Indian Industry|CII]], and [[Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry|FICCI]].&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* An e-mail sent by Sunil Bajaj before the [[Diwali]] festival of 2013 suggested distributing gifts "to person in the middle and the lower ranks in various ministries, who are very vital in sustenance and procurement of important information and documents." The e-mail indicate that the Essar officials had access to confidential government communication from multiple ministries, including Coal, Environment, Finance, Petroleum, Railways, Shipping and Steel. The Essar officials were in close contact with the Petroleum Minister [[Veerappa Moily]], and had access to the 2012-13 budget proposals for his Ministry.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* E-mail correspondence between Essar executives shows that BJP leader [[Nitin Gadkari]] and his family enjoyed a 2-night stay on an Essar luxury yacht in [[French Riviera]] during 7–9 July 2013. Essar also arranged their stay on the [[Sunrays (yacht)|Sunrays]] yacht for a day, including a helicopter trip to and from the [[Nice]] airport.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;
* Essar's internal records show that the company executives regularly arranged cabs for some Delhi-based journalists.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt; These journalists included Anupama Airy (''Hindustan Times''), Meetu Jain (''[[CNN-IBN]]''), and Sandeep Bamzai (''Mail Today'').&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/essar-leaks-2-journalists-resign-third-put-on-notice/ |title=Essar Leaks: 2 journalists resign, third put on notice |author=Archna Shukla |newspaper=Indian Express |date=28 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Essar Group ===

In the 2015 affidavit seeking dismissial of CPIL's request for investigation, the Essar Group stated that they had not derived any benefits from the alleged favours. The affidavit stated that there was no evidence of any criminal offence by Essar Group, and the alleged favours "common courtesies extended by corporate houses".&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

Essar filed a police complaint for data theft, and threatened legal action against media outlets that publish "any allegations based on any email stolen from the system":&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/essar-leaks-french-cruise-for-gadkari-favours-to-upa-minister-journalists/ |title=Essar Leaks: French cruise for Nitin Gadkari, favours to UPA Minister, journalists |author=Appu Esthose Suresh and Ritu Sarin |newspaper=Indian Express |date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the last few weeks we have received anonymous phone calls from people purported to have mail stolen from our systems and on which basis there have been some demands for money at the threat of publishing prejudicial material. It is curious that some of the queries reflect the kind of material on which we were sought to be blackmailed.

It is apparent that some of the material is fabricated and some of the allegations are conclusions and inferences being drawn from email stolen from our computers.|Essar Group press statement, 2015}}

When ''[[The Caravan]]'' published a cover story critical of the company, the Essar group filed a {{INR}} 2500 million [[defamation]] suit against the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/l7p8QtAzYYCRFzRHWVTZ0I/SC-declines-to-transfer-Essar-defamation-suit-against-Carav.html |title=SC declines to transfer Essar defamation suit against ‘Caravan’ to Delhi |author=Shreeja Sen |publisher=Live Mint |date=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essar also questioned the authenticity of the leaked e-mails, calling them "unverified" and "pure hearsay". It stated that the company had not recruited people based solely on VIP recommendations, calling such recommendations legal and proper in Indian context.&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

Essar accused CPIL of launching a smear campaign against them to seek publicity.&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

=== People named in the leaks ===

BJP leader Nitin Gadkari denied extending any favours to the Essar Group, while commenting on his Essar-sponsored yacht stays. He stated that he was not a minister or the BJP President at the time, and paid for his family's Norway vacation using his own money. When Ruias (Essar owners) learned that he was visiting Europe, they invited him to their yacht as a family friend.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;

Sriprakash Jaiswal and Digvijaya Singh defended themselves stating they regularly make referrals to companies, to help unemployed people. Varun Gandhi stated that his office regularly gave letters of recommendations to educated unemployed youth after "satisfying their bonafide credentials."&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;

Journalists Anupama Airy and Sandeep Bamzai resigned after being named among those for whom Essar had arranged cabs.&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"/&gt; Airy stated that she had requested a cab from Essar "as help from a friend", and not as a journalist. She also expressed displeasure at being singled out, stating that other journalists at ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' had sought such help from businesses in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/socials/602 |title=Hindustan Times journalist who quit over Essar leaks questions senior editors about professional ethics |author=Dhanya Rajendran |publisher=The News Minute |date=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamzai denied publishing any biased news to favour Essar Group, and stated that asking them for a cab was simply "a stupid mistake". Meetu Jain had asked Essar for a cab in 2012, when she was working with CNN-IBN. At the time her name was released, she was working as a Deputy News Editor at [[Times Now]], which initiated an internal inquiry against her.&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"/&gt;

=== Others ===

The [[Aam Aadmi Party]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] demanded that the alleged tapes be made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/congress-responds-to-indian-express-report-on-essar-tapes-demands-the-tapes-be-made-public-2858448/ |title=Congress responds to Indian Express report on Essar tapes, demands the tapes be made public |newspaper=Indian Express |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-leaks-aap-joins-chorus-demands-the-tapes-be-made-public-2861057/ |title=Essar leaks: AAP joins chorus, demands the tapes be made public |newspaper=Indian Express |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] ordered the Home Ministry to conduct an inquiry, and submit a detailed report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/essar-leaks-narendra-modi-indian-express/1/695383.html |title=Modi orders probe into Essar leaks, asks Home Ministry to submit report |author=Rahul Kanwal |publisher=India Today |date=19 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick Clifford Dixon.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Frederick Clifford Dixon, 1920's]]
'''Frederick Clifford Dixon''' (5 December 1902 – 5 May 1992) was notable for his [[etchings]] depicting urban life in London in an intricate, realistic and witty manner.  His artistic career was cut short with the decline in the print market after the boom years of the 1920s. He then embarked on a career as an art teacher in order to make a living.

== Personal life ==

Frederick Clifford Dixon (also known as Charles) was born in [[Derby]] in 1902. His initial art training took place at [[Derby School of Art]] and Crafts (1920–1924) before attending the School of Engraving at the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA) in London (1924–1928) with the assistance of a small scholarship from Derby Education Authority. He gained a Diploma in Etching in 1927 and a Teacher's Certificate in 1928 (SoA Archives).

By the time Dixon graduated from the RCA the decline in the etching market had begun, a decline compounded by the negative economic consequences of the [[Wall Street Crash]] in America in October 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seductive Art: The British Passion for Etching, 1850–1950|last=Harvey-Lee|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Elizabeth Harvey-Lee|year=2001|isbn=1902863046|location=North Aston, Oxon, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years that followed many artists ceased etching and took up other professions.  Dixon used his teaching qualification, awarded in his last year at the RCA, to become an art teacher. He taught in schools in the next four decades in Morecambe Bay, Ashton-under-Lyne, Altrincham and finally Cheshire Council Training College in Alsager until 1963.  He had not been able to serve in the 2nd World War, he was ruled medically unfit because he had had [[tuberculosis]] in childhood. After retiring from teaching in 1963 Dixon moved to [[Goring-on-Thames]]. In retirement he had a small sailing boat on the Thames and was an active member of the local history society until his death in 1992.

In 1933 he married Chris Glover and they had one son, John, born in 1937.

[[File:Northern Town v1.jpg|thumb|''Northern Town'' Etching by Frederick Clifford Dixon, 1928]]

At the time Dixon was attending the RCA, [[William Rothenstein]] was principal, [[Malcolm Osborne]] RA was the Professor of Engraving and Job Nixon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Nixon – The Temple of Venus and Rome, Rome, circa 1922|url=http://www.lissfineart.com/1638sub0_22.htm|website=www.lissfineart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Osborne's assistant lecturer and a winner of the [[Prix de Rome|Prix de Rome Scholarship]] in Engraving&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engraving – Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/e/engraving|website=www.tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1920).

Dixon studied alongside some of the major figures in British early twentieth century printmaking, such as [[Edward Bawden]], [[Eric Ravilious|Eric Ravillious]], Charles Tunnicliffe, a friend of Dixon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tunnicliffe Society – London Times!|url=http://www.thecharlestunnicliffesociety.co.uk/londontimes.html|website=www.thecharlestunnicliffesociety.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Adnams]], [[Evelyn Gibbs]], Kenneth Holmes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth Holmes (Biographical details)|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=120793|website=British Museum|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grace Golden]]. He graduated with fellow students Frederick Austin, [[Stanley Roy Badmin|Stanley Badmin]], Enid Butcher, [[Ceri Richards|Ceri G. Richards]] and James Cresser Tarr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist/Maker: James Cresser Tarr  – Aberystwyth University School of Art Museums and Galleries|url=http://museum.aber.ac.uk/person/861|website=museum.aber.ac.uk|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon was encouraged by Rothenstein to become a professional artist but he decided that it was not the career for him; partly because the print market was already in decline having taken a 'fatal knock in the Great Crash of 1929'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portrait of a Country Artist : C. F. Tunnicliffe|last=Niall|first=Ian|publisher=Victor Gollancz ltd|year=1985|isbn=057503694X|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly because he felt that he produced work too slowly to make a decent living.

== Artwork==

During his short artistic career Dixon used his 'keen sense of observation&lt;ref&gt;Derby Daily Telegraph,. "Artistic Derby". 1927: n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;' to produce intricate etchings that capture wonderfully a sense of the period. Contemporary critics noted his ability to depict 'human characteristics of different types', 'treated in a realistic and humorous manner'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mr. F. C. Dixon : A Young Derby Artist Wins Recognition|last=|first=|date=25 March 1927|work=|publisher=|newspaper=Derbyshire Advert|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst a student at the RCA Dixon exhibited his etching ''The British Museum Portico, Night'' at the Royal Academy Exhibition in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection object details|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=2477&amp;partId=1&amp;place=42360&amp;plaA=42360-1-4&amp;page=1|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; This print, along with five others, is now in the collection of The British Museum, Department of Prints and Drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection object details|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=2476&amp;partId=1&amp;people=126940&amp;peoA=126940-3-17&amp;page=1|website=British Museum|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This etching was chosen by Sir Muirhead Bone, along with other the work of other notable printmakers of the day, including [[Stanley Anderson (artist)|Stanley Anderson]], [[Christopher R. W. Nevinson|C R W Nevinson]], Job Nixon and [[William Strang]]e RA, for display on the walls of the banking hall of [[Williams Deacon's Bank]] Limited, West End Office 9, Pall Mall, S.W.1. The [[Museum of London]] also holds a number of Dixon's prints.

Dixons work was shown extensively during 1927 in a number of exhibitions including The British School of Rome Imperial Gallery of Art, the New English Art Gallery where his etching ''Putney Hill: Sunday Morning'' was described as ‘bright and lively’,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baily|first=James Thomas Herbert|year=1927|title=Current Art Notes: The "New English"|url=|journal=The Connoisseur|publisher=Otto Limited|volume=78|page=61|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Royal College of Art Sketch Club Exhibition noted the work as 'strongly satirical' with a 'feeling for the social "aura" of a place'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laver|first=James|date=|year=March 1927|orig-year=1927|title=Recent Etching and Engraving|url=|journal=Artwork: A Quarterly |volume=3–4 |issue=12|page=228|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also exhibited in art galleries in [[Derby]] and [[Nottingham]].

[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]] described his work at the [[New English Art Club]] as  &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Transcending the almost maniacal distortion of the pioneers of the modern movement''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=19 March 1927|title=Comprehensible Modernity in Contemporary Art|url=|journal=The Sphere : The Empire's Illustrated Weekly|publisher=London|volume= CVIII| issue =  1417|page=453|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Donation to Aberystwyth University ==

A recent exhibition at the [[Aberystwyth University]] School of Art Gallery (30 November 2015 – 15 January 2016) featured not only thirteen of Dixon's own etchings of British urban and rural life but also twenty-three prints by his contemporaries which he acquired by exchange or gift.  As a result of this exhibition a number of Dixon's works were given to the collection by the family. The collection in Aberystwyth now has the most comprehensive holdings of Dixon's work.  Included in the acquisition were a number of his etchings and preparatory drawings for ''Regents Street'' (1927) and ''Putney Hill'' (1926) and a pencil portrait of [[Ceri Richards|Ceri Giraldus Richards]] made in the mid 1920s.

'''Heiko Augustinus Oberman''' (15 October 1930 – 22 April 2001) was a Dutch [[historian]] and [[theologian]] who specialized in the study of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

==Life==
Oberman was born in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. He earned his doctorate in [[theology]] from the [[University of Utrecht]] in 1957 and joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1958. There he rose rapidly from instructor to associate professor and, in 1963, to professor of church history. He was appointed [[Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History]] at [[Harvard]] in 1964 and continued teaching there until 1966. He then accepted a chair in the theology faculty at the [[University of Tübingen]], [[Germany]], where he also became director of the Institute for [[Late Middle Ages]] and Reformation Research.  Later in life, Oberman founded the Division for Late Medieval and Reformation Studies at the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Founder Heiko A. Oberman  {{!}} The Division for Late Medieval and Reformation Studies|url = http://dlmrs.web.arizona.edu/node/541|website = dlmrs.web.arizona.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major books include ''The Harvest of Medieval Theology: [[Gabriel Biel]] and Late Medieval [[Nominalism]]'' (1963), which articulated his program of bridging the gap between the later Middle Ages and Reformation era (at least in the field of theology), and an iconoclastic biography of [[Martin Luther|Luther]], translated from German as ''Luther: Man between God and the Devil'' (1989).

==Honors==
Numerous honorary degrees and affiliations in the United States and abroad pay homage to Oberman’s stature as a scholar and an educator. He became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002126 |title=Heiko Augustinus Oberman (1930 - 2001) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences awarded him the prestigious [[Dr A.H. Heineken Prize]] for History — the highest honor a historian can receive — and, in 2001, shortly before his death, he was told that he would be awarded a [[knighthood]] by [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands in 2002 for extraordinary representation of Dutch scholarship and culture. At the [[University of Arizona]], he was named Regents’ Professor of History in 1988 and was honored with the 5-Star Faculty Teaching Award in 1989, the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences Teaching Award for Graduate Instruction in 1999, and the SBS Board of Advisors Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.

[[File:ProtestDS.JPG|thumbnail|Protest against the persecution of Homeschooling in South Africa at the Deutsche Schule in Pretoria in 2007]]

'''Home schooling in South Africa''' (often referred to as home education) had been illegal, until it was recognized in 1996 under the [[South Africa]]n School Legislation, since when it has since grown significantly.

==History==
Notable moments in the history of [[home schooling]] are provided below. Most of the content comes directly from primary sources and has not been documented anywhere yet:

=== 1868-1900 ===
Dr Andrew Murray was the only minister in the Nederduitsch Gereformeerde (NG) church in the Free State and Transvaal, and he was based in [[Bloemfontein]].  He was tasked to travel through both republics baptizing people, giving catechism and performing marriage ceremonies. Dr. Murray was surprised that he very seldom found young people that were illiterate, in reading, writing and arithmetic and this despite the fact that there were no schools in the area traveled. Nomad farmers bordering the north east of the Cape Colony in the eighteen hundreds had no schools, teachers or religious ministers, and yet literacy was a universal occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Email from Leendert van Oostrum on Tuisondwerwys mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1900-1991 ===
Government schools increased in implementation and the freedom of home schooling was increasingly limited. By the 1990s only a few families were allowed to homeschool under severe restrictions, if they could have their children exempted from compulsory school attendance. That was only granted up to Grade 3, if the family lived more than 80&amp;nbsp;km from the nearest school and if the child(ren) were taught by a teacher qualified to teach the junior primary phase.&lt;ref&gt;http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1992 ===
The Association for Homeschooling is established. &lt;ref&gt;http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1993 (Homeschoolers jailed) ===
On 14 December 1993 Andre and Bokkie  Meintjies were sentenced to prison because their children did not attend formal school. In a court case that lasted for almost five years, Andre was sentenced to two years and Bokkie one year in separate jails in Johannesburg, and this while their three children were placed in an [[orphanage]] in the Eastern Cape to prevent contact between the parents and children. Several other parents were given suspended sentences on condition they put their children in schools. All of those parents still have criminal records.&lt;ref&gt;http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994 ===
A group action was launched by the Association for Homeschooling and the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) from the USA that led to release of both Bokkie and Andre. The Meintjies couple were however released six months later under a blanket [[amnesty]] for prisoners with the implementation of the new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000074.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1995 ===
Concept legislation was published to the effect that home schooling was to be illegal in South Africa. This led to a campaign being launched by home school leaders like Leendert van Oostrum, Graham Shortridge and Kate Durham with the HSLDA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000074.asp|title=South Africa:
The Struggle for the Freedom to Home School|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thousands of home schoolers in the USA wrote letters to the South African embassy in the USA in support of this campaign. In that time, SA was still expecting to receive large grants from America, and American public opinion was taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000074.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996 (SA Schools Act acknowledges home education) ===
In November of this year the SA Schools Act was promulgated wherein home schooling was recognized. In December of the same year, the new [[constitution of South Africa]] was accepted, in which the legal status of home schooling was entrenched more securely. The act requires that every home learner be registered with the relevant provincial education department – unless there is good reason not to.&lt;ref&gt;https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000074.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998 ===
The Pestalozzi Trust is established in accordance with a brief from the general meeting of the Association for Homeschooling to serve as a legal fund to ensure the continued freedom and to promote such freedom.&lt;ref&gt;https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000073.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1999 ===
Mr. Kader Asmal publishes the national policy concerning the registration of home schoolers, wherein the input from both the home schooling contingent and the provincial education departments is totally ignored. The Pestalozzi Trust advises home schoolers that the policy is in direct conflict with the SA Schools Act, and therefore not enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;https://hslda.org/content/docs/nche/000000/00000073.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2001 ===
* '''Feb''' : In February 2001 the police accompanied by the media arrived at the home of Doddie Kleyhans to arrest her. Within three minutes The Pestalozzi Trust had an attorney on the line to the senior police officer on the scene. The attorney made it clear to the policeman that the whole issue was not arrest worthy, and that it was completely sufficient to warn her that a case was being investigated against her. This they did. And Beeld newspaper carried a front-page article about the issue. The posters against lampposts led with “''Government vs Mother''”. Due to great pressure from the office of the minister of education, the case was never closed but also never prosecuted. Till her death the cloud of prosecution hung over Doddie.&lt;ref&gt;http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oct''' : The Constitutional Court rules that the case of Harris that policies such as the registration of home schoolers may not be enforced on them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2001/25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002(Revised National Curriculum) ===
The Pestalozzi Trust organizes a campaign against the acceptance of the Revised National Curriculum, which would be compulsory for government- private schools as well as home schooling. In this curriculum children would be compelled to approve inter faith religion. At the end of the campaign a protest is held in Cape Town and on Church Square in Pretoria. Leendert van Oostrum of the Pestalozzi Trust was requested to do a presentation to the parliamentary portfolio committee on education.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the campaign against the curriculum was reported by members on the Tuisonderwys mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2004 ===
The Gauteng department of education arranges a series of meetings to try and intimidate parents to register and to demand compliance to a range of  irregular demands. Representatives of the Pestalozzi Trust and the Association for Homeschooling attended all the meetings. The officials only wanted to discuss the registration process, and interactive discussion with homeschooling parents was strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/reports-by-association-for-homeschooling.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005 ===
In 2005 the Department of Basic Education (DBE) advertised for tenders for research on home education in South Africa. The budget was small and the terms of reference very restrictive. A tender by Wits Education Policy Unit was accepted, and they submitted their report in 2008. Given the restrictions on the researchers, the report was successful in describing the homeschooling community as it then was, and its recommendations were mostly reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;http://pestalozzi.org/web2/en/2016/08/30/and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 ===
In opposition of the prosecution of home schoolers in Germany, the Association for Homeschooling holds a protest at the Deutsche Schule in Pretoria to bring this to the attention of the German community.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents/80-2007-letter-to-the-german-embassy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008 (New regulations for NSC) ===
New regulations on the administration of matric were promulgated. These regulations require that learners must complete Gr. 10 and Gr. 11 in order to be admitted to write the Gr. 12 exam. Whereas it was possible for homelearners to obtain a matric in less than a year at a cost of about R1000, it will now take 3 years at a cost of about R30 000. Due to this increase in duration and cost of the National Senior Certificate, international matric qualifications such as Cambridge (UK) and General Educational Development (USA) became increasingly popular under homeschoolers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ZlgknpSYL3g%3d&amp;tabid=390&amp;portalid=0&amp;mid=1127&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 ===
The Association for Homeschooling launches an initiative for an independent website on home education. The website ''SAHomeschoolers.Org'' has since grown to the most comprehensive independent website concerning home schooling in South Africa. Home Schooling Expos become more commonplace. Since this year there are annual expos in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and George.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Aug''' : The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) publishes a notice in local papers in which they state that parents must register before 30 Sep in the year before they start with home education and that home education must be in line with the National Curriculum Statement. As a reaction the Association for Homeschooling and the Pestalozzi Trust wrote a letter to the WCED. A deputation of the Association, the Pestalozzi Trust and Cape Home Educators had a meeting with officials of the WCED to explain the issues caused by the notice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents/99-2014-letter-from-pestalozzi-trust-to-minister-donald-grant.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 (Home education in census) ===
* '''Mar''' : In a court case between the BCVO and the Minister of Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2012/45.html|title=Beweging vir Christelik-Volkseie Onderwys and Others v Minister of Education and Others (308/2011) [2012] ZASCA 45; [2012] 2 All SA 462 (SCA) (29 March 2012)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Judge Cynthia Pretorius makes a remark that the national curriculum is not binding on independent schools and parents that home school their children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/entry/court-confirms-national-curriculum-not-binding-on-private-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oct''' : In the Census of 2011 there is a question about home education (Question P-18) for the first time. In the question about which type of education institution is attended, there was an option to select home education. According to the results, 56 857 learners receive home education in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/entry/how-many-home-learners-are-there-in-south-africa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 (Home education discussed in parliament) ===
* '''7 Aug''' : In a Portfolio Committee meeting on Basic Education on 7 August 2012 the Department of Education stated that “''the Department is currently developing policy in respect of home schooling''”
* '''8 Aug''' : The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) publishes the same notice of 2010 in local papers again. The Association for Homeschooling wrote a response to this notice, which was published in a number of local paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/home/entry/weskaapse-onderwysdepartement-intimideer-tuisskoolouers.html Blog about notice of WCED]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}}
* '''6 Sep''' : In response to the above question, Ms Cherylynn Dudley (ACDP) asked the Minister of Basic Education when this policy will be available and what the content will be.
* '''11 Sep''' : The minister responded that the policy will available April/May 2013, because they have to go through an extensive consultation process.

=== 2013 ===
According to the results of the 2012 census, there are approximately 57000 home schooling students in South Africa. If all these learners were to be accommodated in schools, 130 schools would be required as well as 2000 teachers. Currently the government is saving approximately R700 million per year because the government is not paying for the education of these children.

* '''7 May''' : The Association for Homeschooling requested Ms Cherylynn Dudley (ACDP) to ask the minister who the Department of Education has contacted during their "''extensive consultation process''".
* '''12 Aug''' : Ms Cherylynn Dudley (ACDP) asked the minister who the Department of Education has contacted during their "''extensive consultation process''".
* '''2 Sep''' :  The minister responds and states that no homeschooling organisations have been consulted, but that she is open to work with homeschooling organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Mk1ip7FoZPM%3d&amp;tabid=859 Ministers response]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014(Western Cape issues draft policy) ===
At the start of the year Pestalozzi Trust publishes an article "Homeschooling running into heavy weather".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pestalozzi.org/nuusbriewe/2013.1.pdf Homeschooling running into heavy weather]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''7 Feb''' :  Referring to the minister's statement that she is open to work with homeschooling organisation, Cape Home Educators sends a letter to the Minister of Education putting it on record that they represent homeschooling families in the Western Cape. A copy is sent to the Western Cape Department of Education.
* '''11 Feb''' :  In response to the above letter, the WCED sends a copy of the draft policy on home education stating to Cape Home Educators : The Provincial Minister of Education in the Western Cape is in the process of finalising the Policy on Education at Home for this province" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/legal-a-research/laws-regulations-and-policies/doc_download/18-wced-draft-policy-on-education-at-home.html WECD Letter]&lt;/ref&gt; " This policy is widely distributed to homeschoolers.
* '''12 Feb''' : Many homeschooling parents write letters to and phone the Democratic Alliance (DA) councilor in their area, because the Western Cape is ruled by the DA.
* '''12 Feb''' : Leendert van Oostrum publishes a Fact Sheet&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/legal-a-research/laws-regulations-and-policies/doc_download/19-fact-sheet-about-the-wced-draft-policy-on-home-education.html Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; on the Draft policy on Home Education of the Western Cape Education Department.
* '''13 Feb''' :  The Western Cape Minister of Education, min. Donald Grant responds to an enquiry from a councilor as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/tuisonderwys/conversations/messages/22659 Donald Grant's response]&lt;/ref&gt; "''As you are now aware the WCED has circulated draft regulations for comment. There are sound reasons for regulation given the new CAPS and SBA requirements. The draft is simply out for comment and that is what the WCED requires - comment. Please request those who are up in arms to communicate their objections as requested to the WCED. The WCED in turn will collate all the objections and provide feedback to the Ministry.''"
* '''13 Feb''' :  In response to the message from min. Donald Grant, the Pestalozzi Trust writes a letter to the minister&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/support/support-groups/304-letter-by-pestalozzi-trust-to-min-donald-grant.html Letter of the Pestalozzi Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; to justify why homeschooling parents are ''"up in arms''" about the proposed policy by the WCED. 
* '''14 Feb''' :  Clive Roos from the WCED issues the following statement : "''The document currently in circulation on Home Schooling has no formal status. It has not been seen by the Minister, the Head of Education or any formal structure within the WCED. The document has been withdrawn with immediate effect by the Head of Education and the WCED apologises unreservedly for any concerns which its appearance has caused.''"
* '''4 Mar''' : The Western Cape Education Department publishes the same notice on Home Education in the press. In 2010 and 2012 the notice was only published in local newspapers, but this time it was also published in large papers such as Die Burger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/legal-a-research/laws-regulations-and-policies/doc_download/23-notice-by-wced-in-2014.html Notice of WCED in 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Apr''' : A national home education magazine “''Learning @ Home''” was launched this month. The newsletter of the Cape Home Educators (CHE) was expanded to become national magazine. It is published quarterly and distributed in electronic format for free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/media/learning--home.html National Homeschool Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''11 Aug''' : The Pestalozzi Trust receives a reply to a letter that the Pestalozzi Trust wrote on 6 September 2010 from Donald Grant, the DA minister of education in the Western Cape. The reply was dated 27 October 2012, but the Pestalozzi Trust only received this letter on 11 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/media/document/doc_download/38-2014-letter-from-donald-grant-to-pestalozzi-trust.html Reply from Donald Grant]&lt;/ref&gt; Since homeschooling parents view education as a responsibility of parents, the closing paragraph was particularly alarming. It reads : ''The provision of education is a state function, and where the state has granted permission in terms of due process as prescribed, it must support and monitor the provision of private education and home education.''
* '''9,10 October''' : Homeschool Associations from all over South Africa and the Pestalozzi Trust met with Department of Basic Education (DBE) on 9,10 October to discuss new policy on Home Education. Homeschool representatives experienced the meeting positively, because they received ample time to present their case. DBE experienced the presentations by the representatives as  well researched and providing valuable insights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/home/entry/homeschool-associations-feedback-to-education-department.html Report on meeting with Department of Basic Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 (KZN court case) ===
After the meetings in October, it was the intention to have follow-up meetings in January 2015.  As the date of the follow-up meeting approached, the meeting was postponed to February 2015, in order to provide more time to the DBE to prepare for the meeting. Two weeks before this meeting, representatives requested that the agenda and working documents be sent to them as a matter of common courtesy. Soon after this representatives were informed that the meeting was postponed indefinitely.

Middle June, representatives received another invite for a meeting on the 2nd and 3 July, with a proposed agenda and an updated Discussion Document by dr. Trevor Coombe. The representatives were surprised by the updated discussion document. This document confirmed that the DBE was indeed willing to attempt to understand home education, because a number of significant paradigms shifts have been made since the previous Discussion Document that was presented in October 2014. In the preparation for the meeting, the agenda was changed a few times. The Association for Homeschooling managed to reserve more than 90 minutes of the agenda for a screening of the “[http://classdismissedmovie.com/ Class Dismissed]” movie.

* '''April''' : The Doe family (name changed) in KwaZulu-Natal was ripped apart. The Children’s court ordered that the three young children be removed and placed in the care of their grandparents, where they are compelled to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/home/entry/home-schooling-family-ripped-apart-by-childrens-court.html Home Schooling Family ripped apart by Children's Court]&lt;/ref&gt; The only reason for removing the children provided by the court and the social workers is that the children don't attend school. This case is similar to the case of Domenic Johansonn in Sweden &lt;ref&gt;[http://friendsofdomenic.blogspot.com/ Friends of Domenic Johansonn]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2,3 July''' : The second meeting between representatives from homeschool associations and the Department of Basic Education took place. The homeschool representatives were encouraged by the paradigm shifts that were made by DBE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuisskolers.org/home/entry/2nd-meeting-between-homeschool-associations-and-department-of-basic-education.html 2nd Meeting between Homeschool Associations and Department of Basic Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''October - Dec''' : The working group was scheduled to meet every month from October to March. Three homeschooling individuals were invited to join these meeting. The first meeting was attended by Leendert van Oostrum and Joy Leavesley. Bouwe van der Eems, the third invitee, was unable to travel from Cape Town at short notice. From the start of the first working group meeting, it was made abundantly clear that a different dynamic was at work. During his opening remarks, for example, the chairman (the same Dr Simelane) claimed that “''children belong to the state''”. He proceeded to make it clear that those present were not there to represent their own stakeholder groups – they represented no-one except the Department of Basic Education. Very soon, it became obvious that the policy to be written would not represent anything that was presented by homeschool organisations during the consultation sessions. Instead, the discussions were aimed at implementing the original objective of the education minister – to bring home education in conformance with “''the formal education system''”. It became apparent to the two homeschoolers present that they were there only so that their names could be listed in the final policy proposal as “members of the working group”, giving the impression that homeschoolers were in support of the final proposals. During the second day, Leendert and Joy withdrew as members of the working group, but stated that they remained willing as resources to assist when needed. Only one of the three homeschoolers who had been invited on the working groups had not withdrawn – Bouwe van der Eems from Cape Town, who did not attend the first work group meeting. He was also unable to travel to Pretoria for the second meeting in November. Karin van Oostrum, another trustee of the Pestalozzi Trust, represented Bouwe at the November meeting. Karin’s impressions of the second meeting were the same as those of the two who had withdrawn during the first meeting. Before the third meeting Karin also withdrew.
* '''Sep - Dec''' : In April the children of the Doe (real name withheld) family of KwaZulu-Natal have been removed from their parents by social workers for “''not attending school''”. The only reasons given to the court were that the children were not attending schools and that their parents were allegedly "''indoctrinating''" the children with their religious beliefs. After this, the Pestalozzi Trust became involved. In December the their three eldest children (of whom the youngest is only three years old) were permanently returned to the care of their parents by the children's court, and set aside all the previous court orders. The court also refused to accept the recommendations of the social worker and other "''interested parties''" that the court orders the social worker to supervise the family's homeschooling for a year. He commented that there is nothing wrong when parents bring up their children in their own beliefs, and that such an upbringing makes the children better people. He also made it very clear that, in his view, these children should never have been before the court in the first place - the matter should have been dealt with by other means.

=== 2016 ===
* In '''March 2016''' the &lt;u&gt;Global Home Education Conference&lt;/u&gt; (GHEC) 2016 took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Pestalozzi Trust Board of Trustees sent three of the trustees to the conference in Brazil, namely Leendert van Oostrum, Karin van Oostrum and Bouwe van der Eems.
* In '''October 2016''' the Pestalozzi Trust announced that its founder and chairman, &lt;u&gt;Leendert van Oostrum passed away.&lt;/u&gt; [http://www.tuisskolers.org/entry/in-memoriam-leendert-van-oostrum.html Click here] for an overview of his life. This was a great loss for the Pestalozzi trust. However, since the Pestalozzi Trust is essential for the continued existence of home education in South Africa, the trustees were determined to ensure that the trust continues to operate and grow its influence. After the passing away of Leendert van Oostrum, the previous Chairman and Manager of the Pestalozzi Trust, the Trustees resolved that the following three Trustees will fill the void left by Leendert’s demise. Mr Bouwe van der Eems was appointed as Chairman. Mrs Karin van Oostrum was appointed as Manager and  Advocate André Williams supports the Executive as a legal consultant.

=== 2017 (BELA Bill and draft policy on home education) ===
* '''13 Oct''': The DBE invited public comment on the draft Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA Bill)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.za/Newsroom/MediaReleases/tabid/347/ctl/Details/mid/5986/ItemID/5500/Default.aspx|title=Basic Education Minister's messsage to the public in regard to comments received on the draft Basic Education Laws Ammendent bill, 13 November 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; gazetted in Government Gazette no. 41178 and released via www.gpwonline.co.za. The Pestalozzi Trust, other associations of home educators and individual home educators only became aware of this in the course of the week-end of the 14th and 15th of October. If a vigilant home educator did not notice this in a press article and alert organisations of home educators, the deadline for comment could easily have passed by without any comment or input from the home education community. The closing date for submissions was 10 November. The most important changes that the bill introduces are the following:
*# The content and skills of the curriculum to be used by home learners must be at least comparable to the national curriculum.
*# Home learners must be assessed annually by registered assessors.
*# Home learners are not allowed to enrol for alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED.
*# The penalty for not registering for home education is increased from 6 months to 6 years.
* '''18 Oct''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and associations and individual parents requested that the closing date is extended. Reasons for an extension include: home educators have been procedurally prejudiced by lack of prior notice; the prescribed comment period (October–November) is a period of preparation for and taking of exams for home educating families; the need for detailed consultation with members before responding; the impacts of the proposed changes are not merely technical, but may have multiple complex substantive financial, curricular, time, and legal impacts on home educating families and their supporting and representative organisations; the changes do not merely edit elements of the previous law but include entirely new provisions; many consequences thereof that may be unintended by the authors of the proposal bill and if not remedied may lead to unnecessary litigation which is neither in the interests of the Department of Basic Education, home educators nor any other party; homeschool organisations will need to take legal counsel on constitutional and other issues after consulting our members.
* '''10 Nov''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the BELA Bell to the Department of Basic Education (DBE). Parents were also encouraged to send their comments in their own words. A total of about &lt;u&gt;1000 letters from homeschoolers&lt;/u&gt; were sent to the DBE. Some of these letters were sent as anonymous submissions to the Pestalozzi Trust. The main objections to the BELA Bill were the following:
*# The provision that home learners must register with the state is unreasonable and negatively affects the interests of children. It is untenable that parents, who are primarily responsible for the education of their children, require permission from the state to choose home education.
*# The requirement that the proposed home education programme must cover contents and skills comparable to the national curriculum prohibits parents from choosing a curriculum or educational approach that would be in the best interests of the child, and which would not necessarily cover comparable skills and contents.
*# The requirement for annual assessments by external assessors serves no educational purpose, covertly enforces the National Curriculum and will be costly to homeschooling parents and the taxpayer.
*# The provision to outlaw alternative matric qualifications such as Cambridge and GED would give rise to the creation of a class of persons so disadvantaged that this would be in violation of the fundamental principle of equality which underlies the provisions of the Constitution. Secondly, the requirement that any person wishing to gain the National Senior Certificate should have to follow a three-year programme in order to do so significantly limits the rights of such a person to education.
*# The provision to outlaw alternative curriculums and matric qualification would give an unfair financial advantage to CAPS compliant curriculum providers.
To ensure that statements on the negative consequences of the proposed bill can be proven empirically, homeschooling parents were requested to complete a survey. A total of &lt;u&gt;2750 parents completed the survey&lt;/u&gt;.
* '''17 Nov'''. : The Department of Basic Education released a draft policy on home education with 21 days to provide comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.za/Newsroom/MediaReleases/tabid/347/ctl/Details/mid/5986/ItemID/5502/Default.aspx|title=Department of Basic Education invites members of the public to submit inputs on draft Policy on Home Education, 20 November 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''22 Nov'''. : The Pestalozzi Trust sent a letter to the Department of Basic Education requesting and extension of the closing date for comments to the draft policy on home education. The reasons are similar to the reasons given to request and extension of the BELA Bill.
* '''28 Nov''' : Parliament’s oversight education committee has taken the exceptional step of calling a hearing – before the legislation is even tabled. In their presentation, DBE Director General Mathanzima Mweli said ‘''the word avalanche would not describe''’ the submissions they had received ''‘and that he had never seen it in his career in public service''’. Democratic Alliance (DA) Shadow Minister of Basic Education Ian Ollis said “''the reason you are getting such an avalanche is because you are tampering with the democratic rights of parents with this bill''“. Ollis objected to the Director General saying they would be “''processing inputs''” without saying “''they would be considering amendments''”. He objected to the Director General’s proposal to hold hearings in which to ‘''educate the public about the bill''’, which wrongly assumed they were uninformed and needed education until they agreed. He said they “''needed to listen to the public''“. The public participation process was also criticized by the ACDP and even ANC members of parliament.  The meeting was extraordinary in a number of respects: First, a bill is normally only discussed in parliament after it is finalised and referred by cabinet. Second, the DBE sent their top officials to the meeting instead of a cabinet meeting discussing on education held at the same time. Third, they deferred to next year another scheduled parliamentary education briefing because after all the questions from parliamentarians, there was no time left for further discussion. Fourth, normally restrained ruling party parliamentarians showed strong independence, asking tough questions and making strong comments. Fifth, because a parliamentary committee requested the education department to extend the time for comment and received agreement. Sixth, strong feelings led the chair to calm the meeting. Seventh, a concerned mom brought her few month old baby, likely the youngest attendee of a parliamentary briefing, much to the delight of female parliamentarians.  At the end of the session, Deputy Minister of Basic Education Enver Surty, granted an extension of time for public comment on the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (BELA) till 10 January 2018.
[[File:BELA_Bill_Briefing.jpg|thumb|Homeschoolers at briefing on BELA Bill]]
* '''5 Dec''' : The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) measured literacy levels between 2011 &amp; 2016 and has found 78% of the Gr. 4 pupils who took part are functionally illiterate and South Africa scored the lowest out of 50 countries globally.
* '''8 Dec''' : The Pestalozzi Trust and all the homeschool associations submitted their comments on the Draft Policy on Home Education to the Department of education. Parents were also encouraged to send their comments in their own words. A total of about 750 letters were sent to the Department of Basic Education, including letters requesting an extension of the closing as well as comments on the policy. Some of these letters were sent as anonymous submissions to the Pestalozzi Trust. The main objections to the policy are as follows&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sahomeschoolers.org/about-us/media/all-documents.html&lt;/ref&gt;:
*# A flawed consultation process means that there has not been the required meaningful consultation, and because home educators have not had sufficient input into the policy provisions, the Draft policy itself betrays a number of flaws.
*# In general terms, the Draft Policy is flawed: while it asserts a very powerful set of constitutional and home education principles, it fails to translate those into a workable policy. In fact, it could be said that the practical provisions of the Draft Policy are diametrically opposed to the principles on which the Draft Policy is based.
*# To further compound this problem, the Draft Policy is based on both the South African Schools Act (No. 84 of 1996) and the BELA Bill. It is highly problematic that a draft policy is being based on the provisions of a proposed bill that is still subject to the public comment process and parliamentary review.
*# Underlying the above is the fact that the Draft Policy conflates home education and public education. These underlying flaws have led to a policy that is unworkable in practice, and will merely contribute to increased non-compliance by parents, and increased conflict between parents and education officials.
*# The Draft Policy does not treat parents and children with dignity, as required by the founding provisions of the South African constitution.
* '''11 Dec''' : Ms Phindile Ngcobo from the Department of Basic Education informed the Pestalozzi Trust that the Minister has granted extension till the 31st of January, 2018 for comments to the draft policy on home education.
* '''14 Dec''' : The Pestalozzi Trust delivers 430 anonymous comments to the BELA Bill at the offices of the Department of Basic Education.

The '''Hot Potatoes''' [[software suite]] includes five applications that can create exercises for the [[World Wide Web]]. The applications are JCloze, JCross, JMatch, JMix and JQuiz. There is also a sixth application called The Masher, that will compile all the Hot Potatoes exercises into one unit.

Hot Potatoes was created by the Research and Development team at the [[University of Victoria]] Humanities Computing and Media Centre. Commercial aspects of the software are handled by Half-Baked Software Inc. Hot Potatoes has been [[freeware]] since October 2009.

Hot Potatoes was first released in version 2.0 in September 1998, at the [[EuroCALL]] conference in Leuven, Belgium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61587">'''Indentured servitude in the Americas''' was a means by which immigrants, typically young [[Europeans]] under 25,&lt;ref name="Tomlins 2001 at notes 31, 42, 66"&gt;Tomlins (2001) at notes 31, 42, 66&lt;/ref&gt; came to the [[Americas (terminology)|Americas]] from the early 17th to the early 20th centuries. Immigrants would contract to work for an American employer for a time period, usually between one and seven years, in exchange for the employer paying for their passage to the Americas. The employer provided subsistence for his indentured servants, but no wages; he could restrict some of their activities such as marriage, could sell or transfer their contract to another employer, and could seek legal sanctions, such as prison, if they ran away. At the end of the agreed time period, the servant would become free to go his own way or demand wages for his work. In some cases, the newly freed person also received an item of value such as a small parcel of land or a new suit of clothes.&lt;ref name="White Servitude" /&gt;

The consensus view among economic historians and economists is that indentured servitude became popular in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in the seventeenth century because of a large demand for labor there, coupled with labor surpluses in Europe and high costs of transatlantic transportation beyond the means of European workers.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=140, 144|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

Most indentures were voluntary, although some people were tricked or coerced into them.&lt;ref name=Hofstadter1750&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=America at 1750: A Social Portrait|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zO4ulIkeKX8C&amp;pg=PA36|year=1971|publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[debt bondage|debt peonage]] system similar to indenture was also used in southern [[New England]] and [[Long Island]] to control and assimilate [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] from the 1600s through the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=nativeamindentures /&gt;

Indentured servitude continued to be used in [[North America]] into the early 20th century, but the number of indentured servants declined over time.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984 1–26"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although experts do not agree on the causes of the decline, some possible factors for the American colonies include changes in the labor market and the legal system that made it cheaper and less risky for an employer to hire [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave labor]] or paid employees, or made indentures unlawful; increased affordability of travel to North America that made immigrants less likely to rely on indentures to pay travel costs; and effects of the American Revolution, particularly on immigration from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. In the Caribbean, the number of indentured servants from Europe began to decline in the 17th century as Europeans became aware of the cruelty of plantation masters and the high death rate of servants, largely due to [[tropical disease]].&lt;ref name=burnard /&gt; After the [[British Empire]] ended slavery in 1833, plantation owners returned to indentured servitude for labor, with most servants coming from [[India]],&lt;ref name=lai /&gt; until the British government prohibited the practice in 1917.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 26"&gt;Galenson 1984: 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
Between one-half and two-thirds of European immigrants to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] between the 1630s and the [[American Revolution]] came under indentures.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 1"/&gt; The practice was sufficiently common that the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], in part, prevented imprisonments overseas; it also made provisions for those with existing transportation contracts and those "praying to be transported" in lieu of remaining in prison upon conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp935-938#h3-0012 Charles II, 1679: An Act for the better secureing the Liberty of the Subject and for Prevention of Imprisonments beyond the Seas.], Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628–80, pp 935–938. Great Britain Record Commission, (1819)&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, while half the European immigrants to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] had been indentured servants, at any one time they were outnumbered by workers who had never been indentured, or whose indenture had expired. Free wage labour was more common for Europeans in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;John Donoghue, "Indentured Servitude in the 17th Century English Atlantic: A Brief Survey of the Literature," ''History Compass'' (2013) 11#10 pp 893–902.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indentured persons were numerically important mostly in the region from [[Virginia]] north to [[New Jersey]]. Other colonies saw far fewer of them. The total number of European immigrants to all 13 colonies before 1775 was about 500,000-550,000; of these 55,000 were [[penal transportation|involuntary prisoners]]. Of the 450,000 or so European arrivals who came voluntarily, Tomlins estimates that 48% were indentured.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Tomlins, "Reconsidering Indentured Servitude: European Migration and the Early American Labor Force, 1600–1775," ''Labor History'' (2001) 42#1 pp 5–43, at p.&lt;/ref&gt;  About 75% were under the age of 25. The age of legal adulthood for men was 24 years; those over 24 generally came on contracts lasting about 3 years.&lt;ref name="Tomlins 2001 at notes 31, 42, 66"/&gt;  Regarding the children who came, Gary Nash reports that, "many of the servants were actually nephews, nieces, cousins and children of friends of emigrating Englishmen, who paid their passage in return for their labour once in America."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Nash, '' The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution'' (1979) p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers, merchants, and shopkeepers in the British colonies found it very difficult to hire free workers, primarily because it was easy for potential workers to set up their own farms.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Shannon, ''Economic History of the People of the United States'' (1934) pp 73–79&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, a common solution was to transport a young worker from Britain or a German state, who would work for several years to pay off the debt of their travel costs. During the indenture period the servants were not paid cash wages, but were provided with food, accommodation, clothing and training. The indenture document specified how many years the servant would be required to work, after which they would be free. Terms of indenture ranged from one to seven years with typical terms of four or five years.&lt;ref name="White Servitude"&gt;[http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude], by Richard Hofstadter&lt;/ref&gt; In southern New England, a variant form of indentured servitude, which controlled the labour of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] through an exploitative [[Debt bondage|debt-peonage]] system, developed in the late 17th century and continued through to the period of the American Revolution.

Not all European servants came willingly. Several instances of [[kidnapping]] for transportation to the Americas are recorded, though these were often indentured in the same way as their willing counterparts. An illustrative example is that of [[Peter Williamson (Indian Peter)|Peter Williamson]] (1730–1799). As historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] pointed out, "Although efforts were made to regulate or check their activities, and they diminished in importance in the eighteenth century, it remains true that a certain small part of the white colonial population of America was brought by force, and a much larger portion came in response to deceit and misrepresentation on the part of the spirits [recruiting agents]."&lt;ref name=Hofstadter1750 /&gt;

Many white immigrants arrived in colonial America as indentured servants, usually as young men and women from Britain or Germany, under the age of 21. Typically, the father of a teenager would sign the legal papers, and work out an arrangement with a ship captain, who would not charge the father any money.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;William Moraley and Susan E. Klepp, ''The infortunate: the voyage and adventures of William Moraley an indentured servant'', Google Books, page xx&lt;/ref&gt; The captain would transport the indentured servants to the American colonies, and sell their legal papers to someone who needed workers. At the end of the indenture, the young person was given a new suit of clothes and was free to leave. Many immediately set out to begin their own farms, while others used their newly acquired skills to pursue a trade.&lt;ref&gt;James Curtis Ballagh, ''White Servitude In The Colony Of Virginia: A Study Of The System Of Indentured Labor In The American Colonies'' (1895)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank R.

Given the high death rate, many servants did not live to the end of their terms.&lt;ref name="White Servitude"/&gt; In the 18th and early 19th century, numerous Europeans, mostly from outside the British Isles, traveled to the colonies as [[redemptioner]]s, a particularly harsh form of indenture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immigrantservants.com/ |title=Price &amp; Associates: Immigrant Servants Database |publisher=Immigrantservants.com |accessdate=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620035713/http://www.immigrantservants.com/ |archivedate=2009-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indentured servants were a separate category from bound [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]]. The latter were American-born children, usually orphans or from an impoverished family who could not care for them. They were under the control of courts and were bound out to work as an apprentice until a certain age. Two famous bound apprentices were [[Benjamin Franklin]] who illegally fled his apprenticeship to his brother, and [[Andrew Johnson]], who later became [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Wallis Herndon and John E. Murray, eds., ''Children Bound to Labor: The Pauper Apprentice System in Early America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Washington]] used indentured servants;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Farmer2#p161 George Washington: Farmer]", by Paul Leland Haworth.&lt;/ref&gt; in April 1775, he offered a reward for the return of two runaway white servants.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3664862/The-forgotten-history-of-Britains-white-slaves.html The forgotten history of Britain's white slaves]". ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===

Indentured servitude in the Americas was first used by the [[Virginia Company]] in the early seventeenth century as a method for [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]ising the debt finance for transporting people to its newfound [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies]].

Before the rise of indentured servitude, a large [[demand]] for [[labor force|labour]] existed in the colonies to help build settlements, farm crops and serve as tradesmen, but many labourers in Europe could not afford the [[transatlantic crossing]], which could cost roughly half a worker’s annual wage.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 3"&gt;Galenson 1984: 3&lt;/ref&gt;

European financial institutions could not easily lend to the workers since there was no effective way to enforce a loan from across the Atlantic, rendering [[Labor mobility|labour immobile]] via the Atlantic because of [[capital market imperfections]].&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 3"/&gt;
 
To address this imperfection, the Virginia Company would allow labourers to borrow against their future earnings at the Virginia Company for a fixed number of years in order to raise sufficient capital to pay for their voyage. Evidence shows this practice was in use by 1609, only two years after the founding of the Virginia Company's original [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown settlement]].&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 4"&gt;Galenson 1984: 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice created a [[financial risk]] for the Virginia Company. If workers died or refused to work, the investment would be lost.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 4"/&gt;

By 1620, the Virginia Company switched to selling contracts of "one hundred servants to be disposed amongst the old Planters" as soon as the servants reached the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Galenson 1984: 6&lt;/ref&gt; This minimised risk on its investment to the 2–3 months of transatlantic voyage. As the system gained in popularity, individual farmers and tradesmen would eventually begin investing in indentured servants as well.&lt;ref&gt;Galenson 1984: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological excavation of a 17th century Maryland residence in Anne Arundel County discovered a likely indentured servant buried and hidden beneath the floor alongside a garbage pit.&lt;ref&gt;National Museum of Natural History. Smithsonian Institute. (February 7,2009- January 6,2014). "Exhibition: Written in Bone: Forensic Files of the Seventeenth Century Chesapeake." [https://naturalhistory2.si.edu/anthropology/WIB/ Smithsonian website] Retrieved 14 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1661 Virginia law prohibited the inappropriate burial of indentured servants.&lt;ref&gt;Lost Towns Project, Inc.

In the 18th century, wages in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] were low because of a surplus of labour. The average monetary wage was about 50 shillings (£2.50, {{inflation|UK|2.5|1700|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} a year for a plowman, and 40 shillings (£2) a year for an ordinary unskilled worker. Ships' captains negotiated prices for transporting and feeding a passenger on the seven- or eight-week journey across the ocean, averaging about £5 to £7, the equivalent of years of work back in England.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, ''Economic History of the People of the United States'' (1934) pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerby A. Miller et al,, eds.|title=Irish Immigrants in the Land of Canaan: Letters and Memoirs from Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1675–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bq79_YZ8ViIC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2003|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, demand for indentured labour remained relatively low until the adoption of staple crops, such as [[sugarcane]] in the [[West Indies]] or [[tobacco]] in the [[American South]].&lt;ref name="Galenson March 1981: 40"&gt;Galenson March 1981: 40&lt;/ref&gt; With economies largely based on these crops, the West Indies and American South would see the vast majority of indentured labour.&lt;ref&gt;Galenson March 1981: 39&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Author and historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The most unenviable situation was that of servants on Southern plantations, living alongside but never with Negro slaves, both groups doing much the same work, often under the supervision of a relentless overseer… Even as late as 1770, William Eddis, the English surveyor of customs at Annapolis, thought that the Maryland Negroes were better off than "the Europeans, over whom the rigid planter exercises an inflexible severity." The Negroes, Eddis thought, were a lifelong property so were treated with a certain care, but the whites were "strained to the utmost to perform their allotted labour."&lt;ref name="Hofstadter"/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over time the market for indentured servitude developed, with length of contracts showing close correlations to indicators of health and productivity. Tall, strong, healthy, literate or skilled servants would often serve shorter terms than less productive or more sickly servants.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb 1985: 868&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galenson June 1981: 462&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, destinations with harsh working climates such as the West Indies would come to offer shorter contracts compared to the more hospitable colonies.&lt;ref name="Galenson March 1981: 40"/&gt;

The majority of indentured servants ended up in the American South, where cash crops necessitated labour-intensive farming. As the Northern colonies moved toward industrialisation, they got significantly less indentured immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb July 1985: 328&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 96.28% of English emigrants to [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] from 1773 to 1776 were indentured servants. During the same time period, only 1.85% of English emigrants to [[New England]] were indentured.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb July 1985: 334&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal documents===
[[File:Indenture - Servitude 1823.jpg|thumb|Indenture of apprenticeship binding Evan Morgan, a child aged 6 years and 11 months, for a period of 14 years, 1 month. Dated Feb. 1, 1823, Sussex Co., Delaware.]]
An indenture was a legal contract enforced by the courts. One indenture reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Frank R. Diffenderffer, ''The German Immigration into Pennsylvania Through the Port of Philadelphia, 1700–1775'', Genealogical Pub. Co., Baltimore, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This INDENTURE Witnesseth that James Best a Labourer doth Voluntarily put himself Servant to Captain
Stephen Jones Master of the Snow Sally to serve the said Stephen Jones and his Assigns, for and during the full Space, Time and Term of three Years from the first Day of the said James’ arrival in Philadelphia in AMERICA, during which Time or Term the said Master or his Assigns shall and will find and supply the said James with sufficient Meat, Drink, Apparel, Lodging and all other necessaries befitting such a Servant, and at the end and expiration of said Term, the said James to be made Free, and receive according to the Custom of the Country. Provided nevertheless, and these Presents are on this Condition, that if the said James shall pay the said Stephen Jones or his Assigns 15 Pounds British in twenty one Days after his arrival he shall be Free, and the above Indenture and every Clause therein, absolutely Void and of no Effect. In Witness whereof the said Parties have hereunto interchangeably put their Hands and Seals the 6th Day of July in the Year of our Lord, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy Three in the Presence of the Right Worshipful Mayor of the City of London. (signatures)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the ship arrived, the captain would often advertise in a newspaper that indentured servants were for sale:&lt;ref&gt;''Pennsylvania Gazette'' (weekly Philadelphia newspaper), August 17, 1774&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Just imported, on board the Snow Sally, Captain Stephen Jones, Master, from England, A number of healthy, stout English and Welsh Servants and Redemptioners, and a few Palatines [Germans], amongst whom are the following tradesmen, viz. Blacksmiths, watch-makers, coppersmiths, taylors, shoemakers, ship-carpenters and caulkers, weavers, cabinet-makers, ship-joiners, nailers, engravers, copperplate printers, plasterers, bricklayers, sawyers and painters. Also schoolmasters, clerks and book-keepers, farmers and labourers, and some lively smart boys, fit for various other employments, whose times are to be disposed of. Enquire of the Captain on board the vessel, off Walnut-street wharff, or of MEASE and CALDWELL.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When a buyer was found, the sale would be recorded at the city court. The ''Philadelphia Mayor’s Court Indenture Book'', page 742, for September 18, 1773 has the following entry:&lt;ref&gt;''Record of Indentures, Philadelphia, 1771–1773'', Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
James Best,
who was under Indenture of Redemption to Captain
Stephen Jones now cancelled in consideration of £ 15,
paid for his Passage from London bound a servant
to David Rittenhouse of the City of Philadelphia
&amp; assigns three years to be found all necessaries.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Restrictions===

Indentures could not marry without the permission of their owner, were subject to physical punishment (like many young ordinary servants), and saw their obligation to labour enforced by the courts. To ensure uninterrupted work by the female servants, the law lengthened the term of their indenture if they became pregnant. But unlike slaves, servants were guaranteed to be eventually released from bondage. At the end of their term they received a payment known as "freedom dues" and become free members of society.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner: Give me liberty. W.W.Norton &amp; Company, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-393-97873-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One could buy and sell indentured servants' contracts, and the right to their labour would change hands, but not the person as a piece of property.

Both male and female labourers could be subject to violence, occasionally even resulting in death. [[Richard Hofstadter]] notes that, as slaves arrived in greater numbers after 1700, white labourers in Virginia became a "privileged stratum, assigned to lighter work and more skilled tasks".&lt;ref name="Hofstadter"/&gt; He also notes that "Runaways were regularly advertised in the newspapers, rewards were offered, and both sheriffs and the general public were enlisted to secure their return. ... The standard penalty in the North, not always rigorously enforced, was extra service of twice the time the master had lost, though [[flagellation|whipping]] was also common."&lt;ref name="Hofstadter"&gt;[http://www.mc.cc.md.us/Departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html White Servitude] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043503/http://www.mc.cc.md.us/departments/hpolscrv/whiteser.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, by Richard Hofstadter&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redemptioner profile===

Indentured servitude was a method of increasing the number of colonists, especially in the [[English colonial empire|English]] and later British colonies. Voluntary migration and [[convict]] labour only provided so many people, and since the journey across the Atlantic was dangerous, other means of encouraging settlement were necessary. Contract-labourers became an important group of people and so numerous that the [[United States Constitution]] counted them specifically in appointing representatives:
{{quote|Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, ''including those bound to Service for a Term of Years''....&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Displaced from their land and unable to find work in the cities, many of these people signed contracts of indenture and took passage to the Americas. In Massachusetts, religious instruction in the [[Puritan]] way of life was often part of the condition of indenture, and people tended to live in towns.

The labour-intensive cash crop of [[tobacco]] was farmed in the [[American South]] by indentured labourers in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="VJT"&gt;{{cite web

The majority of Virginians were Anglican, not Puritan, and while religion did play a large role in everyday lives, the culture was more commercially based. In the Chesapeake and North Carolina, tobacco constituted a major percentage of the total agricultural output. (In the Deep South (mainly Georgia and South Carolina), cotton and rice plantations dominated.) In the lower Atlantic colonies [[Tobacco in the American Colonies|where tobacco was the main cash crop]], the majority of labour that indentured servants performed was related to field work. In this situation, social isolation could increase the possibilities for both direct and indirect abuse, as could lengthy, demanding labour in the tobacco fields.

The system was still widely practiced in the 1780s, picking up immediately after a hiatus during the American Revolution. [[Fernand Braudel]] (''The Perspective of the World'' 1984, pp 405f) instances a 1783 report on "the import trade from Ireland" and its large profits to a ship owner or a captain, who:
{{quote|"puts his conditions to the emigrants in [[Dublin]] or some other Irish port. Those who can pay for their passage—usually about 100 or 80 {{bracket|[[livre tournois|livres tournois]]}}—arrive in America free to take any engagement that suits them. Those who cannot pay are carried at the expense of the shipowner, who in order to recoup his money, advertises on arrival that he has imported artisans, labourers and domestic servants and that he has agreed with them on his own account to hire their services for a period normally of three, four, or five years for men and women and 6 or 7 years for children."}}

In modern terms, the shipowner was acting as a [[independent contractor|contractor]], hiring out his labourers. Such circumstances affected the treatment a captain gave his valuable human cargo. After indentures were forbidden, the passage had to be prepaid, giving rise to the inhumane conditions of Irish '[[coffin ship]]s' in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Pauline (1984). "Women in 19th Century Irish Emigration"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern New England Native Americans and indenture===
{{Slavery}}
Starting in the late 17th century, in southern New England and parts of Long Island, Native Americans were increasingly pulled into an exploitative debt-peonage system designed to control and assimilate Native American people into the dominant culture as well as channel their labour into the market-based Atlantic economy.&lt;ref&gt;The literature on New England Native American indenture, while relatively new is actually vast and growing. John A. Sainsbury, "Indian Labor in Early Rhode Island," ''New England Quarterly'', 48, no. 3 (September 1975), 379–80; David J. Silverman, "The Impact of Indentured Servitude on the Society and Culture of Southern New England Native Americans, 1680–1810," ''New England Quarterly'' 74, no. 4 (Dec. 2001): 622–666; Silverman, Faith ''and Boundaries: Colonists, Christianity, and Community among the Wampanoag Indians of Martha’s Vineyard, 1600–1871'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005); Daniel Mandell, ''Behind the Frontier: Indians in Eighteenth-Century Eastern Massachusetts'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1996); Jean M. O’Brien, ''Dispossession by Degrees: Indian Land and Identity in Natick, Massachusetts, 1650–1790'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997); Jim Coogan, "Slavery and Identured Servitude on Cape Cod," Cape Cod Times, Sunday May 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[King Philip's War]] (1675–1676) most Native Americans in the region were resigned to reservations or lived in increasingly marginal enclaves on the edges of colonial towns. Due to restricted access to resources, [[land consumption|land loss]], and changes to the environment caused by European settlement, many Native Americans, especially coastal groups, could no longer practice traditional subsistence activities and therefore became increasingly dependent on European trade goods—cloth, tools, guns, alcohol, and increasingly, food. Merchants trading these items to Native Americans often inflated the cost and, based on a predatory lending scheme, advanced them credit for these purchases, knowing full well most Native Americans would not be able to repay the debts. Eventually when debts mounted, Native Americans were hauled into court by their creditors. When they could not pay either their lands, or more commonly their labour, was seized to settle the debt. Native American debtors were then indentured to their creditors for terms ranging from a few months to sometimes years. Rare cases exist when Native Americans were indentured for a decade or more and a few were enslaved for life (this was quite rare however).&lt;ref name=nativeamindentures&gt;Perhaps the largest source of information about these indentures are dozens of debt proceedings against Native Americans in David T. Konig, ed. ''Plymouth Court Records'', 1686–1859, (Wilmington, Del.: Pilgrim Society, 1979–1981); Also important are the contracts reprinted int John Strong, "Sharecropping the Sea: Shinnecock Whalers in the Seventeenth Century," in ''The Shinnecock Indians: A Culture History'', edited by Gaynell Stone [Readings in Long Island Archaeology and Ethnohistory, Volume VI] (Lexington, Mass.: Ginn Custom Publishing, 1983), 231–263, and in Philip Rabito-Wyppensenwah, "Discovering the Montauketts in Rediscovered Documents," and "Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Native American Whaling on Eastern Long Island," in ''The History and Archaeology of the Montauk'', edited by Gaynell Stone [Readings in Long Island Archaeology and Ethnohistory, volume III] 2nd edition, (Stony Brook, N.Y.: Suffolk County Archaeological Association, 1993), 423–429, 437–444; Other archives containing Native American indenture contracts include contract of Elisha Osborne. Indenture contract, 23 June 1755. Archives, Mashantucket Museum and Research Center, Mashantucket, CT, MSS 191; also, The collection of the Fairfield Historical Society, Connecticut Colonial Records, Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut, Volume 1 [Source: http://www.cslib.org/earlygr.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}], and the library of the Falmouth Historical Society in Falmouth, Mass. has some as well, as does the Historical Society of Old Yarmouth, in Yarmouth, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native Americans experienced repeated indentures over the course of their lifetimes, amounting to a phenomenon of 'serial indenture' or debt peonage—multiple short indentures alternating with brief periods of 'freedom.'  The 'time' Native American servants owed could be sold or willed to heirs if a creditor died.

Assessing how many Native Americans experienced indenture is difficult as exact Native American populations during the colonial period are unknown. However, Historian John Sainsbury was able to document that by the mid-18th century about a third of all Native Americans in Rhode Island were indentured servants living and working in white households. Also, the Massachusetts state archives contains numerous petitions, written from the 1730s to 1760s from Native American tribes in their jurisdiction complaining about abuses in the indenture system and predatory lending by whites. Statutes were eventually passed attempting to regulate practices. Colonial military records do provide some data on Native American indenture as well. Enlistment records from 1704 to 1726 show that almost two-thirds of Native Americans who joined the army were indentured at the time of their enlistment. Records from 1748 to 1760 show a decline in this rate, but still show almost a third of Native American recruits being bound to white masters at the time of their enlistment. One Connecticut regiment raised in 1746 during [[King George's War]] (containing 980 men total) contained 139 Native American men. Almost half of them had signed their wages over to white creditors before being deployed.&lt;ref&gt;Sainsbury, "Indian Labor in Early Rhode Island"; Brian D. Carroll, "From Warrior to Soldiers: New England Indians in the Colonial Military," Ph.D. dissertation (University of Connecticut, 2009); Carroll, "Savages in the Service of Empire: Native American Soldiers in Gorham's Rangers, 1744–1762," ''New England Quarterly'' 85, no. 3 (2012):  383–429.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many Native American men, women and children became servants in New England households, the labour of many adult men was funneled into the whaling industry on Long Island, Rhode Island, Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, as well as the coast of eastern Connecticut. These [[whaling indentures]] were somewhat distinct from normal indenture contracts, and stipulated that Native Americans serve not as servants in white households but instead as crew members on a certain number of whaling voyages or 'seasons' of whaling (typically November through April).  Throughout most of the colonial period indentured or heavily indebted Native American whalers were the primary labour force in the early whaling industry. They remained an important source of labour into the Revolutionary and early national era, but as their numbers dwindled and the industry expanded exponentially, they made up a decreasingly small proportion of the labour force.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Vickers, "The First Whalemen of Nantucket," ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 3rd ser. 40 (1983): 560–83, and "Nantucket Whalemen in the Deep-Sea Fishery: The Changing Anatomy of an Early American Labor Force," ''Journal of American History'' 72 (1985): 277–96; Elizabeth A.

===Decline===
Indentured servitude appeared in the Americas in the 1620s and remained in use as late as 1917.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984 1–26"/&gt;  The causes behind its decline are a contentious domain in economic history.

The end of [[debtors' prison]]s may have created a [[Capital market imperfections#Limited Commitment|limited commitment]] pitfall in which indentured servants could agree to contracts with ship captains and then refuse to sell themselves once they arrived in the colonies. Increased lobbying from [[Emigrant Aid Societies|immigrant aid societies]] led to increased regulation of the indentured labour market, further increasing the difficulty of enforcing contracts. With less ability to enforce the contracts, demand for indentured servants may have fallen. However, most debtor prisons were still in service when indentured servitude disappeared and many regulations on indentured servitude were put in place well before the disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb Spring 1994: 6&lt;/ref&gt;

A rise in European [[Per capita income|per-capita income]] compared to passage fare during the nineteenth century may also explain the disappearance of indentured servitude. While passage from England to the colonies in 1668 would cost roughly 51 percent of English per-capita income, that ratio would decrease to between 20 and 30 percent by 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Galenson 1984: 18&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in relative income may have been further supplemented by a demonstrated increase in savings among European labourers, meaning European emigrants would have the capital on hand to pay for their own passage. With no need for transit capital, fewer labourers would have become indentured, and the [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of indentured servants would have decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb Dec. 1994: 815&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galenson 1984: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour substitutions may have led employers away from indentured servants and towards slaves or paid employees. In many places, [[Slavery in the United States#Colonial America|African slaves]] became cheaper for unskilled and then eventually skilled labour, and most farmhand positions previously filled by indentured servants were ultimately filled by slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Galenson March 1981: 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wage labour]]ers may have been more productive, since employers were more willing to terminate waged employment. In comparison, firing an indentured servant would mean a loss on the original capital investment spent purchasing the servant’s contract.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb Spring 1994: 21&lt;/ref&gt; Either substitution would lead to a decrease in demand for indentured servitude. An additional problem for employers was that, compared to African slaves, European indentured servants who ran away could not always be easily distinguished from the general white population, so they were more difficult to re-capture.

Indentured servitude's decline for white servants was also largely a result of changing attitudes that accrued over the 18th century and culminated in the early 19th century. Over the 18th century, the penal sanctions that were used against all workers were slowly going away from colonial codes, leaving indentured servants the only adult white labour subject to penal sanctions (with the notable exception of seaman, whose contracts could be criminally enforced up to the 20th century). These penal sanctions for indentured labourers continued in the United States until the 1830s, and by this point treatment of European labourers under contract became the same as the treatment of wage labourers (however, this change in treatment didn't apply to workers of color). This change in treatment can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the growing identification of white indented labour with slavery at a time when slavery was coming under attack in the Northern states, the growing radicalism of workers influenced with the rhetoric of the American Revolution, and the expansion of suffrage in many states which empowered workers politically. Penal sanctions, previously considered perfectly in line with free labour, became in the 19th century a way to transform ordinary labour into "contracts of slavery."&lt;ref name=Steinfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinfeld|first=Robert J.|title=Coercion, contract, and free labour in the nineteenth century|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge [etc.]|isbn=0521774004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor market dynamics====
Given the rapid expansion of colonial export industries in the 17th and 18th Century, natural population growth and immigration were unable to meet the increasing demand for workers. As a result, the cost of indentured servants rose substantially.  In the Chesapeake Bay, for example, the cost of indentures rose as much as 60% in the 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Menard|first=Russel|title=From Servant to Freeholder: Status Mobility and Property Accumulation in Seventeenth-Century Maryland|journal=William and Mary Quarterly|year=1973|volume=30|series=1|pages=37–64 [50]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in the price of indentures did not however act as an incentive for European workers to emigrate for they were not affected by the price at which they were sold in American ports. As a result, the companies that generated indentures disrupted the price signaling effect and thus the supply of immigrants did not expand sufficiently to meet demand. Some actors in the market attempted to generate incentives for workers by shortening the length of indenture contracts based on the productivity of the prospective emigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1–26 [10]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some American firms also opted to incentivize workers by paying small wages or by negotiating early expiration of indentures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=8–9|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The rising cost of indentured labour and its inelastic supply pushed American producers towards other forms of labour. Slaves were substantially cheaper and the supply of them was more abundant for it was not constrained by the slaves’ willingness to emigrate. Additionally, slave traders were directly incentivised by the price mechanism to expand "production" (in the form of raiding expeditions), so supply was relatively elastic. Slavery thus was better able to satisfy labour demands in colonies requiring large quantities of unskilled workers (for example plantation colonies in the Caribbean).  Indentures however prevailed in colonies that required skilled workers (in which the cost of training a slave was higher than the price differential between a slave and an indentured servant). Alison Smith and Abbott E Smith’s analysis of London port records shows how destination of indentured emigrants shifted from the West Indies towards New England as early as the 1660s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbott Emerson|first=Smith|title=Colonists in Bondage: White Servitude and Convict Labor in America, 1607–1776|year=1947|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the theory that indentured servitude might have declined in some regions because of labour market dynamics.

====Affordability of immigration====
The rise in the affordability of immigration reduced emigrants’ need for external financing in the form of indentures. David Galenson’s analysis on affordability shows that the cost of immigration from Britain to the United States over the course of the 18th Century dropped from 50% of per capita income to less than 10%.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}  This is attributable to higher levels of real income in Europe (a result of economic growth in the 18th Century) and to a sharp decline in transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1–26 [18]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Innovation had a strong impact on the ease and cost of passenger transportation, reducing the need of indentures. The railroad made non-port cities a much cheaper destination for immigrants. The steamboat was not necessarily cheaper than older sailing technologies, but it made transatlantic travel much easier and comfortable, an attractive factor for high-income classes (that could easily afford immigration without indentures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Philip|title=The Distant Magnet: European Immigration to the U.S.A|year=1971|publisher=Ayre &amp; Spottiswoode|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The British Navy’s efforts against piracy also reduced transportation costs. Safer seas implied smaller crews (for there was no need to man weapons on board) and also reduced insurance costs (ships were at lower risk of being captured). 
The composition of immigrants also shifted from single males towards entire families. Single males usually left their homes with little if any savings. Instead, families generally liquidated assets in Europe to finance their venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1–26 [21]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salinger|first=Sharon V.|title=Colonial Labor in Transition: The Decline of Indentured Servitude in Late Eighteenth‐Century Philadelphia|journal=Labor History|year=1981|volume=22|series=2|pages=165–191 [169]|doi=10.1080/00236568108584612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact of American Revolution====
The American Revolution severely limited immigration to the United States. Economic historians differ however on the long-term impact of the Revolution. Sharon Salinger argues that the economic crisis that followed the war made long-term labour contracts unattractive. His analysis of Philadelphia’s population shows how the percentage of bound citizens fell from 17% to 6.4% over the course of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salinger|first=Sharon V.|title=Colonial Labor in Transition: The Decline of Indentured Servitude in Late Eighteenth‐Century Philadelphia|journal=Labor History|year=1981|volume=22|series=2|pages=165–191 [181]|doi=10.1080/00236568108584612}}&lt;/ref&gt;    William Miller posits a more moderate theory, stating "the Revolution (…) wrought disturbances upon white servitude. But these were temporary rather than lasting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=William|title=The Effects of the American Revolution on Indentured Servitude|journal=Pennsylvania History|year=1940|volume=7|series=3|pages=131–141 [137]}}&lt;/ref&gt;    David Galenson supports this theory by proposing that British indentures never recovered, but Europeans from other nationalities replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galenson|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of Indentured Servitude in the Americas: An Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1984|volume=44|series=1|pages=1–26 [13]|doi=10.1017/s002205070003134x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal deterrence====
[[History of slavery in New York|In 1799 New York state abolished slavery.]] The existing slaves became indentured servants. That status was finally ended in 1827 and all the indentured obtained full freedom.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://web.archive.org/web/20101109220448/http://www.archives.nysed.gov/education/showcase/201011afamvoting/index.shtml "African American Voting Rights (go down the page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of acts passed by both the American and the British governments fostered the decline of indentures. The English Passenger Vessels Act of 1803, which regulated travel conditions aboard ships, attempted to make transportation more expensive in order to stop emigration. The American abolition of imprisonment of debtors by federal law (passed in 1833) made prosecution of runaway servants more difficult, increasing the risk of indenture contract purchases.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the [[19th century]], most indentures of this nature occurred in the old [[Northwest Territory]]. The permissibility of such indentures centered on the interpretation of "involuntary servitude" per the 1787 [[Northwest Ordinance]], which declared: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the Party shall have been duly convicted."&lt;ref name=Steinfeld /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The permissibility (or not) of penal sanctions in labour became an issue of "fundamental law", in which it was questioned whether those sanctions or specific performance enforcements turned indentured servitude into "involuntary servitude". At the time when the Northwest Ordinance was constructed, white adult servants were still being imported into the United States, and thus, historically, it seems likely that the Ordinance's framers considered indenture to be a form of "voluntary" servitude. In essence, this means the indentured servant chose to work for someone who bought them something.&lt;ref name=Steinfeld /&gt;

The [[Territory of Hawaii]] was the last place in the United States to widely use indentures, as by 1900 the practice had been abolished in the rest of the country and replaced by alternatives such as the [[credit-ticket system]] used to transport Chinese laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, Patricia and David W. Galenson. "Chinese Immigration and Contract Labor in the Late Nineteenth Century," ''Explorations in Economic History'' 24.1 (1987):  26, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to U.S. annexation, indentures were widely used to transport Japanese contract workers to Hawaii for plantation work. In the Organic Act of 1900, the U.S. prohibited further use of indentures in the territory and voided all such existing contracts, thus ending the practice.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Looking Backward: Contract Laborers Emancipated: Organic Act Ends Servitude |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/uhwo/clear/HonoluluRecord1/articles/v1n2/Looking%20Backward.html|newspaper=[[Honolulu Record]] |location=[[Honolulu, Hawaii]] |date=1948-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919144430/http://www.hawaii.edu/uhwo/clear/HonoluluRecord1/articles/v1n2/Looking%20Backward.html |archive-date=2009-09-19 |access-date=2016-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caribbean==
A half million Europeans went as indentured servants to the Caribbean (primarily the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean) before 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Bordo, Alan M. Taylor, Jeffrey G. Williamson, eds. ''Globalization in historical perspective'' (2005) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon K. Lewis and Anthony P. Maingot, ''Main Currents in Caribbean Thought: The Historical Evolution of Caribbean Society in Its Ideological Aspects, 1492–1900'' (2004) pp 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;  Most were young men, with dreams of owning their own land or striking it rich quick, who would essentially sell years of their labour in exchange for passage to the islands. However, forceful indenture also provided part of the servants: contemporaries report that youngsters were sometimes tricked into servitude in order to be exploited in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Olivier Ecquemelin, ''The History of Buccaneers in America'' (1853 edition), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The landowners on the islands would pay for a servant’s passage and then provide the servant with food, clothes, shelter and instruction during the agreed term. The servant would then be required to work in the landowner’s field for a term of bondage (usually four to seven years). During this term of bondage the servant had a status similar to a son of the master. For example, the servant was not allowed to marry without the master’s permission. Servants could own personal property. They could also complain to a local magistrate about mistreatment that exceeded community norms. However, a servant's contract could be sold or given away by his master.

After the servant’s term was complete he became independent and was paid "freedom dues". These payments could take the form of land which would give the servant the opportunity to become an independent farmer or a free labourer.  As free men with little money they became a political force that stood in opposition to the rich planters.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Maingot (2004)  p 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Indentured servitude was a common part of the social landscape in England and Ireland during the 17th century. During the 17th century, British and Irish went to [[Barbados]] as both masters and as indentured servants.  Some went as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/barbados_03.shtml Population], ''Slavery and Economy in Barbados'', BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] many Scottish and Irish prisoners of war were sold as indentured labourers to the colonies.{{sfn|Higman|1997|p=108}} There were also reports of [[kidnapping]]s of youngsters to work as servants.

After 1660, fewer indentured servants came from Europe to the Caribbean. Newly freed servant farmers, given 25–50 acres of land, were unable to make a living because profitable [[sugar cane|sugar]] plantations needed to cover hundreds of acres.  However, profit could still be made through the tobacco trade, which was what these small 25-acre farms did to live comfortably. The landowners’ reputation as cruel masters became a deterrent to the potential indentured servant. In the 17th century, the islands became known as death traps, as between 33 and 50 percent of indentured servants died before they were freed, many from [[yellow fever]], [[malaria]] and other diseases.&lt;ref name=burnard&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3788343?uid=3738776&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101834820177 A failed settler society: marriage and demographic failure in early Jamaica], ''[[Journal of Social History]]'',  Vol. 28, No. 1, Autumn, 1994, by Trevor Burnard&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[British Empire#Abolition of slavery|slavery ended in the British Empire]] in 1833, plantation owners turned to indentured servitude for inexpensive labour. These servants arrived from across the globe; the majority came from [[India]] where many [[Indian indenture system|indentured labourers came from]] to work in colonies requiring manual labour.  As a result, today [[Indo-Caribbean]]s form a majority in [[Guyana]], a plurality in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Suriname]], and a substantial minority in [[Jamaica]], [[Grenada]], [[Barbados]], [[St Lucia]] and other Caribbean islands.&lt;ref name=lai&gt;Walton Lai, ''Indentured labour, Caribbean sugar: Chinese and Indian migrants to the British West Indies, 1838–1918'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Vertovik, "Indian Indentured Migration to the Caribbean," in Robin Cohen, ed. ''The Cambridge survey of world migration'' (1995) pp 57–62&lt;/ref&gt; The British government finally ended indentures in the Caribbean in 1917 by prohibiting the further transportation of persons from India for purposes of servitude for debt.&lt;ref name="Galenson 1984: 26"/&gt;

The school board of the Kaufmännische Schule Tauberbischofsheim is the [[Main-Tauber-Kreis]] and the school campuses in [[Tauberbischofsheim]], in [[Baden-Württemberg]], Southern [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Main-Tauber-Kreis: [http://www.main-tauber-kreis.de/Verwaltung-Service/Infrastruktur/Schulen ''Schulträger Main-Tauber-Kreis''].

==History==

===Early History===
A vocational school was founded in Tauberbischofsheim in 1854, and was affiliated with a “trading post” until 1921.  On August 15, 1901, the former City Council started the “bylaw for commercial training school in Tauberbischofsheim.” From November 1916 until May 1918, the “trading post” was completely closed because the only “trading teacher” had been called upon for military service in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Chronik: ''75 Jahre Kaufmännische Schule Tauberbischofsheim'', Kaufm. Schule TBB (Hrsg.), StieberDruck GmbH, 113 Seiten, Tauberbischofsheim 1997, S. 13 u. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 1921, the Kaufmännische Schule Tauberbischofsheim was established by decree of the Ministry of Culture, in order to create a separation from the business school. The education of typing with a typewriter began as early as the autumn of 1924. In May 1925, the first class was taught in English.&lt;!-- aus Chronik: S. 13f. u. 16--&gt; Starting in 1928, Tauberbischofsheim held the title “Aufbauoberrealschule” alongside the traditional Gymnasium, where one is awarded a diploma. On April 9, 1937, following the opening of the “commercial college”, two school trains were then set up to Tauberbischofsheim. With the beginning of the Second World War, the school system was set into place.&lt;!-- aus Chronik: S. 18 u. 107--&gt;

===Resumption of school activities after the war===
With the permission of the American Military, the school was the first commercial school in all of northern Baden that was allowed to teach again in the autumn of 1945. Josef Albicker was appointed as temporary headmaster.&lt;!-- aus Chronik: S. 18 u. 97--&gt; In 1956, the “Handels- und Höheren Handelschule mit Gemainschaftshaus” was built on Dr. Philipp-Adam-Ulrich-Straße and then inaugurated in 1957.&lt;!-- aus Chronik: S. 107-110--&gt;

[[File:Liège (17).JPG|thumb|Sign advertising the availability of a ''kot'']]
A '''kot''' (diminutive ''kotje'') is a type of [[student housing]] privately rented during the academic or school year in Belgium. The word ''kot'' is used in both [[Belgian Dutch]] and [[Belgian French]], but not in [[standard Dutch]] or [[standard French]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from Flemish and means small shelter, nest, cabin (as in ''friet kot'', a [[Friterie|chip shed]], or ''kot à poule'', a [[chicken coop]]). It can also even refer to slums. This term specifically used in Belgium refers to a cupboard (''un kot à balais'', a broom cupboard) and by extension any small room  such as a student room. It emphasizes the narrow aspect which is typically encountered in such housing. 

These kots can be either individual or part of a shared house, in which a certain area is public (the kitchen, the toilets and showers, etc.) casually called "commu" (rooms shared in common).  

The word ''kot'' is still in use in the [[Dunkirk]] dialect, pronounced “kotsheu“ (a small kot), meaning a shed, a garden shed, a junk room.

Derived words include: 
*the verb ''kotter'' ("to kot"), which means to rent and inhabit a ''kot'', usually only during the week
*the nouns ''kotteur'' and ''kotteuse'' refer to the tenant of a ''kot'' and often by extension to every student living outside the family home
*the nouns ''cokotteur'' or ''cokotier''  and ''cokotteuse'' (or ''cokotière''), which mean housemate.
 
==Project kots==
Some community kots take part in a project, in particular in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]]. These projects offer a large variety of activities. The project could be organizing a weekly spaghetti party, homework support, supporting a humanitarian organization. The only boundary is the creativity in management skills and the ability to bring people together. Such a project is called a "project kot".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28954">The '''state language law of Slovakia''' fixes the status and regulates the use of the [[Slovak language]]. It took force in 1995 and underwent a major amendment in 2009.

[[File:Hungarians in Slovakia 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Hungarian Slovakia, 2001

{{legend|#94C1E2|0-10%}}]]

The 2009 amendment has been severely criticized by [[Hungarians in Slovakia]], as well as the government, civil organizations and general public of neighboring [[Hungary]], for being discriminatory toward Hungarians and their rights to use their [[Hungarian language]].&lt;ref&gt;von Tiedemann, Cornelius (August 13, 2009-10). {{cite web|url=http://www.nordschleswiger.dk/SEEEMS/19708.asp?artid=16016 |title=Wissenschaftliche Kritik des slowakischen Sprachengesetzes |accessdate=2009-09-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220025503/http://www.nordschleswiger.dk/SEEEMS/19708.asp?artid=16016 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df= }} (in German and English).

Euranet.eu.

The law declares priority for the Slovak language over any other language spoken in Slovakia, as it claims the Slovak language is "an articulation of sovereignty of the Slovak Republic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Act of Parliament Dated November 15, 1995 on the State Language of the Slovak Republic |publisher=Ministry of Culture of Slovakia |url=http://www.culture.gov.sk/en/legislation/jazykov-zkon----anglick-verzia |accessdate=September 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420043019/http://www.culture.gov.sk/en/legislation/jazykov-zkon----anglick-verzia |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mixed territories, bilingualism is preserved. In towns with a minority of at least 10%, it is possible to use the minority language in certain official situations. The law names several circumstances of public and official situations,{{Vague|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- What's the meaning of "circumstances of [any kind of] situations"? --&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; e.g. doctors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Anger as Slovak language law comes into force| publisher = Euranet.eu| date = September 1, 2009| url = http://www.euranet.eu/eng/Today/News/English-News/Anger-as-Slovak-language-law-comes-into-force| archive-url = https://archive.is/20120904104825/http://www.euranet.eu/eng/Today/News/English-News/Anger-as-Slovak-language-law-comes-into-force| dead-url = yes| archive-date = September 4, 2012| accessdate = September 4, 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt; (although all medical personnel are exempt from the financial sanctions&lt;ref name="pravda" /&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in which the use of the Slovak language should take precedence&lt;ref name="pravda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spravy.pravda.sk/madaric-lekari-nedostanu-pokuty-za-porusenie-jazykoveho-zakona-p8r-/sk_domace.asp?c=A090609_183720_sk_domace_p23|title=Maďarič: Lekári nedostanú pokuty za porušenie jazykového zákona|first=CTK|date=2009-06-09|publisher=Pravda|language=Slovak|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in written and spoken form. Despite this, the law does not apply to the Czech language, which can be used in any circumstance and occasion whatsoever, as Czech and Slovak are mutually intelligible.

The 2009 modifications include issuing penalties of 100 to 5000 [[euro]]s for not using Slovak when prescribed by the law despite repeated written notice.

==History of the law==

===1990===
The first law about language use was made in 1990,{{dubious|Of course, this was not the first law about language|date=January 2016}} when Slovakia was part of Czechoslovakia. In communities having at least a 20% minority population, the minority language could be (and was) used in all official communications.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite book|last=González|first=Roseann Dueñas |title=Language Ideologies: Critical Perspectives on the Official English Movement, Volume II: History, Theory, and Policy|year=2001|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-8058-4054-4|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1995===
In 1993, Czechoslovakia dissolved into the [[Czech Republic]] and Slovakia. The Slovak National Party and its cultural organization [[Matica Slovenska]] urged the creation of laws to "protect" the state language. The modifications (called "language law without exceptions") of 1995 contained punishments for not using Slovak in official communication, regardless of the percentage of the minority in the area.{{POV-statement|The law removed any threshold, so it also formally removed some previous barriers and it also did not contain any "punishments" like fines, see § 9|date=January 2016}} This{{Vague|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- What? The modified law? The draft of the proposed modification of the law? --&gt; was later&lt;!-- When? --&gt; shown to violate the constitution of Slovakia and was abolished by the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref name="hirsarok"&gt;{{cite web| last = Orosz| first = Andrea| authorlink = Orosz Andrea| title = Nyelvtörvény és félelem&amp;nbsp;– "Ezt nem lehet Európában"| language = Hungarian| trans-title = Language law and fear&amp;nbsp;– "This can't be done in Europe"| publisher = Hírsarok.hu| date = July 21, 2009| url = http://www.hirsarok.hu/node/31497| accessdate = September 4, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725101417/http://www.hirsarok.hu/node/31497| archivedate = July 25, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|The Constitutional Court found problem only in  §3 5): "submissions for public authorities should be written in the official language" and all other objections were refused. See finding of CC no. 260/1997|date=January 2016}} The new 1995 law vacates the earlier.

===1999===
For the accession of Slovakia to the European Union, Slovakia had to accept a law on minority language use. This was created in 1999, and allowed use of minority languages in public situations{{Vague|date=November 2009}} (such as hospitals)&lt;!-- A hospital is a place or an institution, not a situation. Public places? Places open to the public? Institutions funded by the public? --&gt; in areas with at least 20% minority.&lt;ref name="hirsarok" /&gt;

==Controversial modification of the law in 2009==
[[File:Hungarians in Slovakia.jpg|thumb|Areas in Slovakia where Hungarian speakers make up at least 20%.]]
In 2009 the Slovak parliament passed a language law, mandating preferential use of the state language&amp;nbsp;– Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/30/content_11965608.htm Int'l intellectuals protest against Slovak language law]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a non-state language when conducting business could carry a financial penalty. Similarly, a penalty could be given for publishing books, journals or scientific proceedings in a language other than Slovak, or for singing in public in languages other than Slovak or the song's original language.

Opponents have described the law as one that "criminalises the use of Hungarian;"&lt;ref&gt;The Economist [https://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14140437 Slovakia criminalises the use of Hungarian]&lt;/ref&gt;however, according to the Slovak government, the law itself doesn't interfere with use of minority languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrsr.sk/Default.aspx?sid=zakony/zakon&amp;MasterID=2764#IIICit National council of Slovak republic - language law].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism in Hungary===
[[Gordon Bajnai]], the Hungarian Prime Minister, has charged Slovakia of scapegoating Hungarian speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inforadio.hu/hir/belfold/hir-301044 Bajnai: A kisebbségek ügye szent és sérthetetlen]&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian foreign minister [[Péter Balázs]] compared the creation of the language law to the politics of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime on the use of language.&lt;ref name="index.hu"&gt;[http://index.hu/kulfold/2009/09/17/kiakasztotta_a_szlovakokat_balazs_peter/ Kiakasztotta a szlovákokat Balázs Péter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mti.hu/cikk/422463/ Pozsony felháborodásának adott hangot Balázs Péter interjújával kapcsolatban]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origo.hu/nagyvilag/20090917-szlovakia-bekerettek-a-magyar-nagykovetet-balazs-peter-interjuja-miatt.html Besokallt a szlovák külügy Balázs interjúja miatt]&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian newspaper ''[[Budapest Times]]'' has questioned the dual standards for use the [[Czech language]] in Slovakia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budapesttimes.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12866&amp;Itemid=26 |title=The new state language law in Slovakia |accessdate=2014-06-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017073037/http://budapesttimes.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12866&amp;Itemid=26 |archivedate=October 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this charge ignores the [[mutual intelligibility]] between Czech and Slovak,&lt;ref name=CzeSlo&gt;{{cite book |title=Speaking from the Margin: Global English from a European Perspective |chapter=Glocalisation and the Ausbau sociolinguistics of modern Europe |chapterurl=http://www.newjumbo.info/go/nph-go.cgi/000110A/http/web.archive.org/web/20060313102742/http:/=2fwww.york.ac.uk/depts/lang/Jack_Chambers/globalisation.pdf |last=Trudgill |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Trudgill |editor1-last=Duszak |editor1-first=Anna |editor2-last=Okulska |editor2-first=Urszula |publisher=Peter Lang |series=Polish Studies in English Language and Literature 11 |year=2004 |isbn=0-8204-7328-6 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which renders them compatible in business and law.

[[President of Hungary]] [[László Sólyom]] expressed his worries about the law, because according to him the law violates "the spirit and at some places the word" of several bi- and multilateral agreements, and its perceived philosophy of "converting a multi-ethnic state to homogenous nation state" and "forced assimilation"  is incompatible with the values of the European Union and the international laws protecting minorities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Hungarian Prime Minister [[Gordon Bajnai]] said the law violates the words and the spirit of several bilateral and international agreements. He said Slovak politicians "do nationalism for a living" and he suspects the minority issues are getting into the foreground in Slovakia "to cover real problems".{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Péter Balázs]], Foreign Minister of Hungary, told ''[[Die Presse]]'' that Robert Fico, the Slovak Prime Minister, is "unfortunately trying to get popularity by cheap means".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| last = Bognár| first = Peter| title = Balazs: "Slowakei hat sich ein Eigentor geschossen"| language= German|trans-title=Balázs: "Slovakia shot an own goal"| publisher = Die Presse| date = September 2, 2009| url = http://diepresse.com/home/politik/aussenpolitik/505751/index.do?from=suche.intern.portal| accessdate = September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Balázs, the real reason for the language law is gaining voters for the parliamentary elections of next year in Slovakia, by "playing the 'Hungarian card'", and sees the issue as "part of a little political game". He also stated that regarding the bilateral relations, he doesn't expect much from Robert Fico any more. Hungarian foreign minister [[Péter Balázs]] compared the creation of the language law to the politics of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] regime on the use of language.&lt;ref name="index.hu"/&gt;

All four parties of the [[Parliament of Hungary]] ([[Hungarian Socialist Party]], [[Fidesz]], [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]], [[Alliance of Free Democrats]]) issued a joint declaration asking Slovakia to repel the legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Viktor Orbán]], chairman of Hungary's  opposition Fidesz and a former Prime Minister (1998–2002), said no 20th-century country "would have allowed themselves" such regulations, and called it an "absurdity" that Slovaks do it at the end of the first decade of the 21st century. Orbán added that not only democracies "but also mentally sound regimes" would not have tried creating such regulations, or "at least not without the risk of being ridiculed".{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Former Hungarian Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] also condemned the law in his [[blog]], calling it an "outrage", and stated that there can be "no explanation or excuse" to make it acceptable:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| last = Gyurcsány| first = Ferenc| authorlink = Ferenc Gyurcsány| title = A szlovák nyelvtörvényről négy tételben| language = Hungarian| publisher = Kapcsolat.hu| date = September 4, 2009| url = http://kapcsolat.hu/blog/a_szlovak_nyelvtorvenyrol_negy_tetelben| accessdate = September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lajos Bokros]], Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and former Hungarian Minister of Finance, condemned the law in a letter stating that Hungarians in Slovakia "want to get along on their homeland", and reminded Slovakia's MEPs that the Hungarian minority did a great contribution to Slovakia joining the European Union and the [[Eurozone]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Hungarian radical right-wing party [[Jobbik]] organized a half-road block demonstration on the border in Komárom, stating that "the issue is no longer an internal affair of Slovakia, but an issue of European level". Chairman [[Gábor Vona]] called the law "the shame of Europe", by which Slovakia "goes beyond the frameworks of democracy", he called the Slovak politics "aggressive and racist".
Vona urged peace between Hungary and Slovakia as he fears there will be a laughing third who profits from the conflicts, naming [[globalization]] as a common enemy of the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Hungarian Academy of Sciences====
The [[Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] published a Statement on the Amendment of the Slovak Language Law, and it has been signed by many people from around the world, including [[linguistics|linguists]] such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Peter Trudgill]], [[Bernard Comrie]], [[Ian Roberts (linguist)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Ruth Wodak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://peticio.nytud.hu Statement on the Amendment of the Slovak Language Law]; this has a link to the list of signatories.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethnic-National Minority Institute of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] analyzed the law and found that "in the interest of protecting and supporting the mother tongue, the Slovak legislature's law amendment violates several basic rights the protection of which is in any case required by international legal obligations". The institute brought an example of a fireman helping an escaping person who does not speak Slovak, and is forced to only reply in Slovak, according to their analysis of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Hungarian Academy of Sciences: Slovak language law violates human rights| publisher = Politics.hu| date = August 26, 2009| url = http://www.politics.hu/20090826/hungarian-academy-of-sciences-slovak-language-law-violates-human-rights| accessdate = September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction===

====OSCE====
[[File:Knut Vollebæk.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Knut Vollebæk]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] High Commissioner on National Minorities concluded that the law does not violate any international standards.]]
[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] High Commissioner on National Minorities, Knut Vollebæk, reviewed the law and issued a report in which he concluded that:
{{quotation|When read systematically, it is clear that the extension of the scope of application of the Law does not (and cannot) imply a restriction of the linguistic rights of persons belonging to national minorities.&lt;ref name="vollebaek" /&gt;|Knut Vollebæk}} He also stated that the law itself does not violate any international standards or obligations of the Slovak Republic; it is more the perception of the newly enacted possible financial penalisation that can exacerbate the already present tensions. He also called for a very reserved application of the penalisation clause.&lt;ref name="vollebaek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sme.sk/c/4944441/vollebaek-s-jazykovymi-pokutami-narabajte-opatrne.html|title=Vollebaek: S jazykovými pokutami narábajte opatrne|date=2009-07-22|publisher=SME.sk|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Party of the Hungarian Coalition]] (MKP) asked the Slovak Government to release communication exchanged between them and Vollebæk&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mr1-kossuth.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=100295&amp;Itemid=99 Az MKP kíváncsi a nyelvtörvénnyel kapcsolatos levelezésre az EBESZ-szel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725073506/http://www.mr1-kossuth.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=100295&amp;Itemid=99 |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the opinion of Vollebæk regarding the law could not be misrepresented or distorted. According to the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs the report was released unchanged and in full. Spokesman Peter Stano stated: "It is obvious that the Party of the Hungarian Coalition was unable to question the reliability of Vollebæk report, that law is following the legitimate goal and it's in accordance with all international norms." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sme.sk/c/5001273/smk-vyzvala-vladu-aby-zverejnila-celu-korespondenciu-s-vollebaekom.html&lt;/ref&gt; Vollebaek will monitor the situation until the law on minority language use will reach the level of the state language law in Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Szlovák nyelvtörvény: Budapest üdvözli Vollebaek nyilatkozatát|url=http://hvg.hu/vilag/20100104_vollebaek_fobiztos_ebesz_kisebbsegugyi|work=[[Heti Világgazdaság|HVG]]|language=Hungarian|date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slovak Academy of Sciences====
Slovak linguists from the Ľudovít Štúr Institute of Linguistics of the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] are reluctant to comment on the amendment, as the issue is highly politicised. In their opinion, however, aside from the fines, the law introduces only minor changes to the wording previously enacted.

====European Parliament (EP)====
[[File:Buzek 3200.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jerzy Buzek]], President of the European Parliament said the issue revolving around the law harms the spirit of European integration and the principles of democracy.]]
According to the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (EBLUL), the President of the European Parliament, [[Jerzy Buzek]], said the issue was beyond being simply an affair between Slovakia and Hungary and was becoming an issue of the whole European Union because it harms the spirit of European integration and the principles of democracy.&lt;ref name="eblul"&gt;{{cite web| title = Opposition mounts to Slovakia's language law | publisher = European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages| date = July 22, 2009| url = http://www.eblul.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=225&amp;Itemid=1| accessdate = September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said "we need to study it thoroughly in order to find out whether the legal framework has been violated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = EP President suggests bilateral talks on Slovak-Hungarian issues| publisher = The Slovak Spectator| date = September 3, 2009| url = http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/36409/10/ep_president_suggests_bilateral_talks_on_slovak_hungarian_issues.html| accessdate = September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Gahler]], Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and Vice-Chairman of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, also criticized the act, saying Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and his coalition partners "have yet neither mentally nor politically arrived in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Gahler| first = Michael| title = New Slovak language law does not comply with European standards| publisher = EPP Group of the European Parliament| date = July 9, 2009| url = http://www.eppgroup.eu/press/showpr.asp?PRControlDocTypeID=1&amp;PRControlID=8669&amp;PRContentID=15018&amp;PRContentLG=en| accessdate = September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gahler stated that Slovakia is violating "commonly respected standards in the EU" and is disregarding the recommendations of the Council of Europe, "which foresee the extended use of minority languages". According to Gahler, Slovakia risks discrediting itself as an EU member and could again become a "totalitarian state" if the new provisions are consistently applied. He suggested that a "modern and open Slovakia communicating and cooperating closely with its neighbours" would be better both for the country and its citizens; however, he does not expect this from the present Slovak government coalition.

====Federal Union of European Nationalities====
[[File:Hans Heinrich Hansen.JPG|thumb|200px|Hans Heinrich Hansen, president of the [[Federal Union of European Nationalities]] (FUEN) called the law absurd.]]
According to [[Hans Heinrich Hansen]], president of the [[Federal Union of European Nationalities]] (FUEN), "a language law which makes it a punishable offence to use a language does not belong on the statute books of a European country". He said this law is "totally absurd"&lt;ref name="nordschles" /&gt; and "insane".&lt;ref name="fuen-article" /&gt;
&lt;!--He also criticized the treatment of Hungarians in other contexts. According to him the districts of Slovakia have been drawn in 1995, so that the areas of Hungarian majority are split in parts, by which they form a minority in almost all districts, what he calls "an extremely aggressive act".--&gt;

FUEN published an article titled "The right to one's &lt;!-- silent correction of the typo "ones" --&gt; own native language&amp;nbsp;– the language law in Slovakia" in which Hansen is quoted as arguing that the authors of the law made their "first main error in reasoning" by failing to realize that "Hungarian is not a foreign language in Slovakia, but the native language of around 500,000 Hungarian-speaking citizens". According to Hansen, Slovakia must protect and promote the native language of all its citizens, also of its Hungarian-speaking citizens.&lt;ref name="fuen-article"&gt;{{cite web| last = Jan| first = Diedrichsen| title = The right to ones [sic] own native language&amp;nbsp;– the language law in Slovakia| publisher = Federal Union of European Nationalities| date = August 3, 2009| url = http://www.fuen.org/press/20090803_language-law_EN.html| accessdate = September 4, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen recommended examination of a good example of minority treatment, that of the Swedish-speaking population in Finland. He promised that FUEN will speak in Brussels about the issue of the law.&lt;ref name="nordschles"&gt;{{cite web| last = von Tiedemann| first = Cornelius| title = Hansen: Minderheiten-Schikane in der Slowakei ist "absurd"| language = German| trans-title = Hansen: Minority-harassment in Slovakia is absurd| publisher = Nordschleswiger.dk| date = July 29, 2009| url = http://www.nordschleswiger.dk/SEEEMS/19708.asp?artid=15720| accessdate = September 4, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110609121519/http://www.nordschleswiger.dk/SEEEMS/19708.asp?artid=15720| archivedate = June 9, 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forum Minority Research Institute====
Kálmán Petőcz of the independent Forum Minority Research Institute in Slovakia told IPS that the law "could be seen as an expression of the superiority of Slovaks over all other nationalities in Slovakia". He said it only serves to worsen the everyday relations between Slovaks and ethnic Hungarians, and also quoted research "showing that many young Slovak schoolchildren have prejudiced attitudes towards their Hungarian counterparts".&lt;ref name="ips"&gt;{{cite web| last = Stracansky| first = Pavol| title = Europe: Not the Language to Speak| publisher = IPS news| date = July 19, 2009| url = http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=47719| accessdate = September 4, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090808134930/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=47719| archivedate = August 8, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petőcz thinks some politicians in the government are "clearly nationalist and anti-Hungarian", however he sees most of the government as "just populist", who try to find "any 'enemy' to pick on and use that to win votes".

László Ollós, a political analyst of the same institute, criticized the law for being too ambiguous, in order "to give as much power as possible to bureaucrats, so that they alone can decide when to apply the law and when not to".&lt;ref name="ips" /&gt;

===Demonstrations===
On September 1, ethnic Hungarians of Slovakia held a demonstration in the stadium of [[Dunajská Streda]] ({{lang-hu|Dunaszerdahely}}) against the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Slovak Hungarians protest at new language law| publisher = Euronews| date = September 1, 2009| url = http://www.euronews.net/2009/09/01/slovak-hungarians-protest-at-new-language-law/| accessdate = September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC gives the number of protesters as around 10,000,&lt;ref name="bbc-protest" /&gt; but the Slovak paper ''Pravda'' cites only 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spravy.pravda.sk/takmer-6000-ludi-protestovalo-proti-jazykovemu-zakonu-p0v-/sk_domace.asp?c=A090901_173235_sk_domace_p12|title=Takmer 6000 ľudí protestovalo proti jazykovému zákonu|date=2009-09-01|publisher=Pravda|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was attended by several hundred extremists, mostly Hungarian nationals,{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- What news organization would have been capable of checking that a majority of even a few hundred demonstrators, let alone a few thousand, were Hungarian nationals? --&gt; who expressed their vocal support for a territorial autonomy and chanted "Death to [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]]". These were not addressed directly nor denounced ex post by the organizing party of SMK and its leader Pál Csaky. The attendees also claimed that they were "not protesting against Slovaks in general, they were protesting the fact, that they have no rights whatsoever as a national minority". All the major Slovak political parties denounced the meeting as counterproductive feat, that will only exacerbate the tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sme.sk/c/4998619/slota-strasi-madarskou-vojnou.html|title=Slota straší maďarskou vojnou|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malaysian Skills Certification System''' ({{lang-ms|Sistem Persijilan Kemahiran Malaysia}}) is a skills and work-based certification system in [[Malaysia]] that is achieved through assessment and training. Candidates can receive Malaysian Skills award if they meet the requirements of the National Occupational Skills Standard developed and regulated by the Department of Skills Development (formerly known as the National Vocational Training Council).

It is conferred as a formal recognised certificate to individuals who has shown capabilities that acquired or practised with competencies to do a task or work, which usually in the form of basic vocational skills. The criteria and standards of the Malaysian Skills Certification System are articulated with higher level qualifications to enable holders to progress from the level of semi skills, to skilled production, right up to supervisory, executive and managerial functions.

==Development==
The Malaysian Skills Certification System was established in 1993 to replace the National Trade Certification System ({{lang-ms|Sistem Persijilan Pertukangan Kebangsaan}}) as part of a larger reform to streamline the [[higher education|higher]] and [[further education]] systems in Malaysia. The system was also eventually mapped to the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]] in 2007 providing a framework for the credit equivalency and transfer between the [[vocational education and training]] sectors and the [[higher education]] sectors.

==Structure and delivery==

* Level 5: '''Malaysian Skills Advanced Diploma''' ('''DLKM''')
:*Awarded to candidates who show evidence of a level of competence so as to be able to apply a significant range of fundamental principles and complex techniques across a wide and often unpredictable variety of contexts. Very substantial personal autonomy and often significant responsibility for the work of others and for the allocation of substantial resources features strongly, as do personal accountabilities for analysis, diagnosis, design, planning, execution and evaluation. Specialisation in technical skills should be demonstrated.

'''Martha Jochnowitz Siegel''' is an American [[applied mathematics|applied mathematician]], [[probability theory|probability theorist]] and [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]] who served as the editor of ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]'' from 1991 to 1996.{{r|towson|centennial}} In 2017 she won the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr. Charles Y. Hu Award for Distinguished Service of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] for "her remarkable leadership in guiding the national conversation on undergraduate mathematics curriculum".{{r|towson|gunghu}} She was a faculty member in the mathematics department of [[Towson University]] from 1971 until 2015, when she became a [[professor emerita]].{{r|towson}}

==Education and career==
Siegel grew up in [[Brooklyn]], the daughter of civil engineer Nat Jochnowitz.{{r|gunghu}} She became interested in mathematics through her father's interest in mathematical puzzles,{{r|centennial}} and through the calculation of [[baseball statistics]] for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].{{r|gunghu}} She did her undergraduate studies in mathematics at [[Russell Sage College]], a small [[women's college]] in [[Troy, New York]], while also taking classes at the nearby men-only [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]],{{r|tiger}} as at that time Russell Sage had no mathematics department.{{r|centennial}} At Russell Sage, she was a Kellas honor student, and president of the science club.{{r|arrives}} She completed her Ph.D. in 1969 at the [[University of Rochester]]; her dissertation, ''On Birth and Death Processes'', was supervised by [[Johannes Kemperman]].{{r|tiger|mgp}} During graduate school and until her 1971 move to Towson, she was on the faculty at [[Goucher College]].{{r|tiger}}

==Contributions==
At Towson, in 1981, Siegel founded an innovative and still-ongoing undergraduate applied mathematics program involving projects connected to local business and government.  She is a co-author of the [[discrete mathematics]] and [[precalculus]] textbooks ''Finite Mathematics and Its Applications'' and ''Functioning in the Real World''. She also served as chair of a committee of the Mathematical Association of America charged with producing the 2015 edition of their ''MAA Curriculum Guide to Undergraduate Majors in the Mathematical Sciences''.{{r|gunghu}}

The '''Master of Management''' ('''MM''', '''MBM''','''MIM''', '''MMgt''') is a post-graduate [[master’s degree]] awarded to students who normally complete a one- to two-year program of graduate level coursework in [[business management]] at an accredited academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is “a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside”: Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the program is designed for students interested in entering leadership roles, the degree attracts applicants from diverse academic disciplines. The MM program structure is similar to that of the [[Master of Business Administration]], Master of Arts in Management, and [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.

==Program structure==
The MM structure varies from program to program, but typically adheres to the rigor of [[Management science]]. The mode delivery of the program can be full-time,  part-time, distance-learning, accelerated, or executive. 

The MM program for younger professionals with limited professional experience often resembles an [[master of business administration|MBA program]]. It typically prepares students to handle management issues in all areas of business with the option to concentrate or specialize in one area. Most programs begin with a set of required courses and then offer more specialized courses two thirds of the way through the program.  Topics in the MM program often include those listed aside, while concentrations may focus on [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[business administration]], [[international business]]/global management, [[marketing management]], [[supply chain management]], [[human resources]], [[Nonprofit studies|nonprofit management]], and [[entrepreneurship]].  

The MM program for senior professionals with managerial experience (typically 10+ years) often resembles an Executive MBA (EMBA) program. It typically prepares students to handle the tasks associated with interdisciplinary business-related subjects such as ethical decision making, [[business law]], global business values, workplace security, [[corporate crime]], and employee motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Montauk|title=How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs, 5th Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkSp1hHOkPUC&amp;pg=PT48|year=2010|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-7352-0450-8|pages=48+}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs focuses on helping entry and mid level managers improve their management practice with cultural competence that enable them to function across England, Canada, India, China and Brazil.

==Admissions==
Business school admission committees normally evaluate applicants based on [[bachelor degree]] and [[GPA]] score (and graduate GPA if applicable), detailed resume, letters of recommendation, essays, and personal interviews. Based on these indicators, the committee decides if the applicant is suitable for the academic profile of the program, can demonstrate considerable leadership potential, and contribute positively to the student body of the school as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Memory work''' is a process of engaging with the past which has both an [[ethical]] and [[historical]] dimension.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; [[Edgar Reitz|Edgar Reitz's]] ''[[Heimat (film series)|Heimat]]'' and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in ''Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject'', edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and memory==
The premise for memory work or ''travail de memoire'' is that history is not memory. We try to represent the past in the present through memory, history and the archives. As [[Paul Ricoeur]] argued, memory alone is fallible.&lt;ref&gt;(1955) Ricoeur, Paul. ''History and Truth''. Translated by C. A. Kelbley. Evanston: Northwestern University press. (2nd edition 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Historical accounts are always partial and potentially misrepresent since historians do not work with bare, uninterpreted facts.  [[Historian]]s construct and use archives that contain traces of the past. However, historians and [[librarian]]s determine which traces are preserved and stored. This is an interpretive activity. Historians pose questions to which the archives responds leading them to “facts that can be asserted in singular, discrete propositions that usually include dates, places, proper names, and verbs of action or condition”.&lt;ref&gt;(2000) Ricoeur, Paul. La Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli: l'ordre philosophique: Éditions du Seuil, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals remember events and experiences some of which they share with a collective. Through mutual reconstruction and recounting collective memory is reconstructed. Individuals are born into familial discourse which already provides a backdrop of communal memories against which individual memories are shaped. A group's communal memory becomes its common knowledge which creates a social bond, a sense of belonging and identity. Professional historians attempt to corroborate, correct, or refute collective memory. Memory work then entails adding an ethical component which acknowledges the responsibility towards revisiting distorted histories thereby decreasing the risk of social exclusion and increasing the possibility of social cohesion of at-risk groups.

The concept of memory-work as distinguished from history-as-memory finds a textbook case in the Vichy Syndrome as described by Rousso.&lt;ref&gt;(1991) Rousso, Henry. ''The Vichy Syndrome: History and Memory in France since 1944''. Translated by A. Goldhammer. Cambridge/London: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His title uses medical lexicon to refer to history-memory as dependent on working consciously with unconscious memories to revise accounts of history. This calls for an expanded archive that includes the "oral and popular tradition"&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's Heimat and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject, edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the written traditions normally associated with the archives.

==Pierre Nora on memory work==
[[Pierre Nora]], introduced 'lieu de mémoire' about 25 years ago, he traced the surge in memory work at the level of the nation-state to the revisiting of distorted histories of the [[anti-Semitic]] [[Vichy regime|Vichy France]] (1940-1944) following the death of [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) Nora, Pierre. "The Reasons for the Current Upsurge in Memory." Transit-Virtuelles Forum.22 Retrieved Access 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Structural changes resulted from the end of the peasantry and the dramatic economic slump as oil prices worldwide rose in 1974. Added to this was the intellectual collapse of Marxism precipitated in part by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]’s ''[[Gulag Archipelago]]'' which forced the French to rethink attitudes towards the past. 'Lieu de mémoire' closed down perspectives to better understand cultural memory, instead of opening up perspectives. He associated memory with place, and location.

During memory work, the process of producing an image or what we refer to as the production of the imaginary, is central. Therefore, the key in the analysis of remembered history are contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;*(2008), Haug, Frigga. "Australian Feminist Studies" in Memory Work. Volume 23, 537-541.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacques Derrida on memory work==
After meeting at Yale University in 1966, Jacques Derrida was a colleague and friend of [[Paul de Man]]'s&lt;ref name="NYT1dec1987"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yale Scholar Wrote for Pro-Nazi Newspaper|publisher=New York Timesdate=1 December 1987|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19871201&amp;id=QkNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5wIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,1648630}}page 1&lt;/ref&gt; until de Man's death in 1983. In 1984 Derrida gave three lectures, including one at Yale University on the art of memory. In ''Memories:for Paul de Man'' {{harv|Derrida|1986}} described the relationship between memory work and deconstruction in this often-cited passage.

{{quote|"The very condition of a deconstruction may be at work in the work, within the system to be deconstructed. It may already be located there, already at work. Not at the center, but in an eccentric center, in a corner whose eccentricity assures the solid concentration of the system, participating in the construction of what it, at the same time, threatens to deconstruct. One might then be inclined to reach this conclusion: deconstruction is not an operation that supervenes afterwards, from the outside, one fine day. It is always already at work in the work. Since the destructive force of Deconstruction is always already contained within the very architecture of the work, all one would finally have to do to be able to deconstruct, given this always already, is to do memory work. Yet since I want neither to accept nor to reject a conclusion formulated in precisely these terms, let us leave this question suspended for the moment."{{harv|Derrida|1986|p=71}}&lt;ref name="Derrida1986"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Derrida|title=Memories:for Paul de Man|year=1986|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Barbara Gabriel on memory work==
[[Barbara Gabriel]] provided a model for reading the complexities of memory and forgetting by situating ''[[wikt:unheimlich|unheimlich]]'' within the ''[[wikt:heimlich|heimlich]]'', in a [[Freudian]] 'one within the other structure'.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's ''Heimat'' and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in ''Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject'', edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As point of departure Gabriel examined [[Edgar Reitz]]'s eleven-part West German television series entitled [[Heimat (film series)|''Heimat'']]. Reitz' work was in response to a larger movement in Germany national memory work provoked in part by an American television series entitled the ''Holocaust'' followed viewed by millions. As European art in general and German art in particular resurged in the 1960s, artists like [[Günter Grass]] and Edgar Reitz captured international attention as they grappled with issues of identity in a divided, post-Holocaust Germany. Gabriel developed  the concept of an impulse towards national memory work in Germany that stemmed from a haunted subject yearning for a lost, far away, nostalgic place, a utopic homeland. "How do we confront that which we have excluded in order to be, whether it is the return of the repressed or the return of the strangers?"&lt;ref&gt;(1982) Kristeva, Julia. ''Powers of Horror.'' New York: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that which we fear as 'other' is within ourselves through our shared humanity. Repressed memories haunt all of us.

==Artistic and Activist Memory Work==

After attending a memory methodology workshop in Cape Town, South Africa in 2005 on forced removal traumas, Australian performance artist Tanya Heyward, created a performance piece called ''Site'' in Melbourne Watch House in 2006. She referred to a burial ground at Prestwich Street, Cape Town, South Africa with three thousand skeletons dating back to Dutch colonization, the largest of its kind in the South Africa.&lt;ref name=activist_memory_work&gt;

==Post-colonial views==
The concept of memory work is part of a sociological imagination from a post-national point of view. Expanding on [[Norbert Loeffler]]: The idea of one national history is only acceptable as a question, not as an answer.

Memory work is related to identity work often associated with displaced persons. Some of the most provocative research on memory work has been authored by the [[Pied-noir]], or French colonials in Algeria, who returned to [[France]] following the [[Algerian War]]. Examples of such thinkers include [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Hélène Cixous]]. Another major writer in this field, [[Julia Kristeva]], also moved away from the country of her birth, having emigrated to France from Bulgaria when she was 24.

'''Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies named after M.V. Lomonosov''' (traditional abbreviation "MITHT") is one of the oldest universities in the country that offer training in a wide range of specialties in the field of [[chemical technology]].

Currently, there are more than 4,500 students in nine areas of undergraduate, 28 master's programs and 23 scientific specialties for training of candidates and doctors of science. In MITHT there are 8 dissertation councils for doctoral and PhD theses.

Research and teaching activities are performed by more than 400 professors and 158 scientists, including more than 120 doctors of science and professors. Located in Moscow at Vernadsky Avenue, Building 86 (new building complex) and Malaya Pirogovskaya, Building 1 (historic building).

== History ==

History of the University and its continuing operations as a higher education institution begins 1 July 1900 and covers several stages.

=== Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow Higher Women Courses (1900–1918) ===
1 July (14 July, [[New Style]]) 1900 was organized the [[Moscow Higher Women Courses]] (MHWC). Their structure originally consisted of two departments: History and Philosophy and [[Physics]] and Mathematics. On the last one were soon opened two offices: mathematical and natural, and after a few years two more – medical and chemical-pharmaceutical. The initiators and the first lecturers were outstanding scientists, academics subsequently [[Sergey Chaplygin|S. A. Chaplygin]], [[Vladimir Vernadsky|V. I. Vernadsky]], [[Nikolay Zelinsky|N. D. Zelinsky]] (the inventor of the [[gas mask]] (1916)), Professors V. F. Davidov, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, A. N. Reformatsky, A. A. Eichenwald, S. G. Krapivin. The first director of MHWC was Professor [[Vladimir Guerrier|V. I. Guerrier]].

In 1905 as a director was elected S. A. Chaplygin, the leading scientist in the field of [[Hydrodynamics|hydro]]- and [[aerodynamics]], the organizer of the construction of school buildings on the Malaya Pirogovskaya street (formerly Devichie Pole). He remained in that post until 1918.

By the beginning of [[World War I]] MHWC turned into the one of the largest higher education institutions in the country. The number of trainees reached 710, and during the existence of courses released 5760 professionals. In turning into a first-class university MHWC paramount importance had an exceptional organizational skill of S. A. Chaplygin, later shown to them with equal brilliance in creating [[TsAGI]].

=== Department of Chemistry of the 2nd Moscow State University (1918–30) ===
16 October 1918 MHWC were converted into second Moscow State University. The first rector of the 2nd Moscow State University was appointed [[academician]] [[Sergey Namyotkin|S. S. Nametkin]] who worked since 1913 as a head of the Department of [[Organic Chemistry]] of MHWC. As rector, he remained until 1924. As part of the 2nd Moscow State University became the chemical-pharmaceutical department, which in 1919 was transformed into the chemical and pharmaceutical department.  At this time, on the faculty worked well-known Professors A. M. Berkengeim, B. K. Mlodzeevskii, S. S. Nametkin, M. I. Prozin, A. N. Reformatsky, [[O. N. Tsuberbiller]]. In 1929, the faculty became a chemical faculty of the university type with specialties such as:
* Chemical – pharmaceutical chemistry;
* Basic chemistry;
* [[Aniline]] chemistry;
* Chemistry of [[Rare-earth element|rare elements]];
* Coke-benzene chemistry;
* Organic Synthesis.

Faculty graduates go to work in the factories, involve in the implementation of research projects that receive a wide scope. During 1922 – 1928 years it has been published about 300 papers and 11 monographs. The greatest successes are achieved in the fields of organic and [[pharmaceutical chemistry]] under the direction of heads of departments, academics S. S. Nametkin, B. M. Rodionov, Professor A. M. Berkengeim. Production of new drugs being introduced in the pharmaceutical factory belonging to faculty.

=== Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (1930–92) ===
18 April 1930 by order of the [[People's Commissariat]] second MSU was reorganized into three independent institutions: Medical (now [[Russian National Research Medical University|RSMU them. Pirogov]]) Pedagogical (now [[Moscow State Pedagogical University|MPSU]]), and Chemical Technology (now MITHT). Last transferred to the jurisdiction of the Vsehimprom [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy|VSNKh]] [[USSR]]. In addressing this issue directly involved [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze|Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].

10 May 1931 Chemical and Pharmaceutical Faculty became an independent and received a new name – the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology (MITHT). Historically, the name of the Institute is due to the nature of objects that are studied by students: they were small capacity chemical and pharmaceutical technology, technology of [[platinum group]] metals and [[rare-earth elements]]. From this moment begins a new stage of development of the institution, which is quickly becoming one of the leading universities in the [[chemical industry]]. Front of it set the goal of training for high-tech industries of chemical technology. In MITHT the first time in the country began to train engineers on the technology of thin inorganic products, synthetic rubber, thin organic produce synthetic [[liquid fuel]]s, [[organometallic compounds]] and a number of other specialties.

In the process of restructuring of education at the institute have been preserved and developed the best traditions of MHWC and 2nd Moscow State University: a high level of theoretical training and a combination of academic and scientific work, helped by the fact that the teaching work at the institute and chairing of departments were performed by outstanding scientists and educators which created a school and research areas.

Special departments were prepared engineers for industries which were still being created in the first five years. At the time, were of great importance establishment of a domestic pharmaceutical industry and the country's liberation on imports of medicines. Were developed and implemented methods of production of such drugs as [[atophan]], [[benzocaine]], [[procaine]], [[bromural]], [[thiokol]], [[ichtyol]], [[validol]], [[antipyrine]], [[caffeine]], [[alkaloid]]s and others. In 1938, in MITHT under the leadership of academic [[Alexander Nesmeyanov|A. N. Nesmeyanov]] (later President of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|RAS]]) began work in the field of organometallic compounds. Also, the Institute prepared professionals for the companies producing such important national defense materials, such as [[tungsten]], [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]], and [[rare-earth elements]]. So, Professor I. Ya. Bashilov created the production technology of [[uranium]] and [[radium]]. And under the guidance of Professor G. A. Meyerson were carried out important work on carbothermy and getting [[Superhard material|super-hard alloys]].

7 May 1940 for academic achievement and great progress in the preparation of chemists institute is named after the outstanding Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov]].

During the war, groups of departments in collaboration with industry and research institutes conduct intensive research on defense-related development and implementation of the executed work. Thus, under the supervision of Professor N. I. Gelperin was created the most powerful bomb in [[World War II]] – FAB-5000NG that terrified [[Hitlerites]]. Efforts of the Institute as a whole and individual professors and teachers were appreciated by the country. Professors B. A. Dogadkin, N. I. Krasnopevtsev, V. V. Lebedinskij, S. S. Medvedev, S. I. Sklyarenko and Ya. K. Sirkin were awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] laureates, and associate professor K. A. Bolshakov won that title twice.

The post-war period was characterized by intensive work of the Institute staff in the aftermath of the war, the creation of the necessary conditions for teaching and research. Among the most important achievements of the postwar period MITHT need to include: 
* The total synthesis of a number of natural alkaloids – [[pilocarpine]], pilozinin, alkaloids of [[propane]] series ([[tropine]], [[cocaine]]), [[arecoline]], [[eserine]], [[emetine]], [[psyhotrine]], [[emataliine]], [[cinchonamine]], [[tubocurarine]] and other alkaloids of [[curare]] ([[magnolin]], [[magnolamine]], [[dauricine]]). For this work, Professor N. A. Preobragensky in 1952 was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] of the first degree;
* The synthesis of physiologically active derivatives of [[piperidine]] ([[anesthetics]], [[analgesics]], and other drugs), technology development and industrial development of high-output [[painkiller]] "[[promedol]]";
* Academician A. N. Bashkirov for the first time in the world and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1959 has been implemented industrial technology for production of higher [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[alcohols]] on the basis of a synthesis of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] (the so-called "oxosynthesis technology");
* Development of technology for the production of vitamins [[Retinol|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin E|E]], [[Ascorbic acid|C]] and [[Vitamin K|K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]];
* Create rubbers based on new types of caoutchouc, operating at high and low temperatures in harsh operating conditions.

The high scientific – technical research conducted at the institute, evidenced by the fact that MITHT became one of the first places among the universities and research institutes on the number of implemented inventions. Employees of the institute published 450–500 scientific papers and received 50–60 [[Patent|invention certificates]] a year. The Institute conducts research on economic agreements and contracts on cooperation with industry and research institutes, whose number exceeded 150.

MITHT, in fact, has turned into a complex of the university and research institutes. On 2500–3000 students, in addition to 400 professors and lecturers, employed more than 900 scientists. Two to one – that is the ratio of students, academic and teaching staff, which was reached in MITHT. Good specialist, engineer cannot be prepared without bringing him to participate in real, serious scientific research in the learning process.

11 February 1971 for his services to the training of specialists for the national economy and the development of scientific research institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].

Education in MITHT always featured a deep fundamental training, which included, along with a full range of natural sciences study the big cycle engineering and technological disciplines. Special training was carried out by the so-called "thin" chemical technologies that are, as a rule, small capacity technology, implemented on the basis of the latest achievements of chemical science and technology. That is, in fact, the students received a university degree in combination with engineering training.

=== Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov (1992–2011) ===
In 1992, the Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technology named after M. V. Lomonosov has received a new, higher educational status – status of the Academy. With the name change has changed the status and range of activities of the institute along with old technology, new specialty Humanitarian – Management Profile: "Economics and Management (chemical industry)", "[[Environmental Protection]]", "[[Standardization]] and [[Certification]]". These specialties are subject to major technologies and solve their narrow-profile tasks.

Before the transition to a tiered structure the education of students was carried out in one direction, "Chemical Technology and [[Biotechnology]]", which consists of seven specialties. After the transition academy led training in seven areas of undergraduate, graduate five areas (including 26 master's programs) and 13 majors (including 25 majors) in full-time and part-correspondence courses, and conducted post-graduate education in 24 specialties and additional education in primary educational programs MITHT.

To implement in MITHT a tiered system of higher education were opened new training units. Along with main faculties teaching of students was performed at the Faculty of [[Natural Science]], Faculty of [[Humanities]], Faculty of Management, Economics and Environment, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of further education at the Institute of [[Distance Education]].

According to the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Federal Agency for Supervision in Education and Science]] in 2008 in MITHT worked one of the most highly qualified scientific and technical teaching staff of universities and academies of Russia: doctors and candidates of sciences accounted for about 80% of the teachers. At the academy a total enrollment of 4,500 undergraduate and graduate students, taught 119 professors, doctors, and 218 associate professors, candidates of sciences.

=== Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies (2011–present) ===

In 2011, the Academy received a University status.

The successes of the University in education, research and [[innovation]], the recognition of the scientific and pedagogical schools, its international status and worldwide fame are undoubtedly merit in the first professors, assistant professors, lecturers, and they have created in the walls of the university unique creative scientific and educational environment. Friendly and supportive atmosphere of the business and human interaction with the students and teachers together form the necessary conditions for the development of the individual, focused, motivated professional growth.

All EU and EEA states and all the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus have a designated '''National Academic Recognition Information Centre''' ('''NARIC'''), which provides a way to compare academic qualifications as part of the [[Bologna Process]]. Together they form the '''NARIC network'''.

Individual NARICs are coordinated by the NARIC Network, an initiative of the [[European Commission]] to improve recognition of academic qualifications and study between European countries. It is part of the Commission's [[Socrates programme|SOCRATES]]/[[Erasmus programme|ERASMUS]] programme, aimed at improving the mobility of students and staff between higher education institutions.

Each country's NARIC is designated by its Ministry of Education, but they differ in status and scope of work. In most European countries, institutions of higher education make their own decision on what foreign qualifications or study they will accept, and so most NARICs have only an advisory role.

The '''Official Languages Ordinance''' is an ordinance of [[Hong Kong]] enacted for the purpose of specifying the status and use of [[official language]]s of the territory. Both [[Chinese languages|Chinese]] and [[English language|English]] are declared official languages with equal status in the ordinance, and are to be used in communication between the government and members of the public.&lt;ref name="cap5_sec3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CurAllEngDoc/B6AC5FB0CF260FFDC825648000408D51?OpenDocument|title=Official Languages Ordinance, Official languages and their status and use (Cap 5, Section 3)|accessdate=17 July 2013|work=[[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|HKSAR Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dictates that all ordinances would be enacted and published in both languages,&lt;ref name="cap5_sec4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CurAllEngDoc/14D3D4F60818B3CBC825648000408D52?OpenDocument|title=Official Languages Ordinance, Enactment of Ordinances in both official languages (Cap 5, Section 4)|accessdate=17 July 2013|work=HKSAR Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows judicial officers the choice of using either language in court proceedings.&lt;ref name="cap5_sec5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CurAllEngDoc/359730508A4DA498C825648000408D56?OpenDocument|title=Official Languages Ordinance, Judicial proceedings (Cap 5, Section 5)|accessdate=17 July 2013|work=HKSAR Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While no law existed prior to 1974 to designate official languages in Hong Kong, by practice, English was the sole language used in all branches of the British colonial government. Under public pressure, the Official Languages Ordinance was enacted in 1974 to declare that both English and Chinese may be used in communication between the government and the public. Despite the usage of different dialects in spoken Chinese, the government chose not to specify a dialect as an official language, instead indicating "Chinese" as an official language, allowing any dialect to be used. Since most of the local population spoke [[Cantonese]], it became the most frequently used dialect in official communication.&lt;ref name="dickson-cumming"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[National Foundation for Educational Research]]|title=National Profiles of Language  Education in 25 Countries|url=http://www.cbs.polyu.edu.hk/ctdso/paper/lang%20in%20ed%20hk%20.pdf|page=41|author=Peter Dickson and [[Alister Cumming]]|publication-date=1996|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PL/C''' is a computer programming language developed at [[Cornell University]] with the specific goal of being used for teaching programming.  It is based on  [[IBM]]'s [[PL/I programming language|PL/I]] language, and was designed in the early 1970s.  Cornell also developed a compiler for the language that was based on its earlier [[Cornell University Programming Language|CUPL]] compiler, and it was widely used in college-level programming courses.  The two researchers and academic teachers who designed PL/C were Richard W. Conway and Thomas R. Wilcox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=
An introduction to programming: A structured approach using PL/1 and PL/C-7|authors=R.W. Conway and D. Gries|year=1975|publisher=Winthrop Publishers  |location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn= 0-87626-410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They submitted the famous article "Design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for PL/I" published in the Communications of ACM in March 1973, pages 169-179. 


PL/C eliminated some of the more complex features of PL/I, and added extensive debugging and error recovery facilities. PL/C is a subset of PL/I.   A program that runs without error under the PL/C compiler should run under PL/I and produce the  same results, unless certain incompatible diagnostic features, such as a  [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] section (begun by a $MACRO statement and finished by a $MEND statement), were used.The PL/C compiler had the unusual capability of never failing to compile any program, through the use of extensive automatic correction of many syntax errors and by converting any remaining syntax errors to output statements.

'''PlanetRead''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] founded by [[Ashoka (non-profit organization)|Ashoka]] Fellow, [[Brij Kothari]], to provide [[Same language subtitling|Same Language Subtitling]] on [[Bollywood]] [[music videos]] in the same language that they are sung in to promote [[functional literacy]].  There are an estimated 650 million literate people in India. In reality, half the so-called ‘literates,’ more than 300 million people, can best be called ‘early-literate.’ They cannot read, for example, [[Headline|newspaper headlines]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Same language subtitling==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[Same language subtitling|Same Language Subtitling]] (SLS) has been implemented on existing [[Music of Bollywood|Bollywood film songs]] on TV, in 10 languages:
{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|
* [[Hindi]]
* [[Bengali language|Bengali]]
* [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]
* [[Marathi language|Marathi]]
* [[Telugu language|Telugu]]
* [[Tamil language|Tamil]]
* [[Kannada]]
* [[Malayalam]]
* [[Odia language|Oriya]]
* [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]
}}

A Hindi song is shown with the lyrics subtitled in Hindi, Tamil songs with Tamil subtitles, and so on.  What you hear is what you read.  The subtitles are designed to change the color of every word in perfect timing with the song. SLS is cost-effective. On a Hindi program, one [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] gives reading practice to 5,000 people for one year.

[[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad|IIM Ahmedabad]] and PlanetRead Trust have nationally implemented SLS in partnership with [[Doordarshan]]. Donors have included:
* All Children Reading ([[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]])
* [[Google.org|Google Foundation]]
* [[Sir Ratan Tata Trust]]
* [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award|Development Marketplace]] ([[World Bank]])
* [[Dell]] Giving
* Department of School Education and Literacy, [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[Government of India]]

The '''post-graduate diploma in management studies''', [[post-nominal letters]] '''DMS''', is a university management qualification in the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Early structure===
The post-graduate qualification was originally accredited by the DMS Committee of the [[Department of Education and Science (UK)|DES]]. It originally required either one year full-time or 3 years part-time study, and was arranged in two discrete sections: Part A and Part B. It was compulsory to pass the Part A examinations and assessment first before being allowed to take Part B. Part B consisted of the final examinations and a project dissertation. Overall the marks achieved in coursework, examinations and the final dissertation had to exceed a weighted threshold for the candidate to pass and be awarded a DMS. It was thus quite an intensive course with a large workload. If a candidate achieved 90% or above, they were awarded a Distinction.

===Entry requirements===
Normally a bachelor's degree or extensive managerial experience and/or other professional qualifications. Originally there was also a lower age limit for entry of 35 years old, but this requirement was subsequently dropped as managers above that age found that the qualification had no value in achieving employment or promotion above 35.

===Accreditation===
Initially in the UK the qualification was accredited by the DMS committee of the DES, and later by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA). It was originally accepted by the [[Chartered Management Institute|BIM]] as its core qualification for admission as a full member. The BIM subsequently was renamed to the Institute of Management when combining with the Institute of Industrial Managers, and now has again been renamed to become the [[Chartered Management Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.managers.org.uk CIM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
The assessment for the few DMS courses which are still run in the UK is now almost without any formal examinations being required to be passed. It is thus subjectively awarded on the basis of course performance only, according to the opinion of the academic staff responsible.

==Controversy==

It has been argued by some that the move away from mainly or wholly exam assessed courses has lessened the 'value of the qualification' however the change from exams to coursework, projects and assignments is fairly in keeping with most postgraduate UK qualifications, although some exams are normally required.

==Recognition==
The DMS is accepted by the CMI as part of the required qualification for [[chartered manager]].

{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}
'''Project Hope''' (希望工程) is a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] public service project organized by the [[China Youth Development Foundation]] (CYDF) and the [[Communist Youth League]] (CYL) Central Committee. [http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/poverty/95783.htm] Started on October 30, 1989, it aims to bring schools into poverty-stricken rural areas of [[People's Republic of China|China]], to help children whose families are too poor to afford it to complete elementary school education. Through Project Hope, the CYDF has also sought to improve educational facilities and improve teaching quality in poorer regions.

== Achievements ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
By the end of 2004, Project Hope has
*raised over 5.6 billion [[Renminbi]] in funds.
*financed education of more than 3,400,000 poor rural students
*built 15940 "Hope Primary Schools" (希望小学), which consists of 2.5% of all the rural primary schools.
*established "Project Hope Scholarship"(希望之星奖学金), providing financial assistance to about 130,000 secondary and tertiary students.
*funded over 14,000 primary schools in rural areas to build libraries
*built over 150 [[distance learning centers]] to help students living in remote areas.

Some 80 percent of the Hope Project primary schools and students aided by the project are located in China's middle and western regions, which are less developed. (Liu, 2004)

== Influences ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
According to a report by National Research Center for Science and Technology for Development (Xu, 1999), 93.9 percent of residents in 29 [[provincial capital]] cities aged above 16 have heard of Project Hope, and 63.5 percent have contributed to it in various ways. The report drew the conclusion that Project Hope has become the largest and most influential non-governmental welfare project in China.

==Controversies==

===1994 allegations by Next Weekly===
In January 1994, the Hong Kong weekly [[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]] reported{{citation needed|reason=Can we have an exact reference?|date=October 2013}} that Project Hope could not account for HK$70 million in donations, implying the donations from the people of Hong Kong to help the Chinese children have been misdirected to the pockets of certain people.  The affected party filed a libel lawsuit that ran for six years, resulting in Next Weekly paying HK$3.5 million in damages as well as court fees.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/books/features/18225/interview-leslie-t-chang.html|title=Big Eyes' Hope}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}}

===2002 embezzlement reports===
In 2002, Project Hope was reportedly{{citation needed|reason=Can we have an exact reference to one of the reports?|date=October 2013}} involved with embezzlement of donations. [[National Audit Office of the People's Republic of China|National Audit Office]] confirmed that in 2002 it audited financial situations of Project Hope but the report was never publicised. Then head of the project Xu Yongguang later went on as vice director of China Charity Federation.

===Involvement with tobacco industry===
In 2011 [[The Daily Telegraph]] reported that Project Hope accepts [[sponsorship]] from [[China Tobacco]] and allows schools to be named after [[cigarette]] brands, carry prominent pro-tobacco advertising, [[vending machine|vend]] cigarette-shaped [[candy]] and sell individually-wrapped cigarettes outside school gates, in an attempt to create new [[smoking]] [[addiction|addicts]] to replace those [[Health effects of tobacco|dying of smoking-related diseases]], without parents being aware of the dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese primary schools sponsored by tobacco firms|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|author=Malcolm Moore and Stephen Adams|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8779180/Chinese-primary-schools-sponsored-by-tobacco-firms.html|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=2 October 2013}} (also [http://www.smh.com.au/world/china-tobacco-funding-primary-schools-20110922-1kn58.html syndicated by the Sydney Morning Herald])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=And Now Tobacco Companies Are Brainwashing Students At China's Poorest Schools|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|author=Andrew Shen|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-schools-made-of-tobacco-2011-9|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first '''Reason Rally''' was a public gathering for [[secularism]] and [[religious skepticism]] held on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on March 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Aratani, Lori, " 'Godless Rally' in D.C. for Recognition and Respect", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', C1, C10; Sunday, March 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=Reason Rally - About|url=http://reasonrally.org/about/|accessdate=April 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402171445/http://reasonrally.org/about/|archivedate=April 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was sponsored by major [[atheism|atheistic]] and secular organizations of the United States and was regarded as a "[[Woodstock]] for atheists and skeptics". A second Reason Rally was held on June 4, 2016 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C..

Speakers and performers at the first rally included biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], musician [[Tim Minchin]], ''[[MythBusters]]'' co-host [[Adam Savage]], actor-comedian [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Paul Provenza]], [[PZ Myers]], [[Jessica Ahlquist]], [[Dan Barker]], and magician [[James Randi]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reasonrally.org/speakers-2/ |title=Speakers |publisher=Reason Rally |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606192653/http://reasonrally.org/speakers-2/ |archivedate=2012-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The punk rock band [[Bad Religion]] performed and other notables (Rep. [[Pete Stark]], Sen. [[Tom Harkin]], comedian [[Bill Maher]], magician [[Penn Jillette]]) addressed the crowd by video link. Participants recited the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], deliberately omitting the phrase "under God", which was added by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1954. Veterans of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] were represented, and a retired [[United States Army|Army]] colonel, Kirk Lamb, led veterans in an affirmation of their secular [[United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office|military oaths]].&lt;ref&gt;Torpy, Jason, [http://blog.militaryatheists.org/ “Reason Rally shows patriotism and military support”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320172315/http://blog.militaryatheists.org/ |date=2012-03-20 }}, ''Atheists in Foxholes News'', 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Speakers urged those assembled to contact local and national representatives and ask them to support church-state separation, science education, marriage equality for gays and lesbians, and ending government support of faith-based organizations, among other causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Winston| first = Kimberly| title = ''Nonbelievers flex their political muscles''|year = 2012|newspaper=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/nonbelievers-flex-their-political-muscles/2012/05/09/gIQABIAnDU_story.html|accessdate =May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official website of the first rally, the aim of the Reason Rally was to "unify, energize, and embolden secular people nationwide, while dispelling the negative opinions held by so much of American society."&lt;ref name=About /&gt; The website had predicted it would be "the largest secular event in world history." ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said 20,000 people were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Fearnow &amp; Mickey Woods, [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/print/2012/03/richard-dawkins-preaches-to-nonbelievers-at-reason-rally/255012/ "Richard Dawkins Preaches to Nonbelievers at Reason Rally"], ''The Atlantic'', March 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Religion News Service]]'' said 8,000–10,000.&lt;ref name=winston /&gt; The documentary ''[[The Unbelievers]]'' says that over 30,000 people attended the rally.&lt;ref&gt;Gus Holwerda, [http://unbelieversmovie.com/ "The Unbelievers"] April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There are no official crowd estimates of events on the Mall.

The second rally, the Reason Rally for 2016, was billed as "a celebration of fact-driven public policy, the value of [[critical thinking]], and the voting power of secular Americans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://reasonrally.org/about/ Speak Up for Reason!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402171445/http://reasonrally.org/about/ |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekend of the Rally included advocacy events and conference sessions.

==Purpose of the first rally==
According to the first rally's official website, the event had three main goals:&lt;ref name=About /&gt; 
*To encourage attendees (and those who couldn’t attend) to [[coming out|come "out]] of the [[closeted|closet]]" as secular Americans, or supporters of secular equality.
*To dispel stereotypes ("there is no one 'True Atheist' "). Participation by [[nontheism|non-theists]] of all political persuasions, ethnicities, genders, and backgrounds was encouraged. The intent was to show that there are secular Americans in every major demographic.
*Legislative equality. Secular Americans should be permitted to run for public office and adequately represent non-theists, just as theists in office represent their constituents. Non-theists deserve a seat at the table just as theists do; the rally should put secular values "on the radar" of American voters.

Organizers said the aim of the rally was twofold: to unite individuals with similar beliefs and to show the American public that the number of people who don’t believe in God is large and growing. “We have the numbers to be taken seriously,” said Paul Fidalgo, spokesman for the [[Center for Inquiry]], which promotes the [[scientific method]] and reasoning and was one of the organizations sponsoring the rally. “We’re not just a tiny fringe group.”&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{cite news|last=Aratani|first=Lori|title=Atheists, others gather at Reason Rally|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/atheists-others-to-gather-at-reason-rally/2012/03/23/gIQAvqY2WS_story.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to rally spokesman [[Jesse Galef]], diversity with the attendees was a focus this year, he stated 'We can't succeed if we are only coming from one demographic'". Comparing the 2012 rally to the 2002 Godless rally which was mainly over-40 white men, the attendees were "largely under the age of 30, at least half female and included many people of color".&lt;ref name=winston&gt;{{cite news|last=Winston|first=Kimberly|title=Atheists Rally On National Mall; The 'Reason Rally' Largest Gathering Of Nonbelievers (PHOTOS)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/24/atheist-rally_n_1377443.html#s811235&amp;title=Reason_Rally_on|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2012-05-02|date=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to [[NPR]] prior to the rally, American Atheist president [[David Silverman (activist)|David Silverman]] stated that this is a coming-of-age event for atheists, "We'll look back at the Reason Rally as one of the game-changing events when people started to look at atheism and look at atheists in a different light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara|title='Woodstock For Atheists': A Moment For Nonbelievers|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/23/149021993/woodstock-for-atheists-a-moment-for-nonbelievers|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With goals of bringing unity, energy, and visibility to the secular demographic, the rally can be seen as a manifestation of the [[secular movement]] that emerged in America and elsewhere in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' Sarah Posner states that the Reason Rally was modeled on the LGBT movement, encouraging people to 'come out' about their non-belief and working to humanize atheism by getting "people to personalize someone they'd always thought of as an 'other.'" Once people realize that their neighbor, co-worker or family member is an atheist it goes a long way towards acceptance.  Politics played a large part of the Rally according to Posner; considering that there is only one openly atheist American Congressperson, there is a lot of work to still be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Posner|first=Sarah|title=''Can the Reason Rally resonate in this most religious of democracies?''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/26/reason-rally-resonate-religious-democracy|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=2012-05-03|location=London|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support of the first rally===
In the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', Staks Rosch praised the rally. He stated that atheists "face a great deal of discrimination and fear of discrimination for being outspoken" and that many "fear having their families disown them, losing their jobs, or simply being harassed by the religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/staks-rosch/why-the-reason-rally-is-w_b_1326705.html | title=Why The Reason Rally is Worth Coming Out For | author=Staks Rosch | publisher=Huffington Post | date=March 8, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Niose]], the president of the [[American Humanist Association]] stated that "The secular demographic does not claim to have a monopoly on rationality, but it does feel that it has something to offer. By rallying in Washington, seculars are not whining about some imagined victimization, but rather they are exercising a voice that has been silenced for too long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wednesday, April 7, 2010 as of 11:14 AM ET |url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/24/reason-rally-is-coming-out-party-for-secular-movement/ |title=Reason Rally is a coming out party for the secular movement |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2010-04-07 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathan Phelps|Nate Phelps]], an atheist and estranged son of [[Fred Phelps]], the founder of the fringe group, [[Westboro Baptist Church]], supported the Reason Rally and was among the event's speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/15/10706741-westboro-church-pastors-son-to-face-off-against-dads-picketers-at-atheist-rally | title=Westboro church pastor's son to face off against dad's picketers at atheist rally | publisher=msnbc.com | date=March 15, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/15/nate-phelps-westboro-baptist-church_n_1348861.html | title=Nate Phelps, Son Of Westboro Baptist Church Pastor, To Speak At Reason Rally | publisher=Huffington Post | date=March 15, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 | first=Simon | last=McCormack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/westboro-to-protest-reason-rally-where-phelps-atheist-son-will-speak-71594/ | title=Westboro to Protest 'Reason Rally' Where Phelps' Atheist Son Will Speak | publisher=The Christian Post | date=March 16, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the first rally===
The Reason Rally elicited criticism for the anti-theist rhetoric and tone that some speakers employed, since its purpose is to reject religion and superstitions, in favor of employing reason and promoting a secular lifestyle. Editorial writers including Nathalie Rothschild,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathalie-rothschild/why-the-reason-rally-isnt_b_1320748.html | title=Why The Reason Rally Isn't Worth Coming Out For | author=Nathalie Rothschild | publisher=Huffington Post | date=March 5, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tom Gilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/atheists-dont-own-reason/2012/03/21/gIQA4JWUSS_blog.html| title=Atheists don’t own reason | publisher=The Washington Post | date=March 21, 2012 | first=Tom | last=Gilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and representatives of various religious communities such as  [[Rabbi Brad Hirschfield]] of the [[National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership]]&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/24/why-reason-rally-is-unreasonable/| title=Why the Reason Rally is unreasonable| publisher=Fox News | date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Anthony Donohue]] of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]&lt;ref name=League&gt;{{cite web| title = Atheist Rally Draws Haters| url = http://www.catholicleague.org/atheist-rally-draws-haters/|publisher=Catholic League|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; all voiced disapproval.

==Notable speaker quotes of the first rally==
*Rally host [[Paul Provenza]] addressed the issue of "anti-religiosity" in his opening announcement, saying: “We're not here today to bash anyone's religion… but, hey, if it happens it happens.”&lt;ref&gt;Rosenhouse, Jason, [http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2012/03/at_the_reason_rally.php “At the Reason Rally”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331085611/http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2012/03/at_the_reason_rally.php |date=2012-03-31 }}, EvolutionBlog, March 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Keynote speaker [[Richard Dawkins]] spoke about the differences between the US and the UK, which does not have separation between church and state.  "The American Constitution is a precious treasure, the envy of the world".  He praised the size of the crowd at the rally calling it a "magnificent and inspiring sight". He said he believes that this rally, in hindsight, will be seen as a tipping point that is "not far away" when "so many people will have come out [as atheists] that 'I can come out too'... we are far more numerous than anybody realizes." Reason to Dawkins means "basing your life on evidence and on logic, which is how you deduce the consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=Richard Dawkins - Reason Rally 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9UKTuuTHEg|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He encouraged attendees to confront believers regarding what he called their "most absurd" beliefs (e.g., [[transsubstantiation]]), stating: "Mock them, ridicule them in public. Don't fall for the convention that we're all too polite to talk about religion. Religion makes specific claims about the Universe which need to be substantiated and challenged."&lt;ref name="League"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haggerty&gt;{{cite news| last = Haggerty| first = John | title = Letters: Mockery hurts understanding of religion| url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/letters/story/2012-03-27/reason-rally-atheists/53812948/1|publisher=USA Today| date=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kwon&gt;{{cite web| last =  Kwon| first = Lillian| title = Atheists Rally for Reason; Urged to Mock the Religious|year = 2012| url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/atheists-rally-for-reason-urged-to-mock-the-religious-72033/|accessdate =March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =  Grossman| first = Cathy| title = Richard Dawkins to atheist rally: 'Show contempt' for faith| url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2012/03/-atheists-richard-dawkins-reason-rally/1#.T29HTWFv8Ro|publisher=USA Today|accessdate =March 25, 2012| date=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mythbuster]]'' [[Adam Savage]] stated "I play a scientist on TV; I am in awe of those that do it for real." He discusses science and reason by saying "Everything that we have that makes our lives possible exists because human beings have... made predictions based on those tests and then improved upon them. This is reason: the human capacity to make sense of the world." He concluded "through careful empirical analysis and much thought that someone is looking out for me... I have concluded that this person keeping score - is me."&lt;ref name="5//1/2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Savage|title=Adam Savage at the Reason Rally|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1nSuWztIrY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provenza, introducing [[Ahlquist v. Cranston|Jessica Ahlquist]], stated that "for standing up for her beliefs and rights under the Constitution ... [she has] suffered a lot of hate." Ahlquist's speech thanked the atheist community for its support for her.  She felt that students are a really important part of this movement. "What I did can be done by anybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahlquist|first=Jessica|title=Jessica Ahlquist at Reason Rally|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G__Yo6vTiw|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Blogger [[Greta Christina]], author of ''Why Are You Atheists So Angry?: 99 Things That Piss Off the Godless'', gave an abbreviated list of things she was angry about, concluding "Atheists aren't angry because we're selfish, or bitter, or joyless. Atheists are angry because we have compassion. Atheists are angry because we have a sense of justice. Atheists are angry because we see millions of people being terribly harmed by religion, and our hearts go out to them, and we feel motivated to do something about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greta Christina|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Up_Beqmq4|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[David Silverman (activist)|David Silverman]], president of [[American Atheists]], encouraged atheists to come out of the closet to reduce atheophobia: "If the atheists weren't closeted, it would be harder to hate us, because in the end, you can't hate what you already love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reason Rally - March 24, 2012 Washington DC (highlights from Rally) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGBBiFxD2pc|accessdate = 2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Magician [[Penn Jillette]], speaking via pre-recorded video, stated "I can make the argument...that the only ones with true morality are us, the atheists. We are doing good because it's good and are doing right because it's right, and not for reward or punishment.  We have love for each other, we have community, we have charity." Jillette told the audience to "band together and make it okay to be an atheist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jillette|first=Penn|title=Penn Jillette Reason Rally Address|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rudd6Dzp9eI|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bill Maher]], speaking remotely, said, "When it comes to religion, we're not two sides of the same coin, and you don't get to put your unreason upon the same shelf with my reason. Your stuff [religion] has to go over there, on the shelf with [[Zeus]], and [[Thor]], and the [[Kraken]]. With the stuff that is not evidence based, stuff that religious people never change their mind about, no matter what happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Bill|title=Bill Maher at the Reason Rally 3/24/12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHtaiuJc0KM|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 rally (the second rally)==
The second quadrennial '''Reason Rally''' was held on June 4, 2016 at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

The Reason Rally for 2016 was billed as "a celebration of fact-driven public policy, the value of [[critical thinking]], and the voting power of secular Americans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://reasonrally.org/about/ Speak Up for Reason!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402171445/http://reasonrally.org/about/ |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekend of the Rally included advocacy events and conference sessions.

Event organizers were targeting an attendance of 30,000, but crowds proved much smaller; sources disagree on the exact attendance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

The '''''Bacalaureat''''' (or ''bac'' for short) is an exam held in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]] when one graduates [[high school]] ({{lang-ro|liceu}}).

==Romania==

Unlike the [[Baccalauréat|French Baccalaureate]], the Romanian one has a single degree. The subjects (except subject A) depend on the profile studied ({{lang-ro|profil de studiu}}): mathematics and computer science ({{lang-ro|matematică-informatică}}), philology ({{lang-ro|filologie}}), natural sciences ({{lang-ro|științe ale naturii}}), social sciences ({{lang-ro|științe sociale}}), or various other vocational tracks ({{lang-ro| filiera vocaţională}}), and the candidate's choice.

The Hungarian minority living in Romania and taking baccalaureate examination translate ''Bacalaureat'' into ''Érettségi'', which means maturity, like the Spanish Matura. ''Diploma de Bacalaureat'' is translated into ''Érettségi Diploma''.

The marking scale is between 1 and 10. In order to pass, students must obtain at least 5.00 in every subject with a minimum of 6.00 overall.

== Moldova ==
Moldavian Bacalaureat consists of four exams. Pupils from schools with a language of instruction other than Romanian must take one supplementary exam in their native language and literature.

Exams usually take place in June. All of them are written and each is graded separately.

Students must also choose one more subject taught in school. The majority take Geography or Chemistry.

==Subjects==

The baccalaureate has up to 5 modules, each one graded separately. Module E, the written examination, is the one considered for admission to higher education.

===Competence exams===

A, B and D are marked with: Beginner, Average, Advanced and Experienced.
: '''A''': [[Romanian language]] - oral examination.
: '''B''': Maternal Language - if different from [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and if studied; oral examination.
: '''C''': foreign language - oral and written examination; graded on the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|CEFR]] scale, from A1 to B2.
: '''D''': computer skills.

===Written exams===

Each exam takes three hours.
: '''E)a)''': Romanian Language and Literature.
: '''E)b)''': Maternal Language and Literature - if different from [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and if studied.
: '''E)c)''': compulsory subject (of the profile).
: '''E)d)''': subject to be chosen (of the profile).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1939">'''Social education''' (''shakaikyôiku'' 社会教育) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for nondegree-oriented education. 

Modern [[Japan]] is unquestionably a society that values education highly (''see'' [[Education in Japan]]). Diverse institutions, such as the miscellaneous schools, provide social education services. Large newspaper companies and local governments sponsor cultural centers that offer ongoing programs of informal education, and department stores organize curricula covering everything from [[cooking]] classes to music, English conversation ([[eikaiwa]]), and [[Japanese poetry]].

"[[Lifelong learning]]," another term for social education, was also a key phrase in the education reforms of the late 1980s. The responsibility for social education is shared by all levels of government, but especially by local government. Local governments also are largely responsible for such public facilities as libraries and museums--basic resources in social education. The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|ministry of education]] is interested in increasing the use of public school facilities for lifelong learning activities, increasing the number of social education facilities, training staff, and disseminating information about lifelong learning opportunities.

The Japanese are voracious readers. Popular bookstores are full from the moment they open their doors each day with readers seeking books from a staggering range of foreign as well as Japanese titles. The top four national newspapers ([[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Mainichi Shimbun]], [[Yomiuri Shimbun]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]) alone have a combined daily circulation (with two editions each day) of more than 35 million, and there are four daily English-language papers as well.

'''Tama Hochbaum''' (born 1953) is an artist and photographer living in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="GeorgeLawsonGallery"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.georgelawsongallery.com/thmarketing |title=Tama Hochbaum  |website=georgelawsongallery.com |access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Hochbaum was born in New York City, and  received her BA from [[Brandeis University]] in Fine Arts. Upon graduation, she was awarded a Thomas J. Watson Foundation Fellowship to study printmaking at [[Atelier 17]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=LENSCRATCH&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lenscratch.com/2015/06/tama-hochbaum-silver-screen/|title=Tama Hochbaum: Silver Screen|last=Smithson|first=Aline|date=2015-06-02|work=LENSCRATCH|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later received a MFA in painting from [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] in NYC in 1981. 

She worked as a painter in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] for 20 years. In 1991, during a four-month stay in Italy, an old interest in photography that had begun during her time in Paris re-emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawson |first=George |title=Tama Hochbaum Bio |url=http://www.georgelawsongallery.com/artists/t_hochbaum_bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, she and her family moved to North Carolina, where she currently lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/new-and-old-galleries-adapt-to-a-shifting-landscape/Content?oid=4233670 |title=New and old galleries adapt to a shifting landscape |publisher=indyweek.com |accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Her recent work consists of black and white street portraits, grids created by combining like photographic elements, and a series on the Silver Screen.&lt;ref name=LENSCRATCH /&gt; In this series, Hochbaum takes screenshots of classic movies broadcast on TV, warping images of famous Hollywood starlets (Audrey Hepburn, Greta Garbo and Lillian Gish among them)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgelawsongallery.com/artists/t_hochbaum1st.html |title=Tama Hochbaum |website=George Lawson Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; before printing the image on aluminum panels. Along with these series, she has created a number of slide shows to music; each contain hundreds of her images. Two of these pieces were commissioned by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One, ''Graffito'', a collaboration with her husband the composer Allen Anderson, was screened in Memorial Hall in February 2011 as part of the North Carolina Digital Arts Festival. Another, ''return:radius'', was screened at the FedEx Global Education Center as part of the Water of Life Festival in the Spring of 2013.&lt;ref name="CVNC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cvnc.org/article.cfm?articleId=6114 |title='Water of Life: Artistic Expressions' UNC Global Program Uniquely Deepens Concerns about World Water through Art and Music |last=Powers |first=Doris B. |date=March 21, 2013 |website=cvnc.org |location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Times Higher Education''''' ('''''THE'''''), formerly '''''The Times Higher Education Supplement''''' ('''''THES'''''), is a weekly magazine based in London, reporting specifically on news and issues related to higher education. It is the United Kingdom's leading publication in its field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2010/0916/New-world-university-ranking-puts-Harvard-back-on-top |title=New world university ranking puts Harvard back on top |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |author=Ariel Zirulnick|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
From its first issue, in 1971, until 2008, ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' (''THES'') was published in newspaper format and was born out of, and affiliated with, ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper. On 10 January 2008, it was relaunched as a magazine. It is published by TES Global, which until October 2005 was a division of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News International]]. The magazine is edited by John Gill. Phil Baty is the editor at large, and is responsible for international coverage. He is also the editor of the magazine's World University Rankings.

The magazine features a fictional satirical column written by [[Laurie Taylor (sociologist)|Laurie Taylor]], the "Poppletonian", which reflects on life at the fictional [[Poppleton University]].&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2007/10/nparticle.2007-10-31.0303391411| title=The inside story of Poppleton University | work=News – Press Releases | publisher=[[University of Leicester]], UK | date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 ''Times Higher Education'' was awarded the titles of "Weekly Business Magazine of the Year" and "Media Business Brand of the Year" by the [[Professional Publishers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theppaawards.com/ |title=PPA Awards 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FiA1krhW?url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/ppaawards2013/ |archivedate=7 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Times Higher Education'' World University Rankings==
{{Main|Times Higher Education World University Rankings}}
''Times Higher Education'' became known for publishing the annual ''[[Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings]]'', which first appeared in November 2004. On 30 October 2009 ''Times Higher Education'' broke with QS, then its partner in compiling the Rankings, and signed an agreement with [[Thomson Reuters]] to provide the data instead. The magazine developed a new methodology in consultation with its readers and its [[editorial board]]. Thomson Reuters collects and analyses the data used to produce the rankings on behalf of ''Times Higher Education''. The results have been published annually since autumn 2010. QS, which collected and analysed the rankings data from 2004 to 2009, no longer has any involvement with ''Times Higher Education'''s World University Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baty |first=Phil |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408881&amp;c=2 |title=New data partner for World University Rankings |work=Times Higher Education |accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408908&amp;navcode=105 |title=The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2011–2012 |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The magazine runs two sets of awards annually.

The first is the "''Times Higher Education'' Awards".  The 2011 awards took place on 24 November at the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] on London's [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] and received a record number of entries across the 18 categories.&lt;ref name=THE2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/hybrid.asp?typeCode=581&amp;pubCode=1&amp;navcode=175 |title=Education news, resources and university jobs for the academic world |work=Times Higher Education |accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen universities were given awards in different categories, with the [[University of Sheffield]] being "University of the Year". [[Tessa Blackstone]] was given the "[[Lord Dearing]] Lifetime Achievement Award".&lt;ref name=THE2011/&gt;

The [[University of Strathclyde]] was named as the University of the Year at the 2012 awards which took place on 29 November 2012 at the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] on London's [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]]. University of Strathclyde Principal and Vice-Chancellor Professor Sir Jim McDonald received the award at the ceremony.&lt;ref name=UoSPress&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Strathclyde press release |url=http://www.strath.ac.uk/press/newsreleases/headline_678742_en.html |accessdate=10 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106200726/http://www.strath.ac.uk/press/newsreleases/headline_678742_en.html |archivedate=6 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE Winners 2012|url=http://www.the-awards.co.uk/the2012/winners|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "''Times Higher Education'' Leadership and Management Awards" (Thelmas) were launched in 2009. The Thelmas were set up to recognise the impact that administrative staff have on the success of higher education institutions.

A '''tutor''' is a person who provides assistance or tutelage to one or more people on certain subject areas or skills. The tutor spends a few hours on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to transfer their expertise on the topic or skill to the student. Tutoring can take place in different settings, such as a classroom, a formal tutoring center, or the home of the tutor/learner. As a teaching-learning method, tutoring is characterized by how it differs from formal teaching methods on the basis of the (in)formality of the setting as well as the flexibility in pedagogical methods in terms of duration, pace of teaching, evaluation and tutor-tutee rapport.

==History==
Tutoring began as an informal and unstructured method of educational assistance, dating back to periods in Ancient Greece. Tutors operated on an ad-hoc or impromptu basis in varied and unfixed settings wherein the main goal of the tutor was to impart knowledge to the learner in order to help the latter gain proficiency in the subject area. Methods of tutoring only began to become more structured after the 20th century through focus and specialisation in the training of tutors, application of tutoring, and evaluation of tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ralph III, Michele M. Nobel, Terri Hessler, Christopher D. Yawn, and Timothy E. Heron. “Tutoring System Innovations: Past Practice to Future Prototypes.” ''Intervention in School &amp; Clinic'' 43, no. 2 (November 2007): 71–81. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/10534512070430020701&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 20th century onwards, with the rapid spread of mainstream education, the demand for tutoring has also increased as a way to supplement formal education.

==British and Irish secondary schools==

{{see also|Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)}}

In [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[secondary school]]s, ''form tutors'' are given the responsibilities of a [[form (education)|form]] or [[class (education)|class]] of [[student]]s in a particular year group (up to 30 students). They usually work in year teams headed by a year leader, year head, or guidance teacher.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Form tutors will provide parents with most of the information about their child's progress and any problems they might be experiencing. Ordinarily, the form tutor is the person who contacts a parent if there is a problem at school; however, the year leader or guidance teacher may contact the parents, since the form tutor has full-time responsibility as a specialist subject teacher.

==Private tutoring in Asia==

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]] pointed out that private tutoring can dominate the lives of young people and their families, maintain and exacerbate social inequalities, divert needed household income into an unregulated industry, and create inefficiencies in education systems. It can also undermine official statements about fee-free education and create threats to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/news/adb-study-highlights-dark-side-shadow-education ADB Study Highlights Dark Side of 'Shadow Education'], Shadow Education: Private Supplementary Tutoring and its Implications for Policy Makers in Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, nearly 90% of elementary students receive some sort of shadow education.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Keun. 2010. "Educational Equality", in Lee, Chong Jae; Kim, Seong-yul &amp; Adams, Don (eds.), Sixty Years of Korean Education. Seoul: Seoul National University Press, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hong Kong, about 85% of senior secondary students do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klncc.caritas.org.hk/private/document/644.pdf], Caritas, Community &amp; Higher Education Service. 2010. Private Supplementary Tutoring of Secondary Students: Investigation Report. Hong Kong: Caritas.&lt;/ref&gt; 60% of primary students in West Bengal, India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pratham.org/aser08/ASER_2010_Report.pdf.], Pratham. 2011. Annual Status of Education Report 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of secondary students in Kazakhstan receive private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Kalikova, Saule &amp; Zhanar Rakhimzhanova. 2009. "Private Tutoring in Kazakhstan", in Silova, Iveta (Ed.), Private Supplementary Tutoring in Central Asia: New Opportunities and Burdens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for tutoring in Asia is exploding; by comparison globally, shadow education is most extensive in Asia. This is partly due to the stratification of education systems, cultural factors, perceptions of shortcomings in regular school systems, and the combination of growing wealth and smaller family sizes.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Therefore, the education sector has become a profitable industry which businesses have created different kinds of products and advertisement such us "the king/queen of tutorial", a usual advertisement tactic of Hong Kong tutorial centers that has spread to South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India where tutors achieve "celebrity-like status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Yojana|title=Meet the 'tutor kings and queens'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-20085558|accessdate=14 June 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, successful Southeast Asian tutors will even embrace the title of "tutor". Online private tutor matching platform and online learning platform offering online learning materials are other creations.

In Cambodia, most tutoring is provided by teachers,&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter"&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Mass Schooling in East Asia: Reflections of Inequality in Japan, South Korea, and Cambodia." Asia Pacific Education Review 11(1):14-24.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Hong Kong, it is provided by individuals, small companies or large companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/article/facing-shadow-education-system-hong-kong], Kwo, Ora &amp; Mark Bray. 2011. "Facing the Shadow Education System in Hong Kong." IIAS Newsletter (University of Leiden, International Institute for Asian Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia, most tutoring is labor-intensive,&lt;ref&gt;Dong, Alison, Batjargal Ayush, Bolormaa Tsetsgee, &amp; Tumendelger Sengedorj. 2006. "Mongolia". In Iveta Silova, Virginija Būdienė, &amp; Mark Bray (Eds.), Education in a Hidden Marketplace: Monitoring of Private Tutoring. New York: Open Society Institute, pp.257-277&lt;/ref&gt; while entrepreneurs in South Korea make use of computers and other forms of technology.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

===Policy===

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong recommended policymakers across the region take a closer look at how ‘shadow education’ affects family budgets, children's time, and national education systems. It suggested that in order to reduce the need for private lessons, improvements in mainstream schools should be made. Regulations are also needed to protect consumers.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

==Costs of tutoring==

Some studies have estimated costs associated with "shadow education". In [[Pakistan]], expenditures on tutoring per child averaged $3.40 a month in 2011. In [[India]], average spending was lower, but still equated to about $2 per month.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Monazza &amp; Paul Atherton. 2011. "The "Shadow" Education Sector in India and Pakistan: The Determinants, Benefits and Equity Effects of Private Tutoring." Presentation at the UKFIET (United Kingdom Forum for International Education and Training) Conference, University of Oxford, 13–15 September.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, household expenditures for private tutoring at the secondary school level was $48 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;EPPM (International Institute of Education Policy, Planning &amp; Management). 2011. Study of Private Tutoring in Georgia. Tbilisi: EPPM, p.29. (In Georgian)&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hong Kong, the business of providing private tutoring to secondary schools reached $255 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Synovate Limited. 2011. Marketing survey of tutoring businesses in Hong Kong, cited in Modern Education Group Limited (2011), Global Offering (for stock market launch), Hong Kong, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a 2008 survey estimated the size of the private tutoring sector to be $6.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Vora, Nikhil &amp; Shweta Dewan. 2009. Indian Education Sector: Long Way from Graduation!. Mumbai: IDFC-SSK Securities Ltd., p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]], families spent $12 billion in 2010 on private tutoring.&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, where the government has attempted to cool down the private tutoring market, shadow education costs have continually grown, reaching a staggering $17.3 billion in 2010. Household expenditures on private tutoring are equivalent to about 80% of government expenditures on public education for primary and secondary students.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Sunwoong &amp; Ju-Ho Lee. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Demand for Education in South Korea." Economic Development and Cultural Change 58(2), p.261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the tutoring market is fragmented. Some online tutoring marketplaces, however, have managed to aggregate a large number of private tutors on their platform and also tutoring data. For example, one such site has over 34,000 registered tutors in California and made public their tutoring hourly rate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutoring Rates in California: An Analysis of over 34,000 Private Tutors|url=http://www.findtutorsnearme.com/tutoring-rates-in-california-an-analysis-of-over-34000-private-tutors/|publisher=www.findtutorsnearme.com|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

In many countries, individuals can become tutors without training. In some countries, including Cambodia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lao PDR, and Tajikistan, the pattern of classroom teachers supplementing their incomes by tutoring students after school hours is more a necessity than a choice, as many teachers’ salaries hover close to the poverty line.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, the number of private tutors expanded roughly 7.1% annually on average from 2001 to 2006, and by 2009 the sector was the largest employer of graduates from the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Min &amp; Daekwon Park. 2012. "Impacts of Urban Economic Factors on Private Tutoring Industry." Asia Pacific Education Review 13 (20), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private tutoring is not always effective in raising academic achievement; and in some schools students commonly skip classes or sleep through lessons because they are tired after excessive external study. This means that the shadow system can make regular schooling less efficient.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

Teachers who spend more time focusing on private lessons than regular classes can cause greater inefficiencies in the mainstream school system. Situations in which teachers provide extra private lessons for pupils for whom they are already responsible in the public system can lead to corruption, particularly when teachers deliberately teach less in their regular classes in order to promote the market for private lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2009. "The Tricks of the Teacher: Shadow Education and Corruption in Cambodia", in Heyneman, Stephen P. (ed.), Buying Your Way into Heaven: Education and Corruption in International Perspective. Rotterdam: Sense Publishers, pp.51-74; Bray &amp; Lykins (2012), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

When private tutoring is provided by well trained tutor however the effects can be dramatic, with pupils improving performance by two standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. (1984). [http://web.mit.edu/bosworth/MacData/afs.course/5/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf "The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for Methods of Group Instruction as Effective as One-to-One Tutoring"], Educational Researcher, 13:6(4-16).
&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem]].

==Types of tutoring==

There can be an existing overlap between different types of tutoring with respect to the setting or location of tutoring, the size of tutor-learner pairings/groups, and the method of tutoring provided, for example, one-on-one peer tutoring can take place through online tutoring. Tutoring is typically private since it is exists independent of the system of public and private education, that is, one can be enrolled in public/private schooling and attend private tutoring services.

=== Academic coaching ===
Academic coaching is a type of mentoring applied to academics.  Coaching involves a collaborative approach. Coaches try to help students learn how they best learn and how to operate in an academic environment. Tutors help students learn the material in individual courses while coaches help students learn how to be successful in school. In college, that includes such topics as: [[study skills]], time management, stress management, effective reading, note-taking, test-taking, and understanding how to use a syllabus. Academic coaches meet with the student regularly throughout the semester. Coaches work with students in all kinds of situations, not just those who are struggling academically.  Academic coaching is also serves to help students prepare for entrance exams to gain entry to schools or universities, and it is a particularly popular in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/asia/06iht-educlede06.html|title=Tutoring Spreads Beyond Asia's Wealthy|last=Gooch|first=Liz|date=2012-08-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in India, a majority of students, be it of any class or stream, visit a coaching center or a "study circle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/143827.cms|title=Hey tutors! Leave us kids alone|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home-based tutoring===
{{Main|In-home tutoring}}
[[In-home tutoring]] is a form of tutoring that occurs in the home. Most often the tutoring relates to an academic subject or test preparation. This is in contrast to tutoring centers or tutoring provided through after-school programs. The service most often involves one-on-one attention provided to the pupil. Due to the informal and private nature of in-home tutoring, there is limited substantial or conclusive information on in-home tutoring.

===Online tutoring===
{{Main|Online tutoring}}[[Online tutoring]] is another way for a student to receive academic help, either scheduled or on-demand. Sessions are done through an application where a student and tutor can communicate. Common tools include chat, whiteboard, web conferencing, teleconferencing, online videos and other specialized applets which make it easier to convey information back and forth. Online tutoring has relatively recently emerged as a mechanism to provide tutoring services in contrast to more traditional in-person teaching. One of the potential drawbacks of online tutoring stems from the influx or sensory overload of information from different materials. "For example, mate- rial presented in multiple modalities run the risk of interrupting the learner from a coherent learn- ing experience, of imposing a “split attention” effect (the mind cannot concentrate on two things simultaneously), or of overloading the learner's limited supply of cognitive resources."&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, John, and Paul Chandler. “Why Some Material Is Difficult to Learn.” ''Faculty of Education - Papers (Archive)'', January 1, 1994, 185–233. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532690xci1203_1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peer tutoring ===
&lt;p&gt;Peer tutoring refers to the method of tutoring that involves members of the same peer group teaching or tutoring one another. The characteristics of a peer tutoring group/pairing vary across age, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity. It has been defined as "a class of practices and strategies that employs peers as one-on-one teachers to provide individualized instruction, practice, repetition, and clarification of concepts"&lt;ref&gt;Utley, C., Mortweet, S., &amp; Greenwood, C. (1997). Peer-mediated instruction and interventions. ''Focus on Exceptional Children'', ''29''(5), 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

=== Academic performance ===
Studies have found that peer tutoring provides academic benefits for learners across the subject areas of "reading, mathematics, science, and social studies"&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. 2018. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34 (1): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer tutoring has also been found to be an effective teaching method in enhancing the reading comprehension skills of students, especially that of students with a low academic performance at the secondary level in schools. Additionally, peer tutoring has been proven especially useful for those with learning disabilities at the elementary level, while there is mixed evidence showing the effectiveness of peer tutoring for those at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34, no. 1 (January 2, 2018): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic effects ===
Although certain types of tutoring arrangements can require a salary for the tutor, typically tutoring is free of cost and thus financially affordable for learners. The cost-effectiveness of tutoring can prove to be especially beneficial for learners from low-income backgrounds or resource-strapped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Yang, George Loewenstein, and Yaojiang Shi. “Heterogeneous Effects of Peer Tutoring: Evidence from Rural Chinese Middle Schools.” Research in Economics 72 (March 1, 2018): 33–48. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rie.2017.05.002&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, paid tutoring arrangements can create or further highlight socioeconomic disparities between low-income, middle-income and high-income populations. A study found that access to private tutoring was less financially affordable for low-income families, who thus benefited less from private tutoring as compared to high-income populations, who had the resources to profit from private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Hsiao-Lei. “Private Tutoring, Wealth Constraint and Higher Education.” ''Pacific Economic Review'' 20, no. 4 (October 2015): 608–34. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0106.12122&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

=== Tutoring as "Shadow Education" ===
Tutoring has also emerged as a supplement to public and private schooling in many countries. The supplementary nature of tutoring is a feature in the domain of what some scholars have termed "shadow education".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bray, Mark. “Shadow Education: Comparative Perspectives on the Expansion and Implications of Private Supplementary Tutoring.” ''Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences'' 77 (April 2013): 412–20. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.03.096&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Shadow education has been defined as "a set of educational activities that occur out side formal schooling and are designed to enhance the student's formal school career."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David Lee, and David P. Baker. “Shadow Education and Allocation in Formal Schooling: Transition to University in Japan.” ''American Journal of Sociology'' 97, no. 6 (1992): 1639–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "shadow" has four components to it: firstly, the existence of and need for tutoring is produced by the existence of the formal education system; secondly, the formal education system is the mainstream system and thus tutoring is its shadow; thirdly, the focus remains on mainstream education in schools; fourthly, tutoring is largely informal and unstructured as compared to formal or mainstream education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confronting the Shadow Education System: What Government Policies for What Private Tutoring?|last=Bray|first=Mark|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|year=2009|isbn=978-92-803-1333-8|location=Paris|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of the popularity of shadow education, private tutoring can sometimes overshadow mainstream education with more priority given to enrolling in private tutoring centers. Mark Bray claims that "Especially near the time of major external examinations, schools in some countries may be perceived by pupils to be less able to cater for their specific needs."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Wilbur Olin Atwater''' (May 3, 1844 – September 22, 1907) was an American chemist known for his studies of [[human nutrition]] and [[metabolism]]. He is credited with developing the [[Atwater system]], laying the groundwork, in the 19th century, for the science of nutrition in the United States and inspiring modern [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] nutrition.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/07/31/olympians-owe-gold-standard-to-1th-century-chemist/ Olympians Owe Gold Standard to 19th Century Chemist], Fox News. By  Paul Martin. Published 31 July 2012. Retrieved 4 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Atwater was born in [[Johnsburg, New York]] and grew up in the New England area.  He opted not to fight in the [[American Civil War]] and instead to pursue an undergraduate degree at [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Connecticut]]. In 1868, Atwater's interest in [[civil engineering]] and [[agricultural chemistry]] led him to enroll in [[Yale University]]'s [[Sheffield Scientific School]], where he analyzed agricultural fertilizers for specific mineral content. Atwater received his [[doctorate]] in 1869 in agricultural chemistry, his thesis being entitled "The Proximate Composition of Several Types of American Maize." Afterwards, he spent two years in [[Leipzig]] and [[Berlin]], where he visited agricultural experiment stations. Atwater also spent time traveling throughout [[Scotland]], [[Rome]], and [[Naples]], where he reported his findings in local newspapers distributed where he lived back in the United States. Atwater later returned to the United States to teach at [[East Tennessee University]] and later Wesleyan as its first Professor of Chemistry.&lt;ref name="carpenter"&gt;{{cite conference |title=The Life and Times of W.O.

His granddaughter [[Catherine Galbraith|Catherine Merriam Atwater]] married economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J. M.

== Scientific advancement ==
[[Image:Wilbur Atwater seated.jpg|thumb|left|Atwater's [[USDA]] portrait]]
Atwater is best known for his studies of human nutrition. He invented and used the [[respiration calorimeter]], with the help of fellow Wesleyan scientists [[Edward Bennett Rosa]] and [[Francis Gano Benedict]], to measure precisely the energy provided by food and created a system to measure that energy in units, known as [[food calorie]]s as developed in the [[Atwater system]]. "Maintained in the basement of Judd Hall [at Wesleyan], the 4- by 8-foot chamber housed a machine that measured human oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output."&lt;ref name="courant.com"&gt;[http://www.courant.com/health/connecticut/hc-wesleyan-calorie-history-1124-20111123,0,4629898.story Hartford Courant, Counting Calories? You Can Thank — Or Blame — Wesleyan Professor, by William Weir, November 23, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

With annual costs exceeding $10 thousand, the respiration calorimeter was considered a dream project for the 19th century. Atwater began the first of about 500 experiments in 1896. In fact, "he made history by establishing America’s first state agricultural experiment station at [Wesleyan]."&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt; He studied respiration and metabolism in animals and in humans. The calorimeter aided studies in food analysis, dietary evolution, work energy consumption, and digestible foods. It measured the human metabolism balance by analyzing the [[heat]] produced and [[metabolic rate]] by a person performing certain physical activities. With this machine, the dynamics of metabolism could be quantified and the balance between food intake and energy output could be measured.&lt;ref name="lederer"&gt;{{Citation |title=A History of American Bodies |first=Susan |last=Lederer |publisher=Yale University |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]] |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwater applied the [[first law of thermodynamics]] to his research: Energy can be transformed (i.e., changed from one form to another), but it can neither be created nor destroyed. Before Atwater's development of the respiration calorimeter, many experiments on calorie intake and expenditure had been conducted on animals. During this period, there was a widely held belief that the first law of thermodynamics applied to animals, but did not apply to humans because they were unique. Atwater demonstrated that whatever amount of consumed energy humans cannot use is left over and stored in the body. His findings thus established that the first law applied to humans as well as animals. Atwater's research and conclusions in this regard changed both how people thought about science and about humans.&lt;ref name="courant.com"/&gt;

The results from Atwater’s calorimetry study influenced many areas of American life. Most importantly, the calorimeter was a great influence to the growing awareness of the [[food calorie]] as a unit of measure both in terms of consumption and metabolism. Atwater reported on the weight of the calorie as a means to measure the efficiency of a diet. He stated  different types of food produced different amounts of energy.  He stressed the importance of an inexpensive and efficient diet that included more proteins, beans, and vegetables in place of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Price |first1=Catherine  |title=Probing the Mysteries of Human Digestion  |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/probing-the-mysteries-of-human-digestion |journal=Distillations |publisher= [[Science History Institute]] |date=2018|volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=26-35|accessdate=November 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"His careful studies of nutrition and those that followed helped spur federal policies that have done much to alleviate childhood hunger. We see reflections of his influence on the labels of products in our grocery stores, and we’re beginning to see nutritional information on the menus of restaurants. Today’s familiar food pyramid, a quick and easy visual guide to the recommended daily intake of food, is a tribute to Atwater and his successors."&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;

Atwater also studied the effect of [[alcohol]] on the body. His findings showed humans generated heat from alcohol just as they generated heat from a carbohydrate.&lt;ref name="lederer" /&gt; At a time when the [[Scientific Temperance Federation]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] doubted the nutritional value of alcohol, Atwater proved alcohol could be oxidized in the body and used to some extent as fuel for the human motor. Information gained from Atwater’s experiments was used by the liquor trade in the promotion of alcohol. "[Atwater] was very prominent in the temperance movement, and every year he would lecture the students about temperance and tried to promote [abstention from alcohol]," ... "Being a good scientist, he reported the data and was very upset that alcohol companies used his research" to advertise their products.&lt;ref name="courant.com"/&gt;

== Continuation of study ==
After completing his study, Atwater concluded that Americans consumed too much [[fat]] and [[sweets]] and did not exercise enough. His collaborator and successor at Wesleyan, [[Francis Benedict]] (1870–1957), continued down Atwater’s path using the respiration calorimeter to further measure metabolism and other bodily processes. Benedict studied the varying metabolism rates of infants born in two hospitals in Massachusetts, athletes, students, vegetarians, Mayans living in the Yucatán, and normal adults. He even developed a calorimeter large enough to hold twelve girl scouts for an extended period of time. His biggest improvement was the invention of portable field respiration calorimeters. In 1919, Francis Benedict published a metabolic standards report with extensive tables based on age, sex, height, and weight.&lt;ref name="lederer" /&gt;

'''Zinch''' was a company that helped students find scholarships and engage in college networking and recruiting. The company's website enabled students to create a profile similar to a [[college application]], which could be browsed by colleges in which they were interested, providing a forum for a connection between college and Zinch user. Colleges also had the ability to search through these profiles in order to contact interested students.

==History==
Zinch started out as a research project at [[Princeton University]] in June 2006&lt;ref&gt;''Princeton School of Engineering'', http://engineering.princeton.edu/news/en&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} by a group of students. The company was founded by Mick Hagen, Brad Hagen, and Sid Krommenhoek and launched to the public in March 2007.  The company was later run by Anne Dwane, who previously founded and ran [[Military.com]].

In September 2011, [[Chegg]] agreed to acquire Zinch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20110915/chegg-buys-zinch-in-another-move-toward-a-social-education-platform/|title=Chegg Buys Zinch in Another Move Toward a "Social Education Platform"|publisher=[[All Things Digital|allthingsd.com]]|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its expanding digital student hub.  Eventually, the zinch web address began to redirect to Chegg's website, retiring the Zinch brand.
