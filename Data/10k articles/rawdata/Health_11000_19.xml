      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3957">'''Abortion in Serbia''' was legalized in its current form (in Serbia and the other [[Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav republics]]) on October 7, 1977.&lt;ref name="serbia"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/yugoslavia.doc Abortion Policy - Yugoslavia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="law"&gt;[http://www.medicalabortionconsortium.org/law-policy/CS/ ICMA - Laws on Abortion - Serbia and Montenegro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710064232/http://www.medicalabortionconsortium.org/law-policy/CS/ |date=2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is available on-demand for women whose pregnancies have not exceeded the tenth week, and in the case of risk to life or health of woman (no limit specified), or when the pregnancy has resulted from a sex offence (including rape or incest), or in case of fetal impairment up to twenty weeks.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt; Minors under 16 require parental consent before undergoing an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/abortion/SERBIA.abo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates suggest that Serbia  has the highest abortion rate in Europe. Official data from the Belgrade Institute of Public Health claims that 23,000 abortions are performed in Serbia annually, but unofficial data suggests a number as high as 150,000.&lt;ref name="setimes.com"&gt;http://setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2012/01/16/feature-03&lt;/ref&gt;  Although abortions performed after 10 weeks must be done only if there is a specific approved reason, in practice, abortions on demand are performed later than the legal limit - women often obtain fake medical documentation, for example, a note from a psychiatrist stating that they are mentally unstable.&lt;ref&gt;.http://setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2012/01/16/feature-03&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, doctors who want to perform abortions have to obtain a license; because the process of obtaining this license can be strict and complicated many doctors work illegally without a license, and do not report the abortions that they perform.&lt;ref name="setimes.com"/&gt; Until recently, abortion was a leading method of [[birth control]] in what is now the country of Serbia. Lack of [[sex education]], coupled with little to no knowledge of contraception methods caused a large number of [[unwanted pregnancies]], and with them, a high number of terminations.&lt;ref name="serbia" /&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, approximately 12 percent of sexually active women in Serbia used modern contraception such as condoms.&lt;ref name="serbia" /&gt;

In 2009, 23.2% of pregnancies in Serbia ended in abortion. The highest year on record was 1989, when 68% of pregnancies were terminated.&lt;ref name="rate"&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-serbia.html Historical abortion statistics, Serbia]&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as 2006, Serbia continued to have the highest rate of abortions out of the former Yugoslav republics.&lt;ref name="rate2"&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/mapyugoabrate.html Countries of former Yugoslavia: percentage of pregnancies aborted]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mifepristone]] (medical abortion) was registered in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gynuity.org/resources/read/llist-of-mifepristone-approval-en/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926164348/http://gynuity.org/resources/read/llist-of-mifepristone-approval-en |archive-date=2017-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
A Pew Research poll from 2017 showed that 63% of Serbians believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases, while 31% think it should be illegal in all/most cases.&lt;ref&gt;http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/09154356/Central-and-Eastern-Europe-Topline_FINAL-FOR-PUBLICATION.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3162">An '''alcohol enema''', also known colloquially as '''butt-chugging''', is the act of introducing [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] into the [[rectum]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] via the [[anus]]. This method of alcohol consumption can be dangerous and even deadly because it leads to faster [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]] since the alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream and neutralizes the body's ability to reject the toxin by vomiting.

==Administration==
Two reported alcohol enema techniques are via an alcohol-soaked [[tampon]] or a funnel, such as a [[beer bong]], inserted into the rectum.&lt;ref name="khpo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Teens using vodka tampons to get drunk |author= |url=http://www.kpho.com/story/15981315/teens-using-vodka-tampons-to-get-drunk |newspaper=KPHO-TV |date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects and dangers==
An alcohol enema is a faster method of [[alcohol intoxication]] since the alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. The [[Human gastrointestinal tract#Lower gastrointestinal tract|lower gastrointestinal tract]] lacks the [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]] present in the stomach and liver that breaks down [[ethanol]] into [[acetylaldehyde]], which is actually more toxic than ethanol (drinking alcohol) and is responsible for most chronic effects of ethanol. When rectally absorbed, ethanol will still eventually arrive at the liver, but the high alcohol content could overwhelm the organ. Additionally, consuming the alcohol rectally neutralizes the body's ability to reject the toxin by vomiting.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |title=Experts: Alcohol enemas 'extremely dangerous' |author= |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/26/health/alcohol-enemas/index.html |newspaper=CNN |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
In May 2004, a 58-year-old machine shop owner of [[Lake Jackson, Texas|Lake Jackson]], [[Texas]], died after his wife administered an alcohol enema of [[sherry]]. In total, the man consumed two large bottles of sherry, containing about three liters of the alcohol. He suffered from [[alcoholism]] and had difficulty ingesting alcohol orally because of a painful throat ailment. His wife was indicted on a charge of [[negligent homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman accused of giving husband lethal sherry enema |author= |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/article/Woman-accused-of-giving-husband-lethal-sherry-1165596.php |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=2 February 2005 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, prosecutors dropped the charges due to insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charges dropped in sherry-enema death |author= |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Charges-dropped-in-sherry-enema-death-1826761.php |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=4 October 2007 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charges dismissed in Texas sherry enema death |author= |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/10/03/us-texas-sherry-enema-idUSN0325982220071003 |agency=Reuters |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Barnes-Jewish was formed by the merger of two hospitals, Barnes Hospital and The Jewish Hospital of St. Louis. Each hospital built in the early 1900's in proximity to each other on the eastern edge of [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]]. Although the hospitals were initially linked by an affiliation agreement in 1993, the two were legally merged in 1996.

Barnes Hospital was founded at the bequest of wholesale grocer and banker, [[Robert A. Barnes|Robert Barnes]], who died in 1892. In coordination between Barnes executors and St. Louis philanthropist [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Brookings]], the hospital was intended as an affiliate for the Washington University school of medicine. Barnes hospital opened on December 7, 1914 at its current location on Kingshighway Boulevard. The hospital was designed by architect, [[Theodore Link]], and initially had a 373 bed capacity. It was at this time that the [[St. Louis Children's Hospital]], and in 1915 the reorganized school of medicine, were relocated adjacent to Barnes Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Renaissance, A History of the Central West End|last=O'Connor|first=Candace|publisher=Reedy Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-68106-124-5|location=|pages=75-86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish Hospital was founded in 1902 by leaders of the St. Louis Jewish community in order to care for "the sick and disabled of, 'any creed or nationality.'" The hospital was originally located on 5414 [[Delmar Boulevard (St. Louis)|Delmar Boulevard]]. Due to the increasing number of patients and need for expansion, the hospital was relocated two blocks north of the Barnes hospital/Washington University Medical school complex in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beckerarchives.wustl.edu/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=8802&amp;q=|title=The Jewish Hospital of St. Louis Records, 1878-2006 {{!}} Bernard Becker Medical Library Archives|last=|first=|date=|website=Beckerarchives.wustl.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blackwater fever''' is a complication of [[malaria infection]] in which [[RBCs|red blood cells]] burst in the bloodstream ([[hemolysis]]), releasing [[hemoglobinemia|hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels]] and [[hemoglobinuria|into the urine]], frequently leading to [[kidney failure]]. The disease was first linked to malaria by the [[Sierra Leon]]ean physician Dr [[John Farrell Easmon]] in his 1884 pamphlet entitled ''The Nature and Treatment of Blackwater Fever.'' Easmon coined the name "blackwater fever" and was the first to successfully treat such cases following the publication of his pamphlet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Within a few days of onset there are chills, with [[rigor (medicine)|rigor]], high [[fever]], [[jaundice]], vomiting, rapidly progressive [[anemia]], and dark red or black urine.

==Causes==
The cause of [[hemolysis|hemolytic]] crises in this disease is unknown (mainly due to intravascular haemolysis). There is rapid and massive destruction of [[red blood cells]] resulting in [[hemoglobinemia]] ([[hemoglobin]] in the blood, but outside the red blood cells), [[hemoglobinuria]] (hemoglobin in urine), intense jaundice, [[anuria]] (passing less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day), and finally death in the majority of cases.

The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. There has been at least one case, however, attributed to ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katongole-Mbidde E, Banura C, Kizito A |title=Blackwater fever caused by ''Plasmodium vivax'' infection in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=296 |issue=6625 |pages=827 |date=1988-03-19 |pmid=3130932 |pmc=2545111 |doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6625.827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but [[cerebral malaria]] has a higher [[mortality rate]]. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950.&lt;ref name=pmid12355996&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bruneel, F. |author2=B. Gacho |author3=M. Wolff |title=Blackwater fever |language=French |publisher=Presse médicale (Paris, France: 1983) |volume=31 |issue=28 |pages=1329–34 |year=2002 |pmid=12355996 |doi=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that [[quinine]] plays a role in triggering the condition, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria [[prophylaxis]]. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria.

==Treatment==
The treatment is [[malaria|antimalarial]] chemotherapy, [[intravenous]] fluid and sometimes supportive care such as [[intensive care]] and [[dialysis]].

==Prominent victims==
*Prior to his photography career, [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/features/Henri-Cartier-Bresson-8466-1.aspx|title=10 things to know about HenriCartier-Bresson {{!}} Christie's’|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; contracted blackwater fever while hunting in Western Africa. Expecting to die, he sent instructions to his family on his wishes for a funeral. He made a full recovery. 
*Missionary and explorer [[George Grenfell]] died after a bad attack of blackwater fever at [[Basoko]] on 1 July 1906.
*Actor [[Don Adams]], best known as Maxwell Smart from the popular sitcom ''[[Get Smart]]'' and as the title character in ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', contracted blackwater fever after being shot in combat at [[Guadalcanal]] during [[World War II]]. Adams was evacuated from his [[United States Marine Corps]] unit to a hospital in [[New Zealand]] where he ultimately made a full recovery.
*Humanitarian and MMA fighter [[Justin Wren]] contracted malaria, which devolved into blackwater fever, while drilling water-wells for [[Congo Pygmies]] in 2013. The affliction nearly claimed Wren's life. He was misdiagnosed four times and required airlift to Uganda, where he narrowly recovered from severe symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/8/27/9213895/justin-wren-has-returned-from-the-congo-but-his-fight-for-the-pygmies|title=Wren back in MMA to 'Fight for the Forgotten'|date=27 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical uses===
Complications of labor and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery include:
* abnormal presentation ([[Breech birth|breech]] or [[:wikt:transverse|transverse positions]]). Babies are usually born head first. If the baby is in another position the birth may be complicated. In a ‘breech presentation’, the unborn baby is bottom-down instead of head-down. Babies born bottom-first are more likely to be harmed during a normal (vaginal) birth than those born head-first. For instance, the baby might not get enough oxygen during the birth. Having a planned caesarean may reduce these problems. A review looking at planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation with planned vaginal birth, concludes that in the short term, births with a planned caesarean were safer for babies than vaginal births. Fewer babies died or were seriously hurt when they were born by caesarean. There was tentative evidence that children who were born by caesarean had more health problems at age two. Caesareans caused some short-term problems for mothers such as more abdominal pain.

===Prevention===
The prevalence of caesarean section is generally agreed to be higher than needed in many countries, and physicians are encouraged to actively lower the rate, as a caesarean rate higher than 10-15% is not associated with reductions in maternal or infant mortality rates.&lt;ref name="WHO2015" /&gt; Some evidence supports a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.&lt;ref name=Mol2015/&gt;

Some of these efforts are: emphasizing a long [[Childbirth#First stage: latent phase|latent phase]] of labor is not abnormal and not a justification for C-section; a new definition of the start of active labor from a cervical dilatation of 4&amp;nbsp;cm to a dilatation of 6&amp;nbsp;cm; and allowing women who have previously given birth to push for at least 2 hours, with 3 hours of pushing for women who have not previously given birth, before [[Tocolytic|labor arrest]] is considered.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; [[Physical exercise]] during pregnancy decreases the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domenjoz|first1=I|last2=Kayser|first2=B|last3=Boulvain|first3=M|title=Effect of physical activity during pregnancy on mode of delivery |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=October 2014|volume=211|issue=4|pages=401.e1–11|pmid=24631706|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2014.03.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who had caesarean sections are more likely to have problems with later pregnancies, and  women who want larger families should not seek an elective caesarean unless medical indications to do so exist. The risk of [[placenta accreta]], a potentially life-threatening condition which is more likely to develop where a woman has had a previous caesarean section, is 0.13% after two caesarean sections, but increases to 2.13% after four and then to 6.74% after six or more.

{{Further|Delivery after previous caesarean section}}
Women who have had a caesarean for any reason are somewhat less likely to become pregnant again as compared to women who have previously delivered only vaginally, but the effect is small.&lt;ref name="Gurol-UrganciBou-Antoun2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurol-Urganci|first1=I.|last2=Bou-Antoun|first2=S.|last3=Lim|first3=C.

Women who had just one previous caesarean section are more likely to have problems with their second birth.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; [[Delivery after previous caesarean section]] is by either of two main options:
*Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)
*[[Elective surgery|Elective]] repeat caesarean section (ERCS)

Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. There are many issues which must be taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous caesarean section and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of [[uterine rupture]] (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or [[endometritis]] (10 per 1,000), and [[perinatal death]] of the child (0.25 per 1,000).&lt;ref name=rcog2007&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |title=Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth, Green-top Guideline No. 45 |date=February 2007 |website= |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207031819/https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |archivedate=7 December 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section.&lt;ref name="americanpregnancy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"/&gt; On the other hand, VBAC confers less [[maternal morbidity]] and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.&lt;ref name="American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63"&gt;{{cite journal|last=American Congress of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=ACOG Practice bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Aug 2010|volume=116|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=450–63|pmid=20664418|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adhesions====
[[File:Suturing uterus.JPG|thumb|Suturing of the uterus after extraction]]
[[Image:C-sec suture.jpg|thumb|right|Closed incision for ''low transverse abdominal incision'' after stapling has been completed]]
There are several steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of [[adhesions]]. Such techniques and principles may include:

:• Handling all tissue with absolute care
:• Using powder-free surgical gloves
:• Controlling bleeding
:• Choosing sutures and implants carefully
:• Keeping tissue moist
:• Preventing infection with antibiotics given intravenously to the mother before skin incision

Despite these proactive measures, adhesion formation is a recognized complication of any abdominal or pelvic surgery. To prevent adhesions from forming after caesarean section, [[adhesion barrier]] can be placed during surgery to minimize the risk of adhesions between the uterus and ovaries, the small bowel, and almost any tissue in the abdomen or pelvis. This is not current UK practice, as there is no compelling evidence to support the benefit of this intervention.

Adhesions can cause long-term problems, such as:

:• [[Female Infertility|Infertility]], which may end when adhesions distort the tissues of the ovaries and tubes, impeding the normal passage of the egg (ovum) from the ovary to the uterus.  One in five infertility cases may be adhesion related (stoval)
:• Chronic pelvic pain, which may result when adhesions are present in the pelvis. Almost 50% of chronic pelvic pain cases are estimated to be adhesion related (stoval)
:• Small bowel obstruction: the disruption of normal bowel flow, which can result when adhesions twist or pull the small bowel.

The risk of adhesion formation is one reason why vaginal delivery is usually considered safer than elective caesarean section where there is no medical indication for section for either maternal or fetal reasons.

===Child===
Non-medically indicated (elective) childbirth before 39 weeks gestation "carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother." Complications from elective caesarean before 39 weeks include: newborn mortality at 37 weeks may be up to 3 times the number at 40 weeks, and was elevated compared to 38 weeks gestation. These “early term” births were associated with more death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks ("full term").&lt;ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patientsafetycouncil.org/uploads/MOD_39_Weeks_Toolkit.pdf |title=Elimination of Non-medically Indicated (Elective) Deliveries Before 39 Weeks Gestational Age |accessdate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120003529/http://www.patientsafetycouncil.org/uploads/MOD_39_Weeks_Toolkit.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in one study and another review found many benefits to going full term, but “no adverse effects” in the health of the mothers or babies.&lt;ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlTerm Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2011/06000/Term_Pregnancy__A_Period_of_Heterogeneous_Risk_for.5.aspx|title=Term Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|accessdate=12 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217130250/http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2011/06000/Term_Pregnancy__A_Period_of_Heterogeneous_Risk_for.5.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] and medical policy makers review research studies and find more incidence of suspected or proven [[sepsis]], RDS, hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, and need for hospitalization &gt; 4–5 days. In the case of caesarean sections, rates of respiratory death were 14 times higher in pre-labor at 37 compared with 40 weeks gestation, and 8.2 times higher for pre-labor caesarean at 38 weeks. In this review, no studies found decreased neonatal morbidity due to non-medically indicated (elective) delivery before 39 weeks.&lt;ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"/&gt;

* Potential for early delivery and complications: Preterm delivery may be inadvertently carried out if the due-date calculation is inaccurate. One study found an increased complication risk if a repeat elective caesarean section is performed even a few days before the recommended 39 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99132594 Study: Early Repeat C-Sections Puts Babies At Risk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131115102/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99132594 |date=31 January 2016 }}.

==Classification==
Caesarean sections have been classified in various ways by different perspectives.&lt;ref name="AlthabeTorloni2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Althabe|first1=Fernando|last2=Torloni|first2=Maria Regina|last3=Betran|first3=Ana Pilar|last4=Souza|first4=Joao Paulo|last5=Widmer|first5=Mariana|last6=Allen|first6=Tomas|last7=Gulmezoglu|first7=Metin|last8=Merialdi|first8=Mario|title=Classifications for Cesarean Section: A Systematic Review|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=1|year=2011|pages=e14566|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0014566|pmid=21283801|pmc=3024323|bibcode=2011PLoSO...614566T}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to discuss all classification systems is to group them by their focus either on the urgency of the procedure, characteristics of the mother, or as a group based on other, less commonly discussed factors.&lt;ref name="AlthabeTorloni2011"/&gt;

It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.&lt;ref name="AlthabeTorloni2011"/&gt;

===By urgency===
Conventionally, caesarean sections are classified as being either an [[elective surgery]] or an [[emergency]] operation.&lt;ref name="classification 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=DN|last2=Yentis|first2=SM|last3=Kinsella|first3=SM|last4=Holdcroft|first4=A|last5=May|first5=AE|last6=Wee|first6=M|last7=Robinson|first7=PN|title=Urgency of caesarean section: a new classification |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=Jul 2000|volume=93|issue=7|pages=346–50|pmid=10928020|pmc=1298057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform [[general anesthesia]] or [[regional anesthesia]] (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important and is based on many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman.&lt;ref name="classification 2000"/&gt; Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery is an important issue affecting this decision.

A planned caesarean (or elective/scheduled caesarean), arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical indications which have developed before or during the pregnancy, and ideally after 39 weeks of gestation. In the UK, this is classified as a 'grade 4' section (delivery timed to suit the mother or hospital staff) or as a 'grade 3' section (no maternal or fetal compromise but early delivery needed).
Emergency caesarean sections are performed in pregnancies in which a vaginal delivery was planned initially, but an indication for caesarean delivery has since developed. In the UK they are further classified as grade 2 (delivery required within 90 minutes of the decision but no immediate threat to the life of the woman or the fetus) or grade 1 (delivery required within 30 minutes of the decision: immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby or both.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miheso|first1=Johnstone|last2=Burns|first2=Sean|title=Care of women undergoing emergency caesarean section|url=https://www.wwl.nhs.uk/Library/FOI/Requests/2013-2014/July_2013/1678_Emergency_Caesarean_Section_Jul12.pdf|website=NHS Choices|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elective caesarean sections may be performed on the basis of an obstetrical or medical indication, or because of a medically non-indicated [[Caesarean delivery on maternal request|maternal request]].&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; Among women in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia, about 7% preferred caesarean section as a method of delivery.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; In cases without medical indications the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] and the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend a planned vaginal delivery.&lt;ref name=ACOG559&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American College of Obstetricians and|first1=Gynecologists|title=ACOG committee opinion no. 559: Cesarean delivery on maternal request |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Apr 2013|volume=121|issue=4|pages=904–7|pmid=23635708|doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000428647.67925.d3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends that if after a woman has been provided information on the risk of a planned caesarean section and she still insists on the procedure it should be provided.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; If provided this should be done at 39 weeks of gestation or later.&lt;ref name=ACOG559/&gt;

===By characteristics of the mother===

====Caesarean delivery on maternal request====
{{main|Caesarean delivery on maternal request}}
Caesarean delivery on maternal request  (CDMR) is a medically unnecessary caesarean section, where the conduct of a [[childbirth]] via a caesarean section is requested by the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] patient even though there is not a medical [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] to have the surgery.&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=State-of-the-Science Conference Statement.

====After previous caesarean====
{{See also|Delivery after previous caesarean section}}
Mothers who have previously had a caesarean section are more likely to have a caesarean section for future pregnancies than mothers who have never had a caesarean section. There is discussion about the circumstances under which women should have a vaginal birth after a previous caesarean.

Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is the practice of [[Childbirth|birthing a baby]] vaginally after a previous baby has been delivered by caesarean section (surgically).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-vbac-overview Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) - Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230133854/http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-vbac-overview |date=30 December 2009 }}, [[WebMD]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), successful VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies.&lt;ref name="American College of Obstetricians and 450–63"&gt;{{cite journal|last=American College of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=ACOG Practice bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Aug 2010|volume=116|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=450–63|pmid=20664418|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb251}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the American Pregnancy Association, 90% of women who have undergone caesarean deliveries are candidates for VBAC.&lt;ref name="americanpregnancy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |title=Vaginal Birth after Cesarean (VBAC) |publisher=American Pregnancy Association |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621050450/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |archivedate=21 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 60-80% of women opting for VBAC will successfully give birth vaginally, which is comparable to the overall vaginal delivery rate in the United States in 2010.&lt;ref name="americanpregnancy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/VB99999 Vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC) guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312103525/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/vb99999 |date=12 March 2010 }}, [[Mayo Clinic]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |title=NCHS Data Brief: Recent Trends in Cesarean Delivery in the United States Products |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=March 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517145002/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |archivedate=17 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twins====
For otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bis2013/&gt; Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section.&lt;ref name="Bis2013"/&gt;  There is controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not.&lt;ref name=Bis2013/&gt; When the first twin is not head down at the point of labor starting, a caesarean section should be recommended.&lt;ref name=Bis2013/&gt; Although the second twin typically has a higher frequency of problems, it is not known if a planned caesarean section affects this.&lt;ref name=NICE2011 /&gt; It is estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by caesarean section in 2008.&lt;ref name="pmid22015878"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee HC, Gould JB, Boscardin WJ, El-Sayed YY, Blumenfeld YJ | title = Trends in cesarean delivery for twin births in the United States: 1995-2008 | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 1095–101 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22015878 | pmc = 3202294 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182318651 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breech birth====
{{main|Breech birth}}
A breech birth is the [[birth]] of a baby from a breech [[presentation (obstetrics)|presentation]], in which the baby exits the pelvis with the [[buttocks]] or [[foot|feet]] first as opposed to the normal [[cephalic presentation|head-first presentation]]. In breech presentation, fetal heart sounds are heard just above the umbilicus.

The bottom-down position presents some hazards to the baby during the process of [[birth]], and the mode of delivery (vaginal versus caesarean) is controversial in the fields of [[obstetrics]] and [[midwifery]].

Though vaginal [[childbirth|birth]] is possible for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal breech birth. The majority of breech babies born in the United States and the UK are delivered by caesarean section as studies have shown increased risks of morbidity and mortality for vaginal breech delivery, and most obstetricians counsel against planned vaginal breech birth for this reason.  As a result of reduced numbers of actual vaginal breech deliveries, obstetricians and midwives are at risk of de-skilling in this important skill. All those involved in delivery of obstetric and midwifery care in the UK undergo mandatory training in conducting breech deliveries in the simulation environment (using dummy pelvises and mannequins to allow practice of this important skill) and this training is carried out regularly to keep skills up to date.

====Resuscitative hysterotomy====
{{main|Resuscitative hysterotomy}}
A resuscitative [[hysterotomy]],  also known as a peri-mortem caesarean delivery, is an emergency caesarean delivery carried out where maternal [[cardiac arrest]] has occurred, to assist in [[resuscitation]] of the mother by removing the [[aortocaval compression syndrome|aortocaval compression]] generated by the gravid uterus. Unlike other forms of caesarean section, the welfare of the fetus is a secondary priority only, and the procedure may be performed even prior to the limit of [[fetal viability]] if it is judged to be of benefit to the mother.

===Other ways, including by surgery technique===
There are several types of caesarean section (CS). An important distinction lies in the type of incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the [[uterus]], apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a [[Pfannenstiel incision]] but there is no way of knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.
* The classical caesarean section involves a midline incision on the uterus [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal incision]] which allows a larger space to deliver the baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the lower segment of the uterus is unformed as it is safer in this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. Any woman who has had a classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision is much more likely to rupture in labor than the transverse incision.
* The [[lower uterine segment section]] is the procedure most commonly used today; it involves a [[transverse cut]] just above the edge of the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. It results in less [[Bleeding|blood loss]] and has fewer early and late complications for the mother, as well as allowing her to consider a vaginal birth in the next pregnancy.
* A caesarean [[hysterectomy]] consists of a caesarean section followed by the removal of the [[uterus]]. This may be done in cases of intractable bleeding or when the [[placenta]] cannot be separated from the uterus.

The [[EXIT procedure]] is a specialized surgical delivery procedure used to deliver babies who have airway compression.

The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of [[Misgav Ladach]], a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montréal in 1994&lt;ref&gt;Stark M. Technique of cesarean section: Misgav Ladach method. In: Popkin DR, Peddle LJ (eds): Women’s Health Today. Perspectives on current research and clinical practice. Proceedings of the XIV World Congress of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Montreal. Parthenon Publishing group, New York, 81–5&lt;/ref&gt; and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. There is also an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.&lt;ref name="pmid17904561"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nabhan AF | title = Long-term outcomes of two different surgical techniques for cesarean | journal = Int J Gynaecol Obstet | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17904561 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2007.07.011 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22752598"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hudić I, Bujold E, Fatušić Z, Skokić F, Latifagić A, Kapidžić M, Fatušić J | title = The Misgav-Ladach method of cesarean section: a step forward in operative technique in obstetrics | journal = Arch.

In many hospitals, the mother's partner is encouraged to attend the surgery to support the mother and share the experience. The [[anaesthetist]] will usually lower the drape temporarily as the child is delivered so the parents can see their newborn.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Anesthesia===
Both [[general anesthesia|general]] and [[regional anesthesia|regional anaesthesia]] ([[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]], [[epidural]] or [[combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia]]) are acceptable for use during caesarean section. Evidence does not show a difference between regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby.&lt;ref name="Afolabi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=2012|title=Regional versus general anaesthesia for Caesarean section|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=10|issue=|pages=CD004350|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004350.pub3|pmid=23076903|vauthors=Afolabi BB, Lesi FE|editor1-last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional anaesthesia may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby.&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawkins JL, Koonin LM, Palmer SK, Gibbs CP | title = Anesthesia-related deaths during obstetric delivery in the United States, 1979–1990 | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–84 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9054245 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199702000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia is better at preventing [[persistent postoperative pain]] 3 to 8 months after caesarean section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Erica J.|last2=Levene|first2=Jacob L.|last3=Cohen|first3=Marc S.|last4=Andreae|first4=Doerthe A.|last5=Chao|first5=Jerry Y.|last6=Johnson|first6=Matthew|last7=Hall|first7=Charles B.|last8=Andreae|first8=Michael H.|date=2018|title=Local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia for preventing persistent postoperative pain in adults and children|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=6|pages=CD007105|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=29926477|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: [[pulmonary aspiration]] (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and [[Esophagus|esophageal]] [[intubation]].&lt;ref name=Afolabi/&gt; One trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either spinal anaesthesia.&lt;ref name="Afolabi" /&gt;

Regional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled caesarean section.&lt;ref name="Bucklin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucklin BA, Hawkins JL, Anderson JR, Ullrich FA | title = Obstetric anesthesia workforce survey: twenty-year update | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 645–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16129992 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-200509000-00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional anaesthesia during caesarean section is different from the [[analgesia]] (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense [[nerve block]].

General anesthesia may be necessary because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when there is no time to perform a regional anesthesia.

==Recovery==
It is common for women who undergo caesarean section to have reduced or absent bowel movements for hours to days.  During this time, women may experience abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting. This usually resolves without treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pereira Gomes Morais|first=Edna|last2=Riera|first2=Rachel|last3=Porfírio|first3=Gustavo Jm|last4=Macedo|first4=Cristiane R.|last5=Sarmento Vasconcelos|first5=Vivian|last6=de Souza Pedrosa|first6=Alexsandra|last7=Torloni|first7=Maria R.|date=17 October 2016|title=Chewing gum for enhancing early recovery of bowel function after caesarean section|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD011562|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011562.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27747876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdominal, wound and back pain can continue for months after a caesarean section.

In the United States, C-section rates have increased from just over 20% in 1996 to 33% in 2011.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt; This increase has not resulted in improved outcomes resulting in the position that C-sections may be done too frequently.&lt;ref name=ACOG2014/&gt;

Speculation explaining a relationship between birth weight and maternal pelvis size has been proposed. The explanation, based on Darwinian-inspired logic, states that since the advent of successful caesarean birth more mothers with small pelvises and babies with large birth weights survive. This hypothesis would predict an increased average birth weight, which has been observed. It is unclear what component contributes more to this effect; evolution or environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evolution and the Cesarean Section Rate|doi=10.1662/0002-7685(2008)70[401:ETCSR]2.0.CO;2|journal=The American Biology Teacher|year=2008|pages=401–404|volume=70|issue=7|issn=0002-7685|last1=Walsh|first1=Joseph A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chanakya]], the Chandragupta's teacher and adviser, made up his mind that the baby should survive.

According to the ancient Chinese ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', Luzhong, a sixth-generation descendant of the mythological [[Yellow Emperor]], had six sons, all born by "cutting open the body".  The sixth son [[Jilian]] founded the House of Mi that ruled the [[State of Chu]] (c. 1030–223 BCE).&lt;ref name="shiji"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_040.htm |title=楚世家 (House of Chu) |work=[[Records of the Grand Historian]] |author=[[Sima Qian]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310023405/http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_040.htm |archivedate=10 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Irish mythology|Irish mythological]] text the [[Ulster Cycle]], the character [[Furbaide Ferbend]] is said to have been born by posthumous caesarean section, after his mother was murdered by his evil aunt [[Medb]].

The [[Babylonian Talmud]], an ancient [[Jew]]ish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed ''yotzei dofen''. It also discusses at length the permissibility of  performing a c-section on a dying or dead mother.&lt;ref name="Lurie"/&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of [[Gaius Julius Caesar (name)#The cognomen Caesar|the etymology of ''Caesar'']]). The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Julius Caesar's mother, [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]], lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility the Roman ruler and general was born by caesarean section. His first wife died in childbirth, giving birth to a stillborn son who might have lived had a caesarean taken place.

The [[Catalonia|Catalan]] saint [[Raymond Nonnatus]] (1204–1240), received his surname—from the [[Latin]] ''non-natus'' ("not born")—because he was born by caesarean section. His mother died while giving birth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=314 |title=St. Raymond Nonnatus |publisher=Catholic Online |accessdate=26 July 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719195735/http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=314 |archivedate=19 July 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:
* Introduction of the transverse incision technique to minimize bleeding by [[Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer]] in 1881 is thought to be first modern CS performed.
* The introduction of uterine [[suturing]] by [[Max Sänger]] in 1882
* Modification by [[Hermann Johannes Pfannenstiel]] in 1900, see [[Pfannenstiel incision]]

European travelers in the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes region]] of Africa during the 19th century observed caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov_p2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cesarean/part2.html |title=Cesarean Section&amp;nbsp;– A Brief History: Part 2 |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221043816/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cesarean/part2.html |archivedate=21 December 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing. From the well-developed nature of the procedures employed, European observers concluded they had been employed for some time.&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov_p2" /&gt; [[James Barry (surgeon)|James Barry]] carried out the first successful caesarean by a European doctor in Africa in Cape Town, while posted there between 1817 and 1828.&lt;ref name="New Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pain, Stephanie|date=6 March 2008|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726462.000-histories-the-male-military-surgeon-who-wasnt.html|title=The 'male' military surgeon who wasn't|work=NewScientist.com|accessdate=16 March 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314230931/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726462.000-histories-the-male-military-surgeon-who-wasnt.html|archivedate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful caesarean section to be performed in the United States took place in Mason County, Virginia (now Mason County, West Virginia), in 1794. The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815000,00.html|title=Woman's Ills|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=1 April 2009|date=18 June 1951|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413025430/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815000,00.html|archivedate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ''ab utero caeso'', "cut from the womb" giving this as an explanation for the [[cognomen]] "Caesar" which was then carried by his descendants.&lt;ref name="vanDongen-2009"/&gt;  Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a [[false etymology]], it has been widely believed. For example, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines caesarean birth as "the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the [[abdomen]] when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar".&lt;ref&gt;"Caesarean | Caesarian, adj. and n.". OED Online. June 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 June 2013 &lt;http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/26016&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'' (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, "from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen ''Caesar''".&lt;ref name="M-W_C_11"&gt;{{citation | author = Merriam-Webster | authorlink = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary | edition = 11th | publisher = Merriam-Webster | year = 2003 | location = Springfield, Massachusetts, USA| isbn = 978-0-87779-809-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some link with Julius Caesar or with Roman emperors exists in other languages as well.  For example, the modern [[German language|German]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] terms are respectively ''Kaiserschnitt'', ''keisersnitt'', ''kejsersnit'', ''keizersnede'', ''kejsarsnitt'', ''sezaryen'' and ''császármetszés'' (literally: "emperor's cut").&lt;ref&gt;For a summary (in German), of an article (also in German) that deals usefully with many of the relevant historical and linguistic questions raised here, go here [http://www.etymologie.info/~e/d_/de-medizi.html#Kaiserschnitt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106021301/http://www.etymologie.info/~e/d_/de-medizi.html|date=6 January 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The German term has also been imported into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (帝王切開 ''teiōsekkai'') and [[Korean language|Korean]] (제왕 절개 ''jewang jeolgae''), both literally meaning "emperor incision". Similarly, in western Slavic (Polish) ''cięcie cesarskie'', (Czech) ''císařský řez'' and (Slovak) ''cisársky rez'' means "emperor's cut", whereas the south Slavic term is [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''царски рез'' and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''cárski réz'', literally ''[[Tsar|tzar]]'s cut''. The [[Russian language|Russian]] term ''kesarevo secheniye'' (Кесарево сечение ''késarevo sečénije'') literally means ''Caesar's section''. The Arabic term (ولادة قيصرية ''wilaada qaySaríyya'') also means "caesarean birth." The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ניתוח קיסרי (''nitúakh Keisári'') translates literally as caesarean surgery. In Romania and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/cesariana |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019193949/http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/cesariana |archivedate=19 October 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is usually called ''cesariana'', meaning from (or related to) [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Finally, the Roman [[praenomen]] (given name) [[Caeso (praenomen)|Caeso]] was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumenfeld-Kosinski|first1=Renate|title=Not of woman born : representations of caesarean birth in medieval and Renaissance culture|date=1991|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-8014-9974-6|edition=1st}} "Appendix: Creative Etymology: ''Caesarean Section'' from Pliny to Rousset" (pp. 143-153) presents an excellent history of the legend of caesarean births in Western culture.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling ===
The term ''caesarean'' is spelled in various accepted ways, [[wikt:Caesarean#Alternative forms|as discussed at Wiktionary]]. The [[Medical Subject Headings|Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)]] of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|United States National Library of Medicine (NLM)]] uses ''cesarean section'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68002585 |title=Cesarean Section |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some other American medical works, e.g. ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', use ''caesarean'',&lt;ref name="fd"&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/caesarean&lt;/ref&gt; as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cesarean&lt;/ref&gt; and ''American Heritage Dictionary''&lt;ref name="fd" /&gt; list ''cesarean'' first and other spellings as "variants", an etymologically anhistorical position.

==Special cases==

In [[Judaism]], there is a dispute among the ''[[poskim]]'' (Rabbinic authorities) as to whether the first-born son from a caesarean section has the laws of a ''[[bechor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Chok Yaakov 470:2; Kaf ha-Chayim 470:3; {{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/pesach.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818005722/http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/pesach.html |archivedate=18 August 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, a male child delivered by caesarean is not eligible for the ''[[Pidyon HaBen]]'' dedication ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judaism.about.com/od/lifeevents/g/pidyonhaben.htm |title=Pidyon HaBen&amp;nbsp;— Definition of Pidyon HaBen (Redemption of the Firstborn) |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=19 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019184726/http://judaism.about.com/od/lifeevents/g/pidyonhaben.htm |archivedate=19 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cohen-levi.org/the_cohens_heritage/pidyon_ha_ben.htm |title=Kohanim forever from the sources, who is a cohen, the blessing of the Cohanim,.

In rare cases, caesarean sections can be used to remove a dead [[fetus]]. A [[late-term abortion]] using caesarean section procedures is termed a [[hysterotomy abortion]] and is very rarely performed.&lt;ref name="Medscape Abortion"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Francis E|title=Elective Abortion|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/252560-overview|website=Medscape|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=18 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214092044/http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic3311.htm|archivedate=14 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cytotoxic hazard symbol''' is a [[hazard symbol]] consisting of a [[triangle]] with the letter "C" inside it. It is used to label [[biomedical waste]] bags and containers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sterihealth.com.au/services/medical-waste-collection/cytotoxic-waste&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxic waste, the [[by-product]] of [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] [[drug therapy]] administered to patients (such as [[chemotherapy]]), typically includes all drug administrative [[equipment]] (e.g. needles, syringes, dripsets etc.) as well as all gowns and body fluids/waste from patients undergoing such treatment.

In such cases it is totally unconnected with any voluptuous sensation, and is only found accompanied by motor paralysis. It may occur spontaneously immediately after accident involving the cord, and is then probably due to undue excitement of the portion of the cord below the lesion, which is deprived of the regulating influence of the brain...

Death by hanging, whether an execution or a [[suicide]], has been observed to affect the genitals of both men and women. In women, the labia and clitoris may become engorged and there may be a discharge of blood from the vagina.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In men, "a more or less complete state of erection of the [[human penis|penis]], with discharge of urine, mucus or prostatic fluid is a frequent occurrence ... present in one case in three."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other causes of death may also result in these effects, including fatal gunshots to the head, damage to major blood vessels, and violent death by poisoning.

The '''Evans County Heart Study''' was a long-term [[cardiovascular]] study on residents of [[Evans County, Georgia]]. The study, which was funded by the [[National Institute of Health]], began in July, 1958, and was last updated as recent as May 2016. It resulted in more than 560 published papers that ultimately showed the importance of [[HDL cholesterol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musc.edu/catalyst/archive/2005/co1-14heart.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529150838/http://www.musc.edu/catalyst/archive/2005/co1-14heart.htm |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was conducted by Dr. [[Curtis Gordon Hames]], a [[family doctor]] from [[Claxton, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last2=Smith |first2=Diane K. |last3=Feldman |first3=Elaine B. |last4=Hames |first4=Curtis |date=1984 |title=Effect of age, sex, and race on selenium status of healthy residents of Augusta, Georgia |journal=Biological Trace Element Research |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |doi=10.1007/BF02918316 |last1=McAdam |first1=Patricia A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study took place in Evans Country because the area had a high death count due to heart complications, such as [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases]]. The studies showed that there was a significant abundance of heart conditions within a variety of ethnicities. People as young as fourteen and as old as seventy-four participated in the tests, and were divided into different age groups; however only males were eligible for the study. Anyone as old as one-hundred years old could be eligible, and any younger.

== Background  ==
The study involved 6,596 people from Evans County and 3,921 people from [[Bulloch County, Georgia|Bulloch County]]. The study population from Evans county consisted of African-American and [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] males, ages 40–74, along with a 15-39 year old group that were involved in other studies. Then, the people were divided up into 10 random, equal in size, random samples. Also, a 50% random sample of the 15-39 year old group was taken by including people from the first five samples solely. By comprising this type of sampling, secular trends in disease patterns, along with possible aging of laboratory reagents were randomized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonough|first=John R.|last2=Hames|first2=Curtis G.|last3=Stulb|first3=Sarah C.|last4=Garrison|first4=Glen E.|date=1963-12-01|title=Cardiovascular disease field study in Evans County, Ga|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=78|issue=12|pages=1051–1060|issn=0094-6214|pmc=1915405|pmid=14090074|doi=10.2307/4592020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study was done in Evans County, Georgia. Evans County is located in the southeastern portion of the United States. It is situated on the coastal plain estimating around 60 miles inland from the seaport of [[Savannah, GA]]. Around half of the population lives on farms while the other half lives in meager little villages. An example is [[Claxton, Georgia|Claxton]]. Claxton is a town that has a population of 2,000, about 40 percent of which is black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000296291541660X|title=Ethnicity and Cardiovascular Disease: The Evans County Heart Study |language=en|access-date=2017-05-03|doi=10.1016/S0002-9629(15)41660-X|volume=311|journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences|pages=130–134 | last1 = Hames | first1 = Curtis G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white population of Evans County was large enough to provide an adequete number for the study, but the black population was considered too small and some blacks from the Bulloch county were incorporated into this study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Goals and Methods ==
The study can be categorized as a [[cohort study]] due to the longevity of the research and its focus on the residents of [[Evans County, Georgia]]. It was the leader in the field of [[epidemiology]] to analyze effects and differences of [[coronary heart disease]] on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/study-synopsis/evans-county-cardiovascular-and-cerebrovascular-study/|title=Evans County Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Heart Study|last=Curtis|first=Hames|date=October 15, 2012|website=University of Minnesota|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study aimed to determine how [[cardiovascular disease]] affected different races among a specific population. To determine the population size, a specific census was conducted in the county for the study during the first two months of 1960, recording 6,596 persons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  From there, the study population included a total of 3,377 residents within Evans County. These residents included a group of randomly selected blacks and whites age 40-74 and an additional group of blacks were selected from Bulloch sub-County. A group of 15-39 year old residents were also selected into this group mainly to participate in other experiments as well. The study population was subsequently randomly divided into 10 groups.

The examination process consisted of two cardiovascular tests including "history and physical, [[blood pressure]] determination, standard [[electrocardiogram]] and chest [[X-ray]], and [[cholesterol]] determination."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ninety-two percent of the study population responded with an examination process. Therefore, data from 3,102 residents was obtained through the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cassel|first=J.|date=1971|title=Evans County Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Heart Study|url=|journal=Archives of international Medicine|volume=128|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a prospective cohort model, the investigators sought to examine the entire population of the county aged over 40 years and half the population aged between 15 and 39 years. They ultimately achieved a 92% response rate for a total study population of 3,102 residents. From 1960-1962, each participant was given an initial examination in which serum cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, height and the participant’s responses to a number of health behavior and medical history questions. A follow-up consisting of a similar battery of tests was completed from 1967-1969. For 90.9% of the study population, a physical similar to the preliminary one was completed. For another 7.9%, health status was ascertained by a phone survey of either subject or a family member. The total rate of follow-up was 98.8%. Factors assessed at the time of follow-up were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, cigarette smoking, body weight, [[hematocrit]] value, ECG abnormalities and diet. Socioeconomic status was also assessed for whites, but not for blacks, as little variability was found in this factor among black subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Cassel, J., ed., 1971. Evans County cardiovascular and cerebrovascular study. Archives of internal medicine, 128 (6), 883-992.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results/Conclusions ==
A central finding of the study was that, across race and social class differences, factors associated with increased risk of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD) did so equally for blacks and whites whether the risk factors were considered singly or in combination. CHD incidence remained markedly higher for white [[Evans County]] residents. The only [[social grouping]] of white residents that had equally low incidence of CHD was white [[sharecroppers]], which was attributed to higher rates of [[physical activity]] among sharecroppers when compared to whites of higher [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/study-synopsis/evans-county-cardiovascular-and-cerebrovascular-study/|title=Evans County Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Study «  Heart Attack Prevention|website=www.epi.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strength of the study was the high response rate of the population in its entirety, one of only two of its kind to successfully examine an entire community. The publication of the initial study results did not include statistical analysis. Hames attributes his decision to avoid statistical analysis to the unique design of the study. He wrote, “…it certainly is not clear to us [the investigators] what differences such tests could make in our interpretations in the context of this study… the population over 40 does not constitute a sample of some universe. They are a [[universe]].”

'''Fedcap Rehabilitation Services, Inc.''', or '''Fedcap''', is a [[Manhattan]]-based not-for-profit organization that provides [[vocational]] training and employment resources to those who face barriers to employment.

==Mission==
Fedcap’s mission is to empower people with barriers to move towards economic independence as valued members of the workforce. Each year Fedcap’s evaluation, vocational training, job placement and counseling services, employment programs, and support and advocacy programs help more than 2,000 Americans overcome obstacles, rebuild their lives, and find and keep meaningful employment. Originally established in 1935 as the Federation of Crippled and Disabled, it then became the Federation of the Handicapped in 1946, ultimately switching to its current name in 1992.&lt;ref name="NY Times 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/business/yourmoney/08homefront.html?_r=1|title=Where Disabilities Aren't Allowed to Win |last=Fried|first=Joseph|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 8, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first vocational [[Occupational therapy|rehabilitation]] programs for the handicapped established in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedcap.org/pages/about.html|title=About Fedcap|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original goal of the organization was to provide support for the physically disabled, but it eventually expanded into helping people with all kinds of disabilities and employment-related barriers.

==Services==
Fedcap's programs and services are free of charge for the trainees and last for three to six months. Fedcap’s comprehensive approach includes thorough vocational evaluations to help determine appropriate career paths for clients followed by vocational training in a variety of fields including custodial, culinary arts, data entry/document imaging, office skills, hospitality, and mailroom/messenger services. Fedcap’s New York State licensed business and trade school offers small classes and individualized attention from highly qualified instructors.

After graduation, all clients receive career counseling, job placement services, and ongoing on-the-job support. Fedcap graduates obtain jobs at private companies or with Fedcap in New York, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C. The majority of the jobs we are able to offer are made possible through the New York State Preferred Source Program, New Jersey ACCSES, and the federal [[AbilityOne Program]].

Fedcap also operates a licensed home health care agency; Chelton Loft, a clubhouse for adults with severe and persistent mental illness; a Partial Care Mental Health Program for adults with developmental disabilities and mental illness; a Youth Program for young adults transitioning in to the workforce; and a Veterans Program assisting returning veterans with their transition to civilian life.

[[File:Five Rites.jpg|frame|''The Eye of Revelation'' by Peter Kelder]]

The '''Five Tibetan Rites''' is a system of [[exercise]]s reported to be more than 2,500 years old&lt;ref name=Eye&gt;Kelder, Peter: ''The Eye of Revelation''. The New Era Press, Burbank, CA (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; which were first publicized by Peter Kelder in a 1939 publication titled ''The Eye of Revelation''.&lt;ref name=Kelder2&gt;Kelder, Peter: ''The Eye of Revelation'' (1946), ''The Eye of Revelation, edited by J. W. Watt.'' Booklocker.com, Inc., 1st reprint edition (January 10, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rites are said to be a form of [[Trul khor|Tibetan yoga]] similar to the [[yoga series]] that originated in [[India]]. However, the Five Rites and traditional Tibetan yoga both emphasize "a continuous sequence of movement" (Sanskrit: [[vinyasa]]), whereas Indian forms focus on "static positions". Although the Rites have circulated amongst yogis for decades, skeptics say that Tibetans have never recognized them as being authentic Tibetan practices.

The Five Tibetan Rites are also referred to as "The Five Rites", "The Five Tibetans" and "The Five Rites of Rejuvenation".

==Publication==

Although practically nothing is known about Kelder,&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt; one source reports that he was raised as an adopted child in the mid-western United States and left home while in his teens in search of adventure.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;Kelder, Peter &amp; Bernie S. Siegel, M.D.: ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 2''. DoubleDay (January 19, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Kelder claims to have met, in southern California, a retired British army colonel who shared with him stories of travel and the subsequent discovery of the Rites.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelder&gt;Kelder, Peter: ''The Eye of Revelation''. Peter Kelder (1939) (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=revised&gt;Revised publishings of ''The Eye of Revelation'':
* Kelder, Peter: '' Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth''. Harbor Press (1985,1989) Revised, modernized and expanded edition of ''The Eye of Revelation'', copyright 1939 by Peter Kelder.
* Kelder, Peter: ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 1''. Doubleday (January 20, 1998) Further revised, modernized and expanded edition of ''The Eye of Revelation'', copyright 1939 by Peter Kelder.
* Kelder, Peter &amp; Bernie S. Siegel, M.D.: ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 2''. DoubleDay (January 19, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally written as a 32-page booklet,&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt; the publication is the result of Kelder's conversations with the colonel.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt;

==Booklet==

In his booklet, Kelder claims that while stationed in India, British army officer Colonel Bradford (a pseudonym) heard a story about a group of [[lama]]s who had apparently discovered a "[[Fountain of youth|Fountain of Youth]]". The "wandering natives", as he called them, told him of old men who inexplicably became healthy, strong, and full of "vigor and virility" after entering a particular [[lamasery]]. After retiring, Kelder's Colonel Bradford went on to discover the [[lamasery]] and lived with the lamas, where they taught him five exercises, which they called "rites". According to the booklet, the lamas describe seven spinning, "psychic vortexes" within the body: two of these are in the brain, one at the base of the throat, one on the right side of the body in the vicinity of the liver, one in the reproductive anatomy, and one in each knee. As we grow older, the spin rate of the "vortexes" diminishes, resulting in "ill-health". However, the spin rate of these "vortexes" can be restored by performing the Five Rites daily, resulting in improved health.

Bradford was also instructed in how to perform a sixth rite, which the lamas recommended only for those willing to "lead a more or less continent (celibate) life". Additionally, Bradford reveals information on the importance of what foods one should eat, proper food combinations, and the correct method of eating.&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt;

==Disputed origins==

Although the origin of the Five Rites before the publication of ''The Eye of Revelation'' is disputed between practitioners and skeptics, a comparison of illustrations of the postures shows a remarkable similarity between the Rites and authentic Tibetan '''phrul 'khor'' exercises from a system rendered into English as Vajra Body Magical Wheel Sun and Moon Union ({{bo|t=རྡོ་རྗེ་ལུས་ཀྱི་འཕྲུལ་འཁོར་ཉི་ཟླ་ཁ་སྦྱོར|w=rdo rje lus kyi 'phrul 'khor nyi zla kha sbyor}}).&lt;ref name="Authentic1"/&gt; It has been noted, however, that even though these comparisons are compelling, a closer examination reveals that these similarities are misleading.&lt;ref name=Authentic2&gt;[http://jr-books.com/EoR-Article-090814-Misleading.html A Misleading Theory: Tibetan Yantra Yoga and the Five Rites]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Kilham]], whose 1994 book ''The Five Tibetans'' helped respark the Rites' popularity, says, "As the story has it, they were shared by Tibetan lamas; beyond that I know nothing of their history." Even though the historic lineage of the Rites before the publication of Kelder's booklet remains to be ascertained, the Rites have nevertheless been affirmed by a lama and scholar of the [[Sakya|Sa skya]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as being "a genuine form of yoga and were originally taken from an authentic Indo-Tibetan tantric lineage, namely a cycle of yantra-yoga associated with the Sadnadapadadharma."&lt;ref name=Authentic1&gt;[http://people.tribe.net/sahajananda/blog/743ffcef-f30a-454e-8610-14dd8a45cd06 Are the "Five Tibetans" really Tibetan?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Authentic4&gt;[http://allyoga.tribe.net/thread/b7ecc195-67c5-48ef-a078-e9f7dc47b277 The Five Tibetans &amp; ‘phrul ‘khor (yantra)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that the Five Rites predate yoga as we know it today by as much as seven hundred years or more and, therefore, could not have derived from either Tibetan or Indian forms of yoga. Moreover, it has been suggested that the Rites are more likely to have originated from a system of [[Kum Nye]] which, like the Rites, date back 2,500 years.&lt;ref name=Authentic3&gt;[http://jr-books.com/EoR-Article-081203-Origins.html The Genesis of the Five Tibetan Rites: Part 1 - The Bon Tradition of Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Authentic5&gt;[http://jr-books.com/EoR-Article-081231-Origins2.html The Genesis of the Five Tibetan Rites: Part 2 - The Non-Connection]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kilham states that "[t]he issue at hand, though, is not the lineage of the Five Tibetans. The point is their immense potential value for those who will clear 10 minutes a day to practice."

==Performing the Rites==

In the original ''The Eye of Revelation'' booklet, Kelder suggests standing erect between each of the Five Rites with hands on hips and taking one or two deep breaths; he neither implies nor suggests that specific breathing patterns should be adopted while performing the movements.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt; Nevertheless, subsequent publications pertaining to the Rites contain edits by others which recommend and detail specific instructions for breathing while performing the exercises.&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; Some practitioners also recommend taking caution before performing the Rites due to the possibility of aggravating certain health conditions.

Kelder cautions that when performing the First Rite, spinning must always be performed in a clockwise direction. He also states that Bradford clearly recalled that the Maulawiyah, otherwise known as [[Mevlevi|"Whirling Dervishes"]], always spun from left to right, in a clockwise direction.&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; No mention is made of the orientation of the palms, although the original illustration of the Rite in the 1939 edition of ''The Eye of Revelation'' clearly depicts both palms as facing toward the ground.&lt;ref name="Kelder"/&gt; Here arises a point of contention: the Whirling Dervishes spin in the ''counter''-clockwise direction, with the left palm facing down, towards the earth, and the right palm facing up, towards heaven.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/12/whirl.dervishes/index.html CNN article on Whirling Dervishes]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this discrepancy may find partial resolution in the fact that Tibetan Buddhist yoga regards clockwise rotation to be favorable, whereas counter-clockwise rotation is considered to be unfavorable.&lt;ref name="Authentic4"/&gt;

===First Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 1.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 1]]

"Stand erect with arms outstretched, horizontal with the shoulders. Now spin around until you become slightly dizzy. There is only one caution: you must turn from left to right if you are in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise if you are in the South hemisphere."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt; A tip for this is to look at the end of your right hand as a reference point .

===Second Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 2.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 2]]

"Lie full length on rug or bed. Place the hands flat down alongside of the hips. Fingers should be kept close together with the finger-tips of each hand turned slightly toward one another. Raise the feet until the legs are straight up. If possible, let the feet extend back a bit over the body toward the head, but do not let the knees bend. Hold this position for a moment or two and then slowly lower the feet to the floor, and for the next several moments allow all of the muscles in the entire body to relax completely. Then perform the Rite all over again."

"While the feet and legs are being raised it is a good idea also to raise the head, then while the feet and legs are being lowered to the floor lower the head at the same time."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Third Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 3.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 3]]

"Kneel on a rug or mat with hands at sides, palms flat against the side of legs. Then lean forward as far as possible, bending at the waist, with head well forward—chin on chest. The second position of this Rite is to lean backward as far as possible. Cause the head to move still further backward. The toes will prevent you from falling over backward. The hands are always kept against the side of the legs. Next come to an erect (kneeling) position, relax as much as possible for a moment, and perform Rite all over again."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Fourth Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 4.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 4]]

"Sit erect on rug or carpet with feet stretched out in front. The legs must be perfectly straight -- back of knees must be well down or close to the rug. Place the hands flat on the rug, fingers together, and the hands pointing outward slightly. Chin should be on chest -- head forward."

"Now gently raise the body, at the same time bend the knees so that the legs from the knees down are practically straight up and down. The arms, too, will also be vertical while the body from shoulders to knees will be horizontal. As the body is raised upward allow the head gently to fall backward so that the head hangs backward as far as possible when the body is fully horizontal. Hold this position for a few moments, return to first position, and RELAX for a few moments before performing the Rite again."

"When the body is pressed up to complete horizontal position, tense every muscle in the body."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Fifth Rite===

[[File:Five tibetan rite 5.gif|thumb|Five Tibetan rite 5]]

"Place the hands on the floor about two feet apart. Then, with the legs stretched out to the rear with the feet also about two feet apart, push the body, and especially the hips, up as far as possible, rising on the toes and hands. At the same time the head should be brought so far down that the chin comes up against the chest. Next, allow the body to come slowly down to a ‘sagging’ position. Bring the head up, causing it to be drawn as far back as possible."

"The muscles should be tensed for a moment when the body is at the highest point, and again at the lowest point."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

===Sixth Rite===

"It should be practiced only when you feel an excess of sexual energy..."
"Stand straight up and slowly let all of the air out of your lungs...bend over and put your hands on your knees...with the lungs empty, return to a straight up posture. Place your hands on your hips, and press down on them... As you do this, pull in the abdomen as much as possible, and at the same time raise the chest.&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
hold this position as long as you possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
take air into your empty lungs, let the air flow in through the nose. When the lungs are full, exhale through the mouth.
As you exhale, relax your arms... Then take several deep breaths through the mouth or nose, allowing them to escape through either the mouth or nose."&lt;ref name="Kelder2"/&gt;

==Claimed benefits of performing the rites==

According to Kelder, Bradford's stay in the lamasery transformed him from a stooped, old gentleman with a cane to a tall and straight young man in the prime of his life. Additionally, he reported that Bradford's hair had grown back, without a trace of gray.&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; The revised publications of ''The Eye of Revelation'' titled ''Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth'' also contain numerous testimonials by practitioners of the Rites, claiming that they yield positive medical effects such as improved eyesight, memory, potency, hair growth, restoration of full color to completely gray hair, and anti-aging.&lt;ref name="revised"/&gt; However, claims as to the benefits of the Rites are often exaggerated, resulting in unrealistic expectations.&lt;ref name=claims&gt;[http://www.t5t.com/article_info.php?articles_id=19 The Five Tibetan Rites' Benefits - The Truth versus the Claims]&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits most likely to be achieved are increased energy, stress reduction, and an enhanced sense of calm, clarity of thought, increased strength and flexibility, resulting in an overall improvement in health and well-being.&lt;ref name="claims"/&gt;

{{distinguish|Water balance}}

'''Fluid balance''' is an aspect of the [[homeostasis]] of [[organism]]s in which the amount of [[water]] in the organism needs to be controlled, via [[osmoregulation]] and [[behavior]], such that the [[concentrations]] of [[electrolyte]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]] in [[solution]]) in the various [[body fluid]]s are kept [[reference range|within healthy ranges]]. The core principle of fluid balance is that the amount of water lost from the body must equal the amount of water taken in; for example, in humans, the output (via [[breathing|respiration]], [[perspiration]], [[urination]], [[defecation]], and [[spitting|expectoration]]) must equal the input (via [[eating]] and [[drinking]], or by [[parenteral]] intake). '''Euvolemia''' is the state of normal body fluid volume, including [[blood volume]], [[interstitial fluid]] volume, and [[cytosol|intracellular fluid]] volume; [[hypovolemia]] and [[hypervolemia]] are imbalances. Water is necessary for all life on Earth. Humans can survive for 4 to 6 weeks without food but only for a few days without water.

Profuse sweating can increase the need for electrolyte replacement. [[Water-electrolyte imbalance]] produces headache and fatigue if mild; [[disease|illness]] if moderate, and sometimes even [[death]] if severe. For example, [[water intoxication]] (which results in [[hyponatremia]]), the process of consuming too much water too quickly, can be fatal. Deficits to [[body water]] result in [[volume contraction]] and [[dehydration]]. [[Diarrhea]] is a threat to both [[body water]] volume and electrolyte levels, which is why diseases that cause diarrhea are great threats to fluid balance.

==Applications==

===Water consumption===
The amount of water varies with the individual, as it depends on the condition of the subject, the amount of physical exercise, and on the environmental temperature and humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The common misconception that everyone should drink two litres (68 ounces, or about eight 8-oz glasses) of water per day is not supported by scientific research. Various reviews of all the scientific literature on the topic performed in 2002 and 2008 could not find any solid scientific evidence that recommended drinking eight glasses of water per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0236679720080402 Research debunks health value of guzzling water]. Reuters, April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Valtin, [http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993 Drink at least eight glasses of water a day." Really?

An individual's thirst provides a better guide for how much water they require rather than a specific, fixed number. A more flexible guideline is that a normal person should urinate 4 times per day, and the urine should be a light yellow color.

A constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities, such as respiration, perspiration and [[urination]]. Food contributes 0.5 to 1 l/day, and the metabolism of [[protein]], [[fat]], and [[carbohydrates]] produces another 0.25 to 0.4 l/day,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slv.se/templates/SLV_Page.aspx?id=13974&amp;epslanguage=SV Swedish DFA] (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; which means that 2 to 3 l/day of water for men and 1 to 2 l/day of water for women should be consumed as fluid to meet the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI).

====Trace elements====
In terms of mineral nutrients intake, it is unclear what the drinking water contribution is. However, [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] minerals generally enter surface water and ground water via [[stormwater|storm water]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or through the Earth's crust. Treatment processes also lead to the presence of some minerals. Examples include [[calcium]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[phosphate]], [[fluoride]] and [[sodium]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/en/ World Health Organization] (WHO). Geneva, Switzerland. Joyce Morrissey Donohue, Charles O. Abernathy, Peter Lassovszky, George Hallberg. [http://www.who.int/entity/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutintakes.pdf "The contribution of drinking-water to total dietary intakes of selected trace mineral nutrients in the United States."] Draft, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Water generated from the [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] [[metabolism]] of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some [[arthropod]]s and [[desert]] animals, but provides only a small fraction of a human's necessary intake.

There are a variety of trace elements present in virtually all potable water, some of which play a role in metabolism. For example, [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[chloride]] are common chemicals found in small amounts in most waters, and these elements play a role in body metabolism. Other elements such as fluoride, while arguably beneficial in low concentrations, can cause dental problems and other issues when present at high levels. Water is essential for the growth and maintenance of our bodies, as it is involved in a number of biological processes.

===Medical use===

====Effects of illness====
When a person is ill, fluid may also be lost through [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], and [[hemorrhage]]. An individual is at an increased risk of dehydration in these instances, as the kidneys will find it more difficult to match fluid loss by reducing urine output (the kidneys must produce at least some urine in order to excrete metabolic waste.)

====Oral rehydration therapy====
{{main|Oral rehydration therapy}}

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT), is type of fluid replacement used as a treatment for dehydration. In an acute hospital setting, fluid balance is monitored carefully. This provides information on the patient's state of hydration, renal function and cardiovascular function.

* If fluid loss is greater than fluid gain (for example if the patient vomits and has diarrhea), the patient is said to be in ''negative fluid balance''. In this case, fluid is often given [[intravenously]] to compensate for the loss.
* On the other hand, a ''positive fluid balance'' (where fluid gain is greater than fluid loss) might suggest a problem with either the renal or cardiovascular system.

If blood pressure is low ([[hypotension]]), the filtration rate in the [[kidneys]] will lessen, causing less fluid reabsorption and thus less urine output.

An accurate measure of fluid balance is therefore an important diagnostic tool, and allows for prompt intervention to correct the imbalance.

==Routes of fluid loss and gain==
Fluid can leave the body in many ways. Fluid can enter the body as preformed water, [[ingested]] [[food]] and [[drinking|drink]] and to a lesser extent as metabolic water which is produced as a by-product of aerobic respiration ([[cellular respiration]]) and dehydration synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Saladin, Kenneth S. Water, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Balance (New York: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., 2010), 943-944.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Input===
A constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities, such as respiration, [[Perspiration|sweating]] and [[urination]]. Water generated from the [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] [[metabolism]] of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some [[arthropod]]s and [[desert]] animals, but provides only a small fraction of a human's necessary intake.

In the normal resting state, input of water through ingested fluids is approximately 1200 ml/day, from ingested foods 1000 ml/day and from [[cellular respiration|aerobic respiration]] 300 ml/day, totaling 2500 ml/day.&lt;ref name=boron829&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter F. Boron |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year= 2005|pages= |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=}} Page 829&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regulation of input====
{{Main|Thirst}}
Input of water is regulated mainly through ingested fluids, which, in turn, depends on [[thirst]]. An insufficiency of water results in an increased osmolarity in the [[extracellular fluid]]. This is sensed by [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis]], which trigger thirst. Thirst can to some degree be voluntarily resisted, as during [[fluid restriction]].

The human [[kidney]]s will normally adjust to varying levels of water intake. The kidneys will require time to adjust to the new water intake level. This can cause someone who drinks a lot of water to become [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] more easily than someone who routinely drinks less.

===Output===
* The majority of fluid output occurs via the [[urine]], approximately 1500 ml/day (approx 1.59 qt/day) in the normal adult resting state.&lt;ref name=boron829/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch08/7ch08p33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some fluid is lost through [[perspiration]] (part of the body's temperature control mechanism) and as water vapor in [[exhalation|exhaled air]]. These are termed "insensible fluid losses" as they cannot be easily measured. Some sources say insensible losses account for 500 to 650 ml/day (0.5 to 0.6 qt.) of water in adults,&lt;ref name=boron829/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch08/7ch08p28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources put the minimum value at 800 ml (0.8 qt.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/FluidBook/fl3_2.php 3.2 Insensible Water Loss&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In children, one calculation used for insensible fluid loss is 400&amp;nbsp;ml/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[body surface area]].
* In addition, an adult loses approximately 100&amp;nbsp;ml/day of fluid through [[feces]].&lt;ref name=boron829/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch08/7ch08p32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For females, an additional 50 ml/day is lost through vaginal secretions.

These outputs are in balance with the input of ~2500 ml/day.&lt;ref name=boron829/&gt;

====Regulation of output====
The body's [[homeostatic]] control mechanisms, which maintain a constant internal environment, ensure that a balance between fluid gain and fluid loss is maintained.  The anti-diuretic hormones [[vasopressin]] (ADH) and [[aldosterone]] play a major role in this.
* If the body is becoming fluid-''deficient'', there will be an increase in the secretion of these hormones, causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced.
* Conversely, if fluid levels are ''excessive'', secretion of these hormones is suppressed, resulting in less retention of fluid by the kidneys and a subsequent increase in the volume of urine produced.

=====Antidiuretic hormone=====
{{Main|Antidiuretic hormone}}
If the body is becoming fluid-''deficient'', this will be sensed by [[osmoreceptors]] in the [[vascular organ of lamina terminalis]] and [[subfornical organ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=M.J. McKinley |author2=A.K. Johnson | title=The Physiological Regulation of Thirst and Fluid Intake

Thus, there will be an increase in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone, causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced.

=====Aldosterone=====
{{Main|Renin–angiotensin system}}
A fluid-insufficiency causes a decreased perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. This activates the renin–angiotensin system. Among other actions, it causes renal tubules (i.e. the distal convoluted tubules and the [[Collecting duct system|cortical collecting ducts]]) to reabsorb more sodium and water from the urine. Potassium is secreted into the tubule in exchange for the sodium, which is reabsorbed.
The activated renin–angiotensin system stimulates the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex which in turn secretes the hormone aldosterone. This hormone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions from distal tubules and [[Collecting duct system|collecting ducts]]. Water in the tubular lumen cannot follow the sodium reabsorption osmotically, as this part of the kidney is impermeable to water; release of ADH (vasopressin) is required to increase expression of aquaporin channels in the cortical collecting duct, allowing reabsorption of water.

The '''Government Medical Officers Association''' (GMOA) is a [[trade union]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. Founded in 1926 as the Government Medical Officers’ Association (Central Province) in [[Kandy]], it was renamed as Government Medical Officers’ Association of Ceylon in 1927 and in 1949 registered as a trade union under the leadership of Dr [[E. M. Wijerama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://slma.lk/e-m-wijerama-endowment-lecture/ E M Wijerama Endowment Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Controversies==
===Admission of School Children===
In 2016, the GMOA came under heavily criticism for the its demands of special admission criteria for children of its members to elite government schools by passing the national government admission process of the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/gmoa-on-strike-demanding-posh-schools-for-their-children-says-minister-deflated-their-tyres/ GMOA On Strike Demanding Posh Schools For Their Children, Says Minister Deflated Their Tyres]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018 they have threaten trade union action inform of an island wide strike if there demands for schooling of doctors’ children are not met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/GMOA-threaten-countrywide-work-stoppage-next-week-152938.html GMOA threaten countrywide work stoppage next week]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===SAITM===
GMOA have been highly critical of the establishment of the [[South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine]] (SAITM) the only private medical college in the country, calling for its closure and preventing of its graduates from registering with the [[Sri Lanka Medical Council]] (SLMC) as medical practitioners claiming low quality of the SAITM graduates. It has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following a [[Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka|Court of Appeal]] decision ordering SAITM medical graduates to be register with the SLMC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/GMOA-presents-a-national-front-against-SAITM-123447.html GMOA presents a national front against SAITM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Striking for duty free vehicle permits===
The GMOA was highly criticized for demanding [[Duty-free permit|duty free vehicle permit]]s by engaging in strikes when they were reviewed by government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/113470/GMOA-demands-vehicle-permits-every-years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2018/06/09/local/153419/gmoa-happy-permit-policy-transport-and-tax-allowances GMOA happy with permit policy, transport and tax allowances]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engaging in private practice during strikes and political ties ===
In May 2017 GMOA head Anuruddha Padeniya was caught by the media granting appointements at six private hospitals during the time of a strike by the GMOA and other trade unions against the SAITM and MP [[Ranjan Ramanayake]] also got an appointement with him on a time during the strike and showed the receipt in social media and in a media conference. Dr.Padeniya quickly reacted by cancelling the appointments. OPD services and medical clinics of several government hospitals were crippled due to the strike however it was ultimately considered a failure as many hospitals continued normal work and over 200 Trade Unions opposed the GMOA strike and accused them of attempting to return [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] back to power. Rajapaksa visited Padeniya after handing over nominations in 2015 general election and Padeniya appreciated Rajapaksa for contesting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/public-to-be-penalised-due-to-gmoa-strike-over-saitm-but-gmoa-chief-padeniya-offers-private-consultations|title=Public To Be Penalised Due To GMOA Strike Over SAITM, But GMOA Chief Padeniya Offers Private Consultations|work=Colombo Telegraph|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hirunews.lk/160690/trade-union-strikes-disrupt-hospital-functions-train-services|title=Trade union strikes disrupt hospital functions and train services|work=Hiru News|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Ranjan-gets-channel-appointment-with-Dr-Padeniya-during-strike-128434.html|title=Ranjan gets channel appointment with Dr. Padeniya during strike|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_17A/May05_1494005578CH.php|title=Sri Lanka : GMOA strike unsuccessful as many hospitals continued to function|last=Lanka|first=Gamini Gunaratna, Sri Lanka News Paper by LankaPage.com (LLC)- Latest Hot News from Sri|website=www.colombopage.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Striking against free-trade agreement with Singapore and proposed ETCA India===
On 18 May 2018, the GMOA initiated a countrywide 24-hour token strike disrupting healthcare services in hospitals around the island against the [[Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) signed by the Government of Sri Lanka with Singapore and the proposed [[Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement]] with India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/GMOA-strike-Countrywide-healthcare-services-disrupted-150042.html GMOA strike: Countrywide healthcare services disrupted]&lt;/ref&gt; The GMOA has claimed that the FTA with Singapore was not in line with the [[World Trade Organization]] and it would create avenue for foreign countries to invade Sri Lanka's job market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/GMOA-to-launch-hour-strike-on-May--149786.html GMOA to launch 24-hour strike on May 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undertaking trade union action during epidemics===
GMOA has been criticized for undertaking trade union action for various professional and national issues during epidemics such as [[influenza]] and [[dengue]] in the country on several occations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.lk/online/2017/04/22/doctors-strikes-an-epidemic-no-less.html Doctors’ strikes an epidemic no less]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income tax reductions for specialist doctors===
GMOA has apposed amendments to the Inland Revenue (IR) Act which changed the rates of income tax stating that its detrimental to professionals. In July 2018 they have threaten trade union action inform of an island wide strike if there demands are not met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/GMOA-threaten-countrywide-work-stoppage-next-week-152938.html GMOA threaten countrywide work stoppage next week]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following strike action and discussions with officials of the Finance Ministry, Health Ministry and the GMOA, contradicting statements were released by the Health Minister stating that income tax imposed on specialist doctors will be reduced to 15% from the normal 24%; while the Finance Minister has refuted the Health Ministers statement stating that the income tax rate for 24% based on the Inland Revenue (IR) Act was not changed but provisional relief granted by changing the method of calculating tax imposed on specialist doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirunews.lk/196958/health-ministry-and-finance-ministry-in-disagreement-over-taxes Health Ministry and Finance ministry in disagreement over taxes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/180610/news/medical-specialists-threaten-to-withdraw-from-private-hospitals-over-unfair-taxes-297638.html Medical specialists threaten to withdraw from private hospitals over “unfair” taxes]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Department of Inland Revenue, only 6,000 out of the 39,000 registered doctors pay income tax.&lt;ref&gt;[https://srilankamirror.com/news/5365-only-6-000-doctors-pay-income-tax Only 6,000 doctors pay income tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Dean Kesling''' (April 8, 1901 – 1979) was an American Orthodontist who is known for developing the tooth positioning appliance called "Positioner". This appliance is used in Orthodontics at the end of treatment to allow teeth to settle in occlusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Neal E.|date=1970-10-01|title=Application of the positioner appliance in orthodontic treatment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002941670901065|journal=American Journal of Orthodontics|volume=58|issue=4|pages=351–366|doi=10.1016/0002-9416(70)90106-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, H.D. Kesling stated that “Major tooth movements could be accomplished with a series of Positioners by changing the teeth on the setup slightly as treatment progresses." The history of clear aligner therapy began when H.D. Kesling pioneered the concept of straightening teeth without braces with the invention of the "Positioner."&lt;ref&gt;https://10-aso.cdn.aspedia.net/sites/default/files/uploaded-content/field_f_content_file/brighter_futures_-_moving_teeth_sequential_plastic_aligners1.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

H.D. Kesling founded orthodontic company TP Orthodontics, Inc. in 1959.

==Life==
He was born in [[Cass County, Indiana]] in 1901. He graduated from [[Loyola University Chicago]] in 1923 with his dental degree. He then opened his private practice in [[La Porte, Indiana]] . In 1929, he opened his Orthodontics practice in [[Hammond, Indiana]] after receiving his orthodontic degree from Loyola University. Kesling's son, [[Peter Kesling]], developed the Tip Edge Appliance.

==Orthodontics==
Kesling is known for developing the Positioner Appliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kesling|first=Harold D.|date=1956-10-01|title=The diagnostic setup with consideration of the third dimension|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002941656900422|journal=American Journal of Orthodontics|volume=42|issue=10|pages=740–748|doi=10.1016/0002-9416(56)90042-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed this appliance during his work in the La Porte office in Indiana. His developed technique attracted many other orthodontists to his practice and Kesling gave many seminars in 1950s regarding this appliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1980-05-01|title=Harold D. Kesling (1901–1979)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002941680901372|journal=American Journal of Orthodontics|volume=77|issue=5|pages=574–575|doi=10.1016/0002-9416(80)90137-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kesling was influenced by the work of [[Raymond Begg]] and his light wire technique. He switched his treatment to the Begg Technique after he traveled to Australia and learned about the technique. For next 40 years, Kesling would go on to use this method  in his practice. Kesling eventually gave seminars and lectures on Begg technique.

The '''history of agricultural science''' is a sub-field of the [[history of agriculture]] which looks at the [[scientific]] advancement of techniques and understanding of [[agriculture]]. Early study of organic production in [[botanical garden]]s was continued in with [[agricultural experiment station]]s in several countries.

Fertilizer is a major contribution to agriculture history increasing the fertility of the soil and minimizing nutrient loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/%24webindex/0022BBC19C02604A852575C50062FBB7/%24file/BC09-2p12.pdf|title=The Role of Fertilizer in Growing the World’s Food|last=Roberts|first=T.L.|date=2009|website=International Plant Nutrition Institute|archive-url=https://www.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/%24webindex/0022BBC19C02604A852575C50062FBB7/%24file/BC09-2p12.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2018|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific study of [[fertilizer]] was advanced significantly in 1840 with the publication ''Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikulturchemie und Physiologie'' (Organic Chemistry in Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology) by [[Justus von Liebig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9612/the-agricultural-sciences#toc59252|title=The agricultural sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Liebig's advances in agricultural science was the discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant nutrient.

==Fertilizer==
{{Main|History of fertilizer}}

The first method of soil nourishment utilized [[compost]]. Composting used rotten organic materials to replenish the soil of its nutrients and dates back to tenth and twelfth century Arab writings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/history.cfm|title=History of Composting - Composting for the Homeowner - University of Illinois Extension|website=web.extension.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting was a normal and widely used practice of fertilization, up into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1671/Composting-History.html#ixzz5DqHBwwv2|title=Composting - History|website=science.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] was the first scientist to publish experiments on the use of gypsum as a fertilizer, but the mechanism that made it function as a fertilizer was contested by his contemporaries.&lt;ref name="JB 1840"&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel. ''A Treatise on Agriculture, The Present Condition of the Art Abroad and at Home, and the Theory and Practice of Husbandry. To which is Added, a Dissertation on the Kitchen and Fruit Garden.'' 1840. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justus von Liebig, a founder of agricultural chemistry, studied organic compounds in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famousscientists.org/justus-von-liebig/|title=Justus von Liebig - Biography, Facts and Pictures|website=www.famousscientists.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, Liebig published what is now known as [[Liebig's law of the minimum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spar.msstate.edu/class/EPP-2008/Chapter%202/Reference%20Material/Law%20of%20Minimum.pdf|title=On the Origin of the Theory of Mineral Nutrition of Plants and the Law of the Minimum
|last1=van der Ploeg|first1=R.R.|last2=Bo¨hm|first2=W.|last3=Kirkham|first3=M.B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig's law states that growth is not controlled by the total amount of resources available, but by the limiting factor. The three mandatory limiting factors for plant growth are nutrients like phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. He also focused on the importance of ammonia.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The production of synthetic ammonia was acquired by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosh. Haber discovered the reaction process to produce ammonia and Bosh was able to pressurize it to complete the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tfi.org/the-feed/fertilizer-history-haber-bosch-process|title=Fertilizer History: The Haber-Bosch Process|website=www.tfi.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together Haber and Bosch came up with the [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]] that fixated nitrogen to produce ammonia that is used in most fertilizers. In 1918 Fritz Haber received a Nobel prize in Chemistry for the invention of this process. Carl Bosch also received a Nobel Prize in 1918, but for high-pressure studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/Haber-Bosch-process|title=Haber-Bosch process {{!}} chemistry|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the pressure studies this process wouldn’t be possible.

In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term "agricultural science". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. Later on, the [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?]. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
{{Main|History of genetics}}
A genetic study of [[Agricultural science]] began with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. Using statistical methods, Mendel developed the model of [[Mendelian inheritance]] which accurately describes the inheritance of dominant and recessive genes. His results were controversial at the time and were not widely accepted.

In 1900, [[Hugo de Vries]] published his findings after rediscovering Mendel's work, and in 1905 [[William Bateson]] coined the term "genetics" in a letter to [[Adam Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm Online copy of William Bateson's letter to Adam Sedgwick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013020831/http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of genetics carried into an [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|experiment isolating DNA]].

==Agronomy==
In 1843, [[John Lawes]] and [[Henry Gilbert]] began a set of long-term field experiments in [[agronomy]] at [[Rothamsted Research Station]] in England; some of them are still running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Long Term Experiments|url=https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments|publisher=Rothamsted Research|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, [[Albert Howard|Sir Albert Howard]], studied agronomy and focused on organic agriculture processes. In 1943, Howard published his book on ''An Agriculture Testament.'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Education==
The passing of Smith- Hughes Act in 1917 was what allowed agricultural education to enter public schools.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naae.org/whatisaged/index.cfm|title=What is Agricultural Education?|website=National Association of Agricultural Educators|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture took a big hit between the late 1920’s and early 1930’s during the great depression and dust bowl. The [https://www.ffa.org/about/what-is-ffa/ffa-history Future Farmers of America (FFA)], once known as Future Farmers of Virginia  was created to educate and maintain interest of potential farmers in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ffa.org/about/what-is-ffa/ffa-history|title=FFA History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.FFA. org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years this organization has changed the world and educated many about farming processes and encouraged agriculture participation.

National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE) began to help give teachers the ability to start a FFA chapter in their school system and standardize the curriculum all over the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are various universities around the United States which are well known for educating students in the field of the agricultural sciences. These universities include [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]], [[Stephen F. Austin State University]], [[University of Idaho]] and many others.

[[File:Allergy to Antibiotic Cefaclor.JPG|thumb|290x290px|The cardinal signs of inflammation include: pain, heat, redness, swelling, and loss of function. Some of these indicators can be seen here due to an allergic reaction.]]
'''Inflammation''' (from {{lang-la|[[wikt:en:inflammatio#Latin|inflammatio]]}}) is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as [[pathogen]]s, damaged cells, or irritants,&lt;ref name="pmid17223962"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ferrero-Miliani L, Nielsen OH, Andersen PS, Girardin SE |title=Chronic inflammation: importance of NOD2 and NALP3 in interleukin-1beta generation |journal=Clin. Exp. Immunol. |volume=147 |issue=2 |pages=061127015327006–– |date=February 2007 |pmid=17223962 |pmc=1810472 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03261.x |url=|last2=Nielsen |last3=Andersen |last4=Girardin }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a protective response involving [[immune cells]], [[blood vessels]], and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and initiate tissue repair.

The five [[Cardinal sign (pathology)|classical signs of inflammation]] are heat, pain, redness, swelling, and [[Functio laesa|loss of function]] (Latin ''calor'', ''dolor'', ''rubor'', ''tumor'', and ''functio laesa'').{{ref}} Inflammation is a generic response, and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of [[innate immune system|innate immunity]], as compared to [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]], which is specific for each pathogen.&lt;ref name="ABBAS"&gt;{{cite book | author = Abbas A.B. |author2=Lichtman A.H. | title = Basic Immunology. Functions and disorders of the immune system | edition = 3rd | year = 2009|  isbn =978-1-4160-4688-2 | pages = | chapter = Ch.2 Innate Immunity | editor = Saunders (Elsevier) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus (e.g. bacteria) and compromise the survival of the organism. In contrast, chronic inflammation may lead to a host of diseases, such as [[hay fever]], [[periodontitis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and even cancer (e.g., [[gallbladder carcinoma]]). Inflammation is therefore normally closely regulated by the body.

Inflammation can be classified as either ''acute'' or ''chronic''. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of [[blood plasma|plasma]] and [[leukocyte]]s (especially [[granulocyte]]s) from the blood into the injured tissues. A series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local [[vascular system]], the [[immune system]], and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as ''chronic inflammation'', leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation, such as [[Mononuclear cell infiltration|mononuclear cells]], and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and [[healing]] of the tissue from the inflammatory process.

Inflammation is not a synonym for [[infection]]. Infection describes the interaction between the action of microbial invasion and the reaction of the body's inflammatory response — the two components are considered together when discussing an infection, and the word is used to imply a microbial invasive cause for the observed inflammatory reaction. Inflammation on the other hand describes purely the body's immunovascular response, whatever the cause may be. But because of how often the two are [[correlation|correlated]], words ending in the suffix ''[[wikt:-itis|-itis]]'' (which refers to inflammation) are sometimes informally described as referring to infection. For example, the word ''[[urethritis]]'' strictly means only "urethral inflammation", but clinical [[health care provider]]s usually discuss urethritis as a urethral infection because urethral microbial invasion is the most common cause of urethritis.

It is useful to differentiate inflammation and infection as there are many pathological situations where inflammation is not driven by microbial invasion – for example, [[atherosclerosis]], [[type III hypersensitivity]], [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], and [[ischemia]]. There are also pathological situations where microbial invasion does not result in classic inflammatory response—for example, [[parasitosis]], [[eosinophilia]].

Acute inflammation is a short-term process, usually appearing within a few minutes or hours and begins to cease upon the removal of the injurious stimulus.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; It involves a coordinated and systemic mobilization response locally of various immune, endocrine and neurological mediators of acute inflammation.

An acronym that may be used to remember the key symptoms is "PRISH", for pain, redness, immobility (loss of function), swelling and heat.

The traditional names for signs of inflammation come from Latin:
* [[Pain|Dolor]] ([[pain]])
* Calor ([[heat]])
* [[Rubor]] (redness)
* Tumor ([[swelling (medical)|swelling]])
* [[Functio laesa]] (loss of function)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://thepoint.lww.com/Book/ShowWithResource/2931?resourceId=16419 |last=Werner |first=Ruth |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |year=2009 |title=A massage Therapist Guide to Pathology |edition=4th |isbn=978-0781769198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four (classical signs) were described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca. 30 BC–38 AD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Wolfgang H. |last=Vogel |first2=Andreas |last2=Berke |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5pzrF1QocC&amp;pg=PA97 |title=Brief History of Vision and Ocular Medicine |publisher=Kugler Publications |page=97 |isbn=978-90-6299-220-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''loss of function'' was probably added later by [[Galen]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-7087-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Porth, Carol |title=Essentials of pahtophysiology: concepts of altered health states |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages=270 |isbn=978-0-7817-7087-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the addition of this fifth sign has also been ascribed to [[Thomas Sydenham]]&lt;ref name="isbn0-300-11322-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dormandy, Thomas |title=The worst of evils: man's fight against pain |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2006 |pages=22 |isbn=978-0-300-11322-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow|Virchow]].&lt;ref name="robspath"&gt;{{cite book | title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease| last=Cotran|author2=Kumar, Collins| publisher=W.B Saunders Company| location=Philadelphia| isbn=978-0-7216-7335-6 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" /&gt;

Redness and heat are due to increased blood flow at body core temperature to the inflamed site; swelling is caused by accumulation of fluid; [[pain]] is due to the release of chemicals such as bradykinin and histamine that stimulate nerve endings. Loss of function has multiple causes.&lt;ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" /&gt;

Acute inflammation of the lung (usually caused in response to [[pneumonia]]) does not cause pain unless the inflammation involves the [[parietal pleura]], which does have [[nociceptor|pain-sensitive nerve endings]].&lt;ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" /&gt;

=== Process of acute inflammation ===

[[File:Granulation tissue low power.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing granulation tissue. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
The process of acute inflammation is initiated by resident immune cells already present in the involved tissue, mainly resident [[macrophages]], [[dendritic cells]], [[histiocytes]], [[Kupffer cells]] and [[mast cell]]s. These cells possess surface receptors known as ''[[pattern recognition receptor]]s'' (PRRs), which recognize (i.e., bind) two subclasses of molecules: [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMPs) and [[damage-associated molecular pattern]]s (DAMPs). PAMPs are compounds that are associated with various [[pathogen]]s, but which are distinguishable from host molecules.  DAMPs are compounds that are associated with host-related injury and cell damage.

At the onset of an infection, burn, or other injuries, these cells undergo activation (one of the PRRs recognize a PAMP or DAMP) and release inflammatory mediators responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation. Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow causes the redness (''rubor'') and increased heat (''calor''). Increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation (leakage) of [[blood plasma|plasma]] proteins and fluid into the tissue ([[edema]]), which manifests itself as swelling (''tumor''). Some of the released mediators such as [[bradykinin]] increase the sensitivity to pain ([[hyperalgesia]], ''dolor'').  The mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes, mainly [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]], outside of the blood vessels (extravasation) into the tissue. The neutrophils migrate along a [[chemotactic]] gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; The loss of function (''functio laesa'') is probably the result of a neurological reflex in response to pain.

In addition to cell-derived mediators, several acellular biochemical cascade systems consisting of preformed plasma proteins act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response. These include the [[complement system]] activated by bacteria and the [[coagulation system|coagulation]] and [[fibrinolysis system]]s activated by [[necrosis]], e.g. a burn or a trauma.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

Acute inflammation may be regarded as the first line of defense against injury. Acute  inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained. Inflammatory mediators are short-lived and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence, acute inflammation begins to cease once the stimulus has been removed.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

== Vascular component ==

=== Vasodilation and increased permeability ===

As defined, acute inflammation is an immunovascular response to an inflammatory stimulus. This means acute inflammation can be broadly divided into a vascular phase that occurs first, followed by a cellular phase involving immune cells (more specifically myeloid [[granulocytes]] in the acute setting). The vascular component of acute inflammation involves the movement of [[Blood plasma|plasma fluid]], containing important [[protein]]s such as [[fibrin]] and [[immunoglobulin]]s ([[antibodies]]), into inflamed tissue.

Upon contact with PAMPs, tissue [[macrophages]] and [[mastocytes]] release vasoactive amines such as [[histamine]] and [[serotonin]], as well as [[eicosanoids]] such as [[prostaglandin E2]] and [[leukotriene B4]] to remodel the local vasculature. Macrophages and endothelial cells release [[nitric oxide]]. These mediators vasodilate and permeabilize the [[blood vessel]]s, which results in the net distribution of [[blood plasma]] from the vessel into the tissue space. The increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell ([[edema]]). This exuded tissue fluid contain various antimicrobial mediators from the plasma such as [[complement system|complement]], [[lysozyme]], [[antibodies]], which can immediately deal damage to microbes, and opsonise the microbes in preparation for the cellular phase. If the inflammatory stimulus is a lacerating wound, exuded [[platelet]]s, [[coagulation system|coagulant]]s, [[plasmin]] and [[kinin]]s can [[clot]] the wounded area and provide [[haemostasis]] in the first instance. These clotting mediators also provide a structural staging framework at the inflammatory tissue site in the form of a [[fibrin]] lattice – as would construction [[scaffolding]] at a construction site – for the purpose of aiding phagocytic debridement and [[wound healing|wound repair]] later on. Some of the exuded tissue fluid is also funnelled by [[lymphatics]] to the regional lymph nodes, flushing bacteria along to start the recognition and attack phase of the [[adaptive immune system]].

Acute inflammation is characterized by marked vascular changes, including [[vasodilation]], increased permeability and increased blood flow, which are induced by the actions of various inflammatory mediators. Vasodilation occurs first at the [[arteriole]] level, progressing to the [[capillary]] level, and brings about a net increase in the amount of blood present, causing the redness and heat of inflammation. Increased permeability of the vessels results in the movement of [[blood plasma|plasma]] into the tissues, with resultant ''[[stasis (medicine)|stasis]]'' due to the increase in the concentration of the cells within blood – a condition characterized by enlarged vessels packed with cells. Stasis allows [[leukocytes]] to marginate (move) along the [[endothelium]], a process critical to their recruitment into the tissues. Normal flowing blood prevents this, as the [[Shear stress|shearing force]] along the periphery of the vessels moves cells in the blood into the middle of the vessel.

=== Plasma cascade systems ===
* The [[complement system]], when activated, creates a cascade of chemical reactions that promotes [[Antibody opsonization|opsonization]], [[chemotaxis]], and [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]], and produces the [[Membrane attack complex|MAC]].
* The [[kinin system]] generates proteins capable of sustaining vasodilation and other physical inflammatory effects.
* The [[coagulation system]] or ''clotting cascade'', which forms a protective protein mesh over sites of injury.
* The [[fibrinolysis system]], which acts in opposition to the ''coagulation system'', to counterbalance clotting and generate several other inflammatory mediators.

=== Plasma-derived mediators ===

|}

== Cellular component ==
The ''cellular component'' involves [[leukocyte]]s, which normally reside in blood and must move into the inflamed tissue via ''extravasation'' to aid in inflammation. Some act as [[phagocyte]]s, ingesting [[bacteria]], viruses, and cellular debris. Others release enzymatic [[granule (cell biology)|granules]] that damage pathogenic invaders. Leukocytes also release inflammatory mediators that develop and maintain the inflammatory response. In general, acute inflammation is mediated by [[granulocyte]]s, whereas chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as [[monocyte]]s and [[lymphocyte]]s.

=== Leukocyte extravasation ===
[[File:NeutrophilerAktion.svg|200px|thumb|right|Neutrophils migrate from blood vessels to the infected tissue via chemotaxis, where they remove pathogens through phagocytosis and degranulation]]
[[File:Immune response.svg|thumb|Inflammation is a process by which the body's white blood cells and substances they produce protect us from infection with foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses. The (phagocytes)White blood cells are a nonspecific immune response, meaning that they attack any foreign bodies. However, in some diseases, like arthritis, the body's defense system the immune system triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign invaders to fight off. In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal.]]
{{Main|Leukocyte extravasation}}
Various [[leukocyte]]s, particularly neutrophils, are critically involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. These cells must be able to move to the site of injury from their usual location in the blood, therefore mechanisms exist to recruit and direct leukocytes to the appropriate place. The process of leukocyte movement from the blood to the tissues through the blood vessels is known as ''extravasation'', and can be broadly divided up into a number of steps:
# '''Leukocyte margination and endothelial adhesion:''' The white blood cells within the vessels which are generally centrally located move peripherally towards the walls of the vessels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muir's Textbook of Pathology|last=Herrington|first=Simon|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1444184990 |edition=15th |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activated macrophages in the tissue release [[cytokines]] such as [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] and [[TNFα]], which in turn leads to production of [[chemokine]]s that bind to [[proteoglycan]]s forming gradient in the inflamed tissue and along the [[endothelial]] wall. Inflammatory cytokines induce the immediate expression of [[P-selectin]] on endothelial cell surfaces and P-selectin binds weakly to carbohydrate ligands on the surface of leukocytes and causes them to "roll" along the endothelial surface as bonds are made and broken. Cytokines released from injured cells induce the expression of [[E-selectin]] on endothelial cells, which functions similarly to P-selectin. Cytokines also induce the expression of [[integrin]] ligands such as [[ICAM-1]] and [[VCAM-1]] on endothelial cells, which mediate the adhesion and further slow leukocytes down. These weakly bound leukocytes are free to detach if not activated by chemokines produced in injured tissue after [[signal transduction]] via respective [[G protein-coupled receptors]] that activates integrins on the leukocyte surface for firm adhesion. Such activation increases the affinity of bound integrin receptors for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the endothelial cell surface, firmly binding the leukocytes to the endothelium.
# '''Migration across the endothelium, known as'' transmigration, ''via the process of [[diapedesis]]:''' Chemokine gradients stimulate the adhered leukocytes to move between adjacent endothelial cells. The endothelial cells retract and the leukocytes pass through the basement membrane into the surrounding tissue using adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Movement of leukocytes within the tissue via [[chemotaxis]]:''' Leukocytes reaching the tissue interstitium bind to [[extracellular matrix]] proteins via expressed integrins and [[CD44]] to prevent them from leaving the site. A variety of molecules behave as [[chemoattractant]]s, for example, C3a or C5, and cause the leukocytes to move along a chemotactic gradient towards the source of inflammation.

=== Phagocytosis ===
{{Main|Phagocyte}}
Extravasated neutrophils in the cellular phase come into contact with microbes at the inflamed tissue. [[Phagocyte]]s express cell-surface endocytic [[pattern recognition receptors]] (PRRs) that have affinity and efficacy against non-specific [[microbe-associated molecular patterns]] (PAMPs). Most PAMPs that bind to endocytic PRRs and initiate [[phagocytosis]] are cell wall components, including complex carbohydrates such as [[mannans]] and β-[[glucans]], [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS), [[peptidoglycans]], and surface proteins. Endocytic PRRs on phagocytes reflect these molecular patterns, with [[C-type lectin]] receptors binding to mannans and β-glucans, and [[scavenger receptor (immunology)|scavenger receptor]]s binding to LPS.

Upon endocytic PRR binding, [[actin]]-[[myosin]] [[cytoskeletal]] rearrangement adjacent to the plasma membrane occurs in a way that endocytoses the plasma membrane containing the PRR-PAMP complex, and the microbe. [[Phosphatidylinositol]] and [[Vps34]]-[[PIK3R4|Vps15]]-[[BECN1|Beclin1]] signalling pathways have been implicated to traffic the endocytosed phagosome to intracellular [[lysosomes]], where fusion of the phagosome and the lysosome produces a phagolysosome. The [[reactive oxygen species]], [[superoxides]] and [[hypochlorite]] bleach within the phagolysosomes then kill microbes inside the phagocyte.

Phagocytic efficacy can be enhanced by [[opsonization]]. Plasma derived complement [[C3b]]  and antibodies that exude into the inflamed tissue during the vascular phase bind to and coat the microbial antigens. As well as endocytic PRRs, phagocytes also express [[opsonin]] receptors [[Fc receptor]] and [[complement receptor 1]] (CR1), which bind to antibodies and C3b, respectively. The co-stimulation of endocytic PRR and opsonin receptor increases the efficacy of the phagocytic process, enhancing the [[lysosomal]] elimination of the infective agent.

== Morphologic patterns ==
Specific patterns of acute and chronic inflammation are seen during particular situations that arise in the body, such as when inflammation occurs on an [[epithelial]] surface, or [[pyogenic]] bacteria are involved.
* '''Granulomatous inflammation:''' Characterised by the formation of [[granuloma]]s, they are the result of a limited but diverse number of diseases, which include among others [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[sarcoidosis]], and [[syphilis]].
* '''Fibrinous inflammation:''' Inflammation resulting in a large increase in vascular permeability allows [[fibrin]] to pass through the blood vessels. If an appropriate ''procoagulative'' stimulus is present, such as cancer cells,&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; a fibrinous exudate is deposited. This is commonly seen in [[serous membrane|serous cavities]], where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between serous membranes, limiting their function. The deposit sometimes forms a pseudomembrane sheet. During inflammation of the intestine ([[Pseudomembranous colitis]]), pseudomembranous tubes can be formed.
* '''Purulent inflammation:''' Inflammation resulting in large amount of [[pus]], which consists of neutrophils, dead cells, and fluid. Infection by pyogenic bacteria such as [[staphylococci]] is characteristic of this kind of inflammation. Large, localised collections of pus enclosed by surrounding tissues are called [[abscess]]es.
* '''Serous inflammation:''' Characterised by the copious effusion of non-viscous serous fluid, commonly produced by [[mesothelial]] cells of [[serous membrane]]s, but may be derived from blood plasma. Skin [[blister]]s exemplify this pattern of inflammation.
* '''Ulcerative inflammation:''' Inflammation occurring near an epithelium can result in the [[necrotic]] loss of tissue from the surface, exposing lower layers. The subsequent excavation in the epithelium is known as an [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]].

== Inflammatory disorders ==
[[File:Asthma (Lungs).png|thumb|215x215px|Asthma is considered an inflammatory-mediated disorder. On the right is an inflamed airway due to asthma.]]
[[File:CD colitis 2.jpg|thumb|209x209px|Colitis (inflammation of the colon) caused by Crohn's Disease.]]
Inflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders that underlie a vast variety of human diseases. The immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders, demonstrated in both [[allergic reaction]]s and some [[myopathies]], with many [[immune system disorder]]s resulting in abnormal inflammation. Non-immune diseases with causal origins in inflammatory processes include cancer, [[atherosclerosis]], and [[ischaemic heart disease|ischemic heart disease]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

=== Atherosclerosis ===

{{main|Atherosclerosis}}
Atherosclerosis, formerly considered a bland lipid storage disease, actually involves an ongoing inflammatory response. Recent advances in basic science have established a fundamental role for inflammation in mediating all stages of this disease from initiation through progression and, ultimately, the thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis. These new findings provide important links between risk factors and the mechanisms of atherogenesis. Clinical studies have shown that this emerging biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis applies directly to human patients. Elevation in markers of inflammation predicts outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes, independently of myocardial damage. In addition, low-grade chronic inflammation, as indicated by levels of the inflammatory marker [[C-reactive protein]], prospectively defines risk of atherosclerotic complications, thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors. Moreover, certain treatments that reduce coronary risk also limit inflammation. In the case of lipid lowering with statins, this anti-inflammatory effect does not appear to correlate with reduction in low-density lipoprotein levels. These new insights into inflammation in atherosclerosis not only increase our understanding of this disease but also have practical clinical applications in risk stratification and targeting of therapy for this scourge of growing worldwide importance.&lt;ref name="pmid12490960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libby|first=P|title=Inflammation in atherosclerosis.|journal=Nature|date=Dec 19–26, 2002|volume=420|issue=6917|pages=868–74|doi=10.1038/nature01323|pmid=12490960|bibcode=2002Natur.420..868L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allergy ===
An allergic reaction, formally known as [[Type I hypersensitivity|type 1 hypersensitivity]], is the result of an inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation, vasodilation, and nerve irritation. A common example is [[hay fever]], which is caused by a hypersensitive response by [[mast cell]]s to [[allergen]]s. Pre-sensitised mast cells respond by [[degranulation|degranulating]], releasing [[vasoactive]] chemicals such as histamine. These chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation, production of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokine release, and recruitment of leukocytes.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; Severe inflammatory response may mature into a systemic response known as [[anaphylaxis]].

=== Myopathies ===
Inflammatory myopathies are caused by the immune system inappropriately attacking components of muscle, leading to signs of muscle inflammation. They may occur in conjunction with other immune disorders, such as [[systemic sclerosis]], and include [[dermatomyositis]], [[polymyositis]], and [[inclusion body myositis]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

=== Leukocyte defects ===
Due to the central role of leukocytes in the development and propagation of inflammation, defects in leukocyte functionality often result in a decreased capacity for inflammatory defense with subsequent vulnerability to infection.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; Dysfunctional leukocytes may be unable to correctly bind to blood vessels due to surface receptor mutations, digest bacteria ([[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]]), or produce [[microbicide]]s ([[chronic granulomatous disease]]). In addition, diseases affecting the [[bone marrow]] may result in abnormal or few leukocytes.

=== Pharmacological ===
Certain drugs or exogenous chemical compounds are known to affect inflammation. [[Vitamin A]] deficiency causes an increase in inflammatory responses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wiedermann U |title=Vitamin A deficiency increases inflammatory responses |journal=Scand J Immunol. |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=578–584 |year=1996 |pmid=8972739 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-351.x |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |last2=Chen |first2=X.-J. |last3=Enerback |first3=L. |last4=Hanson |first4=L.

Certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy may exert some of their detrimental effects by activating transcription factors intimately involved with inflammation (e.g. [[NF-κB]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hargrave |first=B.

Molecular intersection between receptors of steroid hormones, which have important effects on cellular development, and transcription factors that play key roles in inflammation, such as [[NF-κB]], may mediate some of the most critical effects of inflammatory stimuli on cancer cells.&lt;ref name="pmid19382224"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Copland|first=JA|author2=Sheffield-Moore, M |author3=Koldzic-Zivanovic, N |author4=Gentry, S |author5=Lamprou, G |author6=Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, F |author7=Zoumpourlis, V |author8=Urban, RJ |author9= Vlahopoulos, SA  |title=Sex steroid receptors in skeletal differentiation and epithelial neoplasia: is tissue-specific intervention possible?|journal=BioEssays|date=Jun 2009|volume=31|issue=6|pages=629–41|pmid=19382224|doi=10.1002/bies.200800138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity of a mediator of inflammation to influence the effects of steroid hormones in cells, is very likely to affect carcinogenesis on the one hand; on the other hand, due to the modular nature of many steroid hormone receptors, this interaction may offer ways to interfere with cancer progression, through targeting of a specific protein domain in a specific cell type. Such an approach may limit side effects that are unrelated to the tumor of interest, and may help preserve vital homeostatic functions and developmental processes in the organism.

According to a review of 2009, recent data suggests that cancer-related inflammation (CRI) may lead to accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.&lt;ref name="pmid19468060"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colotta F, Allavena P, Sica A, Garlanda C, Mantovani A |title=Cancer-related inflammation, the seventh hallmark of cancer: links to genetic instability |journal=Carcinogenesis |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=1073–81 |date=July 2009  |pmid=19468060 |doi=10.1093/carcin/bgp127 |type=review|last2=Allavena |last3=Sica |last4=Garlanda |last5=Mantovani }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A normal cell may undergo [[carcinogenesis]] to become a cancer cell if it is frequently subjected to DNA damage during long periods of chronic inflammation.  DNA damages may cause genetic [[mutation]]s due to [[DNA repair#Translecion synthesis|inaccurate repair]].  In addition, mistakes in the DNA repair process may cause [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations.&lt;ref name=Chiba /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shacter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ding /&gt;  Mutations and epigenetic alterations that are replicated and provide a selective advantage during somatic cell proliferation may be carcinogenic.

Genome-wide analyses of human cancer tissues reveal that a single typical cancer cell may possess roughly 100 mutations in [[coding region]]s, 10-20 of which are [[carcinogenesis|“driver mutations”]] that contribute to cancer development.&lt;ref name=Chiba /&gt;  However, chronic inflammation also causes epigenetic changes such as [[DNA methylation in cancer|DNA methylation]]s, that are often more common than mutations.  Typically, several hundreds to thousands of genes are methylated in a cancer cell (see [[DNA methylation in cancer]]).  Sites of oxidative damage in [[chromatin]] can recruit complexes that contain [[DNA methyltransferase]]s (DNMTs), a histone deacetylase ([[sirtuin 1|SIRT1]]), and a [[EZH2|histone methyltransferase (EZH2)]], and thus induce DNA methylation.&lt;ref name=Chiba /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22094255"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Hagan HM, Wang W, Sen S, Destefano Shields C, Lee SS, Zhang YW, Clements EG, Cai Y, Van Neste L, Easwaran H, Casero RA, Sears CL, Baylin SB |title=Oxidative damage targets complexes containing DNA methyltransferases, SIRT1, and polycomb members to promoter CpG Islands |journal=Cancer Cell |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=606–19 |year=2011 |pmid=22094255 |pmc=3220885 |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2011.09.012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28522752"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maiuri AR, Peng M, Sriramkumar S, Kamplain CM, DeStefano Shields CE, Sears CL, O'Hagan HM |title=Mismatch Repair Proteins Initiate Epigenetic Alterations during Inflammation-Driven Tumorigenesis |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=77 |issue=13 |pages=3467–3478 |year=2017 |pmid=28522752 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0056 |pmc=5516887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA methylation of a [[CpG site|CpG island]] in a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter region]] may cause silencing of its downstream gene (see [[CpG site]] and [[regulation of transcription in cancer]]).

The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doitsh|first=Gilad|last2=Greene|first2=Warner C.|date=2016-03-09|title=Dissecting How CD4 T Cells Are Lost During HIV Infection|journal=Cell Host &amp; Microbe|volume=19|issue=3|pages=280–291|doi=10.1016/j.chom.2016.02.012|pmc=4835240|pmid=26962940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflmammatory cytokines such as [[Interleukin 1 beta|IL-1β]] and [[Interleukin 18|IL-18]] can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765,&lt;ref name="Doitsh 509–514"/&gt; which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01048255|title=Study of VX-765 in Subjects With Treatment-resistant Partial Epilepsy - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings could propel development of an entirely new class of “anti-AIDS” therapies that act by targeting the host rather than the virus. Such agents would almost certainly be used in combination with ART. By promoting “tolerance” of the virus instead of suppressing its replication, VX-765 or related drugs may mimic the evolutionary solutions occurring in multiple monkey hosts (e.g. the sooty mangabey) infected with species-specific lentiviruses that have led to a lack of disease, no decline in CD4 T-cell counts, and no chronic inflammation.

=== Resolution of inflammation ===
The inflammatory response must be actively terminated when no longer needed to prevent unnecessary "bystander" damage to tissues.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;  Failure to do so results in chronic inflammation, and cellular destruction. Resolution of inflammation occurs by different mechanisms in different tissues.
Mechanisms that serve to terminate inflammation include:&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eming |first=S. A. |first2=T. |last2=Krieg |first3=J.

{{Cquote|Acute inflammation normally resolves by mechanisms that have remained somewhat elusive. Emerging evidence now suggests that an active, coordinated program of resolution initiates in the first few hours after an inflammatory response begins. After entering tissues, [[granulocyte]]s promote the switch of [[arachidonic acid]]–derived [[prostaglandin]]s and [[leukotriene]]s to lipoxins, which initiate the termination sequence. [[Neutrophil]] recruitment thus ceases and programmed death by [[apoptosis]] is engaged. These events coincide with the biosynthesis, from [[omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids]], of [[resolvins]] and [[Neuroprotectin|protectins]], which critically shorten the period of neutrophil infiltration by initiating apoptosis. As a consequence, apoptotic neutrophils undergo [[phagocytosis]] by [[macrophage]]s, leading to neutrophil clearance and release of anti-inflammatory and reparative [[cytokines]] such as transforming growth factor-β1.

== Systemic effects ==
An [[infectious organism]] can escape the confines of the immediate tissue via the [[circulatory system]] or [[lymphatic system]], where it may spread to other parts of the body. If an organism is not contained by the actions of acute inflammation it may gain access to the lymphatic system via nearby [[lymph vessel]]s. An infection of the lymph vessels is known as [[lymphangitis]], and infection of a lymph node is known as [[lymphadenitis]]. When lymph nodes cannot destroy all pathogens, the infection spreads further. A pathogen can gain access to the bloodstream through lymphatic drainage into the circulatory system.

When inflammation overwhelms the host, [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] is diagnosed. When it is due to [[infection]], the term [[sepsis]] is applied, with the terms [[bacteremia]] being applied specifically for bacterial sepsis and [[viremia]] specifically to viral sepsis. [[Vasodilation]] and organ dysfunction are serious problems associated with widespread infection that may lead to [[septic shock]] and death.

=== Acute-phase proteins ===
Inflammation also induces high systemic levels of [[acute-phase protein]]s. In acute inflammation, these proteins prove beneficial; however, in chronic inflammation they can contribute to [[amyloidosis]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; These proteins include [[C-reactive protein]], [[serum amyloid A]], and [[serum amyloid P]], which cause a range of systemic effects including:&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;
{{div col|colwidth=25em}}
* [[Fever]]
* Increased [[blood pressure]]
* Decreased [[sweating]]
* [[Malaise]]
* [[Anorexia (symptom)|Loss of appetite]]
* [[Somnolence]]
{{div col end}}

=== Leukocyte numbers ===
Inflammation often affects the numbers of leukocytes present in the body:
* [[Leukocytosis]] is often seen during inflammation induced by infection, where it results in a large increase in the amount of leukocytes in the blood, especially immature cells. Leukocyte numbers usually increase to between 15 000 and 20 000 cells per microliter, but extreme cases can see it approach 100 000 cells per microliter.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; Bacterial infection usually results in an increase of [[neutrophil]]s, creating [[neutrophilia]], whereas diseases such as [[asthma]], [[hay fever]], and parasite infestation result in an increase in [[eosinophil]]s, creating [[eosinophilia]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;
* [[Leukopenia]] can be induced by certain infections and diseases, including viral infection, ''[[Rickettsia]]'' infection, some [[protozoa]], [[tuberculosis]], and some [[cancer]]s.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

=== Systemic inflammation and obesity ===
With the discovery of [[interleukin]]s (IL), the concept of [[systemic inflammation]] developed. Although the processes involved are identical to tissue inflammation, systemic inflammation is not confined to a particular tissue but involves the [[endothelium]] and other organ systems.

Chronic inflammation is widely observed in obesity.&lt;ref name=ParimisettyDorsemans2016&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Parimisetty A, Dorsemans AC, Awada R, Ravanan P, Diotel N, Lefebvre d'Hellencourt C|title=Secret talk between adipose tissue and central nervous system via secreted factors-an emerging frontier in the neurodegenerative research|journal=J Neuroinflammation|volume=13|issue=1|pages=67|date=Mar 24, 2016|pmid=27012931|pmc=4806498|doi=10.1186/s12974-016-0530-x|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kershaw |first=E.

Low-grade chronic inflammation is characterized by a two- to threefold increase in the systemic concentrations of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=A.

The body attacks fat like it does bacteria and fungi. When expanded fat cells leak or break open, macrophages mobilize to clean up and embed into the adipose tissue. Then macrophages release inflammatory chemicals, including TNF-α and IL-6. TNF's primary role is to regulate the immune cells and induce inflammation. White blood cells then assist by releasing more [[cytokine]]s. This link between adiposity and inflammation has been shown to produce 10–35% of IL-6 in a resting individual, and this production increases with increasing adiposity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Subcutaneous adipose tissue releases interleukin-6, but not tumor necrosis factor-α, in vivo |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |year=1997 |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=4196–4200 |doi=10.1210/jc.82.12.4196 |pmid=9398739 |author1=Mohamed-Ali |first1=V |last2=Goodrick |first2=S |last3=Rawesh |first3=A |last4=Katz |first4=D.

Loss of [[white adipose tissue]] reduces levels of inflammation markers.&lt;ref name=ParimisettyDorsemans2016 /&gt; The association of systemic inflammation with [[insulin resistance]] and [[atherosclerosis]] is the subject of intense research.&lt;ref name=Stitzinger&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/dspace/bitstream/1887/9729/11/01.pdf |publisher= The digital repository of Leiden University |title= Lipids, inflammation and atherosclerosis |author=M Stitzinger |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-11-02 |format= pdf|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the obese mouse models, inflammation and [[macrophage]]-specific genes are upregulated in white adipose tissue (WAT). There were also signs of dramatic increase in circulating [[insulin]] level, adipocyte lipolysis and formation of [[multinucleate]] [[giant cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chronic Inflammation in Fat Plays a Crucial Role in the Development of Obesity-Related Insulin Resistance |journal=J Clin Invest |year=2003 |volume=112 |issue=12 |pages=1821–30 |doi=10.1172/JCI19451 |pmid=14679177 |pmc=296998 |author1=Xu |first1=H |last2=Barnes |first2=G.

Higher than normal Angptl2 level in fat tissues develop inflammation as well as insulin and leptin resistance. Stored fat secretes leptin to signal satiety. Leptin resistance plays a role in the process where appetite overrules the message of satiety. Angptl2 then starts an inflammatory cascade causing blood vessels to remodel and attract macrophages. Angptl2 is an adipocyte-derived inflammatory mediator linking obesity to systemic insulin resistance.&lt;ref name=KadomatsuTabata2011&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kadomatsu T, Tabata M, Oike Y|title=Angiopoietin-like proteins: emerging targets for treatment of obesity and related metabolic diseases|journal=FEBS J|volume=278|issue=4|pages=559–64|date=Feb 2011|pmid=21182596|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/73/12/73_CJ-09-0710/_pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07979.x|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that, as an inflammatory marker, [[Leptin#Clinical significance|leptin responds specifically]] to adipose-derived [[Proinflammatory cytokine|inflammatory cytokines]].

== Outcomes ==
[[File:Scar (xndr).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Scars present on the skin, evidence of fibrosis and healing of a wound]]
The outcome in a particular circumstance will be determined by the tissue in which the injury has occurred and the injurious agent that is causing it. Here are the possible outcomes to inflammation:&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

# '''Resolution'''&lt;br /&gt;The complete restoration of the inflamed tissue back to a normal status. Inflammatory measures such as vasodilation, chemical production, and leukocyte infiltration cease, and damaged [[parenchyma]]l cells regenerate. In situations where limited or short-lived inflammation has occurred this is usually the outcome.
# '''[[Fibrosis]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Large amounts of tissue destruction, or damage in tissues unable to regenerate, cannot be regenerated completely by the body. Fibrous [[scarring]] occurs in these areas of damage, forming a scar composed primarily of [[collagen]]. The scar will not contain any specialized structures, such as [[parenchyma]]l cells, hence functional impairment may occur.
# '''Abscess formation'''&lt;br /&gt;A cavity is formed containing pus, an opaque liquid containing dead white blood cells and bacteria with general debris from destroyed cells.
# '''Chronic inflammation'''&lt;br /&gt;In acute inflammation, if the injurious agent persists then chronic inflammation will ensue. This process, marked by inflammation lasting many days, months or even years, may lead to the formation of a [[chronic wound]]. Chronic inflammation is characterised by the dominating presence of macrophages in the injured tissue. These cells are powerful defensive agents of the body, but the [[toxin]]s they release (including [[reactive oxygen species]]) are injurious to the organism's own tissues as well as invading agents. As a consequence, chronic inflammation is almost always accompanied by tissue destruction.

== Examples ==
Inflammation is usually indicated by adding the suffix "[[wikt:-itis|itis]]", as shown below. However, some conditions such as [[asthma]] and [[pneumonia]] do not follow this convention. More examples are available at [[list of types of inflammation]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Diet and inflammation ==
The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) is a score (number) that describes the potential of diet to modulate systemic inflammation within the body.  As stated chronic inflammation is linked to most chronic diseases including arthritis, many types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, and diabetes.

== Exercise and inflammation ==

===Exercise-induced acute inflammation===

Acute inflammation of the [[muscle cells]], as understood in exercise physiology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilmore|first=Jack|title=Physiology of Sport and Exercise|year=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=978-0-7360-5583-3|pages=26–36, 98–120, 186–250, 213–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; can result after [[Muscle contraction|induced]] [[Eccentric contraction|eccentric]] and [[Concentric contraction|concentric]] muscle training.  Participation in eccentric training and conditioning, including resistance training and activities that emphasize eccentric lengthening of the [[muscle]] including downhill running on a moderate to high incline can result in considerable soreness within 24 to 48 hours, even though [[blood lactate]] levels, previously thought to cause muscle soreness, were much higher with level running.  This [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS) results from structural damage to the contractile filaments and [[Muscle cells|z-disks]], which has been noted especially in [[marathon runner]]s whose muscle fibers revealed [[Myopathy|remarkable damage]] to the muscle fibers after both training and marathon competition &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/recent-research-provides-insight-into-muscle-soreness|title=Physiology of Sport and Exercise 5E: Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness|work=human-kinetics|access-date=2017-06-04|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.  The onset and timing of this gradient damage to the muscle parallels the degree of muscle soreness experienced by the runners.

Z-disks are the point of contact for the contractile proteins.  They provide structural support for transmission of force when muscle fibers are activated to shorten.  However, in marathon runners and those who subscribe to the overload principle to enhance their muscles, show moderate Z-disk streaming and major disruption of thick and thin filaments in parallel groups of sarcomeres as a result of the force of eccentric actions or stretching of tightened muscle fibers.

This disruption of muscle fibers triggers white blood cells to increase following induced muscle soreness, leading to the inflammatory response observation from induced muscle soreness. Elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure are concluded to be associated with inflammatory response. High tension in the contractile-elastic system of muscle results in structural damage to the muscle fiber and plasmalemma and its epimysium, perimysium, and/or endomysium.  The mysium damage disrupts calcium homeostasis in injured fibers and fiber bundles, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 48 hours after exercise.  The products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents (such as histamines, kinins, and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) accumulate outside cells. These substances then stimulate free nerve endings in the muscle; a process that appears accentuated by eccentric exercise, in which large forces are distributed over a relatively small cross-sectional area of the muscle&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s, including but not limited to those cited in the above description, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases. The new view that muscle is an endocrine organ is transforming our understanding of exercise physiology and with it, of the role of inflammation in adaptation to stress.&lt;ref name="inflammation-metabolism.dk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedersen|first=BK|date=Jul 2013|title=Muscle as a secretory organ|journal=Comprehensive Physiology|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1337–62|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|isbn=9780470650714|pmid=23897689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the above, IL-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine. Therefore, it was first thought that the exercise-induced IL-6 response was related to muscle damage.&lt;ref name="pmid9130176"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bruunsgaard H, Galbo H, Halkjaer-Kristensen J, Johansen TL, MacLean DA, Pedersen BK | title = Exercise-induced increase in serum interleukin-6 in humans is related to muscle damage | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 499 | issue = Pt 3| pages = 833–41 |date=March 1997 | pmid = 9130176 | pmc = 1159298 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1997.sp021972| last2 = Galbo | last3 = Halkjaer-Kristensen | last4 = Johansen | last5 = MacLean | last6 = Pedersen }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has become evident that eccentric exercise is not associated with a larger increase in plasma IL-6 than exercise involving concentric “nondamaging” muscle contractions. This finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise. As a matter of fact, eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL-6 during recovery.&lt;ref name="pmid23897689"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pedersen BK | title = Muscle as a secretory organ | journal = Compr Physiol | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 1337–62 |date=July 2013 | pmid = 23897689 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c120033 | isbn = 9780470650714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work has shown that both upstream and downstream signalling pathways for IL-6 differ markedly between myocytes and macrophages. It appears that unlike IL-6 signalling in macrophages, which is dependent upon activation of the NFκB signalling pathway, intramuscular IL-6 expression is regulated by a network of signalling cascades, including the Ca2+/NFAT and glycogen/p38 MAPK pathways. Thus, when IL-6 is signalling in monocytes or macrophages, it creates a pro-inflammatory response, whereas IL-6 activation and signalling in muscle is totally independent of a preceding TNF-response or NFκB activation, and is anti-inflammatory.&lt;ref name="TheRole"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brandt C |author2=Pedersen BK|title=The role of exercise-induced myokines in muscle homeostasis and the defense against chronic diseases |journal=Journal of Biomedicine &amp; Biotechnology|year=2010|volume=2010|pages=1–6|pmid=20224659|doi=10.1155/2010/520258|pmc=2836182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies show that markers of inflammation are reduced following longer-term behavioural changes involving both reduced energy intake and a regular program of increased physical activity, and that, in particular, IL-6 was miscast as an inflammatory marker. For example, the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 have been demonstrated by IL-6 stimulating the production of the classical anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10.&lt;ref name="TheRole" /&gt; As such, individuals pursuing exercise as a means to treat the causal factors underlying chronic inflammation are pursuing a course of action strongly supported by current research, as an inactive lifestyle is strongly associated with the development and progression of multiple inflammatory diseases. Note that cautions regarding over-exertion may apply in certain cases, as discussed above, though this concern rarely applies to the general population.

===Signal-to-noise theory===

Given that localized acute inflammation is a necessary component for muscle growth, and that chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with a disruption of anabolic signals initiating muscle growth, it has been theorized that a [[signal-to-noise]] model may best describe the relationship between inflammation and muscle growth.&lt;ref&gt;Pilon, Brad. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160509091232/http://www.inflammationtheory.com/ Inflammation Affects Your Ability to Build Muscle]" ''Inflammation Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; By keeping the "noise" of chronic inflammation to a minimum, the localized acute inflammatory response signals a stronger anabolic response than could be achieved with higher levels of chronic inflammation.

The '''Irish College of Ophthalmologists''' or '''ICO''' is the recognised body for [[ophthalmology]] training in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  Founded in 1991, it represents over 200 ophthalmologists in Ireland and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyedoctors.ie/about/&lt;/ref&gt;  Its current president is Alison Blake.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalindependent.ie/99240/irish_college_of_ophthalmologists_ico_annual_conference&lt;/ref&gt;  Yvonne Delaney serves as [[Dean (education)|Dean]].

==Governance==
The ICO is overseen by its Council which is elected every 3 years by College members. The College also appoints a Clinical Lead for National Clinical Programme in Ophthalmology, a Dean of Postgraduate Education, and a Programme Director for Surgical Training. The business of the College is assisted by: a Manpower, Education and Training Committee; a [[Community ophthalmic physician|Medical Ophthalmology]] Committee; an Ethics Committee; and a Scientific and [[Continuing Professional Development]] Committee.

==Education==
In conjunction with the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI), the ICO oversees postgraduate medical and surgical ophthalmology training in Ireland.  The ICO is a recognised training body of the [[Irish Medical Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalcouncil.ie/Registration/First-Time-Applicants/Specialist-Registration/Category-E/Postgraduate-Training-Bodies/&lt;/ref&gt;  Its remit includes approval of hospital training posts.&lt;ref&gt;http://rveeh.ie/rveeh/education/Ophthalmology.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its international activities, the College is twinned with the [[New England Ophthalmological Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neos-eyes.org/meetings/30&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the ICO introduced an online Professional Competency Scheme, to comply with new legislation and Irish Medical Council regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imt.ie/news/2011/03/medical-council-announces-pc-schemes-enrolment-fees.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imn.ie/view/32-clinical-news/3961-professional-competence-schemes-at-the-rcsi&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICO also collaborates with the [[Health Service Executive]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.ie/about-ncbi/ncbi-publications/cost-of-sight-loss-report-2011/full-report/cost-effectiveness-analysis/screening-people-with-diabet&lt;/ref&gt; and engages in outreach and education for patients and the general public.

==Training scheme==
The ICO and RCSI supervise and co-ordinate the two strands of the ophthalmology training programme in Ireland: Basic Surgical Training (BST) and Higher Surgical Training (HST).  Completion of a pre-registration intern year is required before applying for ophthalmology training.

===Basic Surgical Training===
The BST programme involves rotating through various sub-specialities.  Trainees work as [[Senior House Officer]]s over a minimum of three years at hospital sites in one of three combinations:
*1. South Dublin Scheme:  [[Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital]] (RVEEH) and [[Sligo General Hospital]]
*2. North Dublin Scheme:  [[Mater Misericordiae University Hospital]], [[University Hospital Galway]], and [[Waterford Regional Hospital]]
*3. Munster Scheme:  [[Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick]] and [[Cork University Hospital]]
Formal training includes use of surgical simulators, continuous assessment and a mandatory [[human factors]] course.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishmedicaltraining.ie/Specialties/Pages/Ophthalmology.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  During the BST, trainees sit examinations at RVEEH to gain Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the MRCSI (Ophth) qualification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcsi.ie/index.jsp?p=240&amp;n=753&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the BST, successful trainees receive the Certificate of Completion of Basic Surgical Training (CCBST), with which they may apply for the competitive HST programme.

===Higher Surgical Training===
The HST scheme is a pre-requisite for obtaining a post as a [[Consultant (medicine)|hospital consultant]].  HST lasts four-and-a-half years and covers seven core sub-specialities:
* [[oculoplastics|oculoplastic]], [[Accessory visual structures|adnexal]], and [[Lacrimal apparatus|lacrimal]] surgery
* [[cornea]] and external diseases
* [[cataract]] and [[refractive surgery]]
* [[glaucoma]]
* [[retina]], [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]], [[uvea]], and [[Eye neoplasm|ocular oncology]]
* [[neuro-ophthalmology]]
* [[Pediatric ophthalmology|paediatric ophthalmology]] and [[strabismus]]
Trainees are assessed every 6 months and in their final year must complete a [[Fellow#Medical Education Systems in the United Kingdom.2C Canada.2C Australia and New Zealand|fellowship]] exam, the FRCSI (Ophth).  This exit exam comprises a one-hour [[Oral exam|viva voce]] and a written test.  Successful candidates also receive the Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST).

==Research==
The ICO holds an annual international conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalindependent.ie/event.aspx?title=irish_college_of_ophthalmologists_annual_conference&lt;/ref&gt; where members and guests present research abstract, talks and posters. From 2000 to 2011, the annual ICO/[[Pfizer]] Research Fellowship was presented at the conference.  The award sponsored [[non-consultant hospital doctor|trainee doctors]] to undertake research in ophthalmology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyedoctors.ie/press-clipping/Irish%20Medical%20Times%2020.05.11.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2013, the ICO partnered with [[Novartis]] to sponsor the ICO/Novartis Research Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyedoctors.ie/press-releases/010213%20ICO_Novartis%20Research%20Award%202013%20Final%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the ICO introduced a Clinical Fellowship Bursary, in conjunction with [[Bayer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalindependent.ie/99240/irish_college_of_ophthalmologists_ico_annual_conference&lt;/ref&gt;

His initial plan was to choose a career in [[aeronautics]], particularly [[aerospace engineering]], though his school guidance counselor suggested subjects which were useful for a career in medicine.&lt;ref name="thenewsnigeria.com.ng"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2014/05/life-60/|title=My Life At 60 – Prof. Adewole|work=The News Nigeria|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he attended Ogudu Methodist Primary School, Ilesa, where he spent one year, and Methodist School, Oke Ado in Ibadan, where he also spent one year before he completed his primary education at St Mathias Demonstration School Akure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewswatchtimesng.com/adewole-ui-vc-at-61-the-doctor-farm-activist/|title=ADEWOLE, UI VC AT 61: The doctor farm activist |work= Newswatch Times|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended [[Ilesa Grammar School]], where he obtained a Grade I certificate with distinction in 1970 and Higher School Certificate (HSC) in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/adewole-ui-vc-60/|title=Adewole, UI VC, at 60 – The Sun News Online|work=The Sun News|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1973, he enrolled at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan; there he obtained an MBBS degree and in 1978 won the Glaxo Allenbury prize for outstanding performance in [[paediatrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/i-ll-make-ui-greater-new-vc/78948/|title=I'll Make UI Greater – New VC |work=Thisday News|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is involved in Nigerian medical politics. He was influenced by Dr. Kayode Obembe, the former President of the [[Nigerian Medical Association]],&lt;ref name="thenewsnigeria.com.ng"/&gt; who encouraged him in the early 1980s to contest the seat of secretary to the Resident Doctors Association. In 1982, Adewole was elected as the Secretary-general of the University of Ibadan Chapter of the Association of Resident Doctors.&lt;ref name="Challenge"/&gt; He served in that capacity for one year. In 1984 he was elected president of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria and led a nationwide strike that resulted in his dismissal by the then military head of state, General [[Muhammadu Buhari]], who is currently the [[President of Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/feature/life-times/i-was-smuggled-out-of-nigeria-when-buhari-declared-me-wanted-prof-adewole/|title=I was smuggled out of Nigeria|work=The Punch News|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Buhari declared him a wanted man, Adewole went into exile.&lt;ref name=online/&gt; He worked at the Cancer Campaign Research Institute in London, where he authored four papers. He later returned to Nigeria and was elected deputy Secretary-general of the [[Nigerian Medical Association]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=online&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/many-adventures-ui-vice-chancellor/|title=My many adventures as UI Vice-Chancellor|work=The NationNigeria|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he was elected Secretary-general of the Nigerian Medical Association.

==Keynote speeches==
In addition to his outstanding contributions to medicine and academics, he is also a [[pundit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribuneonlineng.com/i’ll-continue-devote-time-research-work-—ui-vc|title=I'll continue to devote time for research work —UI VC|work=Tribune Nigeria|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his welcome address at a public lecture organised by the [[Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa]] held at the International Conference Centre, [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]], Ibadan, he lamented the decline of Africa's contribution to global scientific output. He advocated for the commensurate expansion in doctoral training to meet the human resources needs of the new institutions as well as the existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/science-academy-urges-members-to-identify-societal-needs/|title=Science Academy urges members to identify societal needs|work=The Nation Nigeria|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, during the [[Ebola virus disease in Nigeria|Ebola virus outbreak in Nigeria]], he led a panel of experts to brainstorm on the latest scientific information on the nature of the virus, its signs, symptoms, and prevention. At a meeting held at the University of Ibadan to mobilise against the virus, he said "Nigeria is still safe, though we suffered a biological attack when Mr. Patrick Sawyer came into Nigeria from Liberia".&lt;ref name="AutoY3-31"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/university-ibadan-mobilises-ebola/|title=University of Ibadan mobilises against Ebola|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called on security agencies to investigate the bank accounts of [[Patrick Sawyer]], who imported the virus into the country, to discover if he was paid to terrorise the country with the virus.&lt;ref name="AutoY3-31"/&gt;

While receiving an award of excellence for outstanding contributions to obstetrics and gynaecology at the [[University of Sunderland]] 2015 convocation ceremonies, he said &lt;blockquote&gt;any war against terror must be fought through collective efforts to nip it in the bud. An African proverb says 'Until you unmask it, a masquerade remains a terror'. A war against terror – of any kind – is best achieved through collective efforts. Our modest contributions from our corner of the globe have helped in restoring hope to millions of people without hope. It has become a lamp among the armament that unmasked the monster HIV, and we shall continue to beam the light of research on all threats to human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewillnigeria.com/news/ui-signs-mou-with-uk-varsity-as-vc-bags-award-for-medical-science-excellence/|title=UI Signs MoU With UK Varsity As VC Bags Award For Medical|work=The Will Nigeria|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; As part of efforts to end insurgency in Nigeria, the Ambassador of France to Nigeria [[Jacques Champagne de Labriolle]] visited Adewole in his office at the University of Ibadan. Adewole described the ambassador's visit as "auspicious and timely in the history of Nigeria." He said "our country must gladly engage the French-speaking countries, if we really want to maintain security for the citizenry. I believe that creating a long-term security should be our main concern just as the initiative of our president was so strategic, having recently visited France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionservice.info/article/963536343/french-diplomat-ui-vc-tackle-insecurity-in-nigeria-/|title=French diplomat, UI VC tackle insecurity in Nigeria|work=collectionservice.info|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministerial nomination and appointment==
On 12 October  2015, Adewole was nominated as Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by Muhammadu Buhari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneonlineng.com/node/20559|title=Still on Professor Adewole's nomination|work=Nigeria Tribune|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/191401-buhari-sends-second-batch-of-ministerial-nominees-to-senate.html|title=Buhari sends second batch of ministerial nominees to senate|work=Premium Times|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Academic Staff Union of Universities]] (ASUU) lauded his nomination and described him as a "round peg in a round hole suitable for president's change agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribuneonlineng.com/node/20065|title=Ministerial nomination: Allegations against Adewole baseless|work=Nigerian Tribune|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his remarks, chairman of the union Professor Olusegun Ajiboye described the nomination as a "right step towards the change that Nigeria needs by appointing change agents who have achieved global recognition in their chosen academic career and have unblemished administrative records".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newspost.co/buhari-urged-to-assign-adewole-to-schooling-or-well-being-ministry/|title=Buhari urged to assign Adewole to Schooling or Well being Ministry|work=News Post|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]]'' reported that Dr. Ademola Aremu, the National Treasurer of the Union, said that &lt;blockquote&gt;the story of Prof. Adewole 'IFA' as we popularly called him is the story of someone who has been destined to serve humanity. His achievements as a provost of the college of medicine made him to receive overwhelming support from the university community when he indicated interest to serve on the university governing council and later on as vice chancellor. As vice chancellor, he totally turned the university around in terms of staff and student welfare, academically, University of Ibadan unarguably became the best in Nigeria and one of the best in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/10/asuu-lauds-adewoles-nomination-as-minister/|title=ASUU lauds Adewole's nomination as minister|work=The Guardian News|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same vein, the chairman of the University of Ibadan Senior Staff Association of Universities Wale Akinremi said "the nomination of Prof. Isaac Folorunsho Adewole as a minister was received by the university of Ibadan community with great enthusiasm. We can vouch for his professional pedigree and administrative competence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmirroronline.net/new/buhari-urged-to-assign-adewole-to-education-or-health-ministry/|title=Buhari urged to assign Adewole to Education or Health Ministry|work=National Mirror|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2015, Adewole was appointed as minister of health in Buhari's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/11/stakeholders-charge-adewole-on-industrial-harmony-others-in-health-sector/|title=Stakeholders charge Adewole on industrial harmony, others in health sector|work=Guardian Newspaper|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to ''[[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]]'', Adewole said &lt;blockquote&gt;for the apex policy on health to be achieved, we need to work together and working together means we can make a huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/adewole-ehanire-seek-stakeholders-collaboration-on-health/|title=Adewole, Ehanire seek stakeholders collaboration on health|work=[[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his capacity as minister, Adewole was appointed by WHO Director-General [[Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus]] to serve on the Independent High-level Commission on Non-Communicable Diseases from 2018 until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/ncds/governance/high-level-commission/mission/commissioners/en/ WHO Independent High-level Commission on NCDs] [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is a member of the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) Reference Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familyplanning2020.org/about-us/reference-group FP2020 Reference Group] Family Planning 2020 (FP2020).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joel Jalmari Ruokokoski''', known as '''Jali''' (1886-1936) was a Finnish [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painter. Although most of his works were landscapes and [[still-life]]s, he is probably best known for a series of portraits (including numerous self-portraits) painted mostly during the 1910s. Ruokokoski was a member of the [[November Group (Finland)|November Group]], (''Marraskuun ryhmä''). &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://marikki.fng.fi/bibliografia/bibliografiat.php?path=&amp;res=AQTB2XeKAAAAdg%3D%3D&amp;history=AQTB2MGoAAAACA%3D%3D%3BAQTB2N0uAAAAGQ%3D%3D%3BAQTB2N0PAAAAgQ%3D%3D%3BAQTB2SCBAAAALQ%3D%3D%3BAQTB2MGoAAAAFg%3D%3D%3BAQTB2UzgAAAADg%3D%3D%3BAQTB2MGoAAAAFQ%3D%3D%3BAQTB2XeKAAAAdg%3D%3D |title= Bibliografia}} &lt;/ref&gt;


==Biography==
His father was a shoemaker from [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www3.jkl.fi/taidemuseo/oravienaarteita/jalmariruokokoski.html Biography] @ Oravien Aarteita (Taidemuseo)&lt;/ref&gt; The family returned to Finland when he was thirteen and settled in Helsinki. He studied at the "[[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|Central School of Art and Design]]" from 1902 to 1904 and at the "[[Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki|Art Society Drawing School]]" from 1903 to 1906. His first public showing came in 1905. Until his first artistic breakthrough came four years later, he earned extra money by drawing advertisements and cartoons. In 1907 he was engaged with a girl named Olga, whom he had encountered in a cafe that he frequently visited. The engagement was broken after a short while the same year.

He was very fond of public festivities; especially the circus. In 1909 he married a Swedish-Italian [[tightrope walker]] named Elvira Bono. In 1910, they were able to take a trip to Paris, courtesy of a scholarship, and he was introduced to the work of the [[Impressionists]].
[[File:Ruokokoski, Jalmari - Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Woman (1914)]]
In 1912, he spent some time in [[Helsingør]], Denmark, with the family of Niels-Peder Rydeng (1880-1949), a tailor and art collector who had once employed the Finnish artist [[Tyko Sallinen]]. Word had gotten about that Rydeng was a generous man who would offer free room and board in return for paintings. He stayed for several weeks, producing sixty paintings, including portraits of Rydeng's family. They developed a lasting friendship and Ruokokoski returned there many times for brief visits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obro-artgallery.com/about-rydeng.htm#niels-peder Niels-peder Rydeng and his art collection] @ the Obro Art Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Back in Helsinki, he was able to sell all the paintings he had brought with him at an exhibition in the Athenaeum, but spent most of the money on a drinking and partying binge. This (and a possible flirtation while he was in Helsingør) created a rift between him and his wife, which widened, so they separated. He attempted to emigrate to America in 1914, but the police removed him from the ship due to unpaid debts.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

===Second marriage and more difficulties===
In 1915, he settled in [[Hyvinkää]], where he and Sallinen opened adjacent studios called "Humala ja Krapula" (Drunk and Hungover).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyvinkaa.fi/fi/Kulttuurijavapaa-aika/Kulttuuri/Hyvinkaan-historia/Hyvinkaan-kuvataidehistoriaa/Tyko-Sallinen-ja-Jalmari-Ruokokoski/#.VQIjnUbn9eU Humala ja Krapula] @ the Hyvinkää website.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruokokoski lived in "Drunk", painting what he saw from his windows, with an occasional trip to do landscapes. He stayed there until 1918, when he divorced Elvira and married Saima Forsström, a model, despite his studio's financial failure. They stayed together for ten years, then separated, although they never divorced and he continued to visit their five children.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

He was always successful as an artist, exhibiting throughout Scandinavia as well as Rome and Milan, but continued to squander most of his money and was never far from financial ruin. He began producing quickly sketched pictures of simple things such as leaves, food and sunsets to earn extra income. An antique shop that he opened in 1924 failed after only a year. By 1931, he was barely eking out a living from a small tenement apartment.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

His last exhibition was in 1935. Toward the end of that year, he was hospitalized for alcohol abuse, which had damaged his liver and given him throat cancer. He died the following Spring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4503">'''Jay Martin Gould''' (August 19, 1915 – September 16, 2005), was a statistician and epidemiologist who cofounded the [[Radiation and Public Health Project]] in 1989.  It was Gould's contention that [[radiation]] from [[nuclear power plant]]s was causing high rates of cancer in surrounding neighborhoods. For more than two decades, Gould routinely warned that low levels of radiation from nuclear reactors were far more dangerous than commonly believed. But his research was criticized by many in the scientific community as being alarmist.&lt;ref name=jm&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/nyregion/19gould.html Jay M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10105">{{short description|United Nations mechanism tasked with monitoring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6}}
The '''Joint Monitoring Programme''' ('''JMP''') '''for Water Supply and Sanitation''' by WHO and UNICEF&lt;ref&gt;WHO and UNICEF [http://www.wssinfo.org/ JMP website homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216075751/http://www.wssinfo.org/ |date=2008-02-16 }}, WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  is the official United Nations mechanism tasked with monitoring progress towards the [[Sustainable Development Goal]] Number 6 (SDG6) since 2016.

Until 2015, JMP was tasked with monitoring the [[Millennium Development Goal]] (MDG) relating to drinking water and [[sanitation]] (MDG 7, Target 7c), which was to: "Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking-water and basic sanitation".&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations]]:[http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/facts_figures/basic_needs.shtml World Water Assessment Program], accessed on February 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The JMP is housed within the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]], and supported by a Strategic Advisory Group of independent technical and policy experts as well as various Technical Task Forces convened around important specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;WHO and UNICEF [http://www.wssinfo.org/task-forces/introduction/ overview of Task Forces on the JMP website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606071711/http://www.wssinfo.org/task-forces/introduction/ |date=2012-06-06 }}, WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The JMP’s four priority areas of activity for 2010-2015 are:
1.	maintaining the integrity of the JMP database and ensuring accurate global estimates;
2.	disseminating data to stakeholders;
3.	fulfilling the JMP’s normative role in developing and validating target indicators;
4.	enhancing interaction between countries and JMP.

In 2015, the JMP released its latest estimates on the use of various types of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities at the national, regional and global levels.&lt;ref name="sanitation"&gt;WHO and UNICEF ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140418142528/http://www.wssinfo.org/documents/ Progress on Sanitation and Drinking-water: 2015 Update]'', WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The JMP makes its data and information available through a variety of channels and formats, including workshops in countries, its major biennial reports and website, the UNICEF statistical website, and through Google Public Data.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF [http://www.childinfo.org/water_data.php UNICEF’s statistical website], UNICEF, New York, accessed on June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The data are also used by the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]]'s Statistical Information System (WHOSIS).&lt;ref&gt;[[WHO]]:[http://www.who.int/whosis/indicators/WHS09_IndicatorCompendium_20090701.pdf World Health Statistics indicator compendium 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824054257/http://www.who.int/whosis/indicators/WHS09_IndicatorCompendium_20090701.pdf |date=2009-08-24 }}, p. 137-140, accessed on February 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The JMP collaborates with other international and national organizations to strengthen global and domestic monitoring. The Programme also plays an advocacy role, highlighting the right to improved drinking water and sanitation for populations missing out and helping to target interventions.

In preparation for the post-2015 period ([[Sustainable Development Goals]]), the JMP has initiated four working groups which are developing potential future targets and indicators for water, sanitation, hygiene and equity/non-discrimination).&lt;ref&gt;[[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]:[http://www.wssinfo.org/post-2015-monitoring/overview/ Overview of the Post-2015 Monitoring working groups on the JMP website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606072520/http://www.wssinfo.org/post-2015-monitoring/overview/ |date=2012-06-06 }}, WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as reporting on the national, regional and global use of different types of drinking water sources and sanitation facilities, the JMP actively supports countries in their efforts to monitor this sector and develop evidence based planning and management, plays a normative role in indicator formation and advocates on behalf of populations without improved water or sanitation.

==Vision and mission==

The JMP vision is to accelerate progress towards universal and sustainable access for underserved populations in the developing world to safe water and basic sanitation, including the achievement of the MDG targets by 2015.

The JMP’s mission is to be the trusted source of global, regional and national data on sustainable access to safe drinking-water and basic sanitation, for use by governments, donors, international organizations and civil society.

==Indicators==
{{Further|Improved water source|Improved sanitation}}
The JMP uses the following MDG indicators for monitoring:
* Proportion of population using an [[Improved water source|improved drinking-water source]];
* Proportion of population using an [[improved sanitation]] facility.
An improved water source is defined by the JMP as one that, by nature of its construction or through active intervention, is likely to be protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with fecal matter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;JMP Website (WHO and UNICEF) [http://www.wssinfo.org/definitions-methods/ Definitions], accessed on 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  An improved sanitation facility is defined as one that is likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and some examples are given in the definition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Estimation methods ==
The JMP does not collect primary data itself. Instead, to the extent possible, it exclusively uses data from primary sources such as [[census]]es and national household surveys that are conducted by national statistical authorities every few years. These surveys include the UNICEF-supported [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys]] (MICS) and the USAID funded [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS). One of the challenges faced by the JMP is that the definitions for an [[improved water source]] and [[improved sanitation]] are not consistent across countries. Another challenge is that censuses and surveys are only conducted every few years. The JMP thus uses [[linear regression]] to estimate data for a given year in a particular country even if no survey or census was carried out in that year, in order to be able to compare data across countries for the given year.&lt;ref&gt;[[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]:[http://www.wssinfo.org/definitions-methods/method/ Introduction to JMP methodology on the JMP website], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for discrepancies of estimates===

The indicators used by the JMP are controversial because they cannot always match cultural and local perceptions of what works or not, and can differ from national estimates. Discrepancies between national and international (JMP) coverage estimates are generally due to one or more of the following:

1)	Use of different definitions of access including poorly defined access categories

2)	Exclusion of users of shared sanitation facilities of an otherwise improved type, from those considered to have improved sanitation

3)	Use of latest survey or census findings vs. use of an interpolated estimates based on linear regression

4)	Use of different population estimates, including a different distribution of urban and rural populations

5)	Use of “old” estimates which do not reflect the latest or all findings from new sample surveys or a new census

6)	Use of “reported” line ministry data vs. use of independently verifiable data from sample surveys or censuses

===Challenges===

Complete information about drinking water safety, and the reliability and sustainability of drinking water and sanitation facilities is not available globally, and so these dimensions are not included in the current indicator definitions.&lt;ref&gt;WHO and UNICEF [https://web.archive.org/web/20120328173008/http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-report-2012-en.pdf ''Progress on Drinking-water and Sanitation: 2012 Update''], op.cit page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Allouche and Lyla Mehta:[http://community.eldis.org/Environmentnews/.59b8e85e/.59df98bb Water and sanitation for all: the need to go beyond numbers and beyond the MDGs], September 17, 2010, posted on Eldis&lt;/ref&gt; Systematically testing the microbial and chemical quality of water at the national level in all countries is prohibitively expensive and logistically complicated. However, the JMP is working to include these challenging dimensions to the extent possible in future indicators. 

Between 2002 and 2008, the Rapid Assessment of Drinking-Water Quality (RADWQ) project was designed and the quality of drinking-water from improved sources was evaluated in a number of pilot countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]:[http://www.wssinfo.org/definitions-methods/method/ Introduction to water quality on the JMP website], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on June 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the JMP focused its thematic report on equity, safety and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]:[http://www.wssinfo.org/documents-links/documents/?tx_displaycontroller%5Btype%5D=thematic_reports Thematic reports on the JMP website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731145849/http://www.wssinfo.org/documents-links/documents/?tx_displaycontroller%5Btype%5D=thematic_reports |date=2012-07-31 }}, WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on September 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the JMP has been supporting the piloting of water quality testing alongside household surveys.

== History ==
Amos Winter, a PHD graduate from MIT, travelled to [[Tanzania]] during his work, and found that conventional wheelchairs are inadequate in areas without wheelchair accessible roads and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/09/tech/innovation/leveraged-freedom-chair-innovative-wheelchair/index.html|title=Off-road wheelchair offers freedom for disabled poor|last=Blendis|first=Stefanie|date=10 June 2013|work=CNN|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his students from his mechanical engineering class worked together on the development of the project. The tests of the LFC were conducted in East Africa, Guatemala and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abilitymagazine.com/mit-leveraged-freedom-chair/|title=MIT — Leveraged Freedom Chair|last=Limón Martirosyan|first=Lia|date=|work=Ability Magazine|access-date=30 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In addition to a normal wheelchair pushrim, the wheelchair has a lever drivetrain that lets the user grip the lever far from the wheel for high torque on rough terrain.The levers can be removed and stored on the chair, allowing it to be used like a normal wheelchair indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://d-lab.mit.edu/scale-ups/LFC|title=Leveraged Freedom Chair (LFC) / India - An innovative lever-powered wheelchair for developing countries|work=Development Lab, MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wheelchairs are designed to be produced at low cost from commonly available bicycle parts, and to be repaired and maintained at local bicycle shops.

The chair is developed by a group called Global Research Innovation &amp; Technology. The chair is sold at around US $250 to NGOs, less than the price of common wheelchairs.&lt;ref name="gizmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/freedom-wheelchair-goes-mountain-biking/34728/|title=The GRIT Freedom Chair takes the wheelchair mountain biking|date=15 Nov 2014|work=Gizmag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GRIT Freedom Chair is an off-road sports chair designed for the developed world. The product launched on [[Kickstarter]] with a lowest price point of US$2,195, which sold out.&lt;ref name="gizmag" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">'''National Board Dental Examination''' '''(NBDE)''' is the [[United States]] national [[Dentistry|dental]] examination for students and professionals in dentistry. It is required for licensure in the United States and may also be required when applying for postgraduate studies in dental specialities after completing a [[Doctor of Dental Medicine|dental degree]]. Foreign-trained [[dentists]] also must take the NBDE in order to earn admission into [[advanced standing]] programs in US dental schools. 

The [[American Student Dental Association]] sells reprints of previously released exams as study guides for students in their online store.

'''NBDE I''' consists of 400 multiple choice questions emphasizing basic sciences: &lt;br&gt;
1. [[Human Anatomy]], [[Embryology]], and [[Histology]] &lt;br&gt;
2. [[Biochemistry]] and [[Physiology]] &lt;br&gt;
3. [[Microbiology]] and [[Pathology]] &lt;br&gt;
4. [[Dental anatomy|Dental Anatomy]] and [[Occlusion (dentistry)|Occlusion]].

'''NBDE II''' requires two days and focuses on clinical dental topics:&lt;br&gt;
1. [[Endodontics]]&lt;br&gt;
2. [[Restorative dentistry|Operative Dentistry]]&lt;br&gt;
3. [[Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery]]/[[Pain]] Control &lt;br&gt;
4. [[Mouth|Oral]] [[Diagnosis]] &lt;br&gt;
5. [[Orthodontics]] and [[Pediatric Dentistry]] &lt;br&gt;
6. Patient Management, including Behavioral Science, Dental Public Health and Occupational Safety &lt;br&gt;
7. [[Periodontics]] &lt;br&gt;
8. [[Pharmacology]] &lt;br&gt;
9. [[Prosthodontics]]

'''Scoring'''

Since 2012 the NBDE exams have been graded on a PASS/FAIL basis only, with no scores being issued unless one failed he will receive his score with details .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Licensure|url=http://www.ada.org/5443.aspx|work=Understanding Licensure|publisher=American Dental Association|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a student passes they are not allowed to take the exam again, unless required by a state board or relevant regulatory agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Board Dental Examination Part I 2011 Guide|url=http://www.ada.org/sections/educationAndCareers/pdfs/nbde01_examinee_guide.pdf|work=Eligibility for Reexamination|publisher=Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations|accessdate=31 July 2011|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Board Dental Examination Part II 2011 Guide|url=http://www.ada.org/sections/educationAndCareers/pdfs/nbde02_examinee_guide.pdf|work=Eligibility for Reexamination|publisher=Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations|accessdate=31 July 2011|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Commission on National Dental Examinations (JCNDE) changed the test to pass/fail because the test was being used as a measuring stick for students getting into specialty programs. The test's original purpose was to assist the state in making licensure decisions, not as a criterion for specialty programs. The JCNDE felt the NBDE was an unreliable indicator of success in specialties so they removed the scoring completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wysocki|first=Eddie|title=Board Scores Get the Ax: Does This New Change Pass or Fail?|url=http://www.asdablog.com/board-scores-get-the-ax-does-this-new-change-pass-or-fail/|publisher=ASDA blog|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Leadership Network for Health and Social Care''' (NLN), before 2005 the '''NHS Modernisation Board''', is a coalition of stakeholders in the [[England|English]] [[National Health Service]] (NHS).

Its purpose is to advise the [[Government minister|Ministerial]] team at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] on issues of NHS reform. There are twice-yearly meetings with the ministerial team  to review progress and set priorities. The Network has no executive power, but seeks to influence both government policy and the work of member organisations.

In April 2006 the Network issued a paper ''Strengthening local services: The Future of the acute hospital''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalleadershipnetwork.org/public/NLN-StrengtheningLocalServicesMain-170306.pdf Strengthening local services: The Future of the acute hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; which considers the ways in which local [[acute (medical)|acute]] hospitals will have to change and adapt given changes in the NHS as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="790">'''Normal yield''' is an agricultural term referring to the average historic yield established for a particular farm or area. It is also used to describe average yields. Normal production would be the normal crop acreage planted multiplied by the normal yield. These measures, once required by commodity programs to calculate benefits, are replaced by [[base acre]]s, payment acres, and payment yield under the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1101-1102).

'''Northampton State Hospital''' was a historic [[Psychiatric hospital]] at 1 Prince Street on top of Hospital Hill outside of [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. The hospital building was constructed in 1856, operated until 1993, and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994.

==History==
Construction of the State Hospital at Northampton, the third state institution for the insane in the state of [[Massachusetts]] began on March 15, 1856 on top of Hospital Hill outside of [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://northamptonstatehospital.com/history/ History of Northampton State Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4 (United States Independence Day)  of the same year the cornerstone was laid. For posterity, a time capsule was embedded within the cornerstone, where it would lay undisturbed on top of Hospital Hill for 150 years. The hospital consisted of Old Main (the original Kirkbride hospital building), and infirmaries, staff dormitories, a work farm, and other buildings including a brand new memorial complex which was established later.

The asylum received its first patients on August 16, 1858. Within six weeks, the population would reach 220, most of whom were transfers from other institutions long overwhelmed. The original design specified a maximum of 200 patients, but this limit was raised to 250 by the statewide hospital Commissioners before the asylum opened.  After only two months the Board of Trustees speculated that the limit could be raised to 300 patients.  As the patient population accelerated, the wards of Old Main were built onto so much that its original design looked nothing like its new shape. Soon, the population grew so much that several new infirmaries had to be built to sustain the patients.

The first superintendent, Dr. Prince, resigned in 1864, and Dr. Pliny Earle was selected as his replacement. Dr. Earle immediately began to cultivate a strong [[work therapy]] program by expanding the farm, constructing a greenhouse as well as other service-oriented buildings. When he retired in 1885, Dr. Earle was given an apartment within the asylum out of gratitude for his twenty-one years of service. The population had reached 476 patients.

The start of the 20th century was marked with a change in name from the State Hospital at Northampton to the Northampton Insane Hospital, and two years later to Northampton State Hospital. Northampton State Hospital, under superintendent John A. Houston, continued constructing buildings such as large infirmary wards built on either end of the hospital in 1902 and 1903. In 1907, the same year Bishop's Crook lamps were installed around the hospital grounds, “[[A Mind That Found Itself]]” was published. In it [[Clifford W. Beers]], a former patient of several institutions, argues that contrary to what the public had been led to believe, no one knew how to cure insanity. That year the population at Northampton stood at 726 patients.

Designed to accommodate 1000 patients, in 1925 work began on the largest expansion of Northampton State Hospital: Memorial Complex. Set apart from the original “Old Main” section of the asylum, Memorial Complex became the focal point for most of the construction, expansions and later operations of Northampton State Hospital, and it allowed the population to swell to more than 2,100 patients in 1935. As the asylum's population became crowded, patients were deported to other hospitals and causing several small buildings were built around Old Main. Also, Old Main had been expanded so much, the original shape of the building no longer resembled a bat wing.
 
After nearly a century of constant construction, Northampton State Hospital continued to grow. In 1952, the same year [[Thorazine]], the first [[anti-psychotic]] was introduced, and 2,331 patients were served by 509 staff. The Haskell building, which still serves as an office for the [[Massachusetts Department of Mental Health]], was added in 1959.

On January 6, 1978 the [[United States District Court]] approved the [[Brewster Consent Decree]], which made clear a patient's constitutional right to treatment in the least restrictive environment possible. Under terms set forth in the Decree the State Hospital was to reduce the number of patients it served to 50 by 1981. This process would ultimately take 14 rather than 3 years.

In 1980 Northampton State Hospital registered its 64,500th admission, while simultaneously attempting to reduce the total population. Patients were either reassigned to other, usually smaller facilities, or were simply dismissed. Ex-patients entered a largely ignorant and sometimes hostile community; for some, poverty and homelessness were as immediate as the citywide controversy. Debate raged all around Northampton.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

After 130 years, Old Main was abandoned in 1986. Operations at Memorial Complex continued until 1993, when the last 12 patients were reassigned, and Northampton State Hospital was officially closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://northamptonstatehospital.org/|title=Northampton State Hospital|website=Northampton State Hospital|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to preserve and reuse the buildings had gained some popularity around the turn of the millennium; however, city administrators only seriously considered demolition to redevelop the property. In 2006 Old Main was finally demolished, and by the following summer, the Memorial Complex was gone.

In 2007, the city of Northampton adopted a [[smart growth]] zoning overlay district covering the grounds of the Northampton State Hospital as part of Massachusetts's "Smart Growth Zoning Overlay District Act" enacted in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/chapter-40-r.html|title=Chapter 40 R|last=dhcd|date=2007-11-26|website=Housing and Economic Development|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoning district is designed to promote [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]], pedestrian-friendly development, and in 2008, the 40-unit Village Hill development broke ground on the former hospital grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/hed/docs/dhcd/cd/ch40r/profile-northampton.pdf|title=Northampton: A 40R Community|last=Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorialization Efforts==
On November 17 and 18, 2000 a series of memorial events took place in Northampton focusing on the history of Northampton State Hospital. The two-day event titled "The State Hospital: In Memoriam" included an academic symposium, an open forum with former patients, and three art exhibitions. The event was sponsored by the [[Massachusetts Mental Health Center]] (MMHC) Continuing Education Program and offered continuing education credits to psychologists and nurses in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J. Michael and Anna Schuleit Harber. ''[https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467122269 Images of America Northampton State Hospital]'', Arcadia Publishing, 2014, p. 114-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first day of the academic symposium featured the research and experiences of psychiatrists, mental health professionals, and academics from around the United States. An open forum took place the morning of the second day, during which former patients shared stories of their experiences inside the hospital.  The event closed with a sound installation at the site of the hospital's Old Main building. The art installation was designed by visual artist [[Anna Schuleit Haber]] and intended to reference the events of the laying of the hospital cornerstone in 1856. Attendants of the forum walked in procession to the former hospital grounds. At noon, bells from surrounding churches rang in unison to invoke a communal moment of silence, followed by “Habeas Corpus,” a sound installation in which J.S. Bach's [[Magnificat]], played on installed speakers from inside the empty old main building. The memorial series closed after the end of the 28-minute sound installation.&lt;ref&gt;Pamphlet titled “The State Hospital: In Memorium,” November 2000, Box 3, Folder 1, Northampton and Local History, Smith College Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2017, The Northampton Historical Commission dedicated a new bench in memory to the Northampton State Hospital Burial Ground. The bench overlooks Cemetery Hill, which was used as a burial ground by the hospital until the 1920s. There are 181 confirmed burials for patients who died at Northampton State Hospital, in unmarked graves at this site. The new bench replaced a temporary marker planted at the site since 1959. The new bench is the first step as part of the proposed Northampton State Hospital Walking Tour.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.historicnorthampton.org/nsh-burial-ground-bench.html “Dedication of the Northampton State Hospital Burial Ground Bench]'', Northampton Historical Commission, October 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the 1970s South Korea’s dictator [[Park Chung-hee|Park Chung Hee]] pushed for a [[Heavy-Chemical Industry Drive|heavy-chemical industry drive]] in an effort to modernise the country’s economy and make it less dependent on foreign imports, while encouraging [[foreign direct investment]]. The [[South Gyeongsang Province]] was one of the areas identified for industrial development along with the independently administered coastal corridor between [[Ulsan]] and [[Busan]]. From 1974 onwards, an area of 2,000 ha in Onsan - to the south of Ulsan - became home to a multitude of industrial complexes, with 12 chemical factories initially in operation. After 1990, the area grew to more than 120 factories employing over 10,000 staff.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0l8yBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60&amp;dq=onsan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigvtSt347XAhUDuBoKHd1_CqIQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=onsan&amp;f=false|title=The State of the Environment in Asia: 1999/2000|last=Council|first=The Japan Environmental|last2=Awaji|first2=Takehisa|last3=Teranishi|first3=Shunichi|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9784431683803|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental impact gained initial visibility with gas leaks in 1982 and 1984 which required hospitalisation of over 100 residents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1983, the local government suspended the fishing rights of the largely rural population over concerns of pollution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1985, media began reporting of an illness that may have affected over 500 residents which was believed to be environmental. After the government ran blood and urine tests, an official statement pushed back on the theory of poisoning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, environmental action groups questioned those results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6-Qy8ddxzQ4C&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=collective+emigration+plan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4_MW49Y7XAhXBuRoKHaemCWEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=collective%20emigration%20plan&amp;f=false|title=Contemporary South Korean Society: A Critical Perspective|last=Cho|first=Hŭi-yŏn|last2=Surendra|first2=Lawrence|last3=Cho|first3=Hyo-je|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415691390|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Onsan illness ==
In 1985 the environmental organisations KRIPP and KAPMA – predecessors of the [[Korean Federation for Environmental Movement]] – drew public attention to cases of unexplained illness which seems to cluster around the city of Onsan. The primary symptom was [[neuralgia]], but cases of eye and [[Irritation|skin irritation]] as well as breathing problems were also reported. Most such cases became statistically relevant from 1980 onwards, when pollution became a significant problem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The collective group of symptoms was termed ''Onsan illness'' as a root cause was initially unknown and later thought to be cadmium poisoning. It is believed that over 500 cases of cadmium poisoning have occurred in Onsan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CgG0TfMyitEC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=onsan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5zuvi6YvXAhVG2BoKHSyjBtcQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=onsan&amp;f=false|title=East Asian Social Movements: Power, Protest, and Change in a Dynamic Region|last=Broadbent|first=Jeffrey|last2=Brockman|first2=Vicky|date=2011-01-07|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387096261|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Comparisons have been drawn with the [[Itai-itai disease]], which caused similar symptoms and was caused by [[cadmium poisoning]] from the mining industry in the [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama prefecture]] in Japan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
=== Impact ===
The health impact combined with the risk to their livelihoods sparked a grass roots movement supported by the media. While the government maintained their position that poisoning is not the cause of this illness, it did admit to high pollution in the area. As a result, from 1991 between 30,000 and 40,000 residents were re-housed away from the affected area as part of a ''Collective Emigration Plan''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is thought that over time some of those may have returned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10506">[[File:HeroinWorld-en.svg|thumb|550px|A world map of the world's primary opium or heroin producers. The [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] region, which Myanmar is part of, is pinpointed in this map.]]

'''Opium production in Myanmar''' has historically been a major contributor to the country's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of [[opium]] after [[Opium production in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], producing some 25% of the world's opium, and forms part of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]. The opium industry was a monopoly during colonial times and has since been illegally operated by corrupt officials in the Burmese military and rebel fighters,&lt;ref name="BBC12"/&gt; primarily as the basis for [[heroin]] manufacture. 

Production is mainly concentrated in the [[Shan State|Shan]] and [[Kachin State|Kachin]] states. Due to poverty, opium production is attractive to impoverished farmers as the financial return from poppy is 17 times more than that of rice. The yield during 2012 was 690 tons, valued at US $359 million.&lt;ref name=Irra/&gt; 

Economic specialists indicate that recent trends in growth have the potential to increase the gap between the rich and the poor in the country, empowering criminal rackets at the expense of democracy.

==History==
Opium has been present in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) since as early as the 1750s, during which the Kongbaug Dynasty was in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=_-WcGf-viK0C&amp;pg=PA94 |pages=94– |title=Security and Sustainable Development in Myanmar/Burma |last=James |first=Helen |isbn=9781134253937 |year=2012 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States provided economic aid to the country then known as Burma in 1948 to reduce the opium trade. Between 1974–78, Burma received eighteen helicopters from the US for opium caravan interception.&lt;ref name="Chouvy2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chouvy|first=Pierre-Arnaud|title=Opium: Uncovering the Politics of the Poppy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGl4TN_qIsgC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05134-8|pages=109–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, Myanmar was producing more than half of the world's opium. The percentage dropped to one third by 1998. In 1999, the country reported a goal to become opium-free by 2014.&lt;ref name=Pitman2012 /&gt; 

According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], it is estimated that in 2005 there was some {{convert|167|sqmi}} dedicated to opium cultivation in Myanmar. According to a [[United Nations]] report, opium production has increased every year since then and as of 2012 had increased to around {{convert|510|km2}}.&lt;ref name="BBC12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20150082|title=UN report: Opium cultivation rising in Burma|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a crackdown on the trade and since 1998 production in Myanmar has fallen overall by some 83% as of 2012; and in 2012 alone some {{convert|240|km2}} of poppy fields had been eradicated, but the general trend is a steady increase in production according to recent surveys.&lt;ref name="BBC12"/&gt; 

As of 2012, some 300,000 households in Myanmar were involved in the industry.&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/spike-in-myanmars-opium-production-2012-11|title=The Spike In Myanmar's Opium Production Could Destabilize All Of Asia|publisher=''[[Business Insider]]''|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, China had over 1.1 million registered drug addicts and accounted  for over 70 per cent of all heroin consumption in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; In 2012, Myanmar produced 690 metric tons with a value of approximately $359 million.&lt;ref name=Pitman2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Pitman|first=Todd|title=Opium Production In Myanmar On Rise, Says UN|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/31/opium-production-myanmar_n_2048900.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myanmar is also one of three countries of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|golden "triangle"]] with Thailand and Laos forming the other two arms, where opium production accounted for about 50% of the world's consumption in 1990 but was reduced to about 33% by 1998.&lt;ref name=Irra/&gt; Myanmar part of this triangle is reported to be a lawless region.&lt;ref name=effort&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/31/us-myanmar-opium-idUSBRE89U08K20121031|title=Myanmar opium output rises despite eradication effort|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=13 June 2013|publisher=Reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of [[opium]] after [[Opium production in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], producing some 25% of the world's opium.&lt;ref name="BBC12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt; In the past, though, it was "the world's unrivaled leader in opiate production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NuDGE30AUEgC&amp;pg=PA186 |pages=186– |title=Burma: Prospects for a Democratic Future |last=Rotberg |first=Robert I. |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780815791690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production is mainly concentrated in the [[Shan State|Shan]] and [[Kachin State|Kachin]] states.&lt;ref name="BBC12"/&gt; China is the most important market for Burmese opium, due to an increase in heroin addiction in the country.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/burmamyanmar/9644746/Opium-cultivation-increases-for-sixth-year-in-Burma-according-to-UN-report.html|title=Opium cultivation increases for sixth year in Burma, according to UN report|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On an annual rate, production of opium in the country was estimated to be some {{Convert|150|t}}, according to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=tlqD5SqS8dwC&amp;pg=PA428 |pages=428– |title=History of the Opium Problem: The Assault on the East, Ca. 1600 – 1950 |last=Derks |first=Hans |year=2012 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004221581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012 it was a record 690 metric tons with estimated value of about US $359 million,&lt;ref name=Irra&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/17682|title=UN Says Burmese Opium Production Rising|date=31 October 2012|publisher=Irrwaddy organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to increased demand during last six years in succession, in Asia.&lt;ref name=Myanmar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/31/opium-production-myanmar_n_2048900.html|title=Opium Production In Myanmar On Rise, Says UN|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=13 June 2013|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In just one year between 2011 and 2012 the land area brought under opium crop has shot up from 40,000 ha to 51,000 ha, a 17% increase.&lt;ref name=Irra/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myanmar/&gt;

== Drug movement ==
Prior to the 1980s, heroin was typically transported from Myanmar to Thailand, before being trafficked by sea to [[Hong Kong]], which was and still remains the major transit point at which heroin enters the [[international market]]. Now, drug trafficking has circumvented to [[southern China]] (from [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]], [[Guangxi]], [[Guangdong]]) because of a growing market for drugs in China, before reaching Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chin|first=Ko-lin|author2=Sheldon X.

==The Burmese economy and opium==
The prominence of major drug traffickers have allowed them to penetrate other sectors of the Burmese economy, including the banking, airline, hotel and infrastructure industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chin|first=Ko-lin|title=The Golden Triangle: inside Southeast Asia's drug trade|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2009|pages=239–240|isbn=978-0-8014-7521-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their investment in infrastructure have allowed them to make more profits, facilitate drug trafficking and money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|author2=Gary W. Potter|title=Drugs in Society: Causes, Concepts and Control|publisher=Elsevier|date=14 October 2010|isbn=978-1-4377-4450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|ongoing, rural-based insurgencies within Myanmar]], many farmers have little alternative but to engage in opium production, which is used to make [[heroin]].&lt;ref name="BBC12"/&gt; Most of the money earned from opium sales go into the drug barons' pockets; the amount left is used to sustain the livelihood of the farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=eob5kq88eMAC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145– |title=Ethnic Politics in Burma: States of Conflict |last=South |first=Ashley |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780203895191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic specialists indicate that recent trends in growth have the potential to increase the gap between the rich and the poor in the country, empowering criminal rackets at the expense of democracy.&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt;

==Eradication programme==
With the establishment of the democratic government after the rule of a military junta, there is hope that opium eradication would be a serious public policy. The new government has taken steps to reform the system but the ground situation is otherwise as there is an upsurge in its production and this is attributed in a report by the UN as due to "the resurgence in opium production in Southeast Asia is the demand for opiates, both locally and in the region in general".&lt;ref name=Myanmar/&gt; 

Government reports claim that in 2012, a fourfold increase of elimination of poppy fields has been effected amounting to 24,000 hectares of poppy fields.&lt;ref name="BBC12"/&gt; According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) land poppy cultivation registered an increase of 17 percent, the highest increase in eight years.&lt;ref name=effort/&gt;

'''Psychiatric pharmacy''', also known as '''mental health pharmacy''', is the area of [[clinical pharmacy]] specializing in the treatment of people with [[psychiatric illness]]es through the use of [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]]. It is a branch of [[neuropsychiatric pharmacy]], which includes [[neurologic pharmacy]].&lt;ref name="CPNP FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuropsychiatric Pharmacy FAQ|url=https://cpnp.org/about/public/faq|website=CPNP.org|publisher=CPNP|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The [[College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists]] (CPNP) is a [[professional organization]] that represents psychiatric pharmacists within the United States. CPNP credits two key [[pharmacists]] with developing clinical psychiatric pharmacy as a specialty: Dr. Glen Stimmel, PharmD, BCPP and Dr. R. Lee Evans, PharmD, FASHP, BCPP.&lt;ref name="CPNP FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr Evans Info"&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 Saklad Award Recipient|url=https://cpnp.org/member/profile/2004-saklad-award-recipient|website=CPNP.org|publisher=CPNP|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Stimmel would later become a founding member of CPNP, as well as serve as its president.&lt;ref name="Stimmel Award"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPNP Foundation Awards the Career Achievement Award to Glen Stimmel, PharmD|url=https://cpnp.org/perspective/2016/06/t1465933218|website=The CPNP Perspective|publisher=CPNP|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Matthew Fuller PharmD, BCPP, FASHP, CPNP Foundation President 2006-2007, has recognized Dr. Stimmel as the “Father of Psychiatric Pharmacy."&lt;ref name="Stimmel Award" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CPNP Past Presidents"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPNP Past Presidents|url=https://cpnp.org/about/presidents|website=CPNP.org|publisher=CPNP|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specialty of psychiatric pharmacy was recognized by the [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] (BPS) in 1992.&lt;ref name="CPNP FAQ" /&gt;

==Practitioners==
===In the United States===
Psychiatric pharmacy is practiced by psychiatric (also called "neuropsychiatric") [[pharmacists]]. Psychiatric pharmacists tend to have a board certification in the specialty of psychiatric pharmacy, granting the title of Board Certified Psychiatric Pharmacist (BCPP) by the [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties|BPS]], and attach the post-nominals after their professional degrees.&lt;ref name="BPS BCPP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychiatric Pharmacy: Board of Pharmacy Specialties|url=http://www.bpsweb.org/bps-specialties/psychiatric-pharmacy|website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties|publisher=Board of Pharmacy Specialties|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the BPS does not have a separate certification for neurologic pharmacists, neurologic pharmacists may be classified as BCPP's as well (indeed, there is a significant amount of overlap between the two subspecialties). It is not uncommon for psychiatric pharmacists to be residency trained through a specialized [[pharmacy residency|residency]] (post-graduate year 2, abbreviated "PGY2") program in psychiatric pharmacy.&lt;ref name="APhA Weber"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weber|first1=Stanley|title=What psychiatric pharmacy is, what we do, and how we treat patients|url=https://www.pharmacist.com/what-psychiatric-pharmacy-what-we-do-and-how-we-treat-patients|website=What psychiatric pharmacy is, what we do, and how we treat patients: American Pharmacists Association|publisher=American Pharmacists Association|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric pharmacists work in both the [[inpatient]] and [[outpatient]] settings.

Psychiatric pharmacists working for the [[Veterans Health Administration]] can have salaries between $112,268-145,955.&lt;ref name="VA CPS Posting for OR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health Pharmacist|url=https://www.vacareers.va.gov/job-search/job-detail.asp?job=268902|website=vacareers.va.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
Psychiatric pharmacy is practiced by specialist mental health pharmacists. Specialist mental health pharmacists tend to work in the [[inpatient]] setting, within mental health hospitals.&lt;ref name="RPS on Mental Health Pharm"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutcliffe|first1=Daniel|title=The role of pharmacy in mental health|url=http://blog.rpharms.com/royal-pharmaceutical-society/2017/01/25/the-role-of-pharmacy-in-mental-health/|website=rpharms.com|publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credentialing is performed through the [[College of Mental Health Pharmacy]] (CMHP), which assesses the experience and aptitude of pharmacists working in the field of mental health (psychiatric) pharmacy. Credentialed members are granted the title of Member of the College of Mental Health Pharmacy (MCMHP), and attach the post-nominals after their professional degrees.&lt;ref name="CMHP Credentialing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Credentialing|url=http://www.cmhp.org.uk/expertise/credentialing/|website=cmhp.org.uk|publisher=College of Mental Health Pharmacy|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of practice==
As experts in pharmacotherapy, psychiatric pharmacists are trained to assure that patients suffering from mental illness are treated with the most appropriate medications for their conditions. They provide a variety of services aimed at making sure that patients are treated safely, that side effects are minimized (if not eliminated), and that pharmacologic treatments are efficacious at controlling or halting disease progression. 

===Comprehensive medication management===
Psychiatric pharmacists provide a service called comprehensive medication management (CMM), which involves a thorough assessment of a patient's present and past medication history, laboratory work-up and exam findings, and treatment goals. During CMM, psychiatric pharmacists look for drug related problems (DRPs) related to their patients' pharmacotherapy and correct them in collaboration with [[psychiatrists]], [[social workers]], and other members of the interdisciplinary healthcare team, collaborating closely with the patient and their family.&lt;ref name="CPNP CMM Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comprehensive Medication Management (CMM) Guide|url=https://cpnp.org/guideline/cmm|website=Comprehensive Medication Management (CMM) Guide|publisher=CPNP|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drop Topics Shah"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Monica|title=Psychiatric pharmacists help optimize patient care|url=http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drug-topics/news/psychiatric-pharmacists-help-optimize-patient-care?page=full|website=Psychiatric pharmacists help optimize patient care: Drug Topics|publisher=Drug Topics|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapeutic drug monitoring===
Psychiatric pharmacists provide [[therapeutic drug monitoring]], which involves ordering laboratory tests that will measure the concentration of a medication in the blood. This is especially useful in the area of psychiatric pharmacy because a lot of drugs used to treat psychiatric illnesses (for example, [[lithium citrate]] and [[clozapine]]) have a narrow [[therapeutic window]]. There is a lot of potential for severe adverse reactions when using certain psychiatric medications, making therapeutic drug monitoring a useful tool for preventing harmful outcomes. The National Council for Behavioral Health, a collaborative that represents the interests of psychiatric professional organizations, offers recommendations for targeted, interdisciplinary interventions by psychiatric pharmacists, including pharmacist-lead [[clozapine]] clinics and providing long-acting injectable [[antipsychotic]] administration services.&lt;ref name="NCBH Report Mar 2017"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychiatric Shortage: Causes and Solutions|date=March 28, 2017|publisher=National Council for Behavioral Health|page=52|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric pharmacists are sometimes involved in [[collaborative practice agreements]] which physicians, which allows pharmacists to add or remove medications from a patient's drug regimen, change the strengths/dose or frequencies of medications, the duration of treatment, and the route of administration.&lt;ref name="Pharmacist Prescribing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leheny|first1=Shelby|title=Could Prescribing Become a Daily Duty for Pharmacists?|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/shelby-leheny-pharmd-candidate-2017/2016/05/could-prescribing-become-a-daily-duty-for-pharmacists|publisher=Pharmacy Times|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with therapeutic drug monitoring, this allows psychiatric pharmacists to directly make changes to a patient's drug regimen based on the results from laboratory tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2740">The '''Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire''' ('''SADQ''' or '''SAD-Q''') is a 20 item clinical screening tool designed to measure the presence and level of alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stockwell T, Murphy D, Hodgson R|year=1983|title=The severity of alcohol dependence questionnaire: Its use, reliability and validity|journal=British Journal of Addiction|volume=78|issue=2|pages=45–156|pmid=6135435|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1983.tb05502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is divided into five sections:
* Physical withdrawal symptoms
* Affective withdrawal symptoms
* Craving and relief drinking
* Typical daily consumption
* Reinstatement of dependence after a period of abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Raistrick, D, Heather N, Godfrey C|year=2006|title=Review of the Effectiveness of Treatment for Alcohol Problems|publisher=National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse|location=London|url=http://www.nta.nhs.uk/publications/documents/nta_review_of_the_effectiveness_of_treatment_for_alcohol_problems_fullreport_2006_alcohol2.pdf|access-date=2009-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318131432/http://www.nta.nhs.uk/publications/documents/nta_review_of_the_effectiveness_of_treatment_for_alcohol_problems_fullreport_2006_alcohol2.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each item is scored on a 4-point scale, giving a possible range of 0 to 60. A score of over 30 indicates severe alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Assesing%20Alcohol/InstrumentPDFs/60_SADQ.pdf | title=Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ) sample | publisher=NIAAA | accessdate=August 2, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818194112/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Assesing%20Alcohol/InstrumentPDFs/60_SADQ.pdf | archivedate=August 18, 2006 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some local clinical guidelines use the SADQ to predict the levels of medication needed during alcohol detoxification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harrogatehealth.nhs.uk/gpguidelinesupload/GP%20Guidelines/Prescribing%20guidelines%20for%20alcohol%20misuse%20disorders%20Executive%20summary.doc{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sialadenitis''' ('''sialoadenitis''') is [[inflammation]] of a [[salivary gland]]. It may be subdivided temporally into acute, chronic and recurrent forms.

==Acute==

;Predisposing factors:
* [[sialolithiasis]]
* decreased flow (dehydration, post-operative, drugs)
* poor oral hygiene
* exacerbation of low grade chronic sialoadenitis

;Clinical features:
* Painful swelling
* Reddened skin
* Edema of the cheek, Periorbital region and neck
* low grade fever
* malaise
* raised ESR, CRP, leucocytosis
* purulent exudate from duct punctum

==Chronic==
{{Main|Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis}}
;Clinical Features:
* unilateral
* mild pain / swelling
* common after meals
* duct orifice is reddened and flow decreases
* may or may not have visible/palpable stone.
* [[Parotid gland]]
** Recurrent painful swellings
* [[Submandibular gland]]
** Usually secondary to [[sialolithiasis]] or stricture

;Treatment:
In chronic recurrent sialadenitis or chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, acute attacks are managed with conservative therapies such as hydration, [[analgesics]] (mainly [[NSAIDs]]), [[sialogogue]]s to stimulate salivary secretion, and regular, gentle gland massage.&lt;ref name=bestpractice&gt;[http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/1038/treatment/step-by-step.html bestpractice.bmj.com &gt; Sialadenitis] Last updated: Sep 08, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; If infection is present, appropriate cultures should be obtained, followed by empirical antibiotic therapy initially,&lt;ref name=bestpractice/&gt; for example [[amoxicillin/clavulanate]] or [[clindamycin]] which cover oral flora.

If there are attacks more than approximately 3 times per year or severe attacks, surgical excision of the affected gland should be considered.&lt;ref name=bestpractice/&gt;

'''Smoking''' is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. Most commonly the substance is the dried leaves of the [[tobacco]] plant which have been rolled into a small square of rice paper to create a small, round cylinder called a "[[cigarette]]". Smoking is primarily practiced as a [[route of administration]] for [[recreational drug use]] because the [[combustion]] of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers [[active substance]]s into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gasses and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid  [[nicotine]]; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce [[trance]]-like states that, they believe, can lead them to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]].

Smoking generally has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various [[physiology|physiologic]] processes such as [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Diseases related to [[tobacco smoking]] have been shown to kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015.&lt;ref name=Lancet5April2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reitsma|first1=Marissa B|last2=Fullman|first2=Nancy|last3=Ng|first3=Marie|last4=Salama|first4=Joseph S|last5=Abajobir|first5=Amanuel|title=Smoking prevalence and attributable disease burden in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2017|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30819-X|pmid=28390697|pmc=5439023|volume=389|issue=10082|pages=1885–1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practiced by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco  Fact sheet N°339|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs339/en/|accessdate=13 May 2015|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less common drugs for smoking include [[cannabis smoking|cannabis]] and [[opium]]. Some of the substances are classified as hard [[narcotic]]s, like [[heroin]], but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. [[Cigarette]]s are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and [[rolling paper]]. Other smoking implements include [[Tobacco pipe|pipes]], [[cigar]]s, [[Beedi|bidis]], [[hookah]]s, and [[bong]]s.

Smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BCE, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow [[shaman]]s and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world. In regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, it merged with existing practices of smoking (mostly of cannabis). In Europe, it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown.

Perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a [[panacea (medicine)|panacea]] and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as [[lung cancer]], [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[erectile dysfunction]], and [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of smoking}}

=== Early uses ===

[[File:Aztec feast 1.jpg|thumb|left|Aztec women are handed flowers and smoking tubes before eating at a banquet, [[Florentine Codex]], 1500]]
The history of smoking dates back to as early as 5000 BCE in shamanistic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;See Gately; Wilbert&lt;/ref&gt; Many ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians, Indians and Chinese, burnt incense as a part of religious rituals, as did the Israelites and the later Catholic and Orthodox Christian churches. Smoking in the Americas probably had its origins in the incense-burning ceremonies of [[shamanism|shamans]] but was later adopted for pleasure, or as a social tool.&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek (1978), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The smoking of tobacco, as well as various hallucinogenic drugs, was used to achieve trances and to come into contact with the spirit world.

Substances such as [[cannabis]], clarified butter ([[ghee]]), fish offal, dried snake skins and various pastes molded around [[incense]] sticks dates back at least 2000&amp;nbsp;years. Fumigation (''dhupa'') and fire offerings (''homa'') are prescribed in the [[Ayurveda]] for medical purposes, and have been practiced for at least 3,000&amp;nbsp;years while smoking, ''dhumrapana'' (literally "drinking smoke"), has been practiced for at least 2,000&amp;nbsp;years. Before modern times these substances have been consumed through [[Tobacco pipe|pipes]], with stems of various lengths or [[Chillum (pipe)|chillum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;P. Ram Manohar, "Smoking and Ayurvedic Medicine in India" in ''Smoke'', pp. 68–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis smoking was common in the Middle East before the arrival of tobacco, and was early on a common social activity that centered around the type of water pipe called a [[hookah]]. Smoking, especially after the introduction of tobacco, was an essential component of Muslim society and culture and became integrated with important traditions such as weddings, funerals and was expressed in architecture, clothing, literature and poetry.{{sfn|Gilman|Xun|2004|pp=20-21}}

Cannabis smoking was introduced to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] through [[Ethiopia]] and the east African coast by either Indian or Arab traders in the 13th century or earlier and spread on the same trade routes as those that carried coffee, which originated in the highlands of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, pp. 303–319&lt;/ref&gt; It was smoked in [[calabash]] water pipes with [[terracotta]] smoking bowls, apparently an Ethiopian invention which was later conveyed to eastern, southern and central Africa.

Reports from the first European explorers and conquistadors to reach the Americas tell of rituals where native priests smoked themselves into such high degrees of intoxication that it is unlikely that the rituals were limited to just tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, pp. 74–81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Persian girl smoking.jpg|thumb|A Persian girl smoking by [[Muhammad Qasim]]. [[Isfahan]], 17th century]]

In 1612, six years after the settlement of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[John Rolfe]] was credited as the first settler to successfully raise tobacco as a cash crop. The demand quickly grew as tobacco, referred to as "golden weed", revived the [[Virginia Company]] from its failed gold expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/socialstudies/projects/jvc/overview.html Jamestown, Virginia: An Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207191432/http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/socialstudies/projects/jvc/overview.html |date=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to meet demands from the old world, tobacco was grown in succession, quickly depleting the land. This became a motivator to settle west into the unknown continent, and likewise an expansion of tobacco production.&lt;ref&gt;Kulikoff, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indentured servitude]] became the primary labor force up until [[Bacon's Rebellion]], from which the focus turned to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, William J, ''Liberty and Slavery: Southern Politics to 1860'', Univ of South Carolina Press, 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend abated following the [[American Revolution]] as slavery became regarded as unprofitable. However the practice was revived in 1794 with the invention of the cotton gin.&lt;ref&gt;The People's Chronology, 1994 by James Trager&lt;/ref&gt;

A Frenchman named [[Jean Nicot]] (from whose name the word nicotine is derived) introduced tobacco to France in 1560. From France tobacco spread to England. The first report documents an English sailor in Bristol in 1556, seen "emitting smoke from his nostrils".&lt;ref name="L&amp;M"/&gt; Like tea, coffee and opium, tobacco was just one of many intoxicants that was originally used as a form of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Pollard, "The Pleasures and Perils of Smoking in Early Modern England" in ''Smoke'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco was introduced around 1600 by French merchants in what today is modern-day [[The Gambia]] and [[Senegal]]. At the same time caravans from [[Morocco]] brought tobacco to the areas around [[Timbuktu]] and the Portuguese brought the commodity (and the plant) to southern Africa, establishing the popularity of tobacco throughout all of Africa by the 1650s.

Soon after its introduction to the Old World, tobacco came under frequent criticism from state and religious leaders. [[Murad IV]], sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]] 1623-40 was among the first to attempt a smoking ban by claiming it was a threat to public morality and health. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] of China issued an edict banning smoking two years before his death and the overthrow of the [[Ming dynasty]]. Later, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rulers of the [[Qing dynasty]], would proclaim smoking "a more heinous crime than that even of neglecting archery". In [[Edo period]] Japan, some of the earliest tobacco plantations were scorned by the ''[[shōgun]]'' as being a threat to the military economy by letting valuable farmland go to waste for the use of a recreational drug instead of being used to plant food crops.&lt;ref name = "Screech-Smoke"&gt;Timon Screech, "Tobacco in Edo Period Japan" in ''Smoke'', pp. 92-99&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bonsack machine.png|thumb|left|Bonsack's cigarette rolling machine, as shown on U.S. patent 238,640]]

Religious leaders have often been prominent among those who considered smoking immoral or outright blasphemous. In 1634 the [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus']] forbade the sale of tobacco and sentenced men and women who flouted the ban to have their nostrils slit and their backs whipped until skin came off their backs. The Western church leader [[Pope Urban VII]] likewise condemned smoking in a papal bull of 1590. Despite many concerted efforts, restrictions and bans were almost universally ignored. When [[James VI and I]], a staunch anti-smoker and the author of ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'', tried to curb the new trend by enforcing a whopping 4000% tax increase on tobacco in 1604, it proved a failure, as London had some 7,000 tobacco sellers by the early 17th century. Later, scrupulous rulers would realise the futility of smoking bans and instead turned tobacco trade and cultivation into lucrative government monopolies.{{sfn|Gilman|Xun|2004|pp=15-16}}

By the mid-17th century every major civilization had been introduced to tobacco smoking and in many cases had already assimilated it into its culture, despite the attempts of many rulers to stamp the practice out with harsh penalties or fines. Tobacco, both product, and plant followed the major trade routes to major ports and markets, and then on into the hinterlands. The English language term ''smoking'' was coined in the late 18th century; before then the practice was referred to as ''drinking smoke''.&lt;ref name="L&amp;M"&gt;Lloyd &amp; Mitchinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco and cannabis were used in Sub-Saharan Africa, much like elsewhere in the world, to confirm social relations, but also created entirely new ones. In what is today [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], a society called Bena Diemba ("People of Cannabis") was organized in the late 19th century in Lubuko ("The Land of Friendship"). The Bena Diemba were collectivist pacifists that rejected alcohol and herbal medicines in favor of cannabis.{{sfn|Roberts|2004|pp=53–54}}

The growth remained stable until the American Civil War in the 1860s, from which the primary labor force transition from slavery to [[sharecropping]]. This compounded with a change in demand, lead to the industrialization of tobacco production with the cigarette. [[James Albert Bonsack]], a craftsman, in 1881 produced a machine to speed the production of cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Burns 134–135"&gt;Burns, pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opium ===

{{Main|Opium}}

[[File:French opium den.jpg|thumb|upright|An illustration of an [[opium den]] on the cover of ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', July 5, 1903]]

In the 19th century, the practice of smoking opium became common. Previously it had only been eaten, and then primarily for its medical properties. A massive increase in opium smoking in China was more or less directly instigated by the British trade deficit with [[Qing dynasty]] China. As a way to amend this problem, the British began exporting large amounts of opium grown in the Indian colonies. The social problems and the large net loss of currency led to several Chinese attempts to stop the imports which eventually culminated in the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s.&lt;ref name="Josh_ten_Berge"&gt;Jos Ten Berge, "The ''Belle Epoque'' of Opium in ''Smoke'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Opium smoking later spread with Chinese immigrants and spawned many infamous [[opium den]]s in [[Chinatown]]s around South and Southeast Asia and Europe. In the latter half of the 19th century, opium smoking became popular in the artistic community in Europe, especially Paris; artists' neighborhoods such as [[Montparnasse]] and [[Montmartre]] became virtual "opium capitals". While opium dens that catered primarily to emigrant Chinese continued to exist in Chinatowns around the world, the trend among the European artists largely abated after the outbreak of World War I.&lt;ref name="Josh_ten_Berge" /&gt; The consumption of Opium abated in China during the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the 1960s and 1970s.

With the modernization of cigarette production compounded with the increased life expectancies during the 1920s, adverse health effects began to become more prevalent.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} In Germany, anti-smoking groups, often associated with anti-liquor groups,&lt;ref name="NWC178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Proctor|2000|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; first published advocacy against the consumption of tobacco in the journal ''Der Tabakgegner'' (The Tobacco Opponent) in 1912 and 1932. In 1929, [[Fritz Lickint]] of Dresden, Germany, published a paper containing formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer–tobacco link. During the [[Great Depression]], [[Adolf Hitler]] condemned his earlier smoking habit as a waste of money,&lt;ref name="NWC219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Proctor|2000|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later with stronger assertions. This movement was further strengthened with Nazi reproductive policy as women who smoked were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family.&lt;ref name="NWC187"&gt;{{Harvnb|Proctor|2000|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement in Nazi Germany did reach across enemy lines during the Second World War, as anti-smoking groups quickly lost popular support.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} By the end of the Second World War, American cigarette manufacturers quickly reentered the German black market. Illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent,&lt;ref name="NWC245"&gt;{{Harvnb|Proctor|2000|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaders of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign were assassinated.&lt;ref name=ADLNMPHP&gt;{{Cite book|last=Proctor |first=Robert N. |title=Nazi Medicine and Public Health Policy |publisher=''Dimensions'', Anti-Defamation League |year=1996 |url=http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_nazi_med.asp |accessdate=2008-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531052102/http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_nazi_med.asp |archivedate=2008-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Marshall Plan]], the United States shipped free tobacco to Germany; with 24,000 tons in 1948 and 69,000&amp;nbsp;tons in 1949.&lt;ref name="NWC245"/&gt; Per capita yearly cigarette consumption in [[History of Germany (1945–90)|post-war Germany]] steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1,523 in 1963.&lt;ref name="NWC228"&gt;{{Harvnb|Proctor|2000|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century, anti-smoking campaigns in Germany were unable to exceed the effectiveness of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939–41 and German tobacco health research was described by [[Robert N. Proctor]] as "muted".&lt;ref name="NWC228"/&gt;

[[File:Lung_Cancer_Incidece_vers_Cigarette_Consumption.svg|thumb|A lengthy study conducted in order to establish the strong association necessary for legislative action (US cigarette consumption per person blue, male lung cancer rate green)]]

In the UK and the USA, an increase in lung cancer rates, formerly "among the rarest forms of disease", was noted by the 1930s, but its cause remained unknown and even the credibility of this increase was sometimes disputed as late as 1950. For example, in Connecticut, reported age-adjusted incidence rates of lung cancer among males increased 220% between 1935–39 and 1950-54. In the UK, the share of lung cancer among all cancer deaths in men increased from 1.5% in 1920 to 19.7% in 1947. Nevertheless, these increases were questioned as potentially caused by increased reporting and improved methods of diagnosis. Although several carcinogens were already known at the time (for example, [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[a]pyrene]] was isolated from coal tar and demonstrated to be a potent carcinogen in 1933), none were known to be contained in adequate quantities in [[tobacco smoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2589239/pdf/yjbm00061-0033.pdf|title=Research on Smoking and Lung Cancer: A Landmark in the History of Chronic Disease Epidemiology|author=Colin White|date=September 1989|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|pmc=2589239|pmid=2192501|volume=63|issue=1|pages=29–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Doll]] in 1950 published research in the [[British Medical Journal]] showing a close link between smoking and lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Doll R, Hill AB | title = Smoking and carcinoma of the lung.

As scientific evidence mounted in the 1980s, tobacco companies claimed [[contributory negligence]] as the adverse health effects were previously unknown or lacked substantial credibility. Health authorities sided with these claims up until 1998, from which they reversed their position. The [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], originally between the four largest US tobacco companies and the Attorneys General of 46 states, restricted certain types of tobacco advertisement and required payments for health compensation; which later amounted to the largest civil settlement in United States history.&lt;ref name="WallStreetJournalTobaccoMastersSettlement"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|title=Forty-Six States Agree to Accept $206 Billion Tobacco Settlement|date=November 23, 1998|author=Milo Geyelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965 to 2006, rates of smoking in the United States have declined from 42% to 20.8%.&lt;ref name="RockEtAlCDC2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm|title=Cigarette Smoking Among Adults --- United States, 2006|accessdate=2009-01-01|author=VJ Rock, MPH, A Malarcher, JW Kahende, K Asman, MSPH, C Husten, MD, R Caraballo|date=2007-11-09|website=|publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|location=|pages=|language=|doi=|quote=[...]In 2006, an estimated 20.8% (45.3 million) of U.S. adults[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant majority of those who quit were professional, affluent men. Despite this decrease in the prevalence of consumption, the average number of cigarettes consumed per person per day increased from 22 in 1954 to 30 in 1978.

In the early 1980s, organized international drug trafficking grew.

Recent years shows an increase in the consumption of vaporized heroin, [[methamphetamine]] and [[Phencyclidine]] (PCP). Along with a smaller number of [[psychedelic drug]]s such as [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], [[5-Meo-DMT]], and [[Salvia divinorum]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

{{see also|Recreational drug use#List of drugs which can be smoked|label 1=List of drugs which can be smoked}}

The most popular type of substance that is smoked is [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]]. There are many different tobacco cultivars which are made into a wide variety of mixtures and brands. Tobacco is often sold flavored, often with various fruit aromas, something which is especially popular for use with water pipes, such as [[hookah]]s. The second most common substance that is smoked is [[cannabis smoking|cannabis]], made from the flowers or leaves of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' or ''[[Cannabis indica]]''. The substance is considered illegal in most countries in the world and in those countries that tolerate public consumption, it is usually only pseudo-legal. Despite this, a considerable percentage of the adult population in many countries have tried it with smaller minorities doing it on a regular basis. Since cannabis is illegal or only tolerated in most jurisdictions, there is no industrial mass-production of cigarettes, meaning that the most common form of smoking is with hand-rolled cigarettes (often called [[Joint (cannabis)|joints]]) or with pipes. Water pipes are also fairly common, and when used for cannabis are called bongs.

[[File:Fangspipe ubt.jpeg|thumb|200px|An elaborately decorated [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]]]]

A few other recreational drugs are smoked by smaller minorities. Most of these substances are [[controlled substance|controlled]], and some are considerably more intoxicating than either tobacco or cannabis. These include [[crack cocaine]], heroin, [[methamphetamine]] and [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. A small number of [[psychedelic drug]]s are also smoked, including [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], [[5-Meo-DMT]], and [[Salvia divinorum]].

Even the most primitive form of smoking requires tools of some sort to perform. This has resulted in a staggering variety of smoking tools and paraphernalia from all over the world. Whether tobacco, cannabis, opium or herbs, some form of receptacle is required along with a source of fire to light the mixture. The most common today is by far the cigarette, consisting of a mild inhalant strain of tobacco in a tightly rolled tube of paper, usually manufactured industrially and including a [[cigarette filter|filter]], or hand-rolled with loose tobacco. Other popular smoking tools are various [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipes]] and cigars.

A less common but increasingly popular alternative to smoking is vaporizers, which use hot air convection to deliver the substance without combustion, which may reduce health risks. A portable vaporization alternative appeared in 2003 with the introduction of [[electronic cigarette]]s, battery-operated, cigarette-shaped devices which produce an aerosol intended to mimic the smoke from burning tobacco, delivering nicotine to the user without some of the harmful substances released in tobacco smoke.

Other than actual smoking equipment, many other items are associated with smoking; [[cigarette case]]s, [[cigar box]]es, [[lighter]]s, [[match]]boxes, [[cigarette holder]]s, cigar holders, [[ashtray]]s, [[silent butler]]s, [[pipe cleaner]]s, tobacco cutters, match stands, pipe tampers, cigarette companions and so on. Some examples of these have become valuable [[collector item]]s and particularly ornate and antique items can fetch high prices.

Many governments are trying to deter people from smoking with anti-smoking campaigns in mass media stressing the harmful long-term effects of smoking. [[Passive smoking]], or secondhand smoking, which affects people in the immediate vicinity of smokers, is a major reason for the enforcement of [[smoking ban]]s. This is a law enforced to stop individuals smoking in indoor public places, such as bars, pubs and restaurants. The idea behind this is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient, and to stop harmful smoke being present in enclosed public spaces. A common concern among legislators is to discourage smoking among minors and many states have passed laws against selling tobacco products to underage customers (establishing a [[smoking age]]). Many developing countries have not adopted anti-smoking policies, leading some to call for anti-smoking campaigns and further education to explain the negative effects of ETS (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) in developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  [[Tobacco advertising]] is also sometimes regulated to make smoking less appealing.

In May 2016 the state of California passed legislation raising the smoking age from 18 to 21. This law also includes the sale of electronic cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/05/health/california-smoking-age-21/|title=California raises smoking age to 21|last=Berlinger|date=May 5, 2016|website=|publisher=CNN|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of addiction on society vary considerably between different substances that can be smoked and the indirect social problems that they cause, in great part because of the differences in legislation and the enforcement of narcotics legislation around the world. Though nicotine is a highly addictive drug, its effects on cognition are not as intense or noticeable as other drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines or any of the [[opiate]]s (including heroin and [[morphine]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

=== Physiology ===
[[File:Blood nicotine graph.jpg|thumb|350px|A graph that shows the efficiency of smoking as a way to absorb nicotine compared to other forms of intake]]

Inhaling the vaporized gas form of substances into the lungs is a quick and very effective way of delivering drugs into the bloodstream (as the gas diffuses directly into the pulmonary vein, then into the heart and from there to the brain) and affects the user within less than a second of the first inhalation. The lungs consist of several million tiny bulbs called [[alveoli]] that altogether have an area of over 70 m² (about the area of a tennis court). This can be used to administer useful medical as well as recreational drugs such as aerosols, consisting of tiny droplets of a medication, or as gas produced by burning plant material with a psychoactive substance or pure forms of the substance itself. Not all drugs can be smoked, for example the sulphate derivative that is most commonly inhaled through the nose, though purer free base forms of substances can, but often require considerable skill in administering the drug properly. The method is also somewhat inefficient since not all of the smoke will be inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Iverson, "Why do We Smoke?: The Physiology of Smoking" in ''Smoke'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; The inhaled substances trigger chemical reactions in nerve endings in the brain due to being similar to naturally occurring substances such as [[endorphin]]s and [[dopamine]], which are associated with sensations of pleasure.

Inhaling smoke into the lungs, no matter the substance, has adverse effects on one's health.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The incomplete combustion produced by burning plant material, like tobacco or cannabis, produces [[carbon monoxide]], which impairs the ability of blood to carry oxygen when inhaled into the lungs. There are several other toxic compounds in tobacco that constitute serious health hazards to long-term smokers from a whole range of causes; vascular abnormalities such as [[stenosis]], lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes, [[impotence]], low birth weight of infants born by [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking mother]]s. 8% of long-term smokers develop the characteristic set of facial changes known to doctors as [[smoker's face]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Model D|journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed)|year=1985|volume=291|issue=6511|pages=1760–1762| title=Smoker's face: an underrated clinical sign?|pmid=3936573|pmc=1419177|doi=10.1136/bmj.291.6511.1760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sigmund Freud]], whose doctor assisted with his suicide because of [[oral cancer]] caused by smoking&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book| last=Gay| first= Peter| year=1988| title=Freud: A Life for Our Time| location=New York|pages=650–651|isbn=978-0-393-32861-5|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company |authorlink=Peter Gay}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most tobacco smokers begin during adolescence or early adulthood. Smoking has elements of risk-taking and rebellion, which often appeal to young people. The presence of high-status models and peers may also encourage smoking. Because teenagers are influenced more by their peers than by adults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris | first=J.R. | year=1998 |title=The Nurture Assumption: Why children turn out the way they do | location=New York |publisher=Free Press |authorlink=Judith Rich Harris| title-link=The Nurture Assumption }}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts by parents, schools, and health professionals at preventing people from trying cigarettes are not always successful.

Smokers often report that cigarettes help relieve feelings of stress. However, the stress levels of adult smokers are slightly higher than those of nonsmokers. Adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking, and smoking cessation leads to reduced stress. Far from acting as an aid for mood control, nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Thus, the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parrott AC | title = Does cigarette smoking cause stress? | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 10 | pages = 817–820 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10540594 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.10.817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century psychologists such as [[Hans Eysenck]] developed a personality profile for the typical smoker of that period; [[extraversion]] was associated with smoking, and smokers tended to be sociable, impulsive, risk taking, and excitement-seeking individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, H. J. (1965). ''Smoking, health and personality''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Although personality and social factors may make people likely to smoke, the actual habit is a function of [[operant conditioning]]. During the early stages, smoking provides pleasurable sensations (because of its action on the [[dopamine]] system) and thus serves as a source of [[positive reinforcement]]. After an individual has smoked for many years, the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms and [[negative reinforcement]] become the key motivations. Like all addictive substances, the amount of exposure required to become dependent on nicotine can vary from person to person.

== Prevention ==

Education and counselling by physicians of children and adolescents has been found to be effective in decreasing the risk of tobacco use.&lt;ref name="pmid23974179"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Summaries for patients.

Smoking, primarily of tobacco, is an activity that is practiced by some 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion people, and up to 1/3 of the adult population.{{sfn|Gilman|Xun|2004|p=26}} The image of the smoker can vary considerably, but is very often associated, especially in fiction, with individuality and aloofness. Even so, smoking of both tobacco and cannabis can be a social activity which serves as a reinforcement of social structures and is part of the cultural rituals of many and diverse social and ethnic groups. Many smokers begin smoking in social settings and the offering and sharing of a cigarette is often an important rite of initiation or simply a good excuse to start a conversation with strangers in many settings; in bars, [[night club]]s, at work or on the street. Lighting a cigarette is often seen as an effective way of avoiding the appearance of idleness or mere loitering. For adolescents, it can function as a first step out of childhood or as an act of rebellion against the adult world. Also, smoking can be seen as a sort of camaraderie. It has been shown that even opening a packet of cigarettes, or offering a cigarette to other people, can increase the level of dopamine (the "happy feeling") in the brain, and it is doubtless that people who smoke form relationships with fellow smokers, in a way that only proliferates the habit, particularly in countries where smoking inside public places has been made illegal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Other than recreational drug use, it can be used to construct identity and a development of self-image by associating it with personal experiences connected with smoking. The rise of the modern anti-smoking movement in the late 19th century did more than create awareness of the hazards of smoking; it provoked reactions of smokers against what was, and often still is, perceived as an assault on personal freedom and has created an identity among smokers as rebels or outcasts, apart from non-smokers:

{{cquote|There is a new Marlboro land, not of lonesome cowboys, but of social-spirited urbanites, united against the perceived strictures of public health.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hilton, "Smoking and Sociability" in ''Smoke'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The importance of tobacco to soldiers was early on recognized as something that could not be ignored by commanders. By the 17th century allowances of tobacco were a standard part of the naval rations of many nations and by World War I cigarette manufacturers and governments collaborated in securing tobacco and cigarette allowances to soldiers in the field. It was asserted that regular use of tobacco while under duress would not only calm the soldiers but allow them to withstand greater hardship.&lt;ref&gt;Sollmann, Torald. (1906) ''A Text-book of Pharmacology and Some Allied Sciences.'' W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia and London. pp. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-20th century, the majority of the adult population in many Western nations were smokers and the claims of anti-smoking activists were met with much skepticism, if not outright contempt. Today the movement has considerably more weight and evidence of its claims, but a considerable proportion of the population remains steadfast smokers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hilton, "Smoking and Sociability" in ''Smoke'', pp. 126–133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==

Smoking has been accepted into culture, in various art forms, and has developed many distinct, and often conflicting or mutually exclusive, meanings depending on time, place and the practitioners of smoking. [[Pipe smoking]], until recently one of the most common forms of smoking, is today often associated with solemn contemplation, old age and is often considered quaint and archaic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Cigarette smoking, which did not begin to become widespread until the late 19th century, has more associations of [[modernity]] and the faster pace of the industrialized world. Cigars have been, and still are, associated with [[masculinity]], power and is an iconic image associated with the stereotypical capitalist. In fact, some evidence suggests that men with higher than average testosterone levels are more likely to smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CNN Health|title=Testosterone The good and the bad|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-12-03/health/testosterone.wmd_1_testosterone-nanograms-risky-behavior?_s=PM:HEALTH|newspaper=CNN|date=Dec 1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917184903/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-12-03/health/testosterone.wmd_1_testosterone-nanograms-risky-behavior?_s=PM:HEALTH|archivedate=2011-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking in public has for a long time been something reserved for men and when done by women has been associated with [[promiscuity]]. In Japan during the [[Edo period]], prostitutes and their clients would often approach one another under the guise of offering a smoke; the same was true for 19th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="Screech-Smoke"/&gt;

=== Art ===

[[File:Apothecary smoking pipe.jpg|thumb|upright|''An Apothecary Smoking in an Interior'' by [[Adriaen van Ostade]], oil on panel, 1646]]

The earliest depictions of smoking can be found on Classical Mayan pottery from around the 9th century. The art was primarily religious in nature and depicted deities or rulers smoking early forms of cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after smoking was introduced outside of the Americas it began appearing in painting in Europe and Asia. The painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] were among the first to paint portraits of people smoking and still lifes of pipes and tobacco. For southern European painters of the 17th century, a pipe was much too modern to include in the preferred motifs inspired by mythology from Greek and Roman antiquity. At first smoking was considered lowly and was associated with peasants.&lt;ref name=Lock&gt;''Ashes to Ashes'' pp. 78–81&lt;/ref&gt; Many early paintings were of scenes set in taverns or brothels. Later, as the [[Dutch Republic]] rose to considerable power and wealth, smoking became more common amongst the affluent and portraits of elegant gentlemen tastefully raising a pipe appeared. Smoking represented pleasure, transience and the briefness of earthly life as it, quite literally, went up in smoke. Smoking was also associated with representations of both the sense of smell and that of taste.

In the 18th century smoking became far more sparse in painting as the elegant practice of taking [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] became popular. Smoking a pipe was again relegated to portraits of lowly commoners and country folk and the refined sniffing of shredded tobacco followed by sneezing was rare in art. When smoking appeared it was often in the exotic portraits influenced by [[Orientalism]]. Many proponents of [[postcolonialism]] controversially believe this portrayal was a means of projecting an image of European superiority over its colonies and a perception of the male dominance of a feminized Orient. Proponents believe the theme of the exotic and alien "Other" escalated in the 19th century, fueled by the rise in the popularity of [[ethnology]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan Kalmar]], "The ''Houkah'' in the Harem: On Smoking and Orientalist Art" in ''Smoke'', pp. 218–229&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Gogh - Skull with a burning cigarette.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Skull with a Burning Cigarette '' by [[Vincent van Gogh]], oil on canvas, 1885]]

In the 19th century smoking was common as a symbol of simple pleasures; the pipe smoking "noble savage", solemn contemplation by Classical Roman ruins, scenes of an artists becoming one with nature while slowly toking a pipe. The newly empowered middle class also found a new dimension of smoking as a harmless pleasure enjoyed in smoking saloons and libraries. Smoking a cigarette or a cigar would also become associated with the [[bohemian]], someone who shunned the conservative middle class values and displayed his contempt for conservatism. But this was a pleasure that was to be confined to a male world; women smokers were associated with prostitution and smoking was not considered an activity fit for proper ladies.&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the start of the 20th century that smoking women would appear in paintings and photos, giving a chic and charming impression. [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] like [[Vincent van Gogh]], who was a pipe smoker himself, would also begin to associate smoking with gloom and ''fin-du-siècle'' fatalism.
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Holy Smokes by Brian Whelan.jpg|thumb|''Holy Smokes'' by [[Brian Whelan]]]] --&gt;
While the symbolism of the cigarette, pipe and cigar respectively were consolidated in the late 19th century, it was not until the 20th century that artists began to use it fully; a pipe would stand for thoughtfulness and calm; the cigarette symbolized modernity, strength and youth, but also nervous anxiety; the cigar was a sign of authority, wealth and power. The decades following World War II, during the apex of smoking when the practice had still not come under fire by the growing anti-smoking movement, a cigarette casually tucked between the lips represented the young rebel, epitomized in actors like [[Marlon Brando]] and [[James Dean]] or mainstays of advertising like the [[Marlboro Man]]. It was not until the 1970s when the negative aspects of smoking began to appear, yielding the image of the unhealthy lower-class individual, reeking of cigarette smoke and lack of motivation and drive, which was especially prominent in art inspired or commissioned by anti-smoking campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Benno Tempel, "Symbol and File: Smoking in Art since the Seventeenth Century" in ''Smoke'', pp. 206–217&lt;/ref&gt; In his painting "Holy Smokes", artist [[Brian Whelan]] pokes fun at the smoking debate and its newly found focus on morality and guilt.

=== Film ===

[[File:Paul Henreid and Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca trailer.jpg|thumb|upright|Film star and iconic smoker [[Humphrey Bogart]]]]

Ever since the era of [[silent film]]s, smoking has had a major part in film symbolism. In the hard-boiled ''[[film noir]]'' crime thrillers, cigarette smoke often frames characters and is frequently used to add an aura of mystique or [[nihilism]]. One of the forerunners of this symbolism can be seen in [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Weimar Republic|Weimar era]] ''Dr Mabuse, der Spieler'', 1922 (''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler|Dr Mabuse, the Gambler]]''), where men mesmerized by card playing smoke cigarettes while gambling.

Female smokers in film were also early on associated with a type of sensuous and seductive sexuality, most notably personified by German film star [[Marlene Dietrich]]. Similarly, actors like [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] have been closely identified with their smoker persona, and some of their most famous portraits and roles have involved them being haloed by a mist of cigarette smoke. Hepburn often enhanced the glamor with a cigarette holder, most notably in the film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''. Smoking could also be used as a means to subvert censorship, as two cigarettes burning unattended in an ashtray were often used to suggest sexual activity.

Since World War II, smoking has gradually become less frequent on screen as the obvious health hazards of smoking have become more widely known. With the anti-smoking movement gaining greater respect and influence, conscious attempts not to show smoking on screen are now undertaken in order to avoid encouraging smoking or giving it positive associations, particularly for family films. Smoking on screen is more common today among characters who are portrayed as anti-social or even criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Iserberg, "Cinematic Smoke: From Weimar to Hollywood" in ''Smoke'', pp. 248–255&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===

Just as in other types of fiction, smoking has had an important place in literature and smokers are often portrayed as characters with great individuality, or outright eccentrics, something typically personified in one of the most iconic smoking literary figures of all, [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Other than being a frequent part of short stories and novels, smoking has spawned endless eulogies, praising its qualities and affirming the author's identity as a devoted smoker. Especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century, a panoply of books with titles like ''Tobacco: Its History and associations'' (1876), ''Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy'' (1906) and ''Pipe and Pouch: The Smokers Own Book of Poetry'' (1905) were written in the UK and the US. The titles were written by men for other men and contained general tidbits and poetic musings about the love for tobacco and all things related to it, and frequently praised the refined bachelor's life. ''The Fragrant Weed: Some of the Good Things Which Have been Said or Sung about Tobacco'', published in 1907, contained, among many others, the following lines from the poem ''A Bachelor's Views'' by Tom Hall that were typical of the attitude of many of the books:

[[File:My Lady Nicotine.jpg|thumb|upright|The cover of ''My Lady Nicotine: A Study in Smoke'' (1896) by [[J.M. Barrie]], otherwise best known for his play ''[[Peter Pan]]'']]

{{cquote|So let us drink&lt;br /&gt;To her, – but think&lt;br /&gt;Of him who has to keep her;&lt;br /&gt;And ''sans'' a wife&lt;br /&gt;Let's spend our life&lt;br /&gt;In bachelordom, – it's cheaper.|||Eugene Umberger&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Umberger, "In Praise of Lady Nicotine: A Bygone Era of Prose, Poetry... and Presentation" in ''Smoke'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These works were all published in an era before the cigarette had become the dominant form of tobacco consumption and pipes, cigars, and chewing tobacco were still commonplace. Many of the books were published in novel packaging that would attract the learned smoking gentleman. ''Pipe and Pouch'' came in a leather bag resembling a tobacco pouch and ''Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy'' (1901) came bound in leather, packaged in an imitation cardboard cigar box. By the late 1920s, the publication of this type of literature largely abated and was only sporadically revived in the later 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Umberger, "In Praise of Lady Nicotine: A Bygone Era of Prose, Poetry... and Presentation" in ''Smoke'', pp. 236–247&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===

There have been few examples of tobacco in music in early modern times, though there are occasional signs of influence in pieces such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Enlightening Thoughts of a Tobacco-Smoker''.&lt;ref&gt;Willard A. Palmer [https://books.google.com/books?id=qbLfyNqAzuUC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Enlightening+Thoughts+of+a+Tobacco+Smoker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cqOvmMy7Jo&amp;sig=nqRGjQwAOmfcTmYGIanLoaarvrk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRmrHE_NbLAhUiDJoKHQs1D7U4ChDoAQgvMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Enlightening%20Thoughts%20of%20a%20Tobacco%20Smoker&amp;f=false Enlightening Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker], in ''J. S. Bach: An Introduction to His Keyboard Music'', p. 23. Accessed 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from the early 20th century and onwards smoking has been closely associated with popular music. [[Jazz]] was from early on closely intertwined with the smoking that was practiced in the venues where it was played, such as bars, dance halls, jazz clubs and even brothels. The rise of jazz coincided with the expansion of the modern tobacco industry, and in the United States also contributed to the spread of cannabis. The latter went under names like "tea", "muggles" and "reefer" in the jazz community and was so influential in the 1920s and 30s that it found its way into songs composed at the time such as [[Louis Armstrong]]'s ''Muggles'' [[Larry Adler]]'s ''Smoking Reefers'' and [[Don Redman]]'s ''Chant of The Weed''. The popularity of marijuana among jazz musicians remained high until the 1940s and 50s, when it was partially replaced by the use of heroin.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Cottrell, "Smoking and All That Jazz" in Smoke, pp. 154-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of modern popular music that has been closely associated with cannabis smoking is [[reggae]], a style of music that originated in [[Jamaica]] in the late 1950s and early 60s. Cannabis, or ''ganja'', is believed to have been introduced to Jamaica in the mid-19th century by Indian immigrant labor and was primarily associated with Indian workers until it was appropriated by the [[Rastafari movement]] in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;J. Edward Chamberlin &amp; Barry Chevannes, "Ganja in Jamaica" in Smoke, pp. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The Rastafari considered cannabis smoking to be a way to come closer to God, or [[Jah]], an association that was greatly popularized by reggae icons such as [[Bob Marley]] and [[Peter Tosh]] in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Edward Chamberlin &amp; Barry Chevannes, "Ganja in Jamaica" in Smoke, pp. 144-53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===

Estimates claim that smokers cost the U.S. economy $97.6 billion a year in lost productivity and that an additional $96.7 billion is spent on public and private health care combined.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Hilary. "The high costs of smoking". MSN money. Retrieved 10 September 2008 from https://web.archive.org/web/20081212025257/http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Insurance/InsureYourHealth/HighCostOfSmoking.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This is over 1% of the [[gross domestic product]]. A male smoker in the United States that smokes more than one pack a day can expect an average increase of $19,000 just in medical expenses over the course of his lifetime. A U.S. female smoker that also smokes more than a pack a day can expect an average of $25,800 additional healthcare costs over her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Treasury. "The Economic Costs of Smoking in the United States and the Benefits of Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6526">[[File:Sopona.jpg|thumb|This carved wooden statue of Sopona was one of approximately 50 created by a traditional healer as commemorative objects for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and other public health experts attending a 1969 conference on smallpox eradication. It is adorned with layers of meaningful objects such as [[monkey]] skulls, [[cowrie shell]]s, and [[nail (anatomy)|nail]]s.]]

'''Sopona''' (or '''Shapona''') is the god of [[smallpox]] in the [[Yoruba religion]].&lt;ref name="h"/&gt; Shapona was exported to the [[New World]] in the [[History of slavery#The Americas|slave trade]], where he has become known as [[Babalú-Ayé]], among many other names, in the [[Orisha]] religion.&lt;ref name="w"/&gt;

Within the traditional religion of the [[Yoruba people]] of [[Nigeria]] it is believed that smallpox was a disease foisted upon humans due to Shapona’s “divine displeasure”, and formal worship of the god of Smallpox was highly controlled by specific priests in charge of shrines to the god. Prior to the early 20th century people of this religion believed that if the priests were angered they were capable of causing smallpox outbreaks through their intimate relationship with Shapona.&lt;ref name=Hopkins_2002/&gt; The name "Sapona" (alt. Shapona, Saponna, etc.) is considered a secret and taboo name, not to be spoken aloud in respect for the power of the Lord of [[Infection|Infectious Disease]]. For this reason, the deity has a number of other names and titles which have been in use since the pre-modern period, such as Omolu.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie 1997:70&lt;/ref&gt;

Sapona is the traditional, sacred and protected name of the Orisha popularly known as [[Babalú-Ayé]] or Omolu. Speaking his true name is avoided so as to not invoke the power of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Idowu 1962:97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

Dr. [[Oguntola Sapara]] suspected that the priests were deliberately spreading the disease, and surreptitiously joined the cult. He discovered that the priests were causing the disease through applying scrapings of the skin rash of smallpox cases. Based on this information, the British colonial rulers banned the worship of Shapona in 1907.&lt;ref name=BMed1956/&gt; Worship continues, however, with the faithful paying homage to the god even after such activities were prohibited.&lt;ref name=Hopkins_2002/&gt;

==Dahomey religion==
In [[Dahomean religion]] Sopono is known as ''Sakpata'', ''Shakpana'' or similarly ''Sopono''. He is the divinity of smallpox and can inflicted insanity and disease on humans.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

==Candomblé==
Sopona is known in the [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] tradition of [[Candomblé]] as ''Sakpata'' or ''Sakpata-Omolu'' in the ([[Candomblé Jejé|Jejé]] nation). He is associated with the colors [[red]], [[black]], and [[white]], as in Africa. [[Insect]]s associated with him are Sakpata-Omolu [[beetle]]s, black [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[fly|flies]], and [[mosquito]]es. A skirt and hood made of straw that covers the entire body is the clothing associated with Sakpata-Omolu followers and worship. In the Jejé tradition Kpo and Loko are also associated with straw clothing. The xaxará, a [[broom]] with palm or straw bristles, is used in Sakpata-Omolu rituals. Small gourds, white cowry shells, a black necklace (laguidibá) are all clothing associated with Sakpata-Omolu. He is seen to have both the power to inflict and cure skin disease and other contagious diseases. In present times this includes [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

==Trinidad Orisha==

In the [[Trinidad Orisha]] tradition Sopona is known as ''Shakpana'', and is similarly a ferocious god associated with healing smallpox. In a survey of Orisha shrines on [[Trinidad]] James Houk found that flags to [[Ogun]] are found in almost every location; those to [[Shakpana]] and Osain ([[Osanyin]]) closely follow in popularity.&lt;ref name="ho"/&gt;

== Background ==
Sporadic protests have occurred in [[Thoothukudi district]] in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]] since 1999, directed against the Sterlite Copper smelting works. The factory is owned by [[Vedanta Limited]], a subsidiary of [[Vedanta Resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyo.in/variety/sterlite-protests-sulphur-dioxide-vedanta-tamil-nadu/story/1/23101.html|title=Why hundreds of Tamils won't quit protests against Vedanta's Sterlite|website=www.dailyo.in|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestors oppose soil, water and air contamination caused by the factory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/sterlite-s-pollution-problem-113041801267_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; An epidemiological study carried out by [[Tirunelveli Medical College]] in 2006–07 had found increased prevalence of respiratory diseases and ear, nose and throat (ENT) morbidity in the 5&amp;nbsp;km radius of Sterlite Industries. Their report blamed this on air pollution caused by the industry and automobiles – such as trucks and heavy vehicles – plying in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Elango  | first = S. | title = Health status and Epidemiological study around 5&amp;nbsp;km radius of Sterlite Industries (India) Limited, Thoothukudi | publisher = Tirunelveli Medical College | date = Oct 2008 | location = Tirunelveli | pages = 106 | language = English | url = https://poromboke.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/health-report-sterlite_edited.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water in the area of the plant has been found to be 17–20 times the allowable limit, causing additional health problems for the population already experiencing higher than average incidence of respiratory diseases.&lt;ref name=newsminute&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/sterlite-here-s-proof-how-copper-plant-impacts-health-thoothukudi-people-78772|title=Sterlite – here’s the proof: How the copper plant impacts health of Thoothukudi people|date=2018-04-01|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant is less than 15 Km from the [[Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve]]. More than 2.5 lakh (250,000) people live in the vicinity of the plant.

The Sterlite factorty made headlines in 2013 when a gas leak led to the death of one person and injured several others.&lt;ref name=financialexpress /&gt; The plant was blamed for health issues observed in the area related to gas leakage. Following a gas leak in March 2013, the then chief minister, the late [[Jayalalithaa|J Jayalalithaa]], ordered its closure. The company appealed to the [[National Green Tribunal Act|National Green Tribunal]], which overturned the government order. The state moved the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] against it, where the petition was still pending. The plant closed on March 27 of 2018, with the company citing a 15-day maintenance process.&lt;ref name=financialexpress /&gt; The Supreme Court ordered the company to pay a 100-crore fine and the factory was temporarily shutdown by the pollution regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sc-slaps-rs-100-cr-penalty-on-sterlite-for-pollution/article4572805.ece|title=SC slaps Rs. 100 cr. penalty on Sterlite for pollution|last=Venkatesan|first=J.|date=2013-04-02|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sterlite announced its plans to expand the plant, people around Kumarettiyapuram village protested for more than 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/120896-after-kumarettiyapuram-pandarampatti-village-people-joins-sterlite-protest-in-thoothukudi.html|title=குமரெட்டியாபுரத்தைத் தொடர்ந்து ஸ்டெர்லைட் ஆலைக்கு எதிராகத் திரண்ட மற்றொரு கிராமம்|date=2018-04-01|work=Vikatan|access-date=2018-05-22|language=ta}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major protest had been conducted peacefully till March 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/mar/29/ban-sterlite-thousands-of-protesters-hit-the-streets-demanding-closure-of-copper-plant-in-thoothu-1792667.html|title='Ban Sterlite': Thousands of protesters hit the streets demanding closure of copper plant in Thoothukudi|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacre==

On May 22, 2018, thousands of people began to march to the district collector's office to submit a petition. An official release said 20,000 people took out a procession towards the district collectorate and the copper plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://india.ucanews.com/news/tuticorin-police-massacre-leaves-11-dead-priest-in-hospital/37364/daily|title=Tuticorin police massacre leaves 11 dead, priest in hospital {{!}} UCAN India|website=india.ucanews.com|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police resorted to [[baton charge|lathi charges]] against the protesters, some of whom allegedly started throwing stones at the collectorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/6-km-stir-ended-bloodshed-671436.html|title=A 6-km stir that ended in bloodshed|date=2018-05-23|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/police-targeted-protesters-shot-head-victims-families-671547.html|title=Police targeted the protesters; shot at head|date=2018-05-24|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-uniformed police started to shoot at the unarmed protesters using assault rifles, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/anti-sterlite-protest-at-least-1-should-die-how-cops-handled-protests-that-killed-11-1856107 |title="At Least 1 Should Die": Cop On Video Of Sterlite Protests That Killed 10 |date=2018-05-23|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and police opened fire from over the top of Vehicles using SLR Rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-police-fired-from-assault-rifles-on-anti-sterlite-protesters-heard-saying-at-least-one-should-die-2110643.html|title=Tamil Nadu Police fired from assault rifles on anti-Sterlite protesters, heard saying at least one should die{{!}} Zee News India|website=zeenews.india.com|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen protesters were killed &lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/as-tuticorin-weeps-for-13-felled-in-police-firing-a-quite-rage-persists/articleshow/64334132.cms&lt;/ref&gt; including a 17-year old law student, and dozens were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/she-wanted-be-lawyer-her-dreams-lie-box-thoothukudi-teen-victim-s-kin-81854|title=She wanted to be a lawyer, her dreams lie in a box|date=2018-05-24|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fivedays /&gt;

===Controversy===

The '''Transgender HIV/Aids Prevention Program''' was launched by The Department of Family Practice and The Community Health Medical School at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1992. The program targeted the local transgender community. It was estimated that in 1992 up to 17,000 people were HIV-antibody positive in the state of Minnesota. The organizers realized that there was a lack of knowledge and attitudinal barriers towards HIV prevention among [[Transvestism|transvestites]] and [[transsexual]]s. This knowledge deficit among the transgender community coupled with the steadily increasing number of people affected with HIV/Aids at the time catalyzed the formation of the Transgender HIV Aids Prevention Program at the University of Minnesota.

==Program objectives==

The program was designed to be a potential suitable model for other communities to copy when targeting the transgender community and HIV/AIDS prevention. It aimed to demonstrate effective ways to reach the transgender population and change behaviours/attitudes that formed risk factors for HIV infection. The program had 3 main objectives; 1) Alter the way in which the transgender community behaved and understood the issue of HIV transmission and prevention; 2) Develop and implement an effective pilot program to realize the first objective; and 3) to evaluate the success or failure of the pilot program, specifically in terms of increasing the knowledge about HIV transmission/protection and changing the negative attitudes and behaviours putting the transgender community at risk.

==Implementation==

In June 1992, organizers of the program formed a core focus group, developing advertisements and short articles in order to promote participation of the workshops. The three workshops were held in September and November 1992 and February 1993 respectively. The workshops consisted of a panel of transgender people living with HIV/AIDS and the focus of the workshops was the impact of HIV/AIDS and what could be done in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Specifically, organizers had a focus on eroticizing safer sex and risk reduction strategies relating to the use of needles when injecting hormones and/or silicone. There were a total of 126 registrants of the program. Out of these 126 registrants, 86 participated in the workshops. 74 of these 86 participants participated in the study.

In May 1993, the examination and findings of these three workshops were concluded with the submission for publication of the “Transgender HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Manual.” This manual is currently located at the [[The Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria|Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria]]

==Findings==

The findings of the questionnaires done before, during, and two months after the workshop revealed that the workshops were successful, as there was an increase in relevant knowledge towards HIV/AIDS prevention among the Transgender population. There was an initial increase in positive attitudes among participants, however over time this diminished. The evaluation showed an improvement of community and social support for participants because of the program. The questionnaires failed to show that there was a decrease in unsafe sexual and needle practices.

The focus group evaluation unveiled the issues of understanding HIV/AIDS in the transgender community. The evaluation showed that there was an increase in awareness and personal significance which encouraged personal protection. It also brought to light that the risk for HIV/AIDS was behaviour based rather than based on an individual's sexual partner or orientation. It also exposed personal vulnerabilities which allowed people to develop personal prevention plans to change their risk behaviours.

Findings of the program brought new methods to better education prevention methods. The major method was to have stronger community involvement in the transgender community; specifically targeting “drag queens//female impersonators, transgender hustlers, prostitutes, and post-sex-reassigned transsexuals.” Another method was to integrate HIV/AIDS prevention into education regarding sex, gender and sexuality. Furthermore, another method that was suggested in order to minimize the rate of infection was to create brochures specifically for transgender HIV/AIDS prevention. Lastly, the program found it very important to make health professionals aware of the issue of HIV/AIDS within the transgender community and the specific emotional and social aspects that greatly target this minority population in the process.

==Conclusion==

Results from the program unveiled multiple issues, concerns, solutions and new found knowledge of transgender people living with HIV/AIDS. There were three main concerns regarding HIV/AIDS within the transgender community at this time. The first concern was HIV/AIDS equating to stigmatization and shame. As one of the registrants said, the stigma that existed during this time made the participant feel “dirty… [and like]...a lower minority than most minorities” (19). Another concern was that HIV/AIDS would interfere with individuals seeking sexreassignment surgery. The final concern was that health professionals lacked transgender sensitivity.

The first part of the workshop focused on the impact of HIV/AIDS, and included a panel of transgender persons living with HIV/AIDS. The second part focused on eroticizing safer sex and risk reduction in the use of injection paraphernalia. Sharing needs to inject hormones or silicone was addressed as a special risk. The final part of the workshop focused on personal and community empowerment.

Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Booker|543|220|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[United States v. Fanfan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Fanfan|volume=543|page=220|year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in uphelding the sentencing decision by the trial court, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]].

==Circumstances==
Dammeon Binion was arrested for [[Possession (law)|possession]] of a [[firearm]] by a [[convicted felon]].  Representing himself, the defendant  filed a ''[[pro se]]'' motion for a [[competency evaluation (law)|competence-to-stand-trial evaluation]] in which psychological tests were administered by a [[psychologist]] under the supervision of a [[psychiatrist]] who integrated the results and reported them to the court. Based on the test results and the discrepancy between these results and the defendant's observed behavior, the psychiatrist concluded that the defendant was most likely [[malingering|feigning mental illness]] and had no [[mental disorder]]. He further stated that the defendant's malingering was a "form of recreation rather than a design to accomplish secondary material gain".&lt;ref name="jaapl"&gt;{{cite journal
|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/126

|publisher=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law
|pages=126
|issue=1
|volume=34
|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online
|accessdate=2007-10-10
|year=2006
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendant pleaded guilty to the offense. However, because of his reported malingering, he was also charged with [[obstruction of justice]], which added two points to the sentencing recommendations. The court stated that because of the feigned illness, the defendant was not accepting responsibility for his behavior as is normally required in a plea of guilty, and the normal reduction in sentence for a [[Plea bargain|guilty plea]] was therefore waived. The defendant was sentenced according to the guidelines recommended by the pre-sentence investigation.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;

==Appeal==
The defendant appealed his sentence on three grounds. First he claimed that by increasing his sentence by adding the charge of obstruction of justice, related to his feigning mental illness, the trial court had violated ''[[United States v. Booker]]'' (2005). In this case, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] required the determination beyond a reasonable doubt of the validity of any fact that increased the sentence of a defendant in a federal criminal case over the highest level of the range as set forth by the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]]. Second, although acknowledging the feigned mental illness, the defendant stated he did so to amuse himself and without specific intent to obstruct justice, and that therefore the court erred in so charging him and enhancing his sentence accordingly.  Third, he argued that because the trial court did not view the defendant as accepting responsibility for his offense even though he pleaded guilty, the court had erred in failing to reduce the defendant's sentence as part of the guilty plea.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;

==Ruling==
The U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court on each of the three grounds raised.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;  ''[[United States v. Booker|Booker]]'' was followed in allowing judicial discretion in applying the sentencing guidelines. Thus, the enhancement for [[obstruction of justice]] for [[malingering|feigning mental illness]] on his competency evaluation, adding two points to the sentencing recommendations, was upheld, as was the ruling that because of the feigned illness, the defendant was not accepting responsibility for his behavior for the purposes of a guilty plea, and therefore no reduction in sentence was appropriate. The defendant's sentence, as determined by the trial judge's discretion, was upheld.&lt;ref name="jaapl"/&gt;

==Significance==
The case is significant because of the issues it raises if a legal decision is based on the testimony of mental health professionals, by means of [[forensic psychology]]. First, it points to a difficult issue in competency evaluations. Although the standards for competency were set forth in ''[[Dusky v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Dusky v. United States|volume=362|page=402|pin=|year=1960}}.&lt;/ref&gt; much of the standard remains ambiguous and is  not clearly defined. Only one common principle is clear in forensic evaluations, that forensic evaluators cannot reach a finding independent of the facts of the case at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Second, many practitioners feel strongly that forensic evaluators should restrict themselves to behavioral observations and describing test results only, and avoid making statements on legal questions as transpired in this case.&lt;ref name="shapirointer"&gt;{{cite book

Third, the issue of malingering is particularly problematic as there is no ultimate test, and such diagnoses boil down to clinical decisions. An extensive review of the literature by Melton ''et al.'' did not reveal any studies in which clinicians using various combinations of testing procedures and interviews demonstrated any "extraordinary ability" to detect malingering.&lt;ref name="garymelton"&gt;{{cite book

Dr '''William Farquharson''' [[FRSE]] [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|PRCSE]] FRCPE FSAS (1760-1823) was a senior Scottish surgeon during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].
He served as President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] 1806-8 and President of the Harveian Society in both 1796 and 1805.

==Life==

He was born in [[Balfour, Aberdeenshire]] in 1760 the son of Alexander Farquharson of Balfour (b.1716) and his wife Margaret Davie of Newmill.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepeerage.com/p40410.htm#i404093&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]], James Russell and Robert Kerr. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795 he was a Crown Witness at the trial and imprisonment of [[Kinloch baronets|Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch of Gilmerton]] for the murder of his half-brother Sir Robert Kinloch at Gilmerton House. The trial was judged by [[Robert McQueen, Lord Braxfield|Lord Braxfield]]. Farquharson’s testimony focussed upon Kinloch’s mental state on two previous occasions, each tended by Dr Farquharson (the second being in [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] jail). As one of the oddest of British judgements, although Kinloch was sentenced to life imprisonment on 15 July, Dr Farquharson offered to hold him securely in his own home rather than in prison, and the judge accepted this on 17 July.&lt;ref&gt;The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795&lt;/ref&gt; His house at this time was at Worlds End Close on the Royal Mile.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1795&lt;/ref&gt; However, Farquharson disappears from the Post Office Directories for several years; presumably to hold Kinloch in a less urban environment. This was a very considerable personal sacrifice. He rematerialises in Edinburgh following the death of Kinloch in 1800. He then lives at 16 St James Square.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1804&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807 he is noted as donating 5 guineas towards the new Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Scots Magazine and Edinburgh Literary Miscellany, vol70, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

His final Edinburgh address was 2 Elder Street in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|First New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1822-23&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Edinburgh on 25 January 1823.

==Family==

He was married twice and had two sons: Joseph Canvin Farquharson (who became a banker) and Francis Farquharson of Finzean (1802-1876)
